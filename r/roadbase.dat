40|$|Quality {{ratio of}} lime to fly-ash Abstract. In order to {{determine}} the mix proportion with better anti-cracking performance of lime and fly-ash stabilized coal gangue <b>roadbase</b> materials, anti-cracking performance of lime and fly-ash stabilized coal gangue influenced by quality ratio of lime to fly-ash was studied based on the same aggregate gradation and the same aggregate ratio. And then crack of test road with different mix proportion was observed. Results show that both temperature shrinkage anti-cracking coefficient and drying shrinkage anti-cracking coefficient vary along parabola rule with the decrease of the quality ratio of lime to fly-ash. The mixture have the best anti-cracking performance when the quality ratio of lime to fly-ash is 5 : 15, which was test and verify in the transverse crack observations of test road. Lime and fly-ash stabilized coal gangue <b>roadbase</b> materials have a good anti-cracking performance and suitable for base in the pavement structure. The reasonable ratio of lime and fly-ash stabilized coal gangue <b>roadbase</b> materials in the engineering should be 5 : 15 : 80...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} and restraints which influence transverse crack propagation through the bituminous surfacings of semi-flexible pavements. These pavements incorporate continuously laid cement bound roadbases which, during curing, crack into slabs of varying length, ranging from 4 - 25 m. Reciprocal crack growth {{can occur in}} the surfacing, known as 'reflection cracks', located through stresses concentrated at the discontinuities within the <b>roadbase.</b> Three mechanisms have been identified and are described as contributing to reflection crack propagation. They have been analysed independently {{although the majority of}} conclusions drawn are applicable to their combined action. Their relative importance will vary with respect to pavement geometry, material properties, environmental conditions and traffic intensity. The first mechanism, 'tensile fatigue', induces crack propagation vertically upward through the surfacing. Tensile strains are developed during daily and ru 1 nual fluctuations of temperature, which cause expansion and contraction of the cement bound <b>roadbase.</b> This mechanism is most prominent on pavements with thin surfacings and long slab lengths. The rate of crack growth is dependent on the range of temperature within the <b>roadbase,</b> slab length, thermal characteristics of the <b>roadbase</b> material and resistance of the surfacing to this form of fatigue. A model has been developed based on a combination of results from an extensive testing programme, the use of fracture mechanics theory and computer simulation of the condition. The results quantify the resistance shown by conventional bituminous mixes to reflection cracking in terms of their mix parameters. Also considered are the use of stress relieving membranes, reinforcement material and modified binders to inhibit crack growth. The second mechanism, 'tensile yield' is also thermally induced but associated with cold weather conditions. Temperature gradients through the pavement structure induce warping and contraction within the uppermost layers. Tensile strains developed at the surface can, under U. K. winter temperatures, exceed the ultimate yield strain of the wearing course material. Preliminary. investigations of four pavements constructed in the early 1970 's to motorway specifications indicate that reflection cracking will initiate at the surface if the yield strain, as defined through tensile creep tests, is reduced through binder oxidization to a value of 0. 5 %. This mechanism will operate on pavements with greater structural layer thicknesses and is only partially dependent on slab length. The influence of a further mechanism, 'shear fatigue' induced through trafficking of the pavement, {{has been shown to be}} confined to the acceleration of crack growth in the final stages of propagation unless a breakdown of interlock occurs between adjoining <b>roadbase</b> slabs.

40|$|In several {{countries}} recycled aggregate, taken from old concrete road surfaces, {{has been used}} in the road construction sector for a long time for making new concrete surfaces. Generally the aggregate is only used for the subconcrete, whilst the upper layer of concrete is almost exclusively made using conventional aggregates. The use is generally restricted to the concrete chipping over 4 mm or 2 mm. The resulting crushed concrete fine aggregate -which makes up approximately 30 to 40 % of the total aggregate - is primarily used in frost blankets and hydraulically bound <b>roadbases.</b> However, in order to also enable a more valuable usage, for instance in subconcrete or also in the upper layer of concrete of road surfaces, comprehensive laboratory investigations had to be carried out on types of concrete with different proportions of crushed concrete fine aggregate. Starting materials from 3 motorway building sites were used in the test programme. The effect of the crushed concrete fine aggregate on the fesh concrete properties was tested (air content, workability) as well as the hard concrete properties (strength, durability, expansion, contraction). The following conclusions can be made from the results of the laboratory investigations. (orig.)

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: (i) to analyze agerelated declines in swimming, cycling, and running {{performances}} for road-based and off-road triathlons, and (ii) to compare age-related changes in these three disciplines between road-based and off-road triathlons. Swimming, cycling, running and total time performances {{of the top five}} males between 20 and 70 years of age (in 5 -year intervals) were analyzed for short distance road-based (1. 5 km swim, 40 km cycle, and 10 km run) and off-road (1. 5 km swim, 30 km mountain bike, and 11 km trail run) triathlons at the 2009 World Championships. Independently of age, there was a lesser age-related decline in cycling performance (P. 01) compared to running and swimming for <b>roadbased</b> triathlon. In contrast, age-related decline did not differ between the three locomotion modes for off-road triathlon. With advancing age, the performance decline was less pronounced (P. 01) for road-based than for off-road triathlon in swimming (C 65 years), cycling (C 50 years), running (C 60 years), and total event (C 55 years) times, respectively. These results suggest that the rate of the decline in performance for off-road triathlon is greater than for road-based triathlon, indicating that the type of discipline (road vs. mountain bike cycling and road vs. trail running) exerts an important influence on the magnitude of the age-associated changes in triathlon performance.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{details of}} a laboratory study of the behaviour of cemented <b>roadbases</b> under load, the work relating {{to the use of}} relatively lean concrete mixes having sufficient workability to allow placing by slip-form paver. Large-scale comprehensively instrumented static loading tests were undertaken on 3 m diameter discs, continuously supported by a simulated subgrade of rubber, in order to investigate the material behaviour under conditions approaching those in a pavement structure. Test variables included mix type, slab thickness and subgrade support for which, in each instance, two cases were considered. Laboratory tests on associated control specimens provided material properties for use in subsequent analyses, and considerable emphasis was placed on determining the tensile stress-strain response under flexural and under uniaxial tension loading. The control tests were later extended to give the characterising properties at ages other than 7 days so that, in particular, the longer term performance under trafficking could be estimated. Test slab performance was evaluated primarily by an elastic multilayer analysis and it was found that good initial agreement was obtained between observed and predicted performance in terms of strain. The load at which a well-defined fracture of the test slabs occurred was very much higher than the value predicted from theoretical considerations and this is difficult to explain satisfactorily. It would seem, however, that the primary cracks induced were relatively stable under the test conditions imposed since pronounced discontinuity in both the load-strain measurements and the load-deflection measurements was identified at much lower loads, indicating the initiation of a failure mechanism. Comparison of tensile strains at discontinuity in the large-scale tests with those at discontinuity in the laboratory flexure tests showed good agreement. These strains are therefore thought to define an upper limit for predicting satisfactory long-term behaviour under trafficking whereby higher induced tensile strains would lead to reduced life-expectancy. A method for estimating these strains based on the use of tensile strength and electrodynamic elastic modulus is proposed. In conclusion, the investigation highlights the difficulty of obtaining meaningful data relating to the structural design of pavements incorporating a new material, and recommendations are made for further work in this area...|$|R
40|$|On the {{concrete}} surfacing monitoring {{section of the}} federal motorway A 5 from Darmstadt to Heidelberg, {{set up by the}} Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) in 1968, short slabs (5 m) were built for the first time without surfacing reinforcement and without running joints. In 8 test sections, each 3 kilometres long, the type of <b>roadbase</b> (bituminous <b>roadbase,</b> concrete <b>roadbase</b> with and without bituminous intermediate layer) and the thickness of {{the concrete}} surfacing (22 and 25 cm) varied. The monitoring section has been subjected to very heavy traffic for almost 30 years - roughly since 1989 in accordance with the building class SV. In cooperation with the BASt, the long-term behaviour of the different construction methods was to be investigated. Larger areas with a very poor condition were not found. The condition of an additional section subjected to the investigation, which was built using the usual construction methods - with 7. 5 metres-long, reinforced, 22 -cm-thick slabs was the worst (larger distortion tensions, greater joint movements). The 25 -cm-thick concrete surfacing was well suited for carrying the traffic load up to now. The 22 -cm-thick concrete surfacing of the traffic lane already had to be undersealed during {{the first few years of}} use. The test results confirm the necessity of the increased requirements placed on the erosion-resistance of roadbases under concrete surfacing in recent years in technical regulations. Not only the bituminous <b>roadbase</b> but also the concrete surfacing (equivalent to an HGT with #beta#_D> 15 N/mm" 2) did not display any damage, and in general it is still attached to the concrete surfacing. The bituminous intermediate layer which was used is not suitable. The investigations show that the condition of the individual sections depends not only on the composition, but also the camber, the point in time and the carrying out of the reapir work, the consistency of the joint, the efficiency of the dowelled joints and anchoring, and also the quality of the construction work and the concrete.

40|$|Lean {{concrete}} has, {{on account}} of its high stiffness, excellent load-spreading properties when used as a <b>roadbase</b> material in flexible pavements, although on the same account, appreciable stresses arise when movements are restrained by the subgrade or sub-base. Consequently, owing to the low tensile strength of the material, temperature falls result {{in the formation of}} cracks which, if sufficiently wide, may be transmitted through the superimposed bituminous surfacing. Developments in the design of flexible pavements and in the specification and use of lean concrete roadbases are reviewed, followed by a consideration of the causes of cracking. Expressions for the spacing and width of cracks resulting from restrained thermal contraction of a cementitious <b>roadbase</b> are derived in terms of the temperature fall, material properties and a constant frictional coefficient, in order to identify the critical parameters involved in each case. Thermal movement measurements were carried out on a number of cement stabilised materials in various moisture conditions and an apparatus which would cause cracking of lean concrete by restrained thermal movement was designed and built. A programme of tests was devised principally to determine the susceptibility of the material to cracking as a function of age, the results indicating that cracking in lean concrete roadbases is likely to occur within one day of placing. Additional tests were carried out to investigate the effects of inadequate compaction, the use of mixes of higher water content and cement content and the incorporation of steel fibres. It was found that mixes of increased tensile strength were more resistant to cracking, especially at early ages, but that they ultimately give rise to wider cracks which {{would be more likely to}} reflect through the bituminous surfacing. Experimental results and published values of subgrade restraint were combined to give a more accurate estimate of crack spacing and crack width in a lean concrete <b>roadbase</b> at a given age and for a given temperature fall. Temperatures in a newly constructed <b>roadbase</b> were measured and the results used for the prediction of cracking patterns which were found to be- in broad agreement with those detected.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 855 on 06. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) A {{large proportion of}} the U. K. highway network constructed in the 1960 's and 1970 's contains lean concrete <b>roadbase</b> with bituminous surfacing. Pavements containing relatively high strength lean concrete have rarely required structural maintenance (thick overlay or reconstruction) but have required maintenance because of reflection cracking where the surfacing cracks above cracks in the lean concrete. The time of appearance of this cracking is very variable (2 - 20 years). Field observations indicate that <b>roadbase</b> transverse crack spacings are often greater than 5 m. Reflection cracking at these long spacings can be caused by thermal stresses. This project identifies conditions under which thermal reflection cracking will occur and develops a predictive model that allows estimation of the combined effect of thermal and traffic stresses. Finite element analyses indicate that initial crack development is likely to be caused by thermal stresses and final cracking will be assisted by traffic stresses. A temperature model has been developed to determine <b>roadbase</b> daily temperature range and surfacing temperature on a mean monthly basis. Thermal reflection cracking is considered to result from daily cycle fatigue rather than an extreme low temperature mechanism. A test rig has been developed to apply cyclic crack opening movements and simulative tests have been accelerated to 0. 1 Hz by using a "bitumen stiffness", fatigue criterion. Finite element results, displacements recorded during tests and tensile creep tests to determine mix stiffness, enable dc/dN and K 1 values and material constants (A, n) to be determined. This fracture mechanics interpretation of test results serves as the basis of the predictive model for thermal reflection cracking that is consistent with observations from an untrafficked road. The combined estimate of thermal and traffic stresses cannot however explain reflection cracking at < 5 m spacings. This cracking apparently initiates at the surface and is probably influenced by other mechanisms. University of Birmingham, the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), U.

The results of the characterization of the leaching properties of primary and secondary raw materials generally show a good reproducibility of the chemical composition {{as well as of the}} leaching parameters. The studies have also shown that it is technically feasible to replace primary raw materials partially by secondary materials. In most cases, the technical requirements of the products were met. From the results of the standard leaching tests of granular materials and products it was found that the availibility test can be used as a first screening method for the determination of the leaching behaviour of raw materials and products. The leaching of elements from raw materials and products (primary and secondary) depends strongly on the pH value present in the leaching system. Comparison of the results of the standard leaching test (small scale laboratory test) and the same test carried out in lysimeters (pilot-scale) shows the standard leaching test on laboratory scale to be a reliable test procedure in order to estimate the leaching behaviour in at least the first 100 years. The leaching database, which was developed as part of this project, has demonstrated its usefulness in evaluating and interpreting the results of this study. In addition, it will be a useful tool in the future for mutual comparison of materials as well as for certification of materials...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to explore a concept based on {{performance}} optimization of road pavement structures with various fractions of subgrade layer and asphalt pavement thickness. The project has a total of 14 test sections located in K 1 and K 2 in the northbound direction on road E 4 between Skånes Fagerhult and Markaryd. These were observed with measurements 2004 to 2010. The follow-up was effected by cross profile measurements and falling weight measurements. The follow-up was carried out on 8 test sections á 100 m and 6 test sections á 40 m. The asphalt pavement in the right (slow) lane consists of 40 mm wearing course, 45 mm bitumen base course and 95 mm bitumen <b>roadbase</b> with 80 mm gravel <b>roadbase</b> beneath. The asphalt pavement in the left (fast) lane has the same wearing and bitumen base course but not any bitumen <b>roadbase.</b> The subbase vary between the sections from 60 cm crushed rock 0 - 300 mm to 42 cm crushed rock 0 - 150 mm or crushed rock 0 - 90 mm. All the test sections are situated on embankment of varied height. The road was opened for traffic in 2004, but was then trafficked on the bitumen base course. The wearing course was constructed late in summer 2005 after about one year of traffic.

For the present study two test sections were chosen with different bituminous mixes which were to be evaluated concerning damages caused by traffic. One of the constructions is made of the so called FAS-concept, while the other construction is a reference section with conventional <b>roadbase</b> mix (AG 22). Wearing course, binder layer and <b>roadbase</b> of the section with FAS-concept is produced by NCC {{according to their own}} concept called VIACO, which is based on the idea of using stone mastic asphalt (SMA) principle for all bituminous bound layers. The evaluation is based on laboratory studies of bore cores, an analysis of falling weight measurements, temperature measurements from field stations and theoretical calculations. The main purpose of this project is to evaluate alternative bituminous constructions and to present an evaluation method with relevant criteria concerning the service life related to fatigue cracking. The FAS-concept, which implies that material of good quality is chosen and that the stresses on the construction are diminished, has shown considerable longer fatigue life than the construction with conventional mixes.

40|$|Currently, the {{popularity}} of conventional cementitious stabilisation had been challenged by an innovative soil improvement technique, known as foamed bitumen stabilisation. Many Australian highway and road agencies have dedicated significant investigation and funds to investigate this technique {{in order to achieve}} a more flexible and fatigue resistant stabilised material suitable {{for a wide range of}} pavement conditions. This study aimed to report the preliminary study of the foamed bitumen properties and the mix procedures conducted at Curtin University which simulated the construction of the trial foamed bitumen stabilised project in Western Australia. Our findings show that 2. 5 % of cold water spraying into 180 °C virgin Class 170 bitumen can produce foamed bitumen with a 15 to 20 times expansion rate and 20 s half-time suitable for foaming aggregates. Both resilient modulus and permanent deformation tests failed to predict an optimum foamed bitumen content when the aggregate was mixed with 1 % hydrated lime, compacted at 100 % optimum moisture content and plastic sealed curing for 7 days at room temperature. However, the ratio of crushed granite <b>roadbase</b> to limestone was found to be significant and a mixture consisting of 75 % crushed rock base and 25 % crushed limestone was determined as the optimum aggregate proportion, as it showed the best performance in unconfined compressive strength tests and obtained relatively higher values in indirect tensile strength tests.

40|$|Tuen Mun Road (TMR), some 15 km in length, is a {{major urban}} highway linking Kowloon Peninsula and Tuen Mun New Town. TMR was {{constructed}} along the terrain slope, with many cut and fill sections, in the mid- 1970 s. More than 100 million commercial vehicles or 254 million standards axles were recorded between the years, 1978 and 2001. This cumulative traffic load is well above the original design capacity. Moisture induced damages are observed and sections of TMR were resurfaced from one to five {{times over the years}} and currently it still provides a reasonable level of service. This research intends to find out the residual properties of this road, in particular the effects of re-surfacing on the resistance of moisture attack, which is a common cause of pavement defects in Hong Kong. Core samples of the pavement were obtained from both driving directions of TMR at a 500 -m interval. Specimens cut from these samples were subjected to a series of testings to find out the air void, grading, binder content, and indirect tensile stiffness modulus (ITSM). Stiffness modulus ratio (MR R), which is defined as the ratio of ITSM of moisture-treated specimen to untreated specimen, is employed as an indicator of the structural resistance to moisture attack. The results show that the MR R increases as the number of resurfacing increases, indicating resurfacing on the in-service pavement is effective in protecting the structural integrity of the pavement.

The Western Corridor {{is referred to as the}} areas surrounding Ipswich and the Lockyer and Fassifern Valleys including the growth suburbs of Springfield, Ripley, Ebenezer and Amberley. (SEQRP 2005 - 2026, 2005). Purga Quarry is the only quarry operated by Boral that services the Western Corridor of South East Queensland. The quarry supplies <b>roadbase</b> and aggregates to road and infrastructure projects currently under construction is this region. Boral’s SEQ Quarry Division acknowledged that the current production output needed to be increased to meet the current and future demands, so it therefore enlisted the quarry as part of its first wave of the ‘Operational Excellence’ project. Along with this project, a more efficient asset management method was needed for the current equipment at the quarry. In this project, research was carried out on the way that the current assets such as the plant and load and haul equipment on the site are managed. From this research, various recommendations were introduced including prestart checklists to be filled out every morning for both plants as well as the load and haul equipment, fortnightly scheduled maintenance days for both plants to be undertaken on Saturdays so that the downtime is minimised, introducing scheduled maintenance plans and plans to replace parts on the assets as well as inputting these asset management plans into an asset management program as the program will automatically show when an item has been changed. Some of these recommendations have been implemented and there also has been an addition in tonnes being produced as well as a decrease in unscheduled equipment downtime. All of the other recommendations have been planned to be implemented over the next few months.

40|$|Alternative {{materials}} {{represent an}} important {{potential source of}} aggregates for road construction. At present, their use remains limited owing to the abundance and low cost of high quality natural aggregates, low costs of landfill disposal and generally restrictive specifications for pavement materials. Nevertheless, their influence {{in relation to the}} primary aggregates is likely to increase in the future with the enforcement of more strict environmental regulations at national and European levels. The objective of this research project was to investigate a wide range of alternative materials and provide a practical framework for their assessment enabling pavement engineers to deal with most applications in road construction. Initially secondary materials were assessed according to the present UK specifications and were found to fail the requirements in most cases. However, the current approach does not assess fundamental properties such as stiffness, resistance to permanent deformation, tensile strength, resistance to fatigue and the development of these with time, leading to an inadequate assessment of these materials. To advance towards the development of performance-based specifications repeated load triaxial and indirect tensile tests were used. For their performance the Nottingham 150 x 300 mm triaxial apparatus was used and an indirect tensile apparatus developed which evolved from the Nottingham Asphalt Tester used for bituminous materials. In triaxial testing, models used to study the resilient behaviour of granular materials were found to give good results for unbound but not for lightly-treated secondary materials. For these, a new resilient model was developed. Testing and specimen preparation techniques together with performance classification systems were developed for both tests and recommendations for an overall methodology for the evaluation of secondary materials are presented. An application of this methodology was made to the study of thirteen mixtures to be considered for full-scale trials. The application of secondary materials in pavements was evaluated using analytical methods of pavement design which demonstrated the potential of these at levels in the pavement as high as the <b>roadbase</b> and the overall thickness reduction that may result...|$|E
