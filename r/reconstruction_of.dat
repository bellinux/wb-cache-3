5|$|<b>Reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the MD 3 {{divided highway}} and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex {{operation}} that involved many temporary openings, lane shifts, {{construction of new}} roadways, and <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> existing roadways over several phases over several years. The first improvement was the <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the I-695 interchange between 1987 and 1991. The modern ramps from I-97 to westbound I-695 and from eastbound I-695 to I-97 were built, eastbound I-695's ramp over these two ramps was constructed, and the loop ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695 was removed. I-97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new Beltway ramps was reconstructed to Interstate Highway standards and expanded to six lanes between May 1993 and August 1995. Part of the functionality of the loop ramp to westbound I-695 was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to westbound I-695 was added to allow access from I-97 to MD 648.|$|E
