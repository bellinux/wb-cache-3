5|$|The ditches are {{populated}} with aquatic and bankside plant species. These include the nationally restricted rootless duckweed (Wolffia arrhiza). Other uncommon {{species such as}} frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae) and water fern (Azolla filiculoides) can also be found. The nationally restricted brackish water-crowfoot (<b>Ranunculus</b> baudotii) and sea clubrush (Scirpus maritimus) indicate the slightly brackish nature of the water.|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{surrounded}} with fringing reedbeds, carr woodland and grassland, which are managed by Bristol Water. The water conditions are eutrophic with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), lesser pondweed (Potamogeton pusillus), opposite-leaved pondweed (Groenlandia densa) and water-crowfoot (<b>Ranunculus</b> spp.). On neutral soils around the reservoir, pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), burnet-saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga) and devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) occur, and on calcareous soils fairy flax (Linum catharticum), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor subspecies minor) are found.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse reflector, {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The {{brilliant}} yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in <b>Ranunculus</b> acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S.myrsinifolia) is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the bay willow (S.pentandra), the grey willow (S.cinnerea), the grey alder (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I.saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (<b>Ranunculus</b> repens), the common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I.acuta and I.laceravar.helobia.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as <b>Ranunculus</b> and Potentilla.|$|E
5|$|The green rosella is {{predominantly}} herbivorous, with {{the seeds of}} grasses and trees—especially eucalypts—forming the bulk of its diet; other items eaten include the seed of the soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica), cranberry heath (Astroloma humifusum), myrtle beech (Lophozonia cunninghamii), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and buttercups (<b>Ranunculus),</b> berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers and new buds of southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), shining tea-tree (Leptospermum nitidum), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), Tasmanian bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus), Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida), messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua), snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora), manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), small-fruit hakea (Hakea microcarpa) and native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida). The green rosella has at times partaken of the berries of the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), as well as Coprosma and Cyathodes, and even leaf buds of the common osier (Salix viminalis). It may eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids of the genus Schedotrioza, which they extract from leaf galls on the black peppermint (Eucalyptus amygdalina).|$|E
25|$|The pools {{provide a}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of {{emergent}} plants, of which the rarest is bog St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes), previously believed to have died out in Cheshire. The locally rare floating club rush (Eleogiton fluitans) has been recorded at the site. Other wetland species observed here include bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), greater spearwort (<b>Ranunculus</b> lingua), lesser celandine (<b>Ranunculus</b> ficaria), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), marsh violet (Viola palustris), reedmace (Typha), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and wavy bittercress (Cardamine flexuosa).|$|E
25|$|About 1,300 {{species of}} {{vascular}} plants {{grow in the}} park, of which 37 are endemic to the Tatras, 41 are endemic to the Western Carpathians and 57 are endemic to the Carpathians. Notable plants endemic to the Tatras include Tatra scurvy-grass (Cochlearia tatrae), yellow mountain saxifrage (Saxifraga aizoides), Erysimum wahlenbergii of the wallflower genus, Cochlearia tatrae, Erigeron hungaricus of the Erigeron genus, and others. Ice age relicts include <b>Ranunculus</b> alpestris of the <b>Ranunculus</b> genus, glacier crowfoot, Dianthus glacialis of the Dianthus genus, Gentiana frigida of the gentian genus, Primula minim of the Primula genus, yellow mountain saxifrage, dwarf willow, net-leaved willow (Salix reticulata), and others.|$|E
25|$|As a {{botanist}} and cartographer Dumont d'Urville {{left his}} mark on New Zealand. He gave {{his name to}} the genus of seaweeds Durvillaea, which includes the giant bull-kelp; the seaweed Grateloupia urvilleana; the species of grass tree Dracophyllum urvilleanum; the shrub Hebe urvilleana and the buttercup <b>Ranunculus</b> urvilleanus.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} {{crawling}} plants can also sprout adventitious roots, {{but are not}} considered stoloniferous: a stolon is sprouted from an existing stem and can produce a full individual. Examples of plants that extend through stolons include some species from the genera Argentina (silverweed), Cynodon, Fragaria, and Pilosella (Hawkweeds), Zoysia japonica, <b>Ranunculus</b> repens.|$|E
25|$|Aggregate fruits {{form from}} single flowers that have {{multiple}} carpels {{which are not}} joined together, i.e. each pistil contains one carpel. Each pistil forms a fruitlet, and collectively the fruitlets are called an etaerio. Four types of aggregate fruits include etaerios of achenes, follicles, drupelets, and berries. Ranunculaceae species, including Clematis and <b>Ranunculus</b> have an etaerio of achenes, Calotropis has an etaerio of follicles, and Rubus species like raspberry, have an etaerio of drupelets. Annona have an etaerio of berries.|$|E
25|$|Biddle Street {{has been}} {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest where management practices and the variation in the soils {{has resulted in the}} watercourses supporting a wide range of aquatic plant communities. Where open water occurs plants such as common water-starwort (Callitriche stagnalis), European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsusranae), fan-leaved water-crowfoot (<b>Ranunculus</b> circinatus). The calcareous influence of the underlying Compton soils also encourages whorled water-milfoil (Myriophyllum verticillatum) and stonewort (Chara sp). Also present are the nationally scarce rootless duckweed (Wolffia arrhiza) and hairlike pondweed (Potamogeton trichoides).|$|E
25|$|Natural {{vegetation}} {{is preserved}} {{in many parts}} of the district because of the unsuitability of steep land for cultivation. The district is at a natural geographic and climatic boundary. It is the southern limit for mangroves (Avicennia resinifera) on this side of the North Island of New Zealand, the southern limit for the coastal tree taraire (Beilschmiedia taraire), and the mountains are the furthest north for many New Zealand alpine plants (<b>Ranunculus</b> insignis, Ourisia caespitosa etc.). A remnant sea-level stand of an alpine southern beech (Nothofagus solandri) exists at the head of Ohiwa Harbour, a drowned Ice Ages valley system.|$|E
25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{this is one}} of the commonest pondweeds, {{occurring}} in almost any wet or semi-wet oligotrophic and / or acidic habitat so long as flow is not too rapid. It may be found in lakes, slow-flowing rivers, ponds, ditches, seeps and among bog mosses (Sphagnum). As its name suggests, it is common in areas of blanket bog but may also occur in secondary habitats such as unshaded drainage ditches in bogs and forest plantations. In British rivers it typically grows with other soft-water species such as <b>Ranunculus</b> flammula, Carex nigra, C. rostrata, Scapania undulata and Equisetum fluviatile. In lakes it tends to occur in base-poor, oligotrophic waters with species such as Littorella uniflora, Sphagnum spp., Lobelia dortmanna and Isoetes lacustris especially with a peaty substrate.|$|E
25|$|On Nunivak, most {{indigenous}} {{plants were}} traditionally gathered {{by women and}} children when the men were harvesting other available resources (e.g., caribou, waterfowl, seal). While fresh spring greens provided a welcome addition to the diet, which in winter was based largely on dried and stored foods, other greens were harvested throughout the year as they ripened, and used {{with some of those}} stored for winter use. With the melting of the island's snow pack, local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and were added to the local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to spring seal camps. Cup'ig men would journey out along the ice to harvest arriving sea mammals (i.e., seals, walrus) while the women would spend much of their time harvesting available plant resources (greens and seaweeds) and shellfish. Early spring plants included: marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), sour dock (Rumex arcticus), wild celery (Angelica lucida), wild lettuce (Draba borealis or D. hyperborea), wild parsnip (Ligusticum hultonii), wild rhubarb (Polygonum viviparum), mountain sorrel (Oxyria digylla), Pallas buttercup (<b>Ranunculus</b> pallasii), and Labrador tea (Ledum pallustre decumbens).|$|E
500|$|Early explorers, such as Alexander von Humboldt in 1807, {{observed}} {{a number of}} notable species in the mountains around Mont Blanc at altitudes above [...] This was well above the permanent snow line, but on rocks that were so steep that little snow could rest. These arctic-alpine species included: Cardamine bellidifolia; Draba hirta; [...] and Silene acaulis (occurring down to [...] ). Between , Humboldt noted the following species of flowering plants amongst rocky debris around permanent snow fields and the highest alpine glaciers: Achillea atrata; Gentiana nivalis; Juncus trifidus; <b>Ranunculus</b> glacialis; [...] and Saxifraga oppositifolia.|$|E
500|$|There {{are four}} sites on Tuscarora Creek {{and its tributaries}} on the [...] "exceptional significance" [...] list in the Juniata County Natural Heritage Inventory. The Doyle Run Floodplain {{is located on the}} creek in Beale Township. It {{contains}} a silver maple floodplain forest and is home to <b>Ranunculus</b> flabellaris and many species that are rare in Pennsylvania. Barton Hollow, a tributary of Tuscarora Creek in Lack Township, is home to plant species such as Carex careyana and Pinus echinata and animal species such as the Emperor Butterfly and a mussel species known as the Triangle Floater. Tuscarora Creek supports Carex shortiana downstream of Blair Hollow in Lack Township, as well as 350 plant species and 50 animal species. The creek's valley downstream of Pennybaker Island in Lack Township is home to Samolus parviflorus and Quercus shumardii.|$|E
500|$|Frequent {{fire and}} grazing characterises Plagioclimax {{communities}} of the grassland flora. Grasslands are dominated by Arundinella villosa and Chrysopogon zeylanicus. Waterlogged swamps or slow moving streams are found in low-lying areas, and macrophytes such as Aponogeton jacobsenii, sedge species Isolopis fluitans and Utricularia spp. are found near the slow moving streams. The bamboo Chimonobambusa densifolia [...] thrive {{along the banks of}} the streams, and near the swampy areas grass species such as Juncus prismatocarpus, Garnotia mutica, Eriocaulon spp. and Exacum trinervium are common. Tussock grasses such as Chrysopogon zeylanicus and Cymbopogon confertiflorus are found in the wet hollows. Herbaceous flora of the grasslands include temperate species including <b>Ranunculus,</b> Pedicularis, Senecio, Gentiana and Alchemilla and also tropical species such as Eriocaulon and Ipsea speciosa (a rare endemic daffodil orchid).

The rose is of this family, but her cup is filled with the luxuriance of her leaves; the crocus, campanula, <b>ranunculus,</b> anemone, and almost all the loveliest children of the field, are formed upon the same type.|$|E
60|$|The <b>ranunculus</b> glacialis might perhaps, by cultivation, be blanched {{from its}} wan and corpse-like paleness to purer white, and won to more {{branched}} and lofty development of its ragged leaves. But {{the ideal of}} the plant is to be found only in the last, loose stones of the moraine, alone there; wet with the cold, unkindly drip of the glacier water, and trembling as the loose and steep dust to which it clings yields ever and anon, and shudders and crumbles away from about its root.|$|E
60|$|There is no true alpine flora on {{the higher}} summits, but {{several of the}} {{temperate}} forms extend to a great elevation. Thus Mr. Pickering records Vaccinium, <b>Ranunculus,</b> Silene, Gnaphalium and Geranium, as occurring above ten {324} thousand feet elevation; while Viola, Drosera, Acæna, Lobelia, Edwardsia, Dodonæa, Lycopodium, and many Compositæ, range above six thousand feet. Vaccinium and Silene are very interesting, as they are almost peculiar to the North Temperate zone; while many plants allied to Antarctic species {{are found in the}} bogs of the high plateaux.|$|E
60|$|On the 19th of February we marched up the Soane to Tura, passing some low {{hills of}} limestone, between the cliffs of the Kymore and the river. On the shaded riverbanks grew {{abundance}} of English genera-- Cynoglossum, Veronica, Potentilla, <b>Ranunculus</b> sceleratus, Rumex, several herbaceous Compositae and Labiatae; Tamarix formed a small bush in rocky hillocks {{in the bed}} of the river, and in pools were several aquatic plants, Zannichellia, Chara, a pretty little Vallisneria, and Potamogeton. The Brahminee goose was common here, and we usually saw in the morning immense flocks of wild geese overhead, migrating northward.|$|E
60|$|Two {{seeds of}} mustard (Sinapis nigra), two of celery (Apium graveolens)--both of the {{previous}} year, two seeds well soaked of caraway (Carum carui), and two of wheat, did not excite the leaves more than inorganic objects often do. Five seeds, hardly ripe, of a buttercup (<b>Ranunculus),</b> and two fresh seeds of Anemone nemorosa, induced {{only a little more}} effect. On the other hand, four seeds, perhaps not quite ripe, of Carex sylvatica caused the leaves on which they were placed to be very strongly inflected; and these only began to re-expand on the third day, one remaining inflected for seven days.|$|E
