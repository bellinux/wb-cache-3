The {{reason is that}} special prolongation and <b>restriction</b> <b>operators</b> are {{required in order to}} avoid the creation of divergence when refining or coarsening. Due to the lack of information about the magnetic flux on cell faces, the problem of finding such divergence-preserving prolongation operators becomes underdetermined. However, storing the face-allocated (staggered) magnetic fluxes and applying the appropriate prolongation and <b>restriction</b> <b>operators</b> requires a large change in the code infrastructure on which we will report in an accompanying work.|$|R

In this paper we use methods from microlocal analysis {{and the theory}} of Fourier integral operators to study continuation of the seismic wavefield in this single scattering approximation.

40|$|Thanks to {{dimensional}} (or topological) model reduction techniques, small inclusions in {{a three-dimensional}} (3 D) continuum {{can be described}} as one-dimensional (1 D) concentrated sources, {{in order to reduce the}} computational cost of simulations. However, concentrated sources lead to singular solutions that still require computationally expensive graded meshes to guarantee accurate approximation. The main computational barrier consists in the ill-posedness of <b>restriction</b> <b>operators</b> (such as the trace operator) applied on manifolds with co-dimension larger than one. We overcome the computational challenges of approximating PDEs on manifolds with high dimensionality gap by means of nonlocal <b>restriction</b> <b>operators</b> that combine standard traces with mean values of the solution on low dimensional manifolds. This new approach has the fundamental advantage of enabling the approximation of the problem using Galerkin projections on Hilbert spaces, which could not be otherwise applied because of regularity issues. This approach, previously applied to second order PDEs, is extended here to the mixed formulation of flow problems with applications to microcirculation. In this way we calculate, in the bulk and on the 1 D manifold simultaneously, the approximation of velocity and pressure fields that guarantees good accuracy with respect to mass conservation...|$|R

3000|$|Finite-net multi-CCS {{includes}} the operator α.s of strong prefixing (in contrast to normal prefixing μ [...].t), {{which states that}} the visible action α is the initial part of an atomic sequence that continues with the sequential process s. So, by strong prefixing, a transition can be labeled with a sequence of visible actions. This operator, introduced in [16, 17] with a slightly different semantics, is also {{at the base of}} multi-party synchronization, obtained as an atomic sequence of binary CCS-like synchronizations. In finite-net multi-CCS, parallel composition may occur inside the body of a recursively defined constant C; on the contrary, the <b>restriction</b> <b>operator</b> (ν a) is not allowed in the body of C. So, a finite-net process may be represented as (ν L)t, where L is a set of actions (if L is empty, the <b>restriction</b> <b>operator</b> is not present) and t a restriction-free process.|$|E

40|$|Timelimited {{functions}} and bandlimited functions play {{a fundamental role in}} signal and image processing. But by the uncertainty principles, a signal cannot be simultaneously time and bandlimited. A natural assumption is thus that a signal is almost time and almost bandlimited. The {{aim of this}} paper is to prove that the set of almost time and almost bandlimited signals is not excluded from the uncertainty principles. The transforms under consideration are integral operators with bounded kernels for which there is a Parseval Theorem. Then we define the wavelet multipliers for this class of operators, and study their boundedness and Schatten class properties. We show that the wavelet multiplier is unitary equivalent to a scalar multiple of the phase space <b>restriction</b> <b>operator.</b> Moreover we prove that a signal which is almost time and almost bandlimited can be approximated by its projection on the span of the first eigenfunctions of the phase space <b>restriction</b> <b>operator,</b> corresponding to the largest eigenvalues which are close to one...|$|E
