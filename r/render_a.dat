5|$|On 3 January 1523, the Zurich {{city council}} invited the clergy {{of the city}} and {{outlying}} region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would <b>render</b> <b>a</b> decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Zurich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move is activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can <b>render</b> <b>a</b> finishing move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous, {{meaning that}} they have stubby {{rudimentary}} wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with population structure, possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony-founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When a colony is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies, taken over by one of her daughters. This method of colony founding may <b>render</b> <b>a</b> nest immortal.|$|E

25|$|Although DirectShow {{is capable}} of {{dynamically}} building a graph to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> given media type, in certain instances {{it is difficult for}} developers to rely on this functionality and they need to resort to manually building filter graphs if the resulting filter graph is variable. It is possible for filter graphs to change over time as new filters are installed on the computer.|$|E
25|$|The Lowe {{process is}} a three-stage {{modified}} water gas process in which 'blue' water gas is modified by addition of pyrolized oils to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> yellow flame usable for domestic lighting as well as heating. Blue water gas is a term used for water gas produced from clean burning fuels such as anthracite, coke and charcoal and produces a blue flame.|$|E
25|$|When a {{misrepresentation}} {{has been}} made and an agreement was (or at any rate appeared to be) concluded, the misrepresentee {{does not have to}} bring a halt to the deal. Misrepresentations generally do not <b>render</b> <b>a</b> contract void, as does the contractual doctrine of common mistake or frustration; it makes a contract voidable at the option of the misrepresentee. Not all contracts entered into on the strength of misrepresentations will be bad for the misrepresentee, who may choose not to void the contract.|$|E

25|$|The Chou–Fasman method {{takes into}} account only the {{probability}} that each individual amino acid will appear in a helix, strand, or turn. Unlike the more complex GOR method, it {{does not reflect the}} conditional probabilities of an amino acid to form a particular secondary structure given that its neighbors already possess that structure. This lack of cooperativity increases its computational efficiency but decreases its accuracy, since the propensities of individual amino acids are often not strong enough to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> definitive prediction.|$|E
25|$|Public {{interest}} groups frequently intervene in cases to make arguments {{on how to}} interpret the Charter. Some examples are the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the Canadian Labour Congress, the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), and REAL Women of Canada. The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> decision favourable to the legal interests of the group.|$|E
25|$|As {{railroad}} passenger ridership {{declined in}} the late 1950s, some railroads retired dome cars due to the maintenance costs. Other railroads that had not purchased dome cars new bought them second hand. Illinois Central purchased several cars from Missouri Pacific and Canadian National bought several cars from Milwaukee Road, for example. Because of their enormous usage of sealed glass, the cooling of the cars required massive air conditioning capacity. Maintenance and repair of these cars was costly. Breakdown of the air conditioning system on the road, even in winter, could <b>render</b> <b>a</b> car unusable.|$|E

25|$|Bass {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} using a montage of fast cuts and tight framing to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> violent, bloody murder as an impressionistic and nearly bloodless one. Hitchcock felt uncertain about Bass’s conception of the scene fearing that audiences might not accept such a stylized and quickly cut sequence. In an interview with film historian Pat Kirkham, Bass recalled, “Having designed and storyboarded the shower sequence, I showed it to Hitch. He was uneasy about it. It was very un-Hitchcockian in character. He never used that kind of quick cutting; he loved the long shot”.|$|E
25|$|The {{due process}} clause “does not {{contemplate}} {{that a state}} may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties or relations.” Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another state, even if the forum state has {{a strong interest in}} applying its law to the controversy, and even if the forum state is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause may sometimes act to divest the state of its power to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> valid judgment.|$|E
25|$|To <b>render</b> <b>a</b> full-color {{image as}} a GIF, the {{original}} image must {{be broken down into}} smaller regions having no more than 255 or 256 different colors. Each of these regions is then stored as a separate image block with its own local palette and when the image blocks are displayed together (either by tiling or by layering partially transparent image blocks) the complete, full-color image appears. For example, breaking an image into tiles of 16 by 16 pixels (256 pixels in total) ensures that no tile has more than the local palette limit of 256 colors, although larger tiles may be used and similar colors merged resulting in some loss of color information.|$|E
