40|$|Minimization {{of torque}} ripples in BLDC motors due to phase commutation- a review Abstract. The {{smoothness}} of {{variable speed drive}} operation is critical and a viable measure used {{in the design and}} development of motion control applications. The torque produced in a brushless DC (BLDC) motor with trapezoidal back electromotive force (BEMF) is constant under ideal conditions. However, in practice, torque ripple appears on the delivered output torque. Some of these ripples result from the natural structure of the motor, while some are related to the motor design parameters. Nevertheless, these torques could be minimized throughout the machine design process. Another source of ripples is associated with the control and drive side of the motor. This paper focuses on the torque <b>ripples</b> associated with <b>machine</b> control and drives that could be minimized by applying different control techniques. Various applied techniques for minimizing the torque ripples in BLDC are presented based on the motor control side. There are a variety of configurations to be adjusted based on the applied technique; in addition, hardware modifications or additional stages are also required.

The machine under consideration {{has been designed to}} run in the generation {{as well as in the}} motoring mode for utilization in vast industrial and automotive applications. When used as a motor for automotive applications, the machine is directly coupled to a radial inward flow compressor to operate as an electric driven supercharger running in the range of 40, 000 – 50, 00 rpm. To run the machine as a motor at its rated speed and power, a suitable electric drive and controller has to be utilized while considering the machine performance characteristics. Most of the available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems are either designed for low-speed high-power machines or high-speed, low-power machines. In addition, the self inductance of such machines are relatively high (in the range of hundreds of millihenry) compared to the AFPM machine under consideration which has a very low self inductance (in the range of tens of microhenry).

40|$|One of {{the most}} common goals in {{manufacturing}} is to improve the quality and accuracy of the parts being fabricated without reducing productivity. Aiming at this goal, many different manufacturing processes have been developed. Among them, machining {{plays a major role in}} increasing product accuracy. As an important machining process, grinding is a vital step that can produce both fine finish and dimensional accuracy for applications in which the workpiece material is either hard or brittle. Currently, the ball screw is the most frequently used setup for grinding machine tool feed drive. However, the existence of transmission components induces wear, high friction, backlash, and also lower system stiffness; therefore, applications of conventional feed drives for high speed and high accuracy machining are very limited. As a promising technology, a linear motor feed drive discards the transmission system; therefore, it eliminates transmission induced error, such as backlash and pitch error, and avoids stiffness reduction as well. As a result, a linear motor drive can achieve both high speed and high accuracy performance. A linear motor feed drive will be subject to external disturbances such as friction, force <b>ripple</b> and <b>machining</b> force. Due to the lack of a transmission unit, the tracking behavior of a linear motor feed drive is prone to be affected by external disturbances and model parameter variations. Thus, in order to deliver high performance, a controller should be capable of achieving high accuracy in the presence of external disturbance and parameter uncertainty. This dissertation proposes a general robust motion control framework for the CNC design of a linear motor feed drive to achieve high speed/high precision as well as low speed/high precision. An application to the linear motor feed drives in grinding machines was carried out. One of the developed algorithms is the HSMC, which combines the merits of a reaching law based sliding mode control and a modified disturbance observer for precision tracking to address the practical issues of friction, force ripple, and grinding force disturbances. Another algorithm presented is ASMC, which combines the reaching law based sliding mode control with adaptive disturbance estimation to achieve an adaptive robust motion control. Ph. D.

However an operational characteristic is the occurrence of torque ripple at low speeds. For demanding direct drive applications like machine tools, robot arms or aerospace applications {{it is necessary to}} reduce the level of torque ripple. This thesis presents an in depth investigation into the production and nature of torque <b>ripple</b> in brushless <b>machines.</b> Different torque <b>ripple</b> reduction strategies are evaluated and one reduction strategy using Park's transform as a tool is identified as the promising strategy. The unified machine theory is checked to clarify the theory behind Park's transform; in particular assumptions made and general validity of the theory. This torque ripple reduction strategy based on Park's transform is extended to include the effect of armature reaction. A novel adaptive torque ripple reduction algorithm is designed. The ineffectiveness of the conventional approach is demonstrated. Further a novel torque ripple reduction strategy using direct measurements of the torque ripple is suggested, reducing implementation time and allowing higher accuracies for torque ripple reduction. Extensive measurements from the experimental system show the validity of the novel torque ripple reduction strategies. The experimental results allow derivation of a formula for all load situations. This formula makes it possible to further increase the reduction accuracy and enables improved real time implementation of the torque ripple reduction algorithm. The work presented here makes a substantial contribution towards understanding the nature of torque ripple in brushless motors and solving the associated problems. The novel reduction strategies form the basis for the development of intelligent dynamometers for motor test beds. Further the torque ripple reduction method presented here can be used to overcome manufacturing imperfections in brushless machines thus removing the cost for precise manufacturing tools. Future designs of controllers can "build" their own correction formula during set-up runs, providing a motor specific torque ripple correction. Automotive Motion Technology Lt...|$|R
40|$|The {{permanent}} magnet synchronous machines with fractional slot and concentrated winding configuration have been steadily gaining traction in various applications in recent times. This is mainly driven by several advantages offered by this configuration such as high-torque density, outstanding efficiency, and easy and low-cost fabrication. The {{main focus of}} this thesis {{is dedicated to the}} investigation of three main topologies of fractional-slot and concentratedwinding {{permanent magnet}} synchronous machines specifically suited for particular applications. Additionally, the cogging torque and torque ripple reduction technique based on a novel axial pole pairing scheme in two different radial-flux permanent magnet synchronous machines with fractional-slot and concentratedwinding configuration are investigated. First, an axial flux permanent magnet segmented-armature-torus machine with laminated stator is proposed for in-wheel direct drive application. Both simplified analytical method and three-dimensional finite element analysis model accounting for anisotropic property of lamination are developed to analyze the machine performance. The predicted and experimental results are in good agreement and indicate that the proposed machine could deliver exciting and excellent performance. The impact of magnet segmentation on magnet eddy current losses in the prototype is carried out by the proposed three-dimensional finite element analysis model. The results show that the eddy current losses in the magnet could be effectively reduced by either circumferentially or radially segmenting the magnets. Furthermore, a magnet shaping scheme is employed and investigated to reduce the cogging torque and torque ripple of the prototype. This is validated using the three-dimensional finite element analysis model as well. Second, a coreless axial flux permanent magnet machine with circular magnets and coils is proposed as a generator for man-portable power platform. Approximate analytical and three-dimensional finite element analysis models are developed to analyze and optimize the electromagnetic performance of the machine. Comprehensive mechanical stress analysis has been carried out by threedimensional structural finite element analysis, which would ensure the rotor integrity at expected high rotational speed. The results from both three-dimensional finite element analysis and experiments have validated that the proposed prototype is a compact and efficient high speed generator with very simple and robust structure. Additionally, this structure offers simplified assembly and manufacturing processes utilizing off-the-shelf magnets. Third, a novel radial flux outer rotor permanent magnet flux switching machine is proposed for urban electric vehicle propulsion. Initial design based on the analytical sizing equations would lead to severe saturation and excessive magnet volumes in the machine and subsequently poor efficiency. An improved design is accomplished by optimizing the geometric parameters, which can significantly improve the machine efficiency and effectively reduce the overall magnet volumes. Magnet segmentations can be employed to further improve the machine performance. Finally, a novel axial pole pairing technique is proposed to reduce the cogging torque and torque ripple in radial flux fractional-slot and concentrated-winding permanent magnet synchronous machines. The implementation of the technique in outer rotor surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine shows that the cogging torque and torque ripple can be reduced very effectively with different magnet pairs. However, careful pair selection is of particular importance for compromise between cogging torque and torque ripple minimizations during the machine design stage. This technique is also employed to minimize the cogging torque in a permanent magnet flux switching integrated-stator-generator and it is compared with rotor step skewed technique. The estimated and experimental results show that the axial pole pairing technique can not mitigate the torque <b>ripple</b> of the <b>machine</b> as effectively as rotor step skewed approach although both the techniques could reduce the cogging torque to the same level...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the efficiency {{and the cost of}} electrical machines has been observed. The efficiency of electric motors is important because electric motors consume about 40 %- 45 % of the produced electricity worldwide and about 70 % of the industrial electricity 1. Therefore, some types of electric motors have been classified in proposed standard classes 1 based on their efficiency. By consequence, efficient and low cost electric motors are necessary on the market. Several types of electric motors are used in industrial applications such as permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), induction motors (IMs) and reluctance motors (RMs). Due to the high cost of PMSMs and due to the rotor losses of the IMs, the RMs can be considered as promising and attractive candidates. Moreover, they have a robust and simple structure, and a low cost as there are no cage, windings and magnets in the rotor. There are two main types of RMs: switched reluctance motors (SRMs) and synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs). However, there are some disadvantages of these types of machines. On the one hand, the SRMs have problems of torque ripple, vibrations and noise. In addition, their control is more complicated than that of three-phase conventional motor drives, a. o. because of the high non-linearity of the inductance. On the other hand, the SynRMs have a low power factor, so that an inverter with a high Volt-Ampère rating is required to produce a given motor output power. Therefore, adding a proper amount of low cost permanent magnet (PM) material - such as ferrite - may be a good option to boost the power factor. The PMs also increase the efficiency and torque density. These types of motors are [...] 1 Waide, P. and C. Brunner (2011),”Energy-Efficiency Policy Opportunities for Electric Motor Driven Systems”, IEA Energy Papers, No. 2011 / 07, OECD Publishing, Paris. xiv Summary called permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motors (PMaSynRMs). In this thesis, both SynRMs and PMaSynRMs are investigated. The main focus is given to the rotor design, magnetic material grade and winding configuration. In addition, the modelling and control of SynRMs and PMaSynRMs is also investigated. First, parametrized models are made of the machines. The finite element method (FEM) is used to obtain the dq-axis flux-linkages λd(id, iq, θr) and λq(id, iq, θr) of the SynRM in static 2 D simulations, as a function of d-axis current id, and q-axis current iq and rotor position θr. As known, the performance (output torque, power factor and efficiency) of SynRMs depends mainly on the ratio between the direct (d) and quadrature (q) axis inductances (Ld/Lq). This ratio is well-known as the saliency ratio of the SynRM. As magnetic saturation causes significant changes in the inductances and by consequence in the saliency ratio during operation, a SynRM model based on constant inductances (Ld and Lq) is not good enough. It can lead to large deviations in the prediction of the torque capability compared with the real motor. How large these deviations are, is clarified in this thesis by comparing several models that do or do not take into account saturation, cross-saturation and rotor position effects. It is found that saturation and cross saturation must be included in the model for an accurate representation of the SynRM performance and control. This means the flux linkages should be function of id and iq. The rotor position needn’t be included. Apart from the currents, the FEM contains many parameters for the flux barrier geometry, which have a strong influence on the torque and torque <b>ripple</b> of the <b>machine.</b> Next to static simulations, also dynamic simulations are done. In these simulations, the flux-linkages are stored in lookup tables, created a priori by FEM, to speed up the simulations. Based on the SynRM FEM model, the design of the SynRM rotor is investigated. Choosing the flux-barrier geometry parameters is very complex because there are many parameters that play a role. Therefore, an optimization technique is always necessary to select the flux-barrier parameters that optimize the SynRM performance indicators (maximize the saliency ratio and output torque and minimize the torque ripple). To gain insight in the relevant parameters, first a sensitivity analysis is done: the influence of the flux-barrier parameters is studied on the SynRM performance indicators. These indicators are again saliency ratio, output torque and torque ripple. In addition, easy-to-usexv parametrized equations are proposed to select the value of the two most crucial parameters of the rotor i. e. the flux-barrier angle and width. The proposed equations are compared with three existing literature equations. At the end, an optimal rotor design is obtained based on an optimized technique coupled with FEM. The optimal rotor is checked mechanically for the robustness against mechanical stresses and deformations. Apart from the geometry, the electric steel grade {{plays a major role in}} the losses and efficiency of an electric machine. Therefore, several steel grades are compared with respect to the SynRM performance i. e. output torque, power factor, torque ripple, iron losses and efficiency. Four different steel grades NO 20, M 330 P- 50 A, M 400 - 50 A and M 600 - 100 A are considered. The steel grades differ in thickness and in the losses they produce. It was found that the “best” grade NO 20 had in the rated operating point of the considered SynRM 9. 0 % point more efficiency than the “worst” grade M 600 - 100 A. Next to energy-efficiency, a large interest in recent research is dedicated to obtain a high torque density. One of the main techniques to improve the machine torque density is to increase the fundamental winding factor through an innovative winding layout. Among several configurations, the so-called combined star-delta winding layout was proposed in literature several years ago. In the PhD, the combined stardelta winding is compared with the conventional star winding in terms of output torque, torque ripple and efficiency. A simple method to calculate the equivalent winding factor of the different winding connections is proposed. In addition, the modelling of a SynRM with combined star-delta winding is given. Furthermore, the effect of different winding layouts on the performance of the SynRM is presented. To compare both windings experimentally, two stators are made, one with combined star-delta windings and one with conventional star windings, having the same copper volume. Measurements revealed a 5. 2 % higher output torque of the first machine at rated current and speed. In order to even further improve the power factor and the output torque of the SynRM, ferrite PMs are inserted in the center of the rotor flux-barriers. The rotor geometry of the resulting PMaSynRM is the same as the conventional SynRM. Hence, two rotors with identical iron lamination stack were built: one with PMs and a second one without magnets. Having the two stators and two rotors, a comparison of fourxvi Summary prototype SynRMs is done in the PhD, each of 5. 5 kW. Several validation measurements have been obtained. The combined-star delta SynRM with PMs in the rotor had up to 1. 5 % point more efficiency than the SynRM with star winding and rotor without magnets at the rated current and speed. As an application of SynRM, an efficient and low cost photovoltaic (PV) pumping system employing a SynRM is studied. The proposed system does not have a DC-DC converter that is often used to maximize the PV output power, nor has it storage (battery). Instead, the system is controlled in such a way that both the PV output power is maximized and the SynRM works at the maximum torque per Ampère, using a conventional three phase pulse width modulated inverter. The design and the modelling of all the system components are given. The performance of the proposed PV pumping system is presented, showing the effectiveness of the system...|$|R
