40|$|In 1980, it was {{proposed}} that extension programmes include projects {{designed specifically to}} increase productivity in particular <b>extension</b> <b>areas.</b> By identifying factors which limit the production in a cane growing community or {{a section of the}} community, extension programmes can be formulated in order to overcome these limitations. Such projects have since had considerable impact, not only in the <b>extension</b> <b>areas</b> in which they originated but, in many cases, throughout the industry. Extension programmes aimed at improving productivity offer a valuable opportunity for extension performance to be evaluated. In this paper various examples of such projects are presented and extension strategies in general are reviewed...|$|R

5000|$|Most monotowns {{were built}} {{essentially}} as <b>residential</b> <b>extensions</b> of particular enterprises (so called [...] "city-forming enterprises"), their population being either {{engaged in the}} city-forming enterprise's manufacturing process, or providing various services to the former group. The core workforce in monotowns was largely formed by the centralized workforce distribution system (people being assigned to an enterprise for {{a certain amount of}} years after completing the education - which essentially replaced tuition payment, or transferred from other enterprises) rather than by spontaneous migration processes, as it was the case in less specialized towns. Combined, these factors led to narrow and inflexible economies and an immobile workforce, {{by the standards of the}} market economy newly introduced into the country in late 1980s - early 1990s.|$|R

50|$|During Muhammad Ali's rule, Minya gained {{importance}} {{due to its}} fertile {{lands and}} its large agricultural production. The importance of the City increased {{during the reign of}} Ismail who owned large cotton and sugar cane plantations around Minya. Ismail constructed a royal residence in Minya and beginning with 1870 he started modernizing the city and constructed its first <b>residential</b> <b>extensions.</b> In the year 1873, the Ibrahimiya Canal was built to provide perennial irrigation to Ismail's vast lands. The canal led to a noticeable development in the urban growth especially in the western areas of the city. Improvement of the transportation network, particularly the introduction of the building of bridges across the Ibrahimiya, permitted developments of housing to grow haphazardly on private agricultural lands of the west suburban banks of the canal.|$|R

The second tunnel came much later. The first families arrived in 1951 {{to live in an}} estate that was without roads, pavements, shops, pubs or buses. However, in the wake of World War II during the late 1940s and early 1950s, massive <b>residential</b> <b>extensions</b> at Croxteth, alongside similar and indistinguishable development of neighbouring Norris Green, resulted in what together, are now regarded as the largest municipal housing estate in Europe.|$|R
