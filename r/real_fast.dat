500|$|While OutKast's {{previous}} albums {{were considered}} to be laid-back, mellow efforts, Stankonia contains faster, more high-energy tempos, partially to reflect the [...] "chaotic times" [...] {{at the turn of the}} 21st century. [...] The group took note of new, harder drugs hitting the hip-hop scene and teenagers using ecstasy, cocaine, and methamphetamine. [...] Big Boi reflected, [...] "Niggas living this life at a fast speed don't know what's going on around them. [...] If you live fast, you gonna come out of here <b>real</b> <b>fast,</b> so the music need to show that." [...] While recording Stankonia, the band refrained from listening to hip-hop, [...] "That music was starting to sound real comfortable. There wasn't any adventure to it." [...] Instead, the duo drew influence from musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Prince. However, the band refrained from producing a throwback sound with the record and instead hoped to utilize these influences in a modern, experimental fashion.|$|E

That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up <b>real</b> <b>fast</b> man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E

He'd brought his ladder over the side fence, where the dog, a-barkin' and plungin' at the boy outside, couldn't see him. I stood dumb for a minute, an' then I know'd I had him. I rushed into the house, got a piece of well-rope, tied it to the bull-dog's collar, an' dragged him out and {{fastened}} him to the bottom rung of the ladder. Then I walks over to the front fence with Lord Edward's chain, for I knew that if he got at that bull-dog there'd be times, for they'd never been allowed to see each other yet. So says I to the boy, 'I'm goin' to tie up the dog, so you needn't be afraid of his jumpin' over the fence,'--which he couldn't do, or the boy would have been a corpse for twenty minutes, or may be half an hour. The boy kinder laughed, and said I needn't mind, which I didn't. Then I went to the gate, and I clicked to the horse which was standin' there, an' off he starts, as good as gold, an' trots down the road. The boy, he said somethin' or other pretty bad, an' away he goes after him; but the horse was a-trottin' <b>real</b> <b>fast,</b> an' had a good start." ...|$|E
6000|$|Halleck woke {{at daybreak}} from the drowse {{into which he}} had fallen. The train was {{creeping}} slowly over the track, feeling its way, and he heard fragments of talk among the passengers about a broken rail that the conductor had been warned of. He turned to ask some question, when the pull of rising speed came from the locomotive, {{and at the same}} moment the car stopped with a jolting pitch. It settled upon the track again; but the two cars in front were overturned, and the passengers were still climbing from their windows, when Halleck got his bewildered party to the ground. Children were crying, and a woman was led by with her face cut and bleeding from the broken glass; but it was reported that no one else was hurt, and the trainmen gave their helplessness to the inspection of the rotten cross-tie that had caused the accident. One of the passengers kicked the decayed wood with his boot. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I always like a little accident like this, early; it makes us safe the rest of the day." [...] The sentiment apparently commended itself to popular acceptance; Halleck went forward with part of the crowd to see what was the matter with the locomotive: it had kept the track, but seemed to be injured somehow; the engineer was working at it, hammer in hand; he exchanged some dry pleasantries with a passenger who asked him if there was any chance of hiring a <b>real</b> <b>fast</b> ox-team in that neighborhood, in case a man was {{in a hurry to get}} on to Tecumseh.|$|E

40|$|Background A keloid is {{dysregulated}} fibroproliferative {{scar tissue}} {{in response to}} skin injuries, which extends beyond the wound margin. Since it has a poor response to treatment, variable therapies are used. Current therapies of keloid include intralesional corticosteroid injection, cryotherapy and various laser therapies, silicone gel sheets (pressure therapy), interferon-α- 2 b, 5 -fluoruracil or bleomycine administration, excision followed by low dose radiation or topical imiquimod. Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficacy and safety of “intralesional triamcinolone with cryotherapy” and “Intralesional verapamil with cryotherapy”. Patients and Methods Eighty patients (42 females and 38 males, aged 11 - 40 years) were allocated to receive one of the four treatment methods. Group 1 : Intralesional triamcinolone with cryotherapy. Group 2 : Intralesional verapamil with cryotherapy. Group 3 : Intralesional verapamil. Group 4 : Cryotherapy. Improvement of healing was measured using modified Vancouver scar scale and centimeter scale. Results There was a <b>real</b> <b>faster</b> response in the first group; while groups 3 and 4 had the slowest responses to treatment. Rates of responsiveness seemed to have no significant difference between the groups, but side effects were significantly much frequent in the first group. Conclusions Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide with cryotherapy showed the most efficacies with more adverse effects, but intralesional verapamil with cryotherapy showed good efficacy with less adverse effects. Hence, it is a suitable alternative in the treatment of keloids...|$|R
