Consistent with practices of agitation on which Isou had founded his movement in 1945, the Notre-Dame affair nevertheless put Isou's <b>radicality,</b> and that of his supporters, to the test. The action thus advanced a nascent rupture in the movement, between two blocs which could be called, respectively, [...] "artistic" [...] and [...] "actionist," [...] a rupture which two years later would lead to a schism and formation of the Lettrist International. It was after Gil J.

50|$|While {{there were}} serious {{macroeconomic}} imbalances to address {{they were not}} sufficient to explain the <b>radicality</b> of the market reforms. Inflation-fighting can be and usually is carried out without wholesale privatization and liberaliziation with the aim to reverse the previous 50 years of Chilean development.

Chilean economist Ricardo Ffrench-Davis counters that the cause for those bankruptcies cannot necessarily be addressed to outright inefficiencies since the severe recessions (around 1973, 1975 and 1981), real interest rates at an average of 38%, hasty import liberalization and an artificially high exchange rate revaluation were the decisive factors of business mortality.|$|E
5000|$|According to Maurice Natanson (1973, p. 63), [...] "The <b>radicality</b> of the phenomenological {{method is}} both {{continuous}} and discontinuous with philosophy's general effort to subject experience to fundamental, critical scrutiny: to take nothing {{for granted and}} to show the warranty for what we claim to know." [...] In practice, it entails an unusual combination of discipline and detachment to suspend, or bracket, theoretical explanations and second-hand information while determining one's [...] "naive" [...] experience of the matter. The phenomenological method serves to momentarily erase the world of speculation by returning the subject {{to his or her}} primordial experience of the matter, whether the object of inquiry is a feeling, an idea, or a perception. According to Husserl the suspension of belief in what we ordinarily take for granted or infer by conjecture diminishes the power of what we customarily embrace as objective reality. According to Rüdiger Safranski (1998, 72), [...] "and his followers' great ambition was to disregard anything that had until then been thought or said about consciousness or the world while on the lookout for a new way of letting the things investigated approach them, without covering them up with what they already knew." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Brockmann wrote “Fassbinder {{was also}} by all {{accounts}} an extremely difficult man {{to live and work}} with — something of a tyrant to those around him, as he also openly depicted himself in Deutschland im Herbst, shouting and humiliating persons around him”. One can also see him behaving as such in the movie Ali: Fear Eats Soul. Looking at Fassbinder’s films though, it slowly becomes transparent how his background played an influence. Critics have commented on the remarkable aesthetics, political <b>radicality,</b> and the romantic and erotic human relationships in every one of his movies. In Ali — Angst essen Seele auf, we have two lovers from polar opposite backgrounds: an Arab immigrant and an elderly German female. The erotic nature of their marriage challenges Emmi’s children, neighbors, and co-workers as their oppression is then aimed towards the couple. [...] We, as the audience, are then left to rebuke/justify the German racism of Fassbinder’s concern through this story. In addition, his works have always involved romantic relationships that experience a “nexus with power.” [...] Fassbinder considered love to be an effective form of social oppression, and it seems that in his love relationships that “the more one of Fassbinder’s characters loves another, the less power he or she has; the more one of Fassbinder’s characters is loved by another character, the more power he or she has.” ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{recurrence}} rates {{determine the}} dismal outcome in esophageal cancer. We reviewed our experiences and defined prognostic factors {{and patterns of}} recurrences after curatively, intended transthoracic esophagectomy. METHODS: Between January 1991 and December 2005, 212 consecutive patients underwent a radical transthoracic esophagectomy with extended 2 -field lymphadenectomy. Recurrence rates, survival, and prognostic factors were analyzed (minimal follow-up period, 2 y). RESULTS: <b>Radicality</b> was obtained in 85. 6 %. The median follow-up period was 26. 6 months. The overall recurrence rate at I, 3, and 5 years was 28 %, 44 %, and 64 %, respectively, and locoregional recurrence rate was 17 %, 27 %, and 43 %, respectively. Overall survival rates, including postoperative deaths, were 45 % and 34 % at 3 and 5 years, respectively. pT stage and lymph node (LN) ratio greater than. 20 were independent prognostic factors for survival and recurrences. <b>Radicality</b> was most prognostic for survival, and for N+ greater than 4 positive LN for recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Radicality</b> and LN ratio are strong prognostic factors. High <b>radicality</b> and adequate nodal assessment are guaranteed by an extended transthoracic approach.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Total {{extended}} gastrectomy (TEG) {{is indicated}} {{in the treatment of}} gastric cancer for necessity or to achieve an oncologic <b>radicality.</b> By this surgical treatment the stomach and other organs or a part of them involved by primitive tumor are removed. METHODS: The authors report a study about 15 patients, out of 116 cases of gastric cancer, operated by TEG between 1990 - 1998. The middle-age of this patients was 63 years (range 45 - 76) and their general conditions were good in 9 cases and not-good in 6. The postoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was carried out in all the patients, while preoperatively only in the most compromised patients. The surgical treatments were: 2 TG (total gastrectomy) +splenecomy; 3 TG+splenectomy+pancreatic resection; 4 TG+splenectomy+pancreatic resection+distal esophageal resection; 1 TG+distal esophageal resection; 2 TG+atypic hepatic resection; 1 TG+ atypic hepatic resection+duodenum resection; 2 TG+large intestine resection. While 10 patients were operated on to obtain <b>radicality,</b> 5 patients had a palliative treatment. RESULTS: There was not perioperative mortality, but we have observed: one dehiscence of the duodenal stump and one pancreatic fistula treated with conservative therapy; one left subfrenic abscess treated with surgical therapy. The survival has been higher in the patients treated with <b>radicality.</b> On the basis of these cases, the authors consider: 1) the possibility to obtain <b>radicality</b> by TEG; 2) the gastric localizations more often associated to extravisceral neoplastic localization; 3) the role of extensive lymph node resection (III and IV level) to obtain oncological <b>radicality</b> or neoplastic reduction. CONCLUSIONS. On the basis of their personal experience and related literature, the authors conclude that TEG is indicated to: 1) obtain a better lymphadenectomy; 2) obtain an oncologic radicality; 3) reduce the neoplastic mass in order to facilitate adjuvant therapy; 4) avoid or treat neoplastic complications; 5) improve the quality of life...|$|E

40|$|Background: Thymomas {{are rare}} {{tumors of the}} upper mediastinum, which have to be resected by {{extended}} thymectomy (THX). Unlike the therapy of myasthenia gravis (MG), {{it is still the}} habit to remove thymoma by using transsternal THX due to its <b>radicality.</b> Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for THX with primary connection to thymomas is rare, however not if it’s related to MG. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the feasibility of MIS out of 426 THX at Charité considering <b>radicality,</b> survival and relapse, between 01. 10. 1994 and 31. 03. 2012. Methods: Among the population of 426 conducted THX, 361 thoracoscopic (tTHX, N = 79) and robotic THX (rTHX; n = 282) were conducted alltogether. Among these, 56 thymomas (Masaoka- Koga I + II) could be detected which were completely resected by tTHX (n = 8) and rTHX (n = 48). The overall survival rate, relapse and <b>radicality</b> were checked. Further data such as initial date of diagnosis, gender, date and duration of operation, MG, ADL-Score and characteristics of the specimen were analysed. Results: 56 thymomas (female 27, male 29) were divided in WHO stage A = 6, AB = 14, B 1 = 9, B 2 = 19 and B 3 = 6 patients; according to Masaoka-Koga there were 24 cases of stage I, and 32 cases of stage II. 96, 4 % had a complete resection (n = 54). The mean age was 54, 6 (range 14 – 85 a; female 50, 4 a; male 58, 5 a; p < 0, 05). 46 patients with a MG had a reduction of symptoms by the measurement of ADL score (ADL prä 7, 74; ADL post 2, 60; p < 0, 05). Within an average follow-up of 51, 9 months (range 1 – 210 months) a thymoma related survival of 100 % as well as no relapse could be shown. Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the <b>radicality</b> of rTHX and tTHX by a full thymoma related survival and no relapse after complete THX. Especially the rTHX is a therapy with an excellent <b>radicality</b> due to the articulation of the instruments. Although the symptoms of MG will be improved, MG is no prognostic factor for thymoma. Women develop thymoma in earlier ages than men. Due to <b>radicality,</b> the en bloc resection of the specimen is preferable to a thymothymectomy. Masaoka-Koga and WHO stage classifications are prognostic factors for survival. More researches are necessary, possibly in multicenter studies, in order to get more expressive information...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Surgery is {{the only}} {{curative}} treatment for intraabdominal and retroperitoneal sarcoma (IaRS). Little is known about how to treat patients with recurrence. We here report the outcome in primary and recurrent sarcoma treated at the Sarcoma Center in Aarhus, Denmark. Methods All patients evaluated for IaRS from June 1998 to May 2008 were enrolled and data on symptoms, signs, means of diagnosis, extent of surgery, perioperative complications, mortality and long time survival were registered. Primary and first-recurrence sarcomas were analyzed separately. Results Sixty-five of 73 primary and 22 of 28 first-recurrence IaRS had surgery. Fifty-three (82 %) and 11 (50 %) patients achieved radical R 0 resection. Age and <b>radicality</b> of surgery were independent predictors of death, while recurrence of sarcoma was not. Perioperative mortality was 2. 3 %. 5 -year survival was 70. 2 % for primary and 51. 8 % for first-recurrent sarcomas. However, patients with radical surgery had 5 -year survival of over 70 % in both the primary and recurrent group. Conclusions The <b>radicality</b> of surgery {{is the most important}} prognostic factor.
