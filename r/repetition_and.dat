It was released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox in November 2002. The game was met with generally unfavorable reviews. It was frequently criticized for its unoriginality, <b>repetition</b> <b>and</b> certain gameplay issues, though received some praise for its graphics, storyline and voice acting.|$|E
5|$|The melody of {{the song}} is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its {{combination}} of harmonic <b>repetition</b> <b>and</b> contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody {{is similar to the}} patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education quality is weak, producing high rates of grade <b>repetition</b> <b>and</b> dropout. Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom. Public expenditure on education was 13.4percent of total government expenditure and 2.9percent of GDP in 2008. Primary classrooms are crowded, with average pupil to teacher ratios of 47:1 in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the <b>repetition</b> <b>and</b> suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word <b>repetition,</b> <b>and</b> producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
40|$|This study compares pauses, <b>repetitions</b> <b>and</b> recasts {{in matched}} task {{interactions}} under face-to-face and computer-mediated conditions. Six first-year English undergraduates at a Turkish University {{took part in}} Skype-based voice chat with a native speaker and face-to-face with their instructor. Preliminary quantitative analysis of transcripts showed that there were frequent instances of pauses, <b>repetitions</b> <b>and</b> recasts under both conditions. One-way variance {{analysis of the data}} demonstrated that the comparative frequency of pauses, <b>repetitions</b> <b>and</b> recasts did not differ statistically significantly under the two conditions. A semi-structured interview with the participants on perceived causes of such frequent elements suggested social and emotional reasons for hesitation, pauses, recasts <b>and</b> <b>repetitions.</b> These small-scale <b>and</b> preliminary findings suggest that further exploration of these modes of communication is merited, and that social and emotional factors may exert a common influence on the linguistic elements studied under both conditions...|$|R

50|$|This task-switching model {{assumes the}} role of {{executive}} control. If the cue repeats, the executive does nothing, and the target is processed {{in accordance with the}} task set from the previous trial. If the cue alternates, the executive switches tasks before processing the target. Switching takes time and creates a switch cost. Predicts equal Reaction times (RTs) for cue <b>repetitions</b> <b>and</b> task <b>repetitions,</b> <b>and</b> slower RTs for task alternations because this is the only condition where task switches actually occur.|$|R

25|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} (TSA) {{is a kind}} of aphasia that {{involves}} damage to specific areas of the temporal lobe of the brain, resulting in symptoms such as poor auditory comprehension, relatively intact <b>repetition,</b> <b>and</b> fluent speech with semantic paraphasias present. TSA is a fluent aphasia similar to Wernicke's aphasia, {{with the exception of a}} strong ability to repeat words and phrases. The person may repeat questions rather than answer them ("echolalia").|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. In literature, the written works of Gertrude Stein employ <b>repetition</b> <b>and</b> repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. Most of Stein's important works utilize this technique, including the novel The Making of Americans (1906–08). Not only were they the first important patrons of Cubism, Gertrude Stein {{and her brother}} Leo were also important influences on Cubism as well. Picasso in turn was an important influence on Stein's writing.|$|E

Abuse reduces girls' participation in class even further than normal and reduces their ability to complete homework.

50|$|This model {{does not}} assume {{executive}} control. The cue {{and the target}} jointly specify a unique response on each trial, so subjects can encode the cue and the target and choose the response associated with the compound. No task switching is required. Cues are encoded faster on repetition trials than on alternation trials because encoding benefits from repetition. Switch costs thereby reflect encoding benefits on repetition trials, not task switching, so it predicts faster Reaction times (RTs) for cue repetitions than for task <b>repetitions,</b> <b>and</b> equal RTs for task <b>repetitions</b> <b>and</b> task alternations.|$|R
