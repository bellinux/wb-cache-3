In this paper the <b>rotor</b> eddy <b>current</b> losses of high-speed permanent magnet machines with different slotless windings have been analysed. The analysis of the losses was performed using 2 D and 3 D analytical models. In the study, test machines with different windings and the same torque production capability have been analysed.

50|$|In operation, the {{squirrel-cage}} motor {{may be viewed}} as a transformer with a rotating secondary. When the rotor is not rotating in sync with the magnetic field, large <b>rotor</b> <b>currents</b> are induced; the large <b>rotor</b> <b>currents</b> magnetize the <b>rotor</b> and interact with the stator's magnetic fields to bring the rotor almost into synchronization with the stator's field. An unloaded {{squirrel-cage motor}} at rated no-load speed will consume electrical power only to maintain rotor speed against friction and resistance losses. As the mechanical load increases, so will the electrical load - the electrical load is inherently related to the mechanical load. This is similar to a transformer, where the primary's electrical load is related to the secondary's electrical load.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} mathematic and graphic {{description}} of non-linearity parameters of induction machine (IM) equivalent circuit due to measured data: no-load, short-circuit and load test. The real values of <b>rotor</b> <b>currents</b> {{in each of}} rotor bar for these parameters are calculated. This paper also contains calculation of electromagnetic field distribution by finite element method in ANSYS...|$|R
50|$|In normal motor operation, the {{stator flux}} {{rotation}} is {{faster than the}} rotor rotation. This causes the stator flux to induce <b>rotor</b> <b>currents,</b> which create a rotor flux with magnetic polarity opposite to stator. In this way, the rotor is dragged along behind stator flux, with the <b>currents</b> in the <b>rotor</b> induced at the slip frequency.|$|R
50|$|A {{source of}} {{excitation}} current for magnetizing flux (reactive power) for the stator is still required, to induce <b>rotor</b> <b>current.</b> This can be supplied from the electrical grid or, once it starts producing power, from the generator itself.|$|E
50|$|A {{special case}} would be an {{induction}} machine with superconductors in the rotor. The current in the superconductors will be set up by induction, but the rotor will run at synchronous speed {{because there will be}} no need for a speed difference between the magnetic field in stator and speed of rotor to maintain the <b>rotor</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both {{types of}} {{self-excited}} generator, {{which have been}} attached to a large external load while it was stationary, {{will not be able}} to build up voltage even if the residual field is present. The load acts as an energy sink and continuously drains away the small <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> produced by the residual field, preventing magnetic field buildup in the field coil.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} procedure {{of a field}} oriented controlled induction motor by means of finite element simulations.

50|$|Electromagnetic-rotor {{machines}} are machines having {{some kind of}} electric current in the rotor which creates a magnetic field which interacts with the stator windings. The <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> can be the internal current in a permanent magnet (PM machine), a current supplied to the rotor through brushes (Brushed machine) or a current set up in closed rotor windings by a varying magnetic field (Induction machine).|$|E
50|$|A <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> meter (RCM) is a {{mechanical}} current meter, an oceanographic device deployed within an oceanographic mooring measuring the flow {{within the world}} oceans {{to learn more about}} ocean currents. Many RCMs have been replaced by instruments measuring the flow by hydroacoustics, the so-called Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers. However, for instance in Fram Strait, the Alfred Wegener Institute still uses RCMs for long-term monitoring the inflow into the Arctic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The mooring is held up in {{the water}} column with various forms of {{buoyancy}} such as glass balls and syntactic foam floats. The attached instrumentation is wide-ranging but often includes CTDs (conductivity, temperature depth sensors), current meters (e.g. acoustic Doppler current profilers or deprecated <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> meters), biological sensors, and other devices to measure various parameters. Long-term moorings can be deployed for durations of two years or more, powered with alkaline or lithium battery packs.|$|E
40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of electric machines is ofincreasing importance. The continuous assessment of themachine performance allows to schedule appropriatelymaintenance operations, thus increasing machineoperating life and reducing repair cost. The input currentspectrum {{is a wide}} spread procedure for non-invasive diagnosisof induction machines. Information on rotor variables are available only bycomputation, typically by FEM. Experimental results aredifficult to achieve: specific sensors must be mounted on therotor to detect currents or flux density. In this paper a dedicated machine and experimental set-up,developed at IEN, was used, that allows to detect single barcurrents through sensors positioned on the rotor bars. So doing itis possible to compute both <b>rotor</b> phase <b>currents</b> and space vectorspectra. The main phenomena, that introduce waveform distortion, arebriefly recalled and the corresponding spectrum lines for bothstator and <b>rotor</b> <b>currents</b> are reported and analyzed in thispaper...|$|R

50|$|Mechanical current meters {{are mostly}} based on {{counting}} the rotations of a propeller {{and are thus}} <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> meters. A mid-20th-century realization is the Ekman current meter which drops balls into a container to {{count the number of}} rotations. The Roberts radio current meter is a device mounted on a moored buoy and transmits its findings via radio to a servicing vessel. Savonius current meters rotate around a vertical axis in order to minimize error introduced by vertical motion.|$|E
50|$|Polyphase motors have rotor bars {{shaped to}} give {{different}} speed-torque characteristics. The current distribution within the rotor bars {{varies depending on}} {{the frequency of the}} induced current. At standstill, the <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> is the same frequency as the stator current, and tends to travel at the outermost parts of the cage rotor bars (by skin effect). The different bar shapes can give usefully different speed-torque characteristics as well as some control over the inrush current at startup.|$|E
5000|$|The induced {{currents}} in the rotor windings in turn create magnetic {{fields in the}} rotor that react against the stator field. Due to Lenz's Law, {{the direction of the}} magnetic field created will be such as to oppose the change in current through the rotor windings. The cause of induced current in the rotor windings is the rotating stator magnetic field, so to oppose the change in rotor-winding currents the rotor will start to rotate {{in the direction of the}} rotating stator magnetic field. The rotor accelerates until the magnitude of induced <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> and torque balances the applied mechanical load on the rotation of the rotor. Since rotation at synchronous speed would result in no induced <b>rotor</b> <b>current,</b> an induction motor always operates slightly slower than synchronous speed. The difference, or [...] "slip," [...] between actual and synchronous speed varies from about 0.5 to 5.0% for standard Design B torque curve induction motors. [...] The induction motor's essential character is that it is created solely by induction instead of being separately excited as in synchronous or DC machines or being self-magnetized as in permanent magnet motors.|$|E

Reduced-order Observer Analysis in MBPC Techniques Applied to the Six-phase Induction Motor Drives, Induction Motors - Applications, Control and Fault Diagnostics, Dr. Raul Gregor (Ed.), ISBN: 978 - 953 - 51 - 2207 - 4, InTech, DOI: 10. 5772 / 60778. Available from: [URL] {{predictive}} control techniques have been recently applied with success in power electronics, {{particularly in the}} fields of current control applied to AC multiphase electrical drives. In AC electrical drives control, most of state variables (i. e., <b>rotor</b> <b>currents,</b> <b>rotor</b> fluxes, etc.) cannot be measured, so they must be estimated. As a result of this issue, this chapter proposes a comparative study of reduced-order observers used to estimate the <b>rotor</b> <b>currents</b> in an model-based predictive current control applied to the six-phase induction motor. The proposed control techniques are evaluated using the Luenberger observer and the optimal estimator based on Kalman filter. Different operation modes are analyzed and are further compared in terms of statistical parameters of performance (i. e., covariance, standard deviation, mean square error, etc.). The effectiveness of proposed methods is verified by a set of comparative experiments obtained by using a six-phase induction motor system experimental setup...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{framework}} for analysis of harmonics in a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) caused by non-sinusoidal conditions in the rotor as well as unbalance in stator. Non-sinusoidal rotor voltages are decomposed into harmonic components and their corresponding sequences are identified. Then induced harmonics in rotor and stator are analyzed and computed, from which the torques pro-duced by these interactions between stator and rotor harmonic components can be found. During unbalanced stator conditions, symmetric component theory is applied to the stator voltage to get positive-, negative and zero- sequence components of stator and <b>rotor</b> <b>currents.</b> The steady-state negative sequence equivalent circuit for a DFIG is derived based on reference frame theory. Harmonic <b>currents</b> in the <b>rotor</b> are computed based on the positive and negative sequence circuits. In both scenarios, the har-monic components of the electromagnetic torque are calculated from the interactions of the harmonic components of the stator and <b>rotor</b> <b>currents.</b> Three case studies are considered, namely, (i) non-sinusoidal rotor injection, (ii) an isolated unbalanced stator load scenario and (iii) grid-connected operation. The analysis is verified with results obtained through numerical simulations in Matlab/Simulink. The second case is verified using experiments. The simulation results and experimental results agree well with the results from analysis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rotor</b> bar <b>current</b> {{measurement}} is {{a valuable}} step in verifying the theory of electrical machines design and control. However, because the rotor is moving, the approach is difficult to implement. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an approach to real-time <b>rotor</b> bar <b>current</b> measurement using the Rogowski coil as a current transducer. Rogowski coils have become an increasingly popular method of measuring current within power electronics equipment due to their advantages of low insertion loss and reduced size compared to an equivalent current transformer. The design of the associated integrating amplifier is discussed in detail, including the advantage, tradeoffs and limitation of the approach. Bluetooth wireless technology is employed to transmit data between the moving rotor and the computer which logs the data. Experimental results from a system for measuring the <b>rotor</b> bar <b>current</b> in a Brushless Doubly Fed Machine (BDFM) are presented. 1...|$|R
50|$|The motor has {{a stator}} and a rotor {{but there is}} no {{electrical}} connection between the two and the <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> is generated by induction. The rotor winding is connected to a commutator which is in contact with a pair of short-circuited brushes which can be moved to change their angular position relative to an imaginary line drawn through the axis of the stator. The motor can be started, stopped and reversed, and the speed can be varied, simply by changing the angular position of the brushes.|$|E
50|$|A blocked rotor test is {{conducted}} on an induction motor. It {{is also known}} as short circuit test, locked rotor test or stalled torque test. From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The blocked rotor torque test is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> test is conducted on squirrel cage rotor motors.|$|E
5000|$|Induction {{eliminates}} the need for brushes which is usually a weak part in an electric machine. It also allows designs which make it very easy to manufacture the rotor. A metal cylinder will work as rotor, but to improve efficiency a [...] "squirrel cage" [...] rotor or a rotor with closed windings is usually used. The speed of asynchronous induction machines will decrease with increased load because a larger speed difference between stator and rotor is necessary to set up sufficient <b>rotor</b> <b>current</b> and rotor magnetic field. Asynchronous induction machines can be made so they start and run without any means of control if connected to an AC grid, but the starting torque is low.|$|E
