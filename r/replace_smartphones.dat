5000|$|Compared {{to earlier}} non-{{smartphone}} mobile phones, smartphone battery life {{has generally been}} poor, due to the significant power requirements of their computer systems and color screens. Poor smartphone battery life has negatively affected customer satisfaction. There is also a trend towards using batteries that the user cannot <b>replace.</b> <b>Smartphone</b> users have addressed the challenge of limited battery life by purchasing additional chargers for use outside the home, at work, and in cars and by buying portable external [...] "battery packs". External battery packs include generic models which {{are connected to the}} smartphone with a cable and custom-made models that [...] "piggyback" [...] onto a smartphone's case. Most recently, Samsung had to recall millions of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to an explosive battery issue.|$|R

50|$|In February 2011, Stephen Elop and Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer jointly {{announced}} a major business partnership between Nokia and Microsoft, which would see Nokia adopt Windows Phone as its primary platform on future <b>smartphones,</b> <b>replacing</b> both Symbian and MeeGo. The deal also included {{the integration of}} Bing as the search engine on Nokia devices, and the integration of Nokia Maps into Microsoft's own mapping services. Nokia had planned to use the MeeGo platform {{as part of its}} future plans prior to the announcement, although the company announced that it would still release one MeeGo device in 2011. Aligning with Microsoft had been considered a possibility by analysts due to Elop's prior employment with the company.|$|R

40|$|Decision {{support systems}} {{are being used}} in many areas and their use is still increasing. But one of their {{problems}} is that most decision support systems can only be used on computers, so they are sometimes not available where the decision needs to be made. For example this can happen where decision support systems are used to set medical diagnoses. Ten years ago this problem was solved by Blaž Zupan, Aleš Porenta and Gaj Vidmar with their Decisions at Hand system, which worked on Palm OS PDAs of the time. But since then Palm OS PDAs have practically disappeared and were <b>replaced</b> by <b>smartphones.</b> The goal {{of this paper is}} to implement and present a system similar to Decisions at Hand on the Symbian mobile operating system. The application is a decision support shell which means the machine learning takes place separately on a computer, where the computed model is written into an XML file. On the phone the XML file is used to build a user interface which supports the input of variables and the display of results. The phone application supports variable transformations and calculations. It also supports two decision making methods: the naive Bayes classifier and logistic regression...|$|R
40|$|Many {{believe that}} in-field {{hardware}} faults are too rare in practice {{to justify the}} need for Logic Built-In Self-Test (LBIST) in a design. Until now, LBIST was primarily used in safety-critical applications. However, this may change soon. First, even if costly methods like burn-in are applied, {{it is no longer}} possible {{to get rid of all}} latent defects in devices at leading-edge technology. Second, demands for high reliability spread to consumer electronics as <b>smartphones</b> <b>replace</b> our wallets and IDs. However, today many ASIC vendors are reluctant to use LBIST. In this paper, we describe the needs for successful deployment of LBIST in the industrial practice and discuss how these needs can be addressed. Our work is hoped to attract a wider attention to this important research topic. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

30|$|Passive {{monitoring}} {{should be}} considered {{in the context of the}} ongoing changes in digital technology, especially in relation to mobile devices for consumers. First, the devices used to access the Internet will change the online activities of the public. For example, the use of a search engine is much lower from a smartphone than from a computer (Arthur 2015; MacMillan 2015). Second, the widespread use of mobile technology has triggered a push toward developing artificial intelligence (AI) interfaces for devices, as evidenced by the near simultaneous announcements of open source AI software tools from Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook (Simonite 2015). The vision of Larry Page of Google is for Google to tell you what you want before you ask the question (Varian 2014, Page 2013). In an international survey of 6600 smartphone users by Ericsson, half of all smartphone users expect AI interfaces to <b>replace</b> the <b>smartphone</b> screen within 5  years, and one-third want AI to keep them company (Boulden 2015). Messaging chatbots (computer-generated responses based on AI) are starting to replace search engines on mobile devices (Elgan 2015). In the future, consumer mobile devices will routinely incorporate voice and gesture input, and as hardware features change, the AI algorithms will also evolve. In the background, there is an industry-wide effort to develop AI algorithms based on massive databases to predict behavior and emotions for uses such as for targeted marketing.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{technology}} is formatting the newspaper pages and TV screens. Now it is clearer that technology {{has changed the}} way we consume news. More than half of Internet users are informed about the latest news through social publication platforms. This is especially true for Twitter-in where different events spread long before they are published in printed format. Even though, our society that is still going through the transition is not far from development and the change that is a product of technological revolution, same as the Western Europe and North America. This has meant that in many countries, as in the US and Europe, as a first screen not be that of the television but a SMARTPHONE screen or a tablet, so it comes to reducing time of the human to spent in front of the television. The Albanian media industry, must adapt or accommodate the enormous technological changes and especially "mobile" technology, which for many of them, the television screen is <b>replaced</b> with <b>SMARTPHONE</b> or with tablet screen that dramatically reduces the time and stay in front of television screens or even in front of printed media. For the BBC, 65 % of the information is disseminated through the Smartphone and this is done through what is called the mobile web or through the applications and as content they are consumed more of that's dealing with the latest news or information alert or those related to the weather. It would be very good that our media to also adjust this advancement in our media environment so the audience to facilitate access to such information. Albanian media market is clearly dominated by the electronic media, and especially television, while printed daily data that are in circulation and the periodic one are much to be desired...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to enable end-users to graphically compose their own applications directly on their mobile phone, mainly integrating the functionalities available on the device and those provided by pervasive and Internet services. To this aim, we propose a methodology and a graphical notation enabling the user to compose mobile applications, named MicroApps: The user creates an application following an incremental and iterative development process; he composes icons representing (pervasive) services mainly by touch-based selection and following a data-flow approach. He is not {{in charge of the}} creation of the user interface, which is automatically generated. The methodology enables the end-user to develop applications and/or compose services on the smartphone, so paving the way towards new scenarios where <b>smartphones</b> <b>replace</b> and overtake the Personal Computer, given their native possibility of wide connectivity, when augmented by features for interaction with remote systems and sensors. The methodology has been evaluated through an empirical analysis that revealed that in spite of the reduced size of the screen the use of the MicroApp Generator tool improves the effectiveness in terms of time and editing errors with respect to the use of MIT App Invento...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{has been}} shown that making phone calls or sending text {{messages}} while riding a bicycle can have a negative impact on bicyclist’s behaviour, in countries such as the Netherlands the operation of a mobile phone while cycling on a bicycle is not illegal and is actually quite common. In recent years conventional mobile phones with a physical keypad are increasingly being <b>replaced</b> by <b>smartphones</b> with a touch screen. The operation of a touch screen phone ironically cannot be done purely ‘by touch’ due to the lack of tactile feedback, and instead requires fixations on a relatively small screen. The question therefore can be asked whether the operation of touch screen telephones deteriorates cycling behaviour more than operation of a conventional mobile phone. Twenty-four participants completed a track on their own bicycle while sending a text message from a conventional and a touch screen mobile phone. In addition the effects of other common activities that can accompany bicycling were studied, including texting at the same time as listening to music, talking on a mobile phone or cycling next to someone and speaking with this companion, and playing a game on a touch screen phone while bicycling. The impacts of all the above conditions on cycling performance and visual detection performance were compared with control conditions in which participants cycled with either one or two hands on the handlebars and were not required to perform any secondary tasks. Bicycle speed was reduced in all telephone conditions and in the condition when cycling next to someone. Lateral position variation increased in all telephone conditions. Use of the touch screen led to a more central position in the cycle lane and resulted in worse visual detection performance compared with the operation of a conventional mobile phone. The main effect of listening to music was that an auditory signal to stop cycling was missed by 83 % of the participants. In conclusion, while all investigated types of phone deteriorated cycling performance, the use of a touch phone has a larger negative effect on cycling performance than a conventional mobile phone. With touch screen smartphones taking the place of conventional mobile phones and being used for other purposes than verbal communication, these effects on cycling performance pose a threat to traffic safety...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{communication}} devices are rapidly evolving. Simple cellular phones are being <b>replaced</b> with modern <b>smartphones,</b> which enable permanent Internet connectivity and many new applications. However, {{this trend is}} introducing strong design challenges, {{which can only be}} solved with new innovations. Because of the increasing number of communication standards and the allocated frequency spectrum, the devices need to become much more flexible. The rising data rates and the enhancement of functionality demand a much higher computational performance than in the past. Since the available battery capacity is hardly increasing, future mobile devices need to execute the given tasks even more energy efficiently. A further scaling to more advanced technologies is a must for achieving the required energy efficiency. However, to benefit from new technologies, future designs need to take the occurring technological effects into account. Besides, the high design and mask costs of future technologies claim for high reusability. Since state-of-the-art design approaches can only cope with a few of these design challenges, but not with the combined set of requirements, new innovative approaches are urgently needed. This thesis proposes a new design approach that considers all the fore-mentioned requirements. The core of this approach, and the main contribution of this thesis, is the energy-efficient Domain-Specific Instruction set Processor (DSIP) architecture template for the wireless baseband domain. The employed innovative architecture concepts together with the applied co-design of algorithm, architecture and technology enable an efficient implementation even in very advanced technologies. To prove the feasibility of the proposed design approach, an advanced Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) detector and a high-throughput filter have been designed and implemented in TSMC 40 nm technology. Both are essential for the realization of emerging 4 G wireless communication systems. Although both designs offer high computational performance and sufficient flexibility/reusability, they are at least a factor 2 - 3 more energy/area efficient than state-of-the-art programmable solutions. This result demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed design approach. 1. Introduction and Motivation 2. Background and Related Work 3. The Proposed DSIP Architecture Template 4.
