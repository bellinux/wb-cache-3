30|$|In wired networks, for example, {{by using}} the {{resource}} auction multiple access (RAMA) protocol [10], network nodes place random numbers as bids, from which the highest number will determine the node allowed to use the resource in the following frame. However, bids do not refer to any pricing information. By adding this economic aspect, real-time auctions {{could be used to}} combine resource allocation and pricing. In [11], real-time auctions between service providers and users are proposed in which users compete for available resources at every time slot, that is, on a short-term basis such as seconds or milliseconds. The auction is held by the service provider, who is allowed to set a <b>reserved</b> <b>price</b> to ensure a minimum gain. The calculation of bids is performed dynamically by the users' cognitive radio terminals. If the cognitive radios are multistandard nodes, they can take part in auctions for different access points using different radio access technologies. In this way, the cognitive radio will try to maximize the user's utility by maximizing the quality of services (QoS) at the lowest price possible. The drawback of this auctioning procedure is that it cannot give any QoS guarantee to the nodes as in each time slot another cognitive radio could place a higher bid than an active user and interrupt that user transmission.|$|E

To establish causality, we exploit multiple discontinuities {{in the relationship between}} <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> and vehicle characteristics to present RD estimates of <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> effects on auction outcomes. Our first set of results show that, in line with the robust predictions of auction theory, an increase in <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> decreases the number of bidders, increases the likelihood the object remains unsold, and increases expected revenue conditional on sale. <b>Reserve</b> <b>price</b> effects are found to be larger when there are more entrants, and when the <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> is lower to begin with.

Our final set of results provide novel evidence on <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> effects on the composition of bidders.

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} Ranking the pro 8 ̆ 5 tability of the 8 ̆ 5 rst-price auction (FPA) and the second-price auction (SPA) is of fundamental importance to auction theory. However, the theoretical literature on bidder asymmetry has almost exclusively focused on auctions with two bidders, one weak and one strong. Here, I consider auc-tions with several asymmetric bidders. As {{is common in}} the empirical literature, {{it is assumed that}} any bidder is either weak or strong. There is no unambigu-ous revenue ranking in this environment. Indeed, the ranking may depend on both the size of the <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> and the number and composition of bidders. However, the FPA is shown to dominate the SPA for any 8 ̆ 5 xed and su ¢ ciently high <b>reserve</b> <b>price.</b> Consequently, a seller with a high own-use valuation will at least weakly prefer a FPA with an optimal <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> to a SPA with an optimal <b>reserve</b> <b>price.</b> As the number of bidders grows these results extend to a wider and wider range of <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> and own-use valuations. In these cases the optimal <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> is no larger in the FPA than in the SPA.

40|$|This paper investigates private-value `reserve price' auctions {{when there}} is a strong bidder in an n-bidder model. Consider an auction model, in which bidders draw their values from the same distribution, but then {{identity}} of the high-value bidder is revealed. This can be more plausible than the pure symmetry and asymmetry assumptions in certain real-life applications. In many auctions, auctioneers usually set a <b>reserve</b> <b>price.</b> Landsberger, et al. (1999) develop a model with a strong and a weak bidder. We enhance this model by introducing more bidders and <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> in both the first-price and the second-price auction. In their paper, Landsberger, et al. only consider the first-price auction without the seller's <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> (<b>reserve</b> <b>price)</b> for two bidders. Elbittar and Unver (2001) examine this environment with <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> when there are only 2 bidders. The contribution of this paper is generalization of the Elbittar and Unver (2001) work to n-bidders. For the first-price auction, the analytically intractable equilibrium is approximated using computational techniques. Simulation results provide evidence that the first-price auction can still generate as much expected revenue as the second-price auction and even more with an optimal <b>reserve</b> <b>price.</b> The findings can successfully explain the reason of differences in revenues generated at several privatization auctions using the two formats with similar preference structures.
