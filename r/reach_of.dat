5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding the <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend {{to the protection of}} due process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the venture}} {{was not as}} {{profitable}} as Méliès had expected; {{the high costs of}} the lavish hand-colored film put it out of the <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> many fairground exhibitors. These financial difficulties, which continued with Méliès's similarly spectacular film The Merry Frolics of Satan the following year, helped hasten the decline of Méliès's career.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} based on the Qing {{government}} water level gauge records from Wanjingtan of the Sanmenxia Gorge in the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow River, Muluandian in the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Qinhe River, and Shijingshan and Lugou Bridge in the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Yongding River. The beginning of the flood season has been reconstructed. The anomaly series of the flood season is assessed using pentad scales. The sequence represents the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow River, the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Qinhe River, and the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Yongding River. Within the research period, the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow River and the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Qinhe River began the flood season on 6 - 10 July on average, and Yongding River began 16 - 20 July. The Yongding River is relatively stable and the start of rainy season of its upstream was basically maintained in early July. The middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow River and the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Qinhe River show great fluctuation, with discrepancies up to 3 months. The same anomalous fluctuation in the flood season <b>of</b> the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow River and the Qinhe River is more obvious after the mid- 19 th century. The delay of flood season by about one pentad in the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow River, Qinhe River, and Yongding River is in accordance with the relative low temperature of the Loess plateau in summer, while the early flood season <b>of</b> the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow River and Qinhe River corresponds with the relative high summer temperature in the Loess Plateau. The beginning time of the flood season in the research area is the time the rainy season begins. The length of summer-monsoon rainy season during 1860 s- 1940 s has been reconstructed, as the Little Ice Age transformed to the Modern Warm Period in China. Rapid warming could change the summer rainy season by 2 - 3 pentads. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E

5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E
5|$|After {{this day}} of fierce fighting, which has been {{described}} as the hardest-fought action of the whole Sinai campaign, the Anzac Mounted Division's advance was effectively stopped. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> this strong and aggressive enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength; over 300 casualties, including eight officers and 65 other ranks killed.|$|E
5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington {{and marched}} into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26.

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the recombinant techniques.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{land use}} spatial data (1 : 100000) of Landsat TM image in 1995 and 2000, by using GIS technology, the spatial {{distribution}} characteristics and change range of farmland use status quo, farmland expansion and losses of Wuwei oasis and Minqin oasis of Gangsu Province, China {{in the middle}} and lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Shiyang River Basin (short for SYR basin) from 1995 to 2000 were investigated. The results show: 1) farmland is the main type of land use in Wuwei oasis and Minqin oasis, the spatial distribution of possible transformation between farmland and other types of land use is broad; 2) farmland in middle and lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the SYR basin increased rapidly, the annual change ratio of farmland of Minqin oasis in the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the SYR basin from 1995 to 2000 was 0. 3282, the annual mean rate <b>of</b> increment <b>reached</b> 2. 18 %; 3) farmland expansion of Wuwei oasis in the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the SYR basin originated from grassland and unused land, which accounted for 90. 83 % of the increased farmland areas, and farmland losses were caused by rural residential land expansion and farmland degradation; 4) farmland expansion of Minqin oasis in the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the SYR basin typically resulted from grassland, which accounted for 54. 58 % of the total expanded areas, and farmland losses were mainly caused by degrading farmland to unused land and barren; 5) buffer analysis shows that there is a significant positive correlation between farmland expansion area in middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the SYR basin and farmland loss area in the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the SYR basin, and the correlation coefficient is 0. 8856. Increasing each 1 hm 2 farmland of Wuwei oasis in the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the SYR basin causes about 3 hm 2 farmland loss of Minqin oasis in the lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the SYR basin...|$|R
