5|$|Reading {{is a major}} {{junction}} point of the National Rail system, and hence <b>Reading</b> <b>station</b> is a major transfer point and terminus. In a project that finished in 2015, <b>Reading</b> <b>station</b> was redeveloped {{at a cost of}} £850m, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. Other stations in the Reading area are Reading West, Tilehurst and Earley. Green Park railway station is planned on the Reading to Basingstoke Line to serve Green Park Business Park.|$|E
25|$|In November 2008, Westinghouse (subsequently {{known as}} Invensys Rail, and {{now part of}} Siemens Rail Automation) was awarded a £20M {{contract}} for a 30-month programme of signalling enabling work. Over a series of 12 commissionings, Invensys Rail will re-lock the existing <b>Reading</b> <b>Station</b> and Spur interlockings to three new WESTLOCK Interlocking units, re-control the remaining 18 relay interlockings and move signalling and telecommunications control from <b>Reading</b> <b>Station</b> to the new Thames Valley Signalling Centre at Didcot. The work culminates in a final commissioning, scheduled for 5 December 2010 and paves the way for future stages of the remodelling programme.|$|E
5000|$|Read brushes, 80 exit hubs, one {{for each}} card column. A tabulating machine might {{have two or three}} <b>read</b> <b>stations,</b> each with its own set of 80 hubs. A {{reproducing}} punch might have an additional <b>read</b> <b>station</b> after the punch station for verification.|$|R
50|$|Cartridges {{were moved}} {{into and out}} of <b>read</b> <b>stations</b> by two {{motorized}} accessor arms, electrically connected via flat cable on a drum. Stage time for data from cartridge to disk was typically 15 seconds, including about two seconds to move the cartridge into a <b>read</b> <b>station,</b> and eight to ten seconds to read the 200-foot tape.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} of {{the library}} includes 31 workstations, 504 <b>reading</b> <b>stations,</b> a 120-seat auditorium, an Art Gallery Exhibition Room, a Seminar Room with a seating capacity of 20 people, and 12 carrels.|$|R
25|$|These plans {{provide for}} the future Crossrail and {{possible}} Airtrack services at <b>Reading</b> <b>station,</b> building a railway that will be fit {{for at least the}} next thirty years. Also, the improvements will allow six new freight trains each day – this could take around 300 lorries a day off the roads.|$|E
25|$|As of February 2015, the {{regeneration}} and modernisation of <b>Reading</b> <b>Station</b> is complete. The station now has 15 platforms, {{each serving}} their own specialist destination and purpose. The new platforms allow more frequent trains {{to run through}} Reading and allow more passengers to join longer trains. The entire Reading Redevelopment project will be completed by 2017.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Reading Corporation Tramways' {{electric}} trams {{replaced the}} horse-drawn tramcars along Broad Street. The following year, {{the last major}} change to the street plan of Broad Street occurred when Queen Victoria Street was opened, cutting through various old properties between Broad Street and Friar Street. Queen Victoria Street at last provided a direct link from Broad Street to <b>Reading</b> <b>station,</b> opened in 1840.|$|E
50|$|Each {{input card}} was read at two {{successive}} <b>reading</b> <b>stations.</b> Thus, for example, fields in a card {{could be compared}} with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in invoice number, totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 read brushes at each <b>read</b> <b>station,</b> one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per digit pulses needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{versions}} supported 40 program steps, {{and this}} was soon expanded to 60. Processing was still locked to the reader/punch cycle time, thus program execution had to complete within the time between a punched card leaving the <b>read</b> <b>station</b> and entering the punch station.|$|R

25|$|Access to Heathrow Airport {{from the}} west remains an {{aspiration}} and the 2009 Heathrow Airtrack scheme, abandoned in 2011, proposed a route south of the Great Western main line to link the airport with Reading. Plans for electrification of the line {{will make it easier}} to access Heathrow from Reading, since lack of electrification between <b>Reading</b> <b>station</b> and Airport Junction (near West Drayton station) was a limiting factor. Plans under consideration in 2014 included new tunnels between Heathrow and Langley.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 2008, Network Rail {{unveiled}} a £400M regeneration and reconfiguration of <b>Reading</b> <b>station</b> and surrounding track, incorporating an overpass {{to the west}} of the station; with freight and passenger trains able to transit from the Reading to Taunton Line and Reading to Basingstoke Line to the 'slow' lines via an underpass beneath the 'fast' lines, replacing the conventional at-grade crossing of the 'fast' lines via points, with the aim of alleviating delays due to slow-moving freight service passing through the station. By 2014 the total cost had risen to more than £800M.|$|E
25|$|Heathrow Airtrack was a {{proposed}} new service by Heathrow Airport's operator BAA. If the proposals had been realised, the scheme would have mostly used existing railway lines to connect Heathrow Terminal 5 with <b>Reading</b> <b>station</b> via a southerly route on the disused southern {{portion of the}} former West Drayton to Staines railway line. The scheme would have also provided direct services to Guildford and London Waterloo. However, the plans faced opposition {{in several of the}} settlements which trains would cross; many objections were because the line has level crossings on main roads, thus additional trains would increase road congestion.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the reader}} and punch {{mechanisms}} {{count the number of}} holes in each column at a separate station. An error is indicated and the mechanism stops (if the I/O check stop switch is on) if the number of holes counted at the <b>read</b> <b>station</b> differs from the number of holes counted at the first, check <b>station</b> (for <b>reading)</b> or punched at the first station (for punching).|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both <b>reading</b> <b>stations),</b> print position, counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|R
5|$|In {{their first}} weeks on board, the Expedition 1 crew members {{activated}} critical {{life support systems}} and computer control, as well as unpacked supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions. At this time the station {{did not have enough}} electricity to heat all three pressurized modules, so Unity was left unused and unheated. Unity had been used {{for the past two years}} to allow U.S. flight controllers to command ISS systems and <b>read</b> <b>station</b> system data.|$|R
25|$|Latest {{engineering}} studies of 'the Gap' {{have produced a}} design for a single-track link (difficult to justify the additional cost for double-track) - previously proposing to utilize two, ex-Network Rail, single-track bridges (removed {{as part of the}} <b>Reading</b> <b>Station</b> upgrade), now to be utilized to bridge the Preci-Spark Car Park and Railway Terrace. The latest design proposes to re-instate the bridge over the Midland Main Line utilizing a new-build single span bridge, complying with electrification clearances for the recently announced electrification project. This will cost significantly more than the original proposal, but has the benefits of reduced future maintenance and access charges for the previously proposed central pillar. The additional cost is somewhat offset by the use of the 'Reading Bridges' at the locations mentioned. The replacement embankments {{to the north of the}} Canal bridge are proposed to use the latest construction techniques to provide a higher but narrower structure. Funding options are currently being reviewed for what may be the 'Greatest Heritage Railway Project' in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|Quinton's {{death was}} unusual and tragic. He was found {{shot through the}} top of his head in the {{lavatory}} of a first-class carriage of a train from London at <b>Reading</b> <b>station</b> on 22 December 1922. The inquest was told by his older brother Francis Quinton that James had been depressed after a bout of influenza and had been unreasonably worried over a mistake in his membership of a London club, an apparently trivial matter which he had seen as a potential disgrace for himself and his family. The coroner returned a verdict of [...] "Suicide during temporary insanity". At the time of his death, Quinton was described as living in Church Crookham, Hampshire and as being employed as a schoolmaster at Stanmore Park School, Stanmore, Middlesex, where his headmaster was an Oxford cricket Blue of an earlier vintage, Vernon Royle.|$|E
5000|$|While the Bull punch {{was used}} with the UNIVAC Solid State 80 for 80 column cards the UNIVAC Solid State 90 used the Univac {{manufactured}} [...] "Tower Punch" [...] for 90 column cards.

50|$|Assembler source {{starts with}} column 21 of the card, not column one. In systems without a disk drive, the {{assembler}} would punch code into {{the start of}} the card just read (the card reader was actually a reader-punch, with the punch <b>station</b> after the <b>read</b> <b>station)</b> and then <b>read</b> the next card. To handle forward branches and the like, the assembler's second pass literally involved a second pass of the cards through the reader/punch. If source changes were needed the programmer would duplicate the cards to obtain a deck with columns 1-20 blank ready for the next run through the assembler.|$|R

2500|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Grace's illness {{developed}} [...] "after {{sleeping in a}} damp hotel bed". Gilbert, who stayed at the hotel for several days, later wrote to The Daily Telegraph: [...] "It having come to my knowledge there is a rumour abroad that Mr. G. F. Grace's fatal illness was caused by sleeping in a damp bed at the Red Lion Hotel, Basingstoke, I beg to contradict it. He had a bad cold before he left home, and on my arrival at Basingstoke {{he told me that}} he had received another chill whilst waiting at <b>Reading</b> <b>Station.</b> By inserting this you will greatly oblige me, and also do justice to the members of a family whose attention and kindness to my cousin all through his illness could not have been surpassed had he been at home". The [...] "damp bed" [...] story is refuted by evidence to the contrary, as described above, because Grace's illness began with the cold he caught during the match at The Oval and he was already ill when he arrived in Basingstoke.|$|E

60|$|And {{that was}} all she got from him; but the matter rankled in her brain. She could not bear {{sleeping}} dogs. And there stirred in her a tortuous impulse to push the matter toward decision. Jon ought to be told, so that either his feeling might be nipped in the bud, or, flowering {{in spite of the}} past, come to fruition. And she determined to see Fleur, and judge for herself. When June determined on anything, delicacy became a somewhat minor consideration. After all, she was Soames' cousin, and they were both interested in pictures. She would go and tell him that he ought to buy a Paul Post, or perhaps a piece of sculpture by Boris Strumolowski, and of course she would say nothing to her father. She went on the following Sunday, looking so determined that she had some difficulty in getting a cab at <b>Reading</b> <b>station.</b> The river country was lovely in those days of her own month, and June ached at its loveliness. She who had passed through this life without knowing what union was had a love of natural beauty which was almost madness. And when she came to that choice spot where Soames had pitched his tent, she dismissed her cab, because, business over, she wanted to revel in the bright water and the woods. She appeared at his front door, therefore, as a mere pedestrian, and sent in her card. It was in June's character to know that when her nerves were fluttering she was doing something worth while. If one's nerves did not flutter, she was taking the line of least resistance, and knew that nobleness was not obliging her. She was conducted to a drawing-room, which, though not in her style, showed every mark of fastidious elegance. Thinking, 'Too much taste--too many knick-knacks,' she saw in an old lacquer-framed mirror the figure of a girl coming in from the verandah. Clothed in white, and holding some white roses in her hand, she had, reflected in that silvery-grey pool of glass, a vision-like appearance, as if a pretty ghost had come out of the green garden.|$|E

50|$|WRBH {{began as}} {{the dream of}} a local mathematician, Dr. Robert McClean. He was blind, but he had a vision: a FM <b>reading</b> radio <b>station,</b> with strong {{programming}} content that would improve the lives of blind and visually impaired persons for productive, fulfilling lives. In 1975, McClean began leasing airtime from WWNO and renting studio space from New Orleans’ Lighthouse for the Blind. By 1982, his efforts expanded after purchasing the 88.3 FM wavelength, officially making WRBH the United States’ first 24-hour FM <b>reading</b> radio <b>station</b> for the blind. Today, WRBH remains the USA’s only full-time FM reading radio service and is one of only three such stations in the world.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>read</b> <b>station,</b> {{a set of}} 80 {{spring wire}} brushes pressed against the card, one for each column (the 407 <b>read</b> <b>station,</b> {{constructed}} without brushes, held the card stationary and could read a card multiple times, each time generating the same impulses as would be generated by an 80 spring wire station). When a hole passed under the brush, the brush would make contact with a conductive surface beneath the card that was connected to an electrical power source and an electrical pulse, an impulse in IBM terminology, would be generated. Each brush was connected to an individual hub on the control panel, from which it could be wired to another hub, as needed. The action caused by an impulse on a wire depended on when in the cycle it occurred, a simple form of time division multiplexing. Thus an impulse that occurred during 7-time on a wire connected to the column 26 punch magnet would punch a hole in row 7 of column 26. An impulse on the same wire that occurred at 4-time would punch a 4 in column 26. Impulses timed in this way often came from read brushes that detected holes punched in cards as they passed under the brushes, but such pulses were also emitted by other circuits, such as counter outputs. Zone impulses and digit impulses were both needed for alphanumeric printing. They could both be sent on a single wire, then separated out by relay circuits based on the time within a cycle.|$|R
