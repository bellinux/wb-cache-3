25|$|On March 18, 1939, {{the first}} Boeing 307 (NX19901) crashed {{in the old}} town of Alder, near Mt. Rainier, during a {{demonstration}} flight for KLM, killing all ten on board. The aircraft experienced <b>rudder</b> <b>lock</b> and went into a spin. The pilot attempted to recover, but this caused the aircraft to break up.|$|E
2500|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the first Boeing 307 Stratoliner (not a prototype, as it was planned to be {{delivered}} to Pan Am following testing and certification), registration NX 19901 took place from Boeing Field, Seattle on December 31, 1938. It crashed on March 18, 1939, while its performance with two engines inoperative on one wing was being demonstrated to representatives of KLM. When the engines were shut down, the pilot moved the rudder to maximum deflection to counter the resulting yaw. The Stratoliner then experienced <b>rudder</b> <b>lock,</b> where the control loads prevented the rudder from being re-centered. As a result, the 307 went into a spin and crashed. The ten people aboard, including KLM test pilot Albert von Baumhauer, Boeing test pilot Julius Barr, Boeing Chief Aerodynamicist Ralph Cram, Boeing Chief Engineer Earl Ferguson, and a TWA representative were killed. Subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that the addition of an extended dorsal fin ahead of and attached to the vertical tail prevented <b>rudder</b> <b>lock.</b> This was incorporated into the 307's rudder redesign, while also being incorporated in Boeing's rear fuselage redesign for their models [...] "E" [...] through [...] "G" [...] B-17 bomber.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertical}} stabilizer often employs a small fillet or [...] "dorsal fin" [...] at its forward base which helps {{to increase the}} stall angle of the vertical surface (thanks to vortex lift) and to prevent a phenomenon called <b>rudder</b> <b>lock</b> or rudder reversal. <b>Rudder</b> <b>lock</b> occurs when the force on a deflected rudder (in a steady sideslip) suddenly reverses as the {{vertical stabilizer}} stalls. This may leave the rudder stuck at full deflection with the pilot unable to recenter it. The fillet is sometimes called a dorsal fin.|$|E
25|$|As above for {{pitch and}} roll, {{but with the}} <b>rudder</b> <b>locked</b> and the pedals {{operating}} the ailerons / airbrakes differentially for yaw, lateral control prove barely adequate.|$|R
5|$|The {{forward section}} lies on its port side, with the {{amidships}} section keel up. The stern section {{rises from the}} seabed at an angle. This position shows the <b>rudder</b> <b>locked</b> into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' {{to bear on the}} German ships.|$|R
5000|$|After decommissioning, Fir {{remained}} in Seattle, Washington {{for many years}} while {{efforts were made to}} turn her into a floating museum. When these efforts failed, she was transferred to the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) facility, Suisun Bay, California, in 1997. Her shafts and <b>rudder</b> <b>locked,</b> she was towed 930 miles by [...] to San Franciscos Golden Gate where she was met by a commercial tug that towed her {{the rest of the way}} to Suisun Bay. Significant objects were removed from the vessel and stored at a U.S. Coast Guard facility in Forestville, Maryland.|$|R

50|$|The final Venom for the RAF was the single-seat FB.4 {{which first}} flew on 29 December 1953. It entered service in 1955 and 250 were built. It was {{powered by a}} single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust de Havilland Ghost 103 {{turbojet}} engine. It was the first Venom to be fitted with an ejector seat, {{as well as being}} furnished with redesigned tail surfaces and hydraulically-powered ailerons. The new rudder design prevented excessive yaw and eliminated incidents of <b>rudder</b> <b>locking</b> at low speeds. The FB 4 variant was the first to be compatible with the underwing fuel tanks.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the ship}} was first sighted five days before being boarded, its motor was running and it was underway. At the time of boarding, the engine was dead and the <b>rudder</b> was <b>locked.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since 1962 {{no fewer}} than 121 planes have crashed {{at or near the}} airport, killing a total of 19. Most {{noteworthy}} of these was on September 25, 2004 when a 1985 Stout Bushmaster 2000 (a spinoff of a Ford Tri-Motor) crashed during an airport exhibition. The plane's <b>rudder</b> <b>locked</b> to a left position during the takeoff roll, causing the plane to veer left off the runway. The pilot was able to get the plane airborne before rolling into a crowd of spectators; the plane then narrowly missed the airport's control tower, rolled hard left and crashed onto a busy thoroughfare. In all, four were injured: the 2-person flight crew and two in a moving car. The cause of the accident was due to failure of the flight crew to remove a gust lock—improvised from a nylon cargo strap—from the plane's empennage before flight.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{for the purpose}} of developing instruments that would record the forces and positions of all three controls, and to obtain data on the behavior of an airplane in turns. All the work was done on a standard rigged JN 4 H (airplane no. 2 of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, report no. 70). It was found that the airplane was longitudinally unstable and nose heavy; that it was laterally unstable, probably due to too little dihedral; and that it was directionally unstable, due to insufficient fin area, this last being very serious, for in case of a loss of rudder control the airplane immediately whips into a spin from which {{there is no way of}} getting it out. On the other hand, it was found possible to fly quite satisfactorily with the <b>rudder</b> <b>locked,</b> and safely, though not so well, with the ailerons locked...|$|R
50|$|The {{flight crew}} {{consisted}} of Captain Manjit Singh Sohanpal and co-pilot Arvind Singh Bagga. A criminal case, filed against them {{based on the}} statement of a surviving passenger, was later withdrawn. Both Captain Sohanpal and co-pilot Bagga died in the accident.Investigators later conducted an observation with its Rudder Power Control Unit (PCU). The Main Power Control Unit (MPCU) of the rudder has been a subject of intense debate and discussions and has undergone mandatory modifications {{as a result of}} some previous accident investigations. The PCU has responsible for several high-profile crashes, such as United Airlines Flight 585, USAir Flight 427, and Eastwind Airlines Flight 517. Flight 7412 nose-dived before the crash, as well as two previous crashes, Flight 585 and Flight 427. The <b>rudder</b> <b>locked</b> up in a particular direction, and reversal of rudder to that of the commanded position (anomalous rudder movements such as un-commanded movements). These have been attributed to the secondary slide jamming with the primary slide due to contamination or adverse buildup of tolerances during manufacture. However, investigators later dismissed it and ruled out the failure of the PCU as the cause, and concluded that it was serviceable and was in good condition.|$|R
5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the <b>rudder</b> became <b>locked</b> in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|R
50|$|The starter starts controllers, one for {{vertical}} tail rudders, {{and another for}} roll rudders for anti-rolling in both side wing rudders, with horizontal tail <b>rudders</b> being <b>locked</b> at uppermost position, while the torpedo falls {{down to the water}} surface. It starts the main engine to propel when the torpedo hits the water. A thick safety bolt is inserted into the starter when the weapon is loaded on an aircraft. The bolt is pulled out from the torpedo when it is released. The bolt remains underneath the fuselage of aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The second torpedo—fired by pilot John Moffat—struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the <b>rudder</b> became <b>locked</b> in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage.

2500|$|The {{flight was}} part of [...] "Operation: Sleigh Ride", a USAF airlift program to bring U.S. {{servicemen}} fighting in the Korean War home for Christmas. [...] At around 18:30 PST, the C-124 lifted off from Larson Air Force Base near Moses Lake, Washington en route to Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. [...] Just seconds after taking off, the left wing struck {{the ground and the}} aircraft cartwheeled, broke up, and exploded, killing 82 of the 105 passengers and 5 of the 10 crew members. [...] Investigation into the accident revealed that the aircraft's elevator and <b>rudder</b> gust <b>locks</b> had not been disengaged prior to departure.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{blamed the}} crash on the pilot's failure to remove gust locks {{on the right}} aileron and the rudder before takeoff, {{as well as an}} {{overloaded}} baggage compartment. The NTSB report said that the plane {{might have been able to}} stay airborne had only one of the problems existed. As it was, the extra baggage shifted the plane's center of gravity to the back end, and the <b>locked</b> <b>rudder</b> and aileron made it impossible to provide the needed lift to overcome the extra weight.|$|R
50|$|On 17 June 1989, an Interflug Ilyushin Il-62 (registered DDR-SEW) {{overshot}} {{the runway}} during a take-off attempt at Schönefeld Airport and caught fire, killing 21 of the 103 passengers {{that had been}} on the flight to Moscow (all ten crew members survived). There was one additional ground casualty. The accident was caused by a jammed <b>rudder</b> after a <b>locking</b> tab had been left in place during maintenance. When instructed to apply reverse thrust, the flight engineer mistakenly switched the engines off. Due to the anniversary of the 1953 East German uprising and the at that time tensed atmosphere within the GDR, initially an act of sabotage was suspected, which led to a delayed medical assistance for the injured.|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{aircraft}}'s many faults, {{only two}} {{were lost in}} accidents. The seventh aircraft (38-492) was on its final test flight from the Buffalo factory prior to delivery to the Air Corps when pilot John Strickler, a Bell pilot and engineer/co-pilot Brian Sparks, who was Bell's chief test pilot at the time, encountered problems recovering from a deliberate spin attempt {{which was part of}} the test flight profile. Despite every effort to emerge from the spin, the aircraft would not respond, and it appeared that the <b>rudder</b> had <b>locked.</b> Co-pilot Sparks shut down the engines and waited for the propellers to come to a stop before bailing out. Because of the tandem seating, it was necessary for Sparks to exit the aircraft first, and in doing so he struck the empennage, breaking his legs — and in the process, freeing the rudder. Strickler decided to stay with the aircraft and attempt an emergency landing. By this time, the aircraft had lost sufficient altitude that there was not time to restart the engines. Strickler put the Airacuda down hard in a farmer's field, and walked away unhurt. The Airacuda was so badly damaged it had to be scrapped.|$|R
40|$|The XF- 12 {{airplane}} is {{a high-performance}} photo-reconnaissance aircraft {{designed for the}} Army Air Forces by the Republic Aviation Corporation. An investigation of a 1 / 8. 33 - scale powered model {{was made in the}} Langley l 9 -foot pressure tunnel to obtain information relative to the aerodynamic design of the airplane. The model was tested with and without the original vertical tail. and with two revised tails. For the revised tail no. 1, the span of the original vertical. tail was increased about 15 percent and the portion of the vertical tail between the stabilizer and fuselage behind the rudder hinge line was allowed to deflect simultaneously with the main rudder. Revision no. 2 incorporated the increased span, but the lower <b>rudder</b> was <b>locked</b> in the neutral position. For all the tail arrangements investigated it was indicated that the airplane will possess positive effective dihedral and will be directionally stable regardless of flap or power condition. The rudder effectiveness is greater for the revised tails than for the original tail, but this is offset by the increase in directional stability caused by the revised tail. All the rudder arrangements appear inadequate in trimming out the resultant yawing moments at zero yaw in a take - off condition with the left-hand outboard propeller windmilling and the remaining engines developing take-off power...|$|R
5000|$|The Veltro's slender {{fuselage}} {{was shaped}} with circular formers and four longerons and skinned with plywood, forming a semi-monocoque structure. [...] The wing was attached {{with a pair}} of tapered pins on each side. Forward of the wing a long, one piece perspex canopy reaching almost to the nose covered the cockpit, in which the pilot had a reclining seat to reduce the overall cross sectional area. This was a novelty at the time. Initially, the glider was fitted with an [...] "Orthocinétique" [...] control system, where pitch, roll and yaw were all controlled from a control column fitted with a handlebar; the pilot's feet were then free to operate flaps or undercarriage. This system was never flown. [...] Behind the wing the fuselage had a circular cross-section, tapering to a then novel T-tail. The horizontal tail, straight tapered with ply covered tailplane and fabric covered elevator, was positioned on top of an unusually low aspect ratio ply skinned fin and fabric covered rudder. Flight testing showed the tailplane, out of the wing wake, worked well but the <b>rudder</b> tended to <b>lock</b> in side slips. This problem was cured {{with the addition of a}} dorsal fin and yaw control was later improved with a double slotted rudder, hinged well ahead of the fin trailing edge.|$|R
