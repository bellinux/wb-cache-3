5|$|Kim's {{associates}} {{characterize the}} director as an eccentric individual. Tokyo International Film Festival programming director Kenji Ishizaka recalls that Kim's way {{of writing a}} screenplay was {{to walk away from}} home for three months. He would shut himself up in a cheap hotel, listen to neighborhood gossip, and write all night in the dark. South Korean film critic Lee Young-il <b>remembers</b> <b>that</b> Kim's shoes were never shined, and that one of his few material pleasures was high-quality coffee. Kim Ki-young's unconventional and nonconformist nature also prevented him from participating in South Korea's mainstream film industry.

5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} aging of the characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday is compounded by McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett <b>remembers</b> <b>that</b> Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer did not know that Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E
