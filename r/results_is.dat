Also, the doctrine of separation of powers meant that non-judicial power cannot be conferred on a Chapter III Court such as the High Court.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the <b>results</b> <b>is</b> difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E

5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability <b>results</b> <b>is</b> {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E

25|$|Sixthly, having thus {{attained}} {{this general}} grasp, {{there is a}} continual {{need to make sure}} that it tallies with the up-to-date research of other disciplines, such as archaeology, history, philology etc. For van der Leeuw, as for other phenomenologists, the continual checking of one’s <b>results</b> <b>is</b> crucial to the maintenance of scholarly objectivity.

The more similar the concepts in the <b>results</b> <b>are</b> to the concepts contained in the query, the more relevant the <b>results</b> <b>are</b> considered to <b>be.</b> <b>Results</b> <b>are</b> usually ranked and sorted by relevance so that the most relevant <b>results</b> <b>are</b> {{at the top of the}} list of results and the least relevant <b>results</b> <b>are</b> at the bottom of the list.|$|R

25|$|However critics {{claim to}} have {{identified}} statistical errors in the conclusions published in Nature: including: the actual standard deviation for the Tucson study was 17 years, not 31, as published; the chi-square distribution value is 8.6 rather than 6.4, and the relative significance level (which measures {{the reliability of the}} <b>results)</b> <b>is</b> close to 1% – rather than the published 5%, which is the minimum acceptable threshold.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason the}} high cost of health care yields disappointing <b>results</b> <b>is</b> because only 0.05 percent of health care dollars are spent on {{assessing}} how well new health care technology works.
