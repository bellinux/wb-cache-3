5|$|Fluorine-18 {{is often}} found in <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers</b> for {{positron}} emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers. The most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which, after intravenous injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors; computer-assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging.|$|E
5|$|Heavier {{isotopes}} of neptunium decay quickly, {{and lighter}} isotopes of neptunium cannot {{be produced by}} neutron capture, so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure 237Np. The short-lived heavier isotopes 238Np and 239Np, useful as <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers,</b> are produced through neutron irradiation of 237Np and 238U respectively, while the longer-lived lighter isotopes 235Np and 236Np are produced through irradiation of 235U with protons and deuterons in a cyclotron.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers</b> at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E

5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers</b> to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1940s, <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers</b> {{have been used}} by the oil industry. Tagged at the surface, water is then tracked downhole, using the {{appropriated}} gamma detector, to determine flows and detect underground leaks. I-131 has been the most widely used tagging isotope in an aqueous solution of sodium iodide. It is used to characterize the hydraulic fracturing fluid to help determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers,</b> it was shown that cells are not impermeable to Na+. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove Na+ as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells {{are in a state}} of dynamic equilibrium, constantly using energy to maintain ion gradients. In 1935, Karl Lohmann discovered ATP and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven sodium pump was proposed.|$|E
25|$|If the biologically active {{molecule}} {{chosen for}} PET is fludeoxyglucose (FDG), an analogue of glucose, {{the concentrations of}} tracer imaged will indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. Use of this tracer to explore the possibility of cancer metastasis (i.e., spreading to other sites) {{is the most common}} type of PET scan in standard medical care (90% of current scans). However, although on a minority basis, many other <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers</b> are used in PET to image the tissue concentration of other types of molecules of interest.

Many radiopharmaceuticals use technetium-99m (Tc-99m) which has many useful properties as a gamma-emitting tracer nuclide.

25|$|Numerous {{species of}} ants cohabit the nests of N. corniger or {{colonise}} them once the termites have abandoned them. Some species prey on the termites but others do not. Studies with <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers</b> {{have shown that}} when cohabiting nutrients flow both ways between the ants and the termites. Monacis bispinosa, also known as Dolichoderus bispinosus {{is one of the}} most common ant species to cohabit with the termites but is susceptible to their chemical defences and cannot prey on live termites. Camponotus abdominalis associates with termites less often but is an aggressive predator of the termites. Camponotus species and Dolichoderus diversus have been found to inhabit N. corniger nests that have been abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this may}} be seen as similar to neuroimaging techniques, {{molecular}} measures help to enhance areas of activation that would otherwise be indecipherable to neuroimaging. One such technique that aids in both the temporal and visual resolution of fMRI is the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response. Changes in the BOLD response can be seen when there is differing levels of activation in suspected areas of functioning. Energy is supplied to the brain in the form glucose and oxygen (which is transferred by hemoglobin). The blood supply is consistently regulated so that areas of activation receive higher amounts of energy compared to areas that are less activated. In positron emission tomography, the use of radionuclides (isotopes with short half lives) facilitates visual resolution. These radionuclides are attached to glucose, water and ammonia so that easy absorption into the activated brain areas is accomplished. Once these <b>radioactive</b> <b>tracers</b> are injected into the bloodstream, the efficiency and location of chemical processes can be observed using PET.|$|E
