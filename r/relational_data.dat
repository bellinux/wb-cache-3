A survey of the current state-of-the-art and a classification of the different techniques according to their intent, the way they express the watermark, the cover type, granularity level, and verifiability was published in 2010 by Halder et al. in the Journal of Universal Computer Science.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that for complex queries OLAP cubes can produce an answer in around 0.1% {{of the time}} {{required}} for the same query on OLTP <b>relational</b> <b>data.</b> [...] The most important mechanism in OLAP which allows it to achieve such performance {{is the use of}} aggregations. Aggregations are built from the fact table by changing the granularity on specific dimensions and aggregating up data along these dimensions. The number of possible aggregations is determined by every possible combination of dimension granularities.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{no clear}} {{agreement}} across the industry as to what constitutes [...] "Hybrid OLAP", except that a database will divide data between relational and specialized storage. For example, for some vendors, a HOLAP database will use relational tables to hold the larger quantities of detailed data, and use specialized storage {{for at least some}} aspects of the smaller quantities of more-aggregate or less-detailed data. HOLAP addresses the shortcomings of MOLAP and ROLAP by combining the capabilities of both approaches. HOLAP tools can utilize both pre-calculated cubes and <b>relational</b> <b>data</b> sources.|$|E
