40|$|We present {{detailed}} {{experimental and}} theoretical investigations of hotspots produced by trapped vortex bundles and {{their effect on}} the radio-frequency (rf) surface resistance R_s of superconductors at low temperatures. Our measurements of R_s combined with the temperature mapping and laser scanning of a 2. 36 mm thick Nb plate incorporated into a 3. 3 GHz Nb resonator cavity cooled by the superfluid He at 2 K, revealed spatial scales and temperature distributions of hotspots and showed {{that they can be}} moved or split by thermal gradients produced by the scanning laser beam. These results, along with the observed hysteretic field dependence of R_s which can be tuned by the scanning laser beam, show that the hotspots in our Nb sample are due to trapped vortex bundles which contain ∼ 10 ^ 6 vortices spread over regions ∼ 0. 1 - 1 cm. We calculated the frequency dependence of the rf power dissipated by oscillating vortex segments trapped between nanoscale pinning centers, taking into account all bending modes and the nonlocal line tension of the vortex driven by rf Meissner currents. We also calculated the temperature distributions caused by trapped vortex hotspots, and suggested a method of reconstructing the spatial distribution of vortex dissipation sources from the observed temperature maps. Vortex hotspots can dominate the residual surface resistance at low temperatures and give rise to a significant dependence of R_s on the rf field amplitude H_p, which can have important implications for the rf <b>resonating</b> <b>cavities</b> used in particle accelerators and for thin film structures used in quantum computing and photon detectors...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by the {{critical}} remarks of several authors, we have re-analyzed the classical ether-drift experiments with {{the conclusion that}} the small observed deviations should not be neglected. In fact, within the framework of Lorentzian Relativity, they might indicate the existence of a preferred frame relatively to which the Earth is moving with a velocity v_earth∼ 200 km/s (value projected in the plane of the interferometer). We have checked this idea by comparing with the modern ether-drift experiments, those where the observation of the fringe shifts is replaced by the difference Δν in the relative frequencies of two cavity-stabilized lasers, upon local rotations of the apparatus or under the Earth's rotation. It turns out that, even in this case, the most recent data are consistent with the same value of the Earth's velocity, once the vacuum within the cavities is considered a physical medium whose refractive index is fixed by General Relativity. We thus propose a sharp experimental test that can definitely resolve the issue. If the small deviations observed in the classical ether-drift experiments were not mere instrumental artifacts, by replacing the high vacuum in the <b>resonating</b> <b>cavities</b> with a dielectric gaseous medium (e. g. air), the typical measured Δν∼ 1 Hz should increase by orders of magnitude.

40|$|International audienceVolcanic tremor and long-period (LP) {{events are}} {{characterized}} by sharp spectral peaks that generally result from resonance effects at the source and which concentrate most of the radiated energy. The understanding of these seismovolcanic phenomena requires good descriptions of the distribution in time and frequency of the different spectral components included in the signals, {{as well as a}} separation of the resonance effects from less energetic effects such as excitation and propagation. We address the issue of extracting from individual records information as detailed as possible on the physical processes involved at the source. We introduce and compare several time-frequency analysis methods, and we describe the application of autoregressive modeling and deconvolution methods to the characterization and separation of the main spectral components. We propose a signal analysis approach based on the joint use of a set of complementary methods, and we present applications to several examples of volcanic tremor and LP events. The time-frequency analysis of some of the LP events taken as examples reveals short-duration components at the seismogram onsets with energy concentrated at frequencies either higher or lower than the main resonance frequencies. These seismic phases are probably related to the excitation processes of the volcanic resonators. In several cases, the arrival of the main spectral peak has a delay of a few tenths of a second with respect to the first arrival. The residual signals obtained by deconvolving and eliminating the main spectral components contain information about the excitation, such as duration, delay, or frequency band. The residual signals are short for LP events, and continuous for volcanic tremor. The autoregressive modeling of the sample records gives precise estimations of the frequency and quality factor of the main spectral peaks. The measured parameters cover a wide range of values, which is consistent with the great variety of fluids filling <b>resonating</b> <b>cavities</b> in volcanoes...|$|E
40|$|In 1857 Helmholtz {{proposed}} that the ear contained an array of sympathetic resonators, like piano strings, which served to give the ear its fine frequency discrimination. Since the discovery that most healthy human ears emit faint, pure tones (spontaneous otoacoustic emissions), it has been possible to view these narrowband signals as the continuous ringing of the resonant elements. But what are the elements? It is noteworhty that motile outer hair cells lie in a precise crystal-like array with their sensitive stereocilia {{in contact with the}} tectorial membrane, a gelatinous structure with an observed surface tension. This paper therefore speculates that ripples (surface tension waves) on the lower surface of the tectorial membrane propagate to and fro between neighbouring cells. This mechanism defines a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator, and relies on the outer hair cells directly sensing intracochlear fluid pressure through their cell bodies; in this way the proposal revisits the resonance theory of hearing. The SAW resonator acts as a regenerative receiver of acoustic energy, a topology which was invoked in 1948 by Gold, who later drew the analogy to an 'underwater piano' to describe the cochlea's problem of how it could vibrate with high Q while immersed in fluid. The proposal also gives a physical description of the cochlear amplifier postulated by Davis in 1983. An active array of <b>resonating</b> <b>cavities</b> driven by outer hair cells can explain spontaneous emissions, the shape of the basilar membrane tuning curve, and evoked emissions, among others, and could relate strongly to music. At levels above which the cochlear amplifier saturates, ripples on the tectorial membrane can still be identified, this time due to vibration of the tectorial membrane against the sharp vestibular lip. This second putative mechanism provides time delays between initiation of the ripple by acoustic pressure variations and its detection by the inner hair cells, and so represents an alternative way of interpreting the traveling wave. Thus, by invoking two ways of generating ripples on the tectorial membrane, a comprehensive account of cochlear mechanics can be constructed, unifying a resonance theory (at low levels) with a traveling wave picture (at high levels) ...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} theory of {{resonances}} of time harmonic fields in <b>resonating</b> <b>cavities,</b> based on the Helmholtz equation, we have presented the principle of operation of the Reverberation Chamber (RC) : a n electrically large cavity where the resonant frequencies are changed with a tunerin order to obtain a uniform maximum electric field, within a time cycle. This type of test facility {{can be used as}} an alternative to the conventional Semi-Anechoic Room (SAR) for testing the immunity of electronic equipment to high intensity radiofrequency fields. But, at the opposite of the deterministic environment present in a SAR, the RC generates electromagnetic waves with a direction of incidence, a polarization and a time of arrival on the Equipment Under Test (EUT) that are varying randomly in time. The presented research had two objectives: the firstis to conceive, design and evaluate the efficiency of innovative and less cumbersome tuning systems and the second is to compare the severity level of RC and SAR for immunity testing by using both facilities available at Royal Military Academy (RMA). The first innovative tuning method (RAIL) we have conceived, designed and assessed in the RC at RMA is a dynamic source-mode tuning based on a translation movement of two broadband antennas on two orthogonal rails. The efficiency analysis shows that it complies with the field uniformity requirement ofthe IEC 61000 - 4 - 21. The second innovative tuning method (STATIC) we have conceived and investigated in the same RC is based on a fixed network of sixteen static antennas where a limited subset of eight antennas is randomly activated by means of fast electronic switches. Tuning is obtained without any movement in the RC. The technological breakthrough is that important testing time reduction can be achievedwhen using the STATIC tuner instead of using conventional mechanical tuners. Using the RAIL tuner, we develop a new method for measuring the radiation efficiency of an antenna in a RC without the need of a reference antenna. In order to perform a severity comparison of the immunity testing to Electric fields between a SAR and a RC, a Canonical Equipment Under Test (CEUT) has been designed, developed and manufactured at the RMA. It is an original realization with no equivalent in the EMC community. An unexpected development of this initiative lies in the fact that it has been accepted as reference material for interlaboratory testing in the field of radiated immunitytesting to RF, according to IEC 61000 - 4 - 3. Moreover, EMC testing laboratories in Germany and Japan have shown interest and have participated inthis campaign. The comparison of radiatedimmunity testing performed both in a SAR and a RC has produced several interesting results. Applied to test RS 103 of the MIL-STD- 461 F, it meansthat with one aspect angle in a SAR, it is recommended to use from 20 to 30 tuner steps, in a RC, in order to achieve equivalence of testing results. For the IEC 61000 - 4 - 3, testing with 4 aspect angles in a SAR willneed from 40 to 60 tuner steps for equivalence. Finally, we have shown experimentally that, in a RC, spatial averages and time averages are equal; this is a characteristic of ergodic processes. This experimental demonstration of ergodicity establishes a scientific breakthrough since, as far as we know, there is no literature about this subject yet. From now on, we can say that the stochastic generation of an electric field in a RC is a stationary process and that various statistical parameters in its volume can be estimatedby measuring the time average in a fixed spatial point.

A solenoid is used to produce a narrow beam waist downstream at the position of a 35 GHz <b>resonating</b> <b>cavity.</b> First, we test the so-called "idler " cavity, a closed RF-structure which can be slightly detuned from the resonant frequency in order to enhance bunching. In a second step, open cavities will be tested in order to study the production of high frequency RF-power by an intense bunched beam. ...|$|R
50|$|Whistling {{techniques}} do {{not require}} the vibration of the vocal cords: they produce a shock effect of the compressed air stream inside the cavity of the mouth and/or of the hands. When the jaws are fixed by a finger, {{the size of the}} hole is stable. The air stream expelled makes vibrations {{at the edge of the}} mouth. The faster the air stream is expelled, the higher is the noise inside the cavities. If the hole (mouth) and the cavity (intra-oral volume) are well matched, the resonance is tuned, and the whistle is projected more loudly. The frequency of this bioacoustical phenomenon is modulated by the morphing of the <b>resonating</b> <b>cavity</b> that can be, to a certain extent,related to the articulation of the equivalent spoken form.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{simplified}} technique for dual wavelength operation {{of an extended}} cavity semiconductor laser, and its characterization using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). In this laser cavity scheme light beam is made converging before it incidences on the cavity grating. The converging angle of the beam creates two longitudinal oscillating modes of <b>resonating</b> <b>cavity.</b> Frequency separation between the longitudinal modes are measured {{with the help of}} beat frequency generation in a photodiode and creating pair of EIT spectra in Rb vapor. The pair of EIT dips that are generated due to dual wavelength of this laser (that is used as control laser) can be used to estimate frequency difference between the generated wavelengths. Width of EIT spectra can be used to estimate line width of individual wavelength components...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY This study {{examined}} associations between articulatory speech disorders and occlusal anomalies {{found in a}} group of young Finnish-speaking adults. The present results indicate that mesial molar occlusion, mandibular overjet and to some extent lateral crossbite, seem to be associated with misarticulation of some medio-alveolar consonants. The incorrectly pronounced sounds are produced too anteriorly. Despite differences in the /s/ phoneme in different languages, an association between an anterior open bite and a laterally or too anteriorly produced unvoiced /s / sound seems to be uniform in different languages. Factors associated with incorrect sound production appear to be occlusal anomalies which affect the position of the tongue and hyoid bone, which decrease posterior intermaxillary space, or which affect {{the size and shape of}} the <b>resonating</b> <b>cavity</b> in the most anterior part of the oral cavity...|$|R
50|$|The EC-1 did {{not provide}} a range measurement; to add this capability, {{development}} of a pulsed system was initiated in 1937. Captain Alfeo Brandimarte joined the group and primarily designed the first pulsed system, the EC-2. This operated at 175 MHz (1.7 m) and used a single antenna made {{with a number of}} equi-phased dipoles. The detected signal was intended to be displayed on an oscilloscope. There were many problems, and the system never reached the testing stage. Work then turned to developing higher power and operating frequencies. Carrara, in cooperation with the firm FIVRE, developed a magnetron-like device. This was composed of a pair of triodes connected to a <b>resonate</b> <b>cavity</b> and produced 10 kW at 425 MHz (70 cm). It was used in designing two versions of the EC-3, one for shipboard and the other for coastal defense.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the effect of the}} vicinity of a liquid 3 He-vacuum interface on the behavior of a vibrating wire viscometer. It was found that in the fluid near the liquid interface the quality factor is lower than in the bulk liquid. We further report on the observation of a doubling of the resonance peak of the wire in a saturated 3 He- 4 He mixture. The frequencies and amplitudes of the two peaks strongly depend on the distance between the phase boundary and the vibrating wire; the temperature and the velocity of the phase boundary have no significant influence on the peak frequencies. The observed peak doubling is attributed to the coupling of the vibrating wire with a standing second-sound wave in the dilute phase where the volume of the dilute phase can be regarded as a <b>resonating</b> <b>cavity</b> for second sound...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to perform quartz-enhanced photoacoustic {{spectroscopy}} (QEPAS) on trace concentrations of NH 3 in the 1. 53 pm region with a DFB laser {{without the use of}} a <b>resonating</b> <b>cavity.</b> I analyzed the process of QEPAS both analytically and experimentally. First, absorption spectroscopy was performed with a 1. 55 pm DFB laser on the 1558. 033 nm absorption line of H 13 C 12 N. The wavelength of the laser radiation was then modulated, and the spectral components of the absorbance were analyzed. In addition, low concentrations of NH 3 were generated {{through the use of a}} vacuum system, and absorption spectroscopy was performed on these samples. A tuning fork was also characterized. Photoacoustic signals were ultimately not realized, however, plans for future work are mentioned. by Amrita V. Masurkar. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|There {{are three}} {{branches}} to this thesis: chromospheric resonator, forward modelling, and magnetic reconnection at different atmospheric heights. The first branch investigates the behaviour of resonant {{waves in the}} chromosphere above sunspot umbrae. The steep temperature gradients at the solar photosphere and transition region allow waves to be partially transmitted and partially reflected creating the boundaries of a <b>resonating</b> <b>cavity.</b> These resonant waves {{can be used to}} explain the existence of three-minute oscillations frequently observed above sunspot umbrae. 1 D numerical simulations have been performed of wave propagation along a magnetic field line perpendicular to the umbra to analyse the behaviour of this <b>resonating</b> <b>cavity</b> driven by continuous random noise. It was found that the gradient of the velocity spectra present in the corona is directly correlated with the size of the chromospheric cavity. This provides a potentially useful diagnostic for indirectly measuring chromospheric cavity size. The second branch uses line-of-sight integration to compare simulation data with observations. LOS integration has been performed on two cases: 1 D resonances above sunspot umbrae, and a 3 D simulation of a coronal kink instability. The LOS integration of resonant waves is an extension to the first branch of this thesis. The intensity was calculated using several coronal lines. It was found that the broadband of excited frequencies is correlated with chromospheric cavity size, providing a potentially useful diagnostic for chromospheric cavity size. For the kink-unstable loop, several Hinode/EIS lines were used to investigate the observational intensity and Doppler velocities. It was found that the intensity maps overestimate the loop width due to temporal and spatial degradation. Synthetic intensity maps were also generated using spectral lines from the DKIST/DL-NIRSP instrument. The final branch consists of a numerical investigation into the onset of 2 D magnetic reconnection in the solar photosphere, chromosphere and corona. The initial state is an equilibrium Harris current sheet. A reconnection event is triggered by applying a velocity driver perpendicular to the magnetic field. This external velocity driver allows us to study the early behaviour of reconnection in a naturalistic manner. The heating manifests differently across the different atmospheric layers. The photospheric heating is guided by the slow-mode shocks. The chromospheric heating is confined to the reconnection region. The ambipolar diffusion in the chromospheric case alters the distribution of the current on the inflow region in line with theoretical models...|$|R
