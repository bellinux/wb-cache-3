25|$|Extensive {{personality}} {{research has}} been done that links positive emotional states to individual differences in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The trait positive urgency, defined as the tendency to engage in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour</b> under conditions of extreme positive affect, is predictive of substance or behavioural problems that lead to addiction. This trait represents an underlying dysregulation in response to extreme affective states and has a direct impact on behaviour. The trait 'positive urgency' has been shown to have a predictive relationship with increases in drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems in college, as well as drug use in college. Furthermore, this trait provides important information on how positive affect can increase the likelihood of engaging in substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the trait}} {{negative}} urgency, the propensity {{to engage in}} <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour</b> in response to distress, is highly predictive of certain aspects of substance abuse in adolescents. Early individual differences in emotional differences in reactivity and regulation underlie the later emergence of the trait 'negative urgency'.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{concerns}} about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers hide their caches in inappropriate locations, such as electrical boxes, that may encourage <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour,</b> especially amongst children. Hides {{in these areas}} are discouraged, and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every particular cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting {{to search for a}} cache, and report any problems.|$|E
30|$|In {{this section}} we define a multivariate set-up, {{estimating}} linear probability (OLS) models. Our dependent variables are the <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{as defined in}} the previous sections. With {{the exception of the}} intensity variable (number of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours),</b> the dependent variable is a variable equal to 1 if the young person engages in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> at the age of 19, and 0 otherwise.|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} to {{highlight}} that single parenthood {{as well as}} some other socio-economic characteristics frequently associated with poverty are some of the stronger predictors of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours.</b> <b>Risky</b> sexual <b>behaviours</b> are often a manifestation of lack of opportunities, deprivation and poverty. Nevertheless, although <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> are generally more prevalent in deprived socio-economic contexts, there is no consensus in the literature about the relative importance of different socio-economic indicators as independent determinants of adolescent <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Some researchers have argued that parental educational attainment is a stronger predictor than other socio-economic indicators, such as household income or parental occupation (Goodman 1999).|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> are not {{necessarily}} a phenomenon prevalent among young people living in poverty. Indeed, young people living in poverty are as likely as young people living in less poor households to engage in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours.</b>|$|R
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} use Peggy Mitchell in the breast cancer storyline, {{conforming}} to a soap opera tradition of reserving strong roles for a firmly established middle-aged matriarch. The audience were familiar with Peggy's history, knew that her first husband had died from cancer, consequently making her fear hospitals, and she had: [...] "the right mentality for , which was about 'a woman who discovers a lump and then refuses to accept that anything's wrong'. An added factor was that in choosing Peggy the programme could avoid appearing too issue driven, and [...] storyline {{could be used as}} a device to expand and develop her characterisation." [...] Additionally, as the causes of breast cancer are not attributable to <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour,</b> the disease was deemed [...] "more attractive" [...] in storyline terms. A member of the EastEnders production team explains: ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{negative}} affect, {{positive affect}} {{is related to}} addiction in both high and low forms. For example, individuals high in positive affect {{are more likely to}} engage in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour,</b> such as drug use. Individuals with high positive affect in response to use are more likely to seek out substances for hedonic reasons. Conversely, low [...] positive affect may prompt initial use due to lack of responsiveness to natural rewards.|$|E
2500|$|Some biographies {{suggest that}} the loss of her mother caused {{underlying}} childhood trauma, revealed through periods of depression and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour.</b> [...] But when Gertrude was seven years old her father remarried, providing her a stepmother, Florence Bell (née Olliffe), and eventually, three half-siblings. Florence Bell was a playwright and author of children's stories, as well as the author of a study of Bell factory workers. She instilled concepts of duty and decorum in Gertrude and contributed to her intellectual development. Florence Bell's activities with the wives of Bolckow Vaughan ironworkers in Eston, near Middlesbrough, may have helped influence her step-daughter's later stance promoting education of Iraqi women.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, {{there is}} no {{difference}} in the prevalence of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> in rural and urban areas and the level of parental education is the same among young people at risk and not at risk. Notably, <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> are more prevalent in single-parent households.|$|R
30|$|While the {{differences}} in mean characteristics across young people engaging in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> and their peers are instructive, Sections 6.1 and 6.2 go a step forward {{in the identification of}} the potential predictors of young people’s engagement in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> within a multivariate set-up, as described in Section 5.|$|R
30|$|Theoretically, JEC {{and similar}} {{initiatives}} can have direct {{as well as}} indirect effects on the prevalence of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours.</b> First of all, longer school hours implies that students spend {{a greater number of}} hours per day under adult supervision, limiting the possibility to engage in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> (Bellei 2009; Aguero and Beleche 2013). Further, inasmuch as extended school days have been found to improve academic achievement in middle-income countries, this type of programme can be expected to reduce the prevalence of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> by increasing the opportunity cost of engaging in them (indirect effect).|$|R
2500|$|Sloths go to {{the ground}} to urinate and defecate about once a week, digging a hole and {{covering}} it afterwards. They {{go to the}} same spot each time and are vulnerable to predation while doing so. The reason for this <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour</b> is unknown, although some believe it is to avoid making noise while defecating from up high that would attract predators. Consistent with this, they reportedly relieve themselves from their branches during storms in the rainy season. Another possible explanation is that the middens provide the sloths with one of their few methods of finding one another for breeding purposes, since their sense of smell is far more acute than their eyesight or hearing. Still other recent studies have suggested that it might be relevant for maintaining the ecosystem in the sloths' fur. Individual sloths tend to spend the bulk of their time feeding on a single [...] "modal" [...] tree; by burying their excreta near the trunk of that tree, they may help nourish it. Recently there has been some speculation that sloths go to the ground to defecate because of their mutually beneficial relationships with moths. While the sloth defecates, female moths that otherwise live on a sloth will get off and immediately lay their eggs directly on the fecal matter, on which the larvae survive until they mature to adulthood and are able to fly onto sloths. Incidentally, it appears that sloths benefit from their relationship with moths because the moths are responsible for fertilizing algae on the sloth, which provides them with nutrients.|$|E

30|$|The {{economic}} {{literature on}} crime and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> primarily adopts an opportunity cost framework. People choose {{to commit a crime}} or to engage in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> if their expected utility from engaging in that behaviour is greater than the expected utility from their outside options (for example in terms of labour market opportunities). Within this framework, more educated people or people with better cognitive abilities {{are less likely to be}} involved in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> (Lochner and Moretti 2004; Travis and Hindelang 1977). However, these models do not acknowledge the role of psychosocial competencies.|$|R
30|$|Our data reports quite a {{remarkable}} diffusion of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> among Peruvian adolescents and a worrisome predisposition towards risky {{activities for the}} relevant part of them. Although our data do not provide full support to either the ‘bad seed’ or the ‘conservation of risk’ hypothesis, it is worth to note that {{there is evidence of}} a certain persistence (or recidivism) in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Those who engage in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> at the age of 15 are indeed {{more likely to engage in}} <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> at the age of 19. The average ‘number of risky behaviours’ at the age 15 is strongly correlated with the same measured 4 years later (standardized correlation coefficient of 0.6). Recidivism is more evident in some <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> than others, particularly in drug consumption, drinking and smoking. In fact, adolescents who consume drugs at age 15 are 64 percentage points more likely to consume drugs at age 19. Similarly, drinking (smoking) at age 15 increases the probability of smoking (drinking) at age 19 by 38 percentage points (39 percentage points).|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{looking at}} the {{incidence}} of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> by age, we notice that <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> increase significantly between the age of 15 {{and the age of}} 19, in correspondence with the transition from childhood to adolescence (Table 3). It is worth to note that by the age of 19 male engagement in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> is about two to three times that of females in smoking, drinking and taking drugs and criminal behaviours. There is also an urban-rural difference in drinking, where adolescents living in urban areas drink more (10 % by the age of 15 and 38 % by the age of 19) relative to those in rural areas (5 % by the age of 15 and 24 % by the age of 19) and by the age of 19 are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> while drinking.|$|R

40|$|ObjectivePedestrian {{fatalities}} due to collisions {{with motor}} vehicles {{are a large}} public health problem in Romania, ranking them {{among the highest in}} Eastern Europe. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain a better understanding of crash factors by examining how roadway and environmental characteristics contribute to pedestrian distraction and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> at pedestrian MVC (PMVC) locations in Cluj County, Romania. MethodsA sample of PMVC locations was selected from the 2010 Cluj County police reported crash database for on-site examination. A total of 100 sites were visited to collect details on site characteristics and typical pedestrian and driver behaviours. Variable distributions were examined and rate ratios of pedestrian distraction and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> were calculated. ResultsPedestrian distraction and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> were observed at rates of 6. 3 and 24. 3 per 100 observed pedestrians. The majority of distractions were related to electronic device use. <b>Risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> were evenly split between unpredictable, partial use of a crosswalk and midblock illegal crossings. Distractions and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> decreased as the number of pedestrians and average vehicle speeds at a site increased. RR of distraction was higher at intersections and locations with crosswalks. ConclusionsPedestrian distraction was highly correlated with pedestrian <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> at PMVC locations in Romania. Higher pedestrian volume was protective against pedestrian distraction and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Locations with painted crosswalks had increased distraction. Targeted distraction prevention, particularly at intersections and crosswalk locations, may contribute to the prevention of PMVCs.

50|$|Brief {{intervention}} {{is a technique}} used to initiate change for an unhealthy or <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour</b> such as smoking, lack of exercise or alcohol misuse. As an alcohol intervention it is typically targeted to non-dependent drinkers whose drinking may still be harmful. It is a prevention approach typically carried out by health roles helping at-risk drinkers make an informed choice about their alcohol use.|$|E
50|$|Perceptions of {{vulnerability}} {{can also lead}} to the perception that the victim is partially or entirely responsible for the crime. For example, a disabled person may be perceived as having been at fault due to being alone after dark, i.e. engaged in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviour.</b> This pattern of victim blaming has also appeared in the prosecution of rape and other sexual crimes.|$|E
30|$|In this {{analysis}} {{we try to}} overcome both challenges. First (low prevalence), we show that {{in most cases the}} frequency of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> has increased considerably between age 15 and 19 which makes the empirical study more viable. Furthermore, the use of the last round of data allows us to broaden the scope of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> observed (at age 19, individuals were asked to report about criminal behaviours in addition to the other <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> collected in previous rounds). Second (potential endogeneity bias), although this paper does not claim any causal relation, we exploit the fact that the data was collected over multiple periods to implement strategies that minimize both sources of endogeneity. To deal with reverse causality, we use lagged values of the psychosocial variables of interest, measured 3 years before the realization of the <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours.</b> To deal with omitted variable bias, we estimate a child fixed effects model, which purges bias due to unobservables that are constant over time.|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} we briefly define the core {{predictors}} of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{used in the}} analysis.|$|R
30|$|To summarize, {{the fixed}} effects {{estimates}} {{show that the}} relationship between self-esteem and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> is very robust, whereas the relationship between self-efficacy, aspirations and <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> is not. In addition, {{there seems to be a}} lot of meaningful variation over time in the control variables, which allows us to show that coming from a single-parent household, area of location, migration and schooling achievement are also important factors that play a role in the determination of <b>risky</b> and criminal <b>behaviours.</b>|$|R

First of all, we document a high prevalence of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> with 1 out of 2 individuals engaging in at least one risky activity by the age 19 with a dramatic increase between age 15 and 19. Second, we find a pronounced pro-male bias and some differences by area of residence particularly in drinking habits which are more prevalent in urban areas. Third, we find a negative correlation between early self-esteem and later <b>risky</b> <b>behaviours</b> which is robust to a number of specifications. Further, aspiring to higher education at the age of 15 is correlated to a lower probability of engaging in criminal behaviours at the age of 19. Similarly, aspirations protect girls from <b>risky</b> sexual <b>behaviours.</b>|$|R
