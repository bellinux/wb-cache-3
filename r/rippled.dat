5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse <b>rippled</b> through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if <b>rippled</b> by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this case}} report was to study the {{relationship}} between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spikes, and seizures in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. IntroductionDuring intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), HFOs {{are thought to be}} a marker for the seizure onset zone (SOZ). High-frequency oscillations are classified into <b>ripples</b> with frequencies of 70 – 200 Hz and fast <b>ripples</b> with frequencies of 200 – 500 Hz. Although HFOs are thought to be a marker for the SOZ, their relationship to spikes has not been studied in detail, especially within the SOZ. MethodsWe studied the time course of <b>ripples</b> and spikes in a patient undergoing intracranial EEG. Medications were discontinued on day one. She suffered three seizures on day three. Her SOZ was in the left hippocampus, which displayed abundant <b>ripples</b> and spikes. <b>Ripples,</b> spikes with simultaneous <b>ripples,</b> and spikes without <b>ripples</b> were counted for this study. ResultsWe found that <b>ripples</b> and spikes in the SOZ had a marked diurnal variation. <b>Ripples,</b> spikes with <b>ripples,</b> and spikes without <b>ripples</b> increased and decreased in concert until just before seizure onset, when <b>ripples</b> and spikes with <b>ripples</b> increased markedly. Spikes without <b>ripples</b> did not increase. ConclusionsThese results support <b>ripples</b> as a marker for SOZ and show that they co-occur with spikes. Seizure onset was heralded by an increase in <b>ripples</b> and spikes with <b>ripples,</b> without an increase in spikes without <b>ripples.</b> We hypothesize that spikes associated with <b>ripples</b> may have a somewhat different pathophysiological mechanism than spikes not associated with <b>ripples,</b> differences that may be relevant for the timing of seizure onset...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTemperature-controlled atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{has been}} used to visualize and study the structure and kinetics of <b>ripple</b> phases in one-component dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and two-component dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC-DSPC) lipid bilayers. The lipid bilayers are mica-supported double bilayers in which ripple-phase formation occurs in the top bilayer. In one-component DPPC lipid bilayers, the stable and metastable <b>ripple</b> phases were observed. In addition, a third <b>ripple</b> structure with approximately twice the wavelength of the metastable <b>ripples</b> was seen. From height profiles of the AFM images, estimates of the amplitudes of the different <b>ripple</b> phases are reported. To elucidate the processes of <b>ripple</b> formation and disappearance, a ripple-phase DPPC lipid bilayer was taken through the pretransition in the cooling and the heating direction and the disappearance and formation of <b>ripples</b> was visualized. It was found that both the disappearance and formation of <b>ripples</b> take place virtually one <b>ripple</b> at a time, thereby demonstrating the highly anisotropic nature of the <b>ripple</b> phase. Furthermore, when a two-component DMPC-DSPC mixture was heated from the <b>ripple</b> phase and into the ripple-phase/fluid-phase coexistence temperature region, the AFM images revealed that several dynamic properties of the <b>ripple</b> phase are important for the melting behavior of the lipid mixture. Onset of melting is observed at grain boundaries between different <b>ripple</b> types and different <b>ripple</b> orientations, and the longer-wavelength metastable <b>ripple</b> phase melts before the shorter-wavelength stable <b>ripple</b> phase. Moreover, it was observed that the <b>ripple</b> phase favors domain growth along the <b>ripple</b> direction and is responsible for creating straight-edged domains with 60 ° and 120 ° angles, as reported previously...|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>Ripples</b> (80 - 250.

We investigated the spatiotemporal relation between spikes and <b>ripples,</b> and differences between spikes that do and do not co-occur with <b>ripples.</b> Methods: We marked 50 time points with spikes in bipolar surface EEG during NREM sleep in patients with focal or multifocal epilepsy. We marked <b>ripples</b> that occurred with spikes and calculated parameters relating spikes and ripples: the duration, amplitude and slope of spikes, the timing of the start of <b>ripples</b> and spikes and the proportion of overlap. Results: In total 219 <b>ripples</b> and 5995 individual spikes were marked in 31 patients. Spikes with <b>ripples</b> were on average shorter, had higher amplitude and higher slope than spikes without <b>ripples.</b> 64 % of <b>ripples</b> started before spikes started.
