25|$|At {{the height}} of its traffic, during World War II, as many as 200,000 {{passengers}} passed through the station in a single day. In 1988, a headhouse wing was added and the original station renovated {{for use as a}} shopping mall. Today, Union Station is one of the busiest <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> and shopping destinations in the United States, and is visited by over 40 million people a year.|$|E
25|$|Of course, {{people and}} {{property}} continue to travel by ship, {{as the first}} settlers did. The Atlantic Ocean is accessed by the more sheltered Chesapeake Bay and Hampton Roads, with 5 major navigable rivers offering a wide choice of ports and industrial sites. International shipping traffic continues to grow as intermodal port and <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> are expanded. The Virginia Port Authority even operates an inland port in the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E
25|$|Remaining PE {{passenger}} {{service was}} sold off in 1953 to Metropolitan Coach Lines, which was given {{two years of}} rent-free usage of <b>rail</b> <b>facilities.</b> Jesse Haugh, of Metropolitan Coach Lines was a former executive of Pacific City Lines which together with National City Lines acquired local streetcar systems across {{the country with the}} intention of shutting them down and converting them to bus operation in {{what became known as the}} Great American Streetcar Scandal.|$|E

25|$|Toronto {{became the}} largest alcohol {{distillation}} (in particular, spirits) centre in North America; the Gooderham and Worts Distillery operations became the world's largest whiskey factory by the 1860s. A preserved {{section of this}} once dominant local industry remains in the Distillery District. The harbour allowed for sure access to grain and sugar imports used in processing. Expanding port and <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> brought in northern timber for export and imported Pennsylvania coal. Industry dominated the waterfront for the next 100 years.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{disadvantage}} of electrification {{is the cost}} for infrastructure: overhead lines or third rail, substations, and control systems. Public policy in the U.S. interferes with electrification: higher property taxes are imposed on privately owned <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> if they are electrified. The EPA regulates exhaust emissions on locomotive and marine engines, similar to regulations on car & freight truck emissions, in order to {{limit the amount of}} carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitric oxides, and soot output from these mobile power sources.|$|E

25|$|The unit trained from July to October 1943 for {{operations}} with the Twelfth Air Force. It resumed combat on 30 October 1943 and directed {{most of its}} attacks against roads, bridges, motor transport, supply areas, rolling stock, gun positions, troop concentrations, and <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> in Italy until August 1944. During the assault on Anzio in January 1944, it patrolled the beaches and protected convoys. It aided the Allied offensive in Italy during May 1944, receiving another DUC during the Battle of Monte Cassino for action from 12 to 14 May when the group bombed an enemy position on Monastery Hill, attacked troops massing on the hill for counterattack, and hit a nearby stronghold to force the surrender of an enemy garrison.|$|E
25|$|A {{signature}} name of {{this period}} was Maurice Marland. Born on 12 February 1888 in Falaise, and a teacher of English, French and civics, he led a resistance network. Notable in the town, in 1939, he organised the reception of Belgian refugees and the evacuation of British soldiers. Later, with Jules Leprince, they put escape routes to Jersey in place. Throughout the occupation, his relations enabled him to mount a clandestine intelligence network on port and <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> and enemy operations in the Channel Islands. Arrested and then released in 1941 and 1943, he nonetheless continued until 22 July 1944, {{when he was arrested}} and shot in the forest of Lucerne at the request of collaborators. On 23 July 1994, his son Serge Marland filed a complaint for crimes against humanity, the investigation concluded that he was assassinated by German soldiers. Today, the secondary school of the commune bears his name.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1920s, {{the city}} planned {{to develop a}} large ship and rail {{terminal}} along Jamaica Bay, particularly along the Paerdegat Basin in nearby Canarsie, to relieve port operations in the greater New York Harbor. The project would have constructed new <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> {{to connect with the}} Long Island Rail Road, New York Connecting Railroad, and a proposed rail tunnel to Staten Island. Around this time, a street grid was mapped in Spring Creek, though most of the streets had yet to be constructed. In 1930, Spring Creek Park and the Shore Parkway portion of the Belt Parkway were proposed by Robert Moses, along with several other parks and highways. Land for both projects along Jamaica Bay in the area was acquired via condemnation in 1938, and Shore Parkway opened in 1940, with an interchange to the south end of Pennsylvania Avenue. This {{put an end to the}} proposed Jamaica Bay seaport. Later plans by Robert Moses in the 1950s called for Spring Creek Park to extend to Cross Bay Boulevard in Howard Beach, Queens and include a new beach and boat basin.|$|E

The city is also a [...] "college town", with nearly 50,000 students attending the city's universities and medical and law schools. Its airport, maritime port, <b>rail</b> <b>facilities,</b> and highway network make Newark the busiest transshipment hub on the East Coast in terms of volume.|$|E
500|$|While Jarvis's palliative {{measures}} were being developed, a more substantial project to bring industry back to Jarrow was under consideration. An American entrepreneur, T. Vosper Salt, [...] {{became aware of}} the impending sale and break-up of Palmer's yard. He was convinced that the world demand for steel was about to rise, and thought that the site, with its ready-made docking and <b>rail</b> <b>facilities,</b> would be ideal for a new, modern steelworks. In January 1934, when an initial feasibility study report had proved favourable, Salt began discussions with the British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF), a steel producers' organisation formed that year as part of the National Government's rationalisation of the iron and steel industry.|$|E

2500|$|At {{one time}} nearly 600,000 railcars were {{transferred}} annually by barge between the region's extensive <b>rail</b> <b>facilities.</b> Today approximately 1,600 cars are [...] "floated" [...] {{on the remaining}} car float in the port. The New York New Jersey Rail, LLC transfers freight cars across the Upper Bay between the Greenville Yard in Jersey City and the 65th Street Yard and the [...] Bush Terminal Yard in Brooklyn. At the Greenville end, CSX Transportation operates through Conrail's North Jersey Shared Assets Area along the National Docks Secondary. At Brooklyn, end connections are made to the New York and Atlantic Railway's Bay Ridge Branch and the South Brooklyn Railway. The [...] crossing takes approximately 45 minutes. The equivalent truck trip would be 35 to [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1997, {{freight service}} was {{franchised}} on a 20-year term to the New York and Atlantic Railway (NYAR), a short line railroad {{owned by the}} Anacostia and Pacific Company. It has its own equipment and crews, but uses the <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> of the LIRR. To the east, freight service operates {{to the end of}} the West Hempstead Branch, to Huntington on the Port Jefferson Branch, to Bridgehampton on the Montauk Branch, and to Riverhead on the Main Line. On the western end it provides service on the surviving freight-only tracks of the LIRR: the Bay Ridge and Bushwick branches; the [...] "Lower Montauk" [...] between Jamaica and Long Island City; and to an interchange connection at Fresh Pond Junction in Queens with the CSX, Canadian Pacific, and Providence and Worcester railroads.|$|E
40|$|Urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>facilities</b> play a {{critical}} role in citizen’s social activities (e. g., residence, work and education). Using panel data on housing prices and urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>facilities</b> for 35 Chinese cities for 2002 to 2013, this study constructs a panel data model to evaluate the effect of <b>rail</b> transit <b>facilities</b> on housing prices quantitatively. A correlation test reveals significant correlations between housing prices and <b>rail</b> transit <b>facilities.</b> Empirical results demonstrate that <b>rail</b> transit <b>facilities</b> can markedly elevate real estate prices. Quantitatively, a 1 % increase in rail transit mileage improves housing prices by 0. 0233 %. The results highlight the importance of other factors (e. g., per capita GDP, land price, investment in real estate and population density) in determining housing prices. We also assess the effects of expectations of new rail transit lines on housing prices, and the results show that expectation effects are insignificant. These findings encourage Chinese policy makers to take <b>rail</b> transit <b>facilities</b> into account in achieving sustainable development of real estate markets...|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to severe traffic congestion experienced by commuters from the Waimakariri District heading into Christchurch following the earthquakes of 2010–2011, Environment Canterbury commissioned the Greater Christchurch Northern Rail – Rapid Assessment {{to examine the}} possibility of a temporary passenger rail service between Rangiora and Christchurch. [...] Released on 17 July 2014, the aim of the report was to determine if existing <b>rail</b> <b>facilities</b> and equipment could be used, for low cost, to run a peak-time commuter service to relieve pressure on the road network until mitigation works could be completed to improve road capacity. [...] It concluded that, while the best option for providing such a service would be one that ran from Rangiora to Addington with stops at Kaiapoi and Papanui and had connecting bus services, given the narrow and specific scope of a temporary service, it was too risky and could not be justified.|$|E
2500|$|When National Steel became {{insolvent}} in 2003 {{most of the}} island's {{facilities were}} purchased, {{along with the rest}} of what is now called the Great Lakes Works, by United States Steel, which currently operates the mill.
