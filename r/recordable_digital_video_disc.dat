40|$|Abstract—Fire {{behavior}} characteristics (such as temperature, radiant {{and total}} heat flux, 2 - and 3 -dimensional velocities, and air flow) are {{extremely difficult to}} measure insitu. Although insitu sensor packages are capable of such measurements in realtime, it is also essential to acquire video documentation {{as a means of}} better understanding the fire behavior data recorded by individual fire behavior sensor packages. Therefore, coupling each sensor pack with a <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> recorder for simultaneous recording of video and insitu measurements allows viewing of the fire behavior as flames approach, envelope, and disperse past individual sensor packs. The limiting factor in this process is the amount of <b>recordable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> tape, typically 60 to 90 minutes of record time. This raises both tactical and safety-related concerns, requiring researchers to remain in proximity to the advancing fire in order to activate the fire behavior sensor and video packages. A new remote trigger that eliminates the need for human interaction in order to activate data collection hardware and video equipment has been designed and tested. This trigger system allows the fire behavior and video packages to stay in “sleep ” mode until a measurable rise in heat flux is detected. The detection activate...|$|R

One was the Multimedia Compact Disc (MMCD), backed by Philips and Sony, and the other was the Super Density (SD) disc, supported by Toshiba, Time Warner, Matsushita Electric, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric, Pioneer, Thomson, and JVC. By the time of the press launches for both formats in January 1995, the MMCD nomenclature had been dropped, and Philips and Sony were referring to their format as <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Disc</b> (DVD).|$|R

50|$|The {{compact disc}} (CD) and the <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> (DVD) were {{introduced}} at this time. The CD, {{which appeared in}} 1982, became a favourite format for musical recordings. By 1986 most music stores in Canada had phased out the LP {{and replaced it with}} the CD. It was also used for other purposes including data storage {{in the form of the}} CD-ROM. A closely related format, the DVD, with greater storage capacity than the CD, was introduced in 1997. In 1986, Americ Disc of Drummondville, Quebec began to manufacture CDs and after 1997, DVDs and has become one of the largest suppliers of this product in North America.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The warpage of injection–compression-molded optical media, such as com-pact <b>discs</b> and <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs,</b> due to {{asymmetric}} cooling during {{production is}} predicted. Thermally induced stress is calculated with a nonisothermal compressible flow simulation with a viscoelastic constitutive model. A {{finite element analysis}} is formulated with axisymmetric plate elements based on Kirchhoff thin-plate theory to simulate the warpage of the disc due to the asymmetric thermal stress and gravity after demolding. Simulation results of warpage for compact-disc-recordable moldings are compared with experimental observations under different processing conditions, such as the melt temperature, mold temperature, and packing pressure, with an optical grade of polycarbonate. The comparison shows that the simulation well predicts the effects of various processing conditions. Both the simulation and experiment indicate that of the processing conditions, the mold temperature has the greatest effect o...|$|R

50|$|DVD (<b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Disc,</b> or <b>Digital</b> Versatile Disc) was {{released}} in 1996. It is a hybrid of Philips and Sony's MM-CD (Multi-Media Compact Disc) format and Toshiba's SD (Super Density) format. The last-minute adoption of the hybrid DVD format was agreed to by all three companies {{in an effort to}} avoid a damaging format war, similar to that between Beta and VHS in the 1970s and 1980s. Toshiba failed to reach a similar compromise agreement with Sony in the race to develop a high-definition optical <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> format in the 2000s. This proved to be a costly mistake for Toshiba (and the format's co-developers, NEC and Microsoft), and the AOD (Advanced Optical Disc) format, later renamed HD DVD, lost a brutal format war with Sony's Blu-ray Disc (BD) format. This format war delayed acceptance of either format, and Blu-ray Disc has only recently gained traction in the consumer market, where it competes with the continued success of DVD and the rise of streaming movie services such as Netflix.|$|R

Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes (such as yaoi) and on fansubbers—anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue—whom they had hired. In response, the Board of Film Censors said {{that it did not}} ask for subtitles to be changed, that it merely classified content, and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles. In addition to problems of quality and scheduling, criticisms were directed at Odex's litigious strategy and poor public relations.

Many movie producers lament about how the existence of rampant movie piracy has greatly reduced their profits, and they take concerted efforts in fighting both online and hard goods piracy. In order to evaluate how movie piracy has affected both movie producers and consumers, we develop a simple theoretical model consisting of both the traditional theatrical movie market and the modern <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs</b> (DVD) market. While prices, demand and profits of movie theatres and DVDs are adversely affected by movie piracy, consumers gain most with an early availability of pirated movies.

50|$|As the VHS market saturated, {{multiple}} media {{executives and}} manufacturers {{liked the idea}} of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>disc.</b> Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} {{of meeting the}} ever increasing demands for low-cost information storage media with greater information storage density and rapid access has prompted development of sophisticated optical technologies, e. g., compact <b>disc</b> (CD) and <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> (DVD) in read only memory (ROM), recordable (R), rewritable (RW) and random access memory (RAM). Here the suitability of time of flight-energy elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-E ERDA) to characterise optical storage media film has been investigated. High-energy heavy ions (48 MeV 81 Br 8 + and 60 MeV 127 I 10 +) from a tandem accelerator were used to analyse CD-ROM, CD-R and CD-RW structures. Up to 9 elements, H, C, O Al, P, Co, Cr, Ge, and Sb/Te could be distinguished simultaneously.
