40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Initial {{complete}} occlusion of {{very large}} or giant aneurysms often cannot be accomplished, and most will partially reopen over time. This study {{was performed to}} assess the clinical and angiographic outcome of patients with very large or giant cerebral aneurysms treated with detachable coils. METHODS: During 6 years, 29 patients with 31 very large or giant (20 – 55 -mm) cerebral aneurysms were initially treated with detachable coils. Nineteen patients presented with sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and eight patients had symptoms of mass effect. One patient had an incidental aneurysm, and one patient had an additional aneurysm. RESULTS: Twenty-three (79 %) of 29 patients had a good clinical outcome at a median follow-up of 50 months. One of 19 patients presenting with SAH had repeat bleed (annual rebleeding rate, 1. 45 %). After initial coiling, seven of 31 aneurysms were incompletely occluded; this rate increased to 20 of 29 aneurysms at 6 -month follow-up angiography. After 16 <b>repeat</b> <b>coiling</b> procedures in 13 aneurysms, 12 of 29 aneurysms in surviving patients were still incompletely occluded.

40|$|Pollen feeding {{behaviors}} Heliconius and Laparus (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) {{represent a}} key innovation that has shaped other life history traits of these neotropical butterflies. Although all flower visiting Lepidoptera regularly {{come in contact}} with pollen, only Heliconius and Laparus butterflies actively collect pollen with the proboscis and subsequently take up nutrients from the pollen grains. This study focused on the behavior of pollen processing and compared the movement patterns with proboscis grooming behavior in various nymphalid butterflies using video analysis. The proboscis movements of pollen processing behavior consisted of a lengthy series of <b>repeated</b> <b>coiling</b> and uncoiling movements in a loosely coiled proboscis position combined with up and down movements and the release of saliva. The proboscis-grooming behavior was triggered by contamination of the proboscis in both pollen feeding and non-pollen feeding nymphalid butterflies. Proboscis grooming movements included interrupted series of coiling and uncoiling movements, characteristic sideways movements, proboscis lifting, and occasionally full extension of the proboscis. Discharge of saliva was more pronounced in pollen feeding species than in non-pollen feeding butterfly species. We conclude that the pollen processing behavior of Heliconius and Laparus is a modified proboscis grooming behavior that originally served to clean the proboscis after contamination with particles...|$|R

40|$|Werner {{syndrome}} (WS) {{is a rare}} progeroid disorder {{characterized by}} genomic instability, increased cancer incidence, and early onset {{of a variety of}} aging pathologies. WS is unique among early aging syndromes in that affected individuals are developmentally normal, and phenotypic onset is in early adulthood. The protein defective in WS (WRN) {{is a member of the}} large RecQ family of helicases but is unique among this family in having an exonuclease. RecQ helicases form multimers, but the mechanism and consequence of multimerization remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify a novel heptad <b>repeat</b> <b>coiled</b> coil region between the WRN nuclease and helicase domains that facilitates multimerization of WRN. We mapped a novel and unique DNA-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site proximal to the WRN multimerization region. However, phosphorylation at this site affected neither exonuclease activity nor multimeric state. We found that WRN nuclease is stimulated by DNA-dependent protein kinase independently of kinase activity or WRN nuclease multimeric status. In addition, WRN nuclease multimerization significantly increased nuclease processivity. We found that the novel WRN coiled coil domain is necessary for multimerization of the nuclease domain and sufficient to multimerize with full-length WRN in human cells. Importantly, correct homomultimerization is required for WRN function in vivo as overexpression of this multimerization domain caused increased sensitivity to camptothecin and 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide similar to that in cells lacking functional WRN protein...|$|R
40|$|Packing {{of about}} two meters {{of the human genome}} DNA into chroma-tin occupying a several {{micron-sized}} cell nucleus requires a high degree of compac-tion in a manner that allows the informa-tion encoded on DNA to remain easily accessible. This packing is mediated by <b>repeated</b> <b>coiling</b> of DNA double helix around histones to form nucleosome arrays that are further folded into higher-order structures. Relatively straight DNA linkers separate the nucleosomes and the spacing between consecutive nucleosome varies between different cells and between differ-ent chromosomal loci. In a recent work 1 our group used a biochemically defined in vitro reconstituted system to explore how do various DNA linkers mediate nucleosome array packing into higher-order chromatin structures. For long nucleosome linkers (about 60 bp) we observed a more open chromatin structure and no effect of small linker length alterations (± 2 – 4 bp) on chromatin folding. In striking contrast, for shorter linkers (20 – 32 bp) we found more compact packing with strong periodical dependence upon the linker DNA lengths. Our data together with high-resolution nucleosome position mapping provide evi-dence for the natural nucleosome repeats to support a chromatin architecture that, by default, restricts spontaneous folding of nucleosome arrays into compact chroma-tin fibers. We suggest that incomplete fold-ing of the nucleosome arrays may promote global inter-array interactions that lead to chromatin condensation in metaphase chromosomes and heterochromatin...|$|R

The first patient, a 72 -year-old woman, presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) secondary to rupture of a 10 -mm left {{internal carotid artery}} aneurysm with a 5 -mm neck. The first GDC embolization was performed at 9 hours after onset, leaving contrast filling of the dome from the distal neck. Follow-up angiography 3 months later revealed aneurysmal regrowth, recanalization and coil compaction. A second embolization was performed, resulting in complete occlusion. However, follow-up angiography 9 months later revealed recanalization again. A third coiling was performed, resulting in complete occlusion. The second patient, a 53 -year-old man, presented with SAH secondary to rupture of a 20 -mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm with an 8 -mm neck.

40|$|ObjectiveAneurysms {{involving}} {{branches of}} the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries are uncommon and require proper management to prevent rupture and death. This study compares surgical and endovascular treatment of these aneurysms and analyzes outcome. MethodsPatients at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York who were treated for aneurysms in the {{branches of the}} celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery were identified through a search of the institution’s medical records and endovascular database. Patient demographics, history, clinical presentation, aneurysm characteristics, treatments, and follow-up outcome were retrospectively recorded. Significant differences between patients treated by surgical or endovascular therapy were determined by using Student’s t test and χ 2 analysis. ResultsBetween January 1, 1991, and July 1, 2005, 59 patients with 61 aneurysms were treated at a single institution. Twenty-four patients had surgical repair, and 35 underwent endovascular treatment, which included coil embolization and stent-graft therapy. Splenic (28) and hepatic (22) artery aneurysms predominated. Eighty-nine percent of splenic artery aneurysms were true aneurysms and were treated by endovascular and surgical procedures in near equal numbers (14 and 11, respectively). Pseudoaneurysms {{were significantly more likely to}} be treated by endovascular means (P <. 01). The technical success rate of endovascular treatment for aneurysms was 89 %, and failures were successfully treated by <b>repeat</b> <b>coil</b> embolization in all patients who presented for retreatment. Patients treated by endovascular techniques had a significantly higher incidence of malignancy than patients treated with open surgical techniques (P =. 03). Furthermore, patients treated by endovascular means had a shorter in-hospital length of stay (2. 4 vs 6. 6 days, P <. 001). ConclusionEndovascular management of visceral aneurysms is an effective means of treating aneurysms involving branches of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and is particularly useful in patients with comorbidities, including cancer. It is associated with a decreased length of stay in the elective setting, and failure of primary treatment can often be successfully managed percutaneously...|$|R
40|$|Background: Follow-up imaging after coil {{embolization}} of visceral artery aneurysms {{is important}} for detecting recanalization. However, CT examination is susceptible to coil artifacts, which sometimes {{makes it difficult to}} assess recanalization. We report 2 cases where recanalization was successfully visualized using time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography after coil embolization of visceral artery aneurysms (one case of right internal iliac artery aneurysm and one case of splenic artery aneurysm). <b>Repeat</b> <b>coil</b> embolization was successfully performed. Case Report: Case 1. An 80 -year-old male patient with right internal iliac artery (IIA) aneurysm underwent coil embolization. Aneurysm was located at the bifurcation of the right IIA and therefore, after making a femorofemoral bypass, the distal part of the right IIA, aneurysm and the common iliac artery were embolized with a coil. One year later, the size of the aneurysm seemed to have increased on CT. However, the details were not determined because of metal artifacts. Thus, timeresolved MRA was performed and showed minute vascular flow inside the aneurysm. Angiography was subsequently performed and blood flow inside the aneurysm was visualized similar to the findings in time-resolved MRA. Coil embolization was performed once more and vascular flow inside the aneurysm disappeared. Case 2. A 36 -year-old male patient with a splenic artery aneurysm underwent coil packing with preservation of splenic artery patency. Four years later, coil compaction was suspected in a CT scan, but CT could not evaluate recanalization because of severe metal artifacts. Angiography was subsequently performed, showing recanalization of the aneurysm as did the time-resolved MRA. Therefore, coil embolization of the aneurysm and splenic artery was performed again. Conclusions: Follow-up imaging after coil embolization of visceral artery aneurysms {{is important for}} detecting recanalization. However, it is sometimes difficult to assess recanalization with CT because of artifacts caused by metal. In our cases, recanalization of aneurysms was clearly shown by timeresolved MRA and re-embolization was successfully performed.

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this report is to {{evaluate}} the use of conventional coils and the Amplatzer Vascular Plug, a type of nitinol-based self-expanding device, to occlude the internal iliac artery in patients undergoing aortoiliac or common iliac aneurysm endograft repair, or both. MethodsBetween August and December 2004, in preparation for endograft repairs of aortoiliac or common iliac artery aneurysms, or both, at a community hospital system, five patients underwent the occlusion of the internal iliac artery with an Amplatzer Vascular Plug to prevent endoleak. During the preceding 12 months, the conventional coil embolization of the internal iliac artery was used for the same purpose in 10 patients. ResultsIn five patients undergoing the Amplatzer Vascular Plug occlusion of the internal iliac artery, precise deployment at the origin of the artery was achieved. Complete and precise occlusion was confirmed angiographically, and only one device was used for each internal iliac artery. Two patients reported mild buttock claudication 2 weeks after occlusion, which resolved completely by 6 and 8 weeks, respectively. A type II endoleak from the inferior mesenteric artery developed in one patient. In the previous 10 patients, 11 internal iliac arteries were treated with conventional <b>coils.</b> Subsequent <b>repeat</b> <b>coil</b> embolization was required for three patients. The procedural complications in this second group included one case of coil embolization into the superficial femoral artery and one into the common iliac artery; both errant coils were retrieved successfully by endovascular techniques. An average of 7 ± 3. 4 (mode of 5) coils were used for each internal iliac artery. Three cases of buttock claudication occurred after the unilateral internal iliac artery occlusion in this group and did not resolve. No evidence of ischemic bowel, buttock necrosis, or sexual dysfunction was observed in either group. The estimated average cost to occlude one internal iliac artery was $ 375 for Amplatzer Vascular Plugs and $ 3, 500 for conventional coils. ConclusionsThe Amplatzer Vascular Plug allows for a cost-effective method to occlude the internal iliac artery in patients undergoing endograft repairs of aortoiliac aneurysms. The use of a single device with a precise placement at the origin of the artery minimizes cost and avoids ischemic complications...|$|R

The panning with the R 2 Env resulted in significantly higher number of cross-reactive antibody clones than by using Envs from two other isolates (89. 6 and IIIB).

For several of the tested HIV- 1 primary isolates its potency on molar basis was comparable to that of T 20. It inhibited entry of primary isolates from different clades with an increased activity for cell lines with low CCR 5 surface concentrations. The m 46 neutralizing activity against a panel of clade C isolates was significantly higher in an assay based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (4 out of 5 isolates were neutralized with an IC 50 in the range from 1. 5 to 25  μg/ml) than in an assay based on a cell line with relatively high concentration of cell-surface-associated CCR 5.

40|$|AbstractCoiled coils are a {{fundamental}} emergent motif in proteins found in structural biomaterials, consisting of α-helical secondary structures {{wrapped in a}} supercoil. A fundamental question regarding the thermal and mechanical stability of coiled coils in extreme environments is {{the sequence of events}} leading to the disassembly of individual oligomers from the universal coiled-coil motifs. To shed light on this phenomenon, here we report atomistic simulations of a trimeric coiled coil in an explicit water solvent and investigate the mechanisms underlying helix unfolding and coil unzipping in the assembly. We employ advanced sampling techniques involving steered molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations to obtain the free-energy landscapes of single-strand unfolding and unzipping in a three-stranded assembly. Our comparative analysis of the free-energy landscapes of instability pathways shows that coil unzipping is a sequential process involving multiple intermediates. At each intermediate state, one heptad <b>repeat</b> of the <b>coiled</b> coil first unfolds and then unzips due to the loss of contacts with the hydrophobic core. This observation suggests that helix unfolding facilitates the initiation of coiled-coil disassembly, which is confirmed by our 2 D metadynamics simulations showing that unzipping of one strand requires less energy in the unfolded state compared with the folded state. Our results explain recent experimental findings and lay the groundwork for studying the hierarchical molecular mechanisms that underpin the thermomechanical stability/instability of coiled coils and similar protein assemblies...|$|R
40|$|Repeat {{sequences}} of approximately 100 base pairs in length {{were found in}} the rDNA ITS 2 region of Anopheles barbirostris van der Wulp (Diptera: Culicidae) species A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4, and An. campestris-like in the An. barbirostris complex. Variation in the number of repeats was observed among the five sibling species. Specifically, 10 repeats were observed in A 1, eight in A 2, A 4, and campestris-like, and three in A 3. Based on similarities in the {{sequences of}} the repeats, related repeats were classified into nine groups. Although A 2, A 4, and the campestris-like species had the same number of repeats, the ITS 2 region of the three species contained different groups of repeats. Excluding the repeat sequences facilitated good alignment of the ITS 2 region in the five sibling species. Phylogenetic analyses of the 95 isolines were compared with results obtained from mitochondrial genes (COI and COII). The results revealed marked differences among the five sibling species, particularly regarding the ITS 2 region of A 3, which was more distinct from the other four species than COI and <b>COIL</b> <b>Repeat</b> sequences in the ITS 2 region of other Anopheles species retrieved from GenBank also were analyzed. New repeat sequences were found in An. beklemishevi Stegnii and Kabanova, An. crucians Wiedemann and An. funestus Giles, suggesting that the occurrence of repeat sequences in the ITS 2 region are not rare in anopheline mosquitoes...|$|R
40|$|Together with actin {{filaments}} and microtubules, intermediate filaments (IFs) are {{the basic}} cytoskeletal components of metazoan cells. Over 80 human diseases {{have been linked to}} mutations in various IF proteins to date. However, the filament structure is far from being resolved at the atomic level, which hampers rational understanding of IF pathologies. The elementary building block of all IF proteins is a dimer consisting of an α-helical coiled-coil (CC) "rod" domain flanked by the flexible head and tail domains. Here we present three crystal structures of overlapping human vimentin fragments that comprise the first half of its rod domain. Given the previously solved fragments, a nearly complete atomic structure of the vimentin rod has become available. It consists of three α-helical segments (coils 1 A, 1 B, and 2) interconnected by linkers (L 1 and L 12). Most of the CC structure has a left-handed twist with heptad <b>repeats,</b> but both <b>coil</b> 1 B and coil 2 also exhibit untwisted, parallel stretches with hendecad repeats. In the crystal structure, linker L 1 was found to be α-helical without being involved in the CC formation. The available data allow us to construct an atomic model of the antiparallel tetramer representing the second level of vimentin assembly. Although the presence of the nonhelical head domains is essential for proper tetramer stabilization, the precise alignment of the dimers forming the tetramer appears to depend on the complementarity of their surface charge distribution patterns, while the structural plasticity of linker L 1 and coil 1 A plays a role in the subsequent IF assembly process. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Coronins are {{in general}} {{versatile}} actin filament-crosslinking and bundling proteins. In human, seven subfamilies of coronins are identified. One of these proteins found ubiquitously expressed in human tissues is CRN 2 (synonyms: coronin- 1 C, coronin- 3). Here, we study in vivo and in vitro F-actin associated properties of CRN 2. Using different GFP tagged structural domain proteins and RNAi mediated knock down of CRN 2, we studied {{the role of}} these domains in various cellular activities like wound healing, formation of protrusions, proliferation, cytokinesis and endocytosis. We found an inhibitory effect of the WD <b>repeat</b> or <b>coiled</b> coil domain of CRN 2 in specific to be profound on wound closure and formation of cellular protrusions. Screening of the CRN 2 protein sequence for posttranslational modifications resulted in identification of Ser 463 as a putative serine phosphorylation site located in the coiled coil domain. An important cytoskeleton regulator, CK 2 á kinase, was found to interact and phosphorylate this residue. The consequence of this phosphorylation is to regulate oligomerization of this domain as evident from gel filtration studies. Further, at the cellular level it induced a significant inhibitory effect on wound closure and cell protrusion as studied using a phosphomimetic S 463 D mutation. CRN 2 like other coronins interacted with the Arp 2 / 3 -complex and cofilin. In addition, both wild type and phosphomutant CRN 2 executed an inhibitory effect on Arp 2 / 3 -mediated actin polymerisation, however, this effect was more pronounced {{in the case of}} phosphomutant. Two novel CRN 2 isoforms which differ in their N-terminal length were found to arise from an alternative exon, exon 1 a, identified in intron 1. All three isoforms co-localize with and associate with F-actin. Biochemical evidence suggests that, in contrast to the conventional isoform 1 and the longer isoform 2, the largest isoform 3 exists as a monomer. Structural modelling reveals that this difference in the oligomerization state may result from an interaction of the elongated N-terminus of CRN 2 -isoform 3 with the C-terminal coiled coil. In addition, this isoform, which is expressed during the myogenic differentiation and in mature skeletal muscle tissue, was found as a novel component specifically localizing to sarcomeric F-actin {{as well as to the}} motor end plate. Further we performed a detailed study on the expression pattern of CRN 2 in human brain tumours. We found a correlation between the number of CRN 2 positive cells and the malignant phenotype in diffuse gliomas. In addition, CRN 2 knockdown glioblastoma cells exhibited significantly reduced levels of cell proliferation, motility and invasion into the extracellular matrix. Our findings provide evidence for a contribution of CRN 2 in the malignant progression of diffuse gliomas...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is of unsurpassed versatility {{in its ability to}} non-destructively probe for chemical identity. Portable, low-cost NMR sensors would enable on site identification of potentially hazardous substances, such as signatures from production of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapon agents, narcotics, explosives, toxins, and poisons. There exist however problems that need to be considered in the case of such sensors: (a) small-scale magnets produce inhomogeneous magnetic fields and therefore undesired Larmor frequency distributions that conceal much of the useful spectral information, and (b) sensitivity in most experiments decreases due to the inherently low and strongly inhomogeneous fields associated with portable instruments. Our approach is to: (a) try to improve the field of low cost magnets either with hardware (e. g. magnet design and construction of ''shim coils'') or via special pulse sequences, where the field is ''effectively shimmed'' to appear homogeneous to the sample, and (b) to use microcoils to improve sensitivity and to allow focusing in smaller regions and therefore smaller static field variations. We have been working in setting up a table top, 2 -Tesla permanent Halbach magnet system for tabletop NMR. The Spectrometer console is a Tecmag Apollo, controlled by a dell notebook. Currently an external linear chemagnetics rf amplifier is being used, though the power requirements for our system are quite low (a few Watts). The Magnetic Resonance lab in LLNL, has developed several types and sizes of microcoils, which have been proven to perform well for NMR experiments. We have evaluated an rf, 360 {micro}m O. D., microcoil probe that was built previously. We have finished mapping the magnetic field of the magnet. In the optimal position (in terms of field quality), the field inhomogeneity was at 17 ppm. Preliminary fluorine spectra with a resolved two peak separation have now been obtained. For the field, as mapped, we have initial designs of first degree shimming, or gradient coils (linear correction to the field). We have calculated ''shim pulses'' to effectively shim the mapped field, for ideal gradient coils. These calculations will be <b>repeated</b> after the <b>coils</b> will be built and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{conformable}} {{array data}} acquisition system consists of the array, the data acquisition and analysis hardware, and the data acquisition and analysis software. The following decisions {{were made in the}} development of the system. Array design decisions include the following: (a) The flexible array board will be approximately 8 by 12 inches square with the active coil section confined to a smaller 6 -inch-square section at the center of the board. The outer edges of the board will be used for switching and other circuitry. (b) The diameter of the array coils will be approximately 0. 375 inch (9. 5 mm). Data acquisition strategy includes: (a) The corrosion spots will be mapped by successive interrogations of the active section of the array board. Approximately 10, 000 samples will be acquired for each coil. The 10, 000 readings will be averaged to produce one lower-noise value for each coil. This will be <b>repeated</b> for each <b>coil</b> in the array in a sequential manner. The total corrosion image for the sector will be built from the individual coil data. (b) Corrosion larger than the operational portion of the array board will be measured using a grid technique. Uniquely identified areas in the grid will overlay a corroded area, and data collected for each area will be connected by the display and assessment software to form a composite image for the corroded area. (c) Defect assessment will be invoked on the corrosion image by ''boxing'' selected areas on the color contour map. Software decisions consisted of selecting the appropriate LABVIEW modules running in a Windows XP operating system to obtain the required functionality. This third quarterly report of the project presents the activity and conclusions reached to date. Specifically, the design of the conformable array was completed and work was started on obtaining the data acquisition hardware. Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and Clock Spring{reg_sign} staff met at the SwRI facilities in June 2003 to discuss the project. The Clock Spring representative was given the latest version of the data acquisition and analysis software for evaluation. Comments were received...|$|R
