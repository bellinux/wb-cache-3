50|$|John Davidson, {{who was a}} semi-regular {{panelist}} on {{the original}} Hollywood Squares, was chosen to host the new series. Shadoe Stevens was the announcer for the series and, beginning {{late in the first}} season, he also became a regular panelist occupying the bottom center square. After a season of <b>rotating</b> <b>center</b> squares, former Hollywood Squares panelist Joan Rivers joined the series as the permanent center square. Jim J. Bullock was the series' third regular panelist, usually in the upper-left square. The three regulars also served as guest hosts for when Davidson was unavailable; in one of those instances, for one week {{at the beginning of the}} show's final season, Stevens hosted while Bullock was the center square and Howard Stern announced. On most other occasions that Stevens was not available to announce, his brother Richard would take his place. That happened beginning on the show's 100th episode until the Friday before the final two weeks of the first season, when Shadoe returned and became a regular.|$|E
50|$|For {{the sixth}} and last season of Hollywood Squares, more changes {{were made to the}} series. First, after a season of <b>rotating</b> <b>center</b> squares, the show went back to having a {{permanent}} center square and Martin Mull was chosen to fill the role while John Moschitta, Jr. replaced Jeffrey Tambor as the announcer and Bruce Vilanch returned to the series as an occasional panelist. Second, the game format was scrapped in favor of a return to the two-out-of-three match format last seen on the NBC series in 1980. The first player to win the necessary two games won $2,000 and no consolation money was awarded if a player failed to win a game. The Secret Square was still played during the second game but the accumulating jackpot of prizes was discarded in favor of playing for one prize per match, {{regardless of whether or not}} the previous match's prize was won. Third, the change in format resulted in the show no longer being self-contained, as matches could and often did straddle episodes.|$|E
50|$|Spins are {{an element}} in figure skating where the skater <b>rotates,</b> <b>centered</b> on a single point on the ice, while holding one or more body positions. The skater rotates {{on the part of}} the blade just behind the toe pick, with the weight on the ball of the foot. There are many types of spins, {{identified}} by the position of the arms, legs, and torso, the foot on which the spin is performed, and the entrance to the spin. A combination spin is a spin with a change of position or foot. Spins are a required element in most figure skating competitions.|$|R

40|$|We revisit {{ground states}} of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates with a Rashba spin-orbit coupling, {{and find that}} votices show up as a direct {{consequence}} of spontaneous symmetry breaking into a combined gauge, spin, and space rotation symmetry, which determines the vortex-core spin state at the <b>rotating</b> <b>center.</b> For the continuous combined symmetry, the total spin rotation about the rotating axis is restricted to 2 π, whereas for the discrete combined symmetry, we further need 2 F quantum numbers to characterize the total spin rotation for the spin-F system. For lattice phases we find that in the ground state the topological charge for each unit cell vanishes. However, we find two types of highly symmetric lattices with a nontrivial topological charge in the spin- 1 / 2 system based on the symmetry classification, and show that they are skyrmion crystals.

Based on site test data, the point of tangency of the rack pitch line of the bucket rod and the pitch circle of the crowd gear were determined as the <b>rotating</b> <b>center</b> and the dynamic model of working mechanism was derived; due to the change law of the current and voltage of the hoist motor, the excavating process sections was separated from the excavating trace; log spiral model {{was chosen as the}} fitting function, and according to the following three judgment rules: maximizing soil volume in bucket, rationalizing the excavating time and minimizing the energy consumption of unit mass of soil in bucket, the optimal excavating trace was obtained and provided basis for the operation and design of the large mining shovel...|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper {{introduces}} a FE modeling effort of the lower extremity of Thor dummy, Thor-Lx Hybrid III retrofit. The FE model consists of 9, 800 nodes and 8, 300 elements, of which 2, 900 are deformable solid elements. Three kinematic ankle joint elements are respectively used to represent dorsiflexion, inversion/eversion, and internal/external rotation of the foot. In addition to kinematic joint elements which represent the initial linear resistance developed by continuous joint stop, sliding contact interfaces are also defined between neoprene rubber and <b>rotating</b> <b>center</b> blocks for the subsequent non-linear stage. This two-stage joint definition then provides the precise description of ankle joint characteristics both in loading and unloading phases. The simulated outcomes of FE model have been validated for the performance of the ankle under different rotation motions and showed good agreement with both quasi-static and dynamic test results. The second part of the paper deals with a practical application of the FE Thor-Lx model. Numerical simulations of a NCAP frontal 40 % offset crash with a small size sedan are performed. A sub-structuring scheme for isolating the occupant compartment from the full car crash simulation is then adopted in order to facilitate the parametric study in which the various levels of structural deformations are attempted. The FE model of Hybrid III 50 th percentile male upper body including knees and femurs is utilized to mount Thor-Lx and Hybrid III leg for the quantitative and comparative analyses of both legs. The Hybrid III leg mostly produces higher tibia index values than Thor-Lx due to its simple ankle joint structure which might result in steep increase of moments {{at the end of the}} range of motion. The paper concludes with the improved capabilities of Thor-Lx for the injury risk assessment compared with Hybrid III leg...|$|E
40|$|WOSInternational audienceIn {{offshore}} tubular structures, {{a typical}} tubular joint may {{be subjected to}} three different types of basic loadings: axial, in-plane bending and out-of-plane bending, through its brace members. Each type will cause a different stress distribution at the joint intersection of structures. Moreover, the actual load condition of a tubular joint can be any combination of the above three basic load cases, for this reason, a combined loading was investigated {{in addition to these}} three basic loadings. This load is composed of an axial loading combined with a continuation of rotational bending loading obtained while <b>rotate</b> <b>center</b> of the brace around a circle. Different types of planar joints such as T, Y, X, K, DT, DY, DX, TY, TK, DTX, DTDY, and DTDK, with braces subjected to combined loading, were numerically analyzed to study the effect of those different cases of loading and different types of joints, on the stress concentration zone and values...|$|R
