40|$|The subject o f {{this paper}} is the role o f {{specialized}} open-end investment funds (SFIO), which became an interesting and profitable instrument o f investment on the Polish capital market. The author’ s main intention is to present the legal regulations concerning the activity of those institutions, their offer addressed to both individuals and institutional investors and their share in the Polish investment fund market. SFIO funds operate on similar principles as open-end investment funds. However, SFIO funds in some respects differ from open-end funds, the main difference being that SFIO funds allow an indication in the charter o f formal conditions related to their participants or the conditions on which participants may request a <b>repurchase</b> <b>of</b> participation <b>units.</b> In the view or both these facts and characteristics of this part o f the Polish capital market, one may distinguish two kinds o f SFIO funds with two different groups o f participants: • funds associated with investment within the 3 'd pillar o f the Polish individual retirement system (table 1), • funds appropriative exclusively for legal persons (table 2). Considering the share of SFIO funds in the investment fund market, they take the second position after open-end funds, both in terms o f quantity and net asset value o f the funds (graphs 1 & 2). The discussion o f the past performance o f SFIO funds is accompanied by considerations of their future role for the funds market. The author suggests that because individuals are mostly interested in long-term and safe investments (both conditions are met by those funds), the role o f SFIO funds {{in this case will}} be continuously growing. As far as the interest o f institutional investors is concerned, the situation may appear the opposite. This is mainly because such investors are interested in short-term (even speculative) investments and are therefore likely to choose other capital market instruments...|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{to present}} the results of {{empirical}} studies {{on the evolution of}} abnormal rates of return on undervalued shares of Polish public companies on notice <b>of</b> planned <b>repurchases</b> <b>of</b> these securities. The study assumed a signaling hypothesis, which states that the share repurchasing may be used by managers as a tool for sending information to the market about undervaluation of these assets. This hypothesis seems to be justified in terms of signaling theory and the theory of information asymmetry. This article is divided into two main parts. The first part presents a theoretical concept of own shares, motives <b>of</b> <b>repurchasing,</b> the internal value of shares and the attractiveness rate <b>of</b> <b>repurchases.</b> The second part presents the results of empirical research on the number of buy-back programs in 2001 – 2009, and the reasons for carrying out the <b>repurchasing</b> <b>of</b> shares.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{announcement}} stock returns and long-run performance <b>of</b> 352 targeted <b>repurchases</b> from 1979 to 1998. For those <b>repurchases</b> <b>of</b> blocks that are non-control related {{we find a}} positive announcement stock price response and positive long-run stock performance indicating that these repurchases are timed to occur when the company's shares are undervalued and that the market underreacts to this signal. In contrast, for those <b>repurchases</b> <b>of</b> blocks that are control related we find a negative announcement stock price response and insignificant long-run stock performance indicating that these repurchases occur for a different reason. We conclude that control related repurchases are utilized solely to dismiss potential takeover bids and are not timed when the stock is undervalued.

40|$|<b>Repurchase</b> <b>of</b> {{shares for}} the purpose of their {{redemption}} is one of the exemptions to the general rule that forbids companies to buy their own shares back. Thus, the Polish code of commercial partnerships and companies sets out a series of restrictions for the re-acquisition of shares {{for the purpose}} of their redemption. These limitations aim at protecting the creditors and minority shareholders of a given company. If the buy-back is financed with distributable profits of the company, the precondition for the <b>repurchase</b> <b>of</b> shares is to devote the profits to this end. If the company has no distributable profits, the repurchase must follow the decision of the general meeting to reduce the legal capital. The conditions for the share buy-back are infringed by the company’s duty to return the shares to the seller. On the other hand, the shareholder who sold the shares is obliged to pay-back the price. A company repurchasing its own shares ought to comply with the rule of equal treatment of shareholders. According to the rule any unequal treatment o f shareholders is only allowed if it is clearly in the interest o f the company as a whole. After the <b>repurchase</b> <b>of</b> shares a company does not have to obtain a permission from the former shareholders to redeem them. It is assumed that a shareholder permits their redemption by selling his shares to the company...|$|R
