This computer system was developed in order to compute the different allocations to claims in Allocation problems, distribution problems and Assignment problems for real cases and {{to be used in}} education of game theory and decision problems. The system generates numerical and graphical results. It allows comparisons between the numerical results and their graphic representations.
