40|$|Surface {{exploration}} and well drilling began at Sulphurdale, Utah in 2001 after a ten-year hiatus. Electrical resistivity measurements {{were taken in}} a previously untested area west of the producing field to help identify and rank potential well sites. A 601 m well was drilled and cased to 396 m and a preliminary temperature survey run. The well has already yielded some information for comparison with geologic and resistivity models of the area. The temperature results are encouraging but not definitive. More testing is planned upon the return of favorable weather and surface access. The new well was completed without trouble and within budget in twelve days using a conventional rotary <b>rig.</b> <b>Hole</b> an...|$|R

50|$|This type of rig is {{commonly}} used in connection with oil and/or natural gas drilling. There are more jackup rigs in the worldwide offshore rig fleet than other type of mobile offshore drilling rig. Other types of offshore rigs include semi-submersibles (which float on pontoon-like structures) and drillships, which are ship-shaped vessels with rigs mounted in their center. These <b>rigs</b> drill through <b>holes</b> in the drillship hulls, known as moon pools.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{accessed}} via a 1.5 kilometre long decline, at -15%, 6.3 metres wide by 5 metres high. Underground drilling <b>rigs</b> bore <b>holes</b> in the ore face, {{which are}} charged with explosives and fired. The resultant broken ore is removed by large Load Haul Dump (LHD) machines and loaded into trucks which transport the ore to the crusher. The ore is first emptied onto 'grizzly' bars which prevent oversized material from entering the crushing chamber before being fed into the underground crusher. Approximately 6,300 tonnes of ore grade material are transported daily via a conveyor system from the mine to surface where it is stored in a covered stockpile of approximately 12,000 tonnes live capacity prior to processing in the Concentrator plant. Following various process the concentrate is then trucked south to Cork for onward shipment to various customers.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{feasibility}} of hot forging forming process for rigging joints, the numerical simulation of hot inverse extrusion forming technology of the <b>hole</b> of a <b>rigging</b> joint is analyzed with finite element method, and the formability of <b>rigging</b> joint <b>hole</b> is analyzed from both metal flow regularity and metal streamline distribution. The relationships of rigging joints under different extrusion conditions between stress field, strain field and change of grain size of the extrusion parts are studied. The extrusion technological parameters are obtained which are initial temperature of 1 100 ~ 1 150 ℃ and extrusion speed of 10 mm/s. Through finite element analysis, after forming of the hole under extrusion, the simulation {{results show that the}} distribution of metal flow line is reasonable, there is no obvious cross or fracture, the forming result is good, and the dimensional accuracy is high. So the hot inverse extrusion forming of the <b>hole</b> of the <b>rigging</b> joint is feasible...|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May 1781 the Dutch saw the British ships {{following}} them. The British opened fire and Carnbee and Oorthuys {{tried and failed to}} get one of the British ships between them. The battle then became a ship-to-ship action between the Den Briel and the Crescent in one case and the Castor and the Flora in the other. The Castor was a 23-year-old ship with low calibre guns and a maximum salvo of 372 pounds, thus proving no match for the modern Flora with its 720-pound salvo. The Castor soon became unmanageable, with her sails and <b>rigging</b> destroyed, <b>holes</b> below the waterline, five feet of water in her hold, most of her guns out of action, 30 of her 230-man crew killed and 40 wounded. Carnbee hoisted a white flag, he and his crew were taken on board the Flora and the sinking Castor was taken in tow as a prize ship.|$|R
500|$|In February 1915, Lord Nelson {{was ordered}} to the Dardanelles to {{participate}} in the Dardanelles Campaign. [...] She departed Portland on 18 February and joined the British Dardanelles Squadron at Mudros eight days later. She took part in the bombardment of the inner forts and supported the initial landings in early March. The Ottoman Turkish forts engaged her heavily on 7 March and hit her several times, including by a stone cannonball which landed on the deck and was kept as a souvenir by the Flag Officer, Arthur Baker, at Longcross Church; she suffered damage to her superstructure and <b>rigging</b> and was <b>holed</b> by one hit below the waterline which flooded two coal bunkers. After repairs at Malta, the ship returned {{to take part in the}} main attack on the Narrows forts on 18 March. Later she bombarded Ottoman field batteries on 6 May prior to the Second Battle of Krithia.|$|R
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1973, when {{engineering}} studies for a large, collidingbeam storage ring started in earnest, soil studies were begun to determine the nature of earth materials where tunneling might be undertaken. The initial ring concept, a 2100 -m oval, was investigated by drilling seventeen test holes with a truck-mounted 15 -em auger drill <b>rig.</b> These <b>holes</b> were roughly logged to determine the general nature of the site's materials, but no laboratory testing was undertaken to determine engineering characteristics. The drilling indicated a heterogeneous, unsystematic arrangement of gravels, sand, clay, claystone and shale in the upper levels, with sandstone occurring at depths 6 to 20 m below the surface. In an effort to determine systematic arrangement of the site's sedimentary deposits, the 1973 drilling program was followed by seismic refraction geophysical surveys. 40 Such surveys, by measuring velocities of seismic waves at varying depths, can indicate densities and competence of subterranean formations and can provide some indication {{of the speed of}} tunnel advances. The survey indicated that upper levels have relatively low compressional wave velocities between, 360 and 540 m per second. These are in desiccated adobe and sandy clay. Underneath these surface materials, wave velocities varied from 700 to 1000 m per second in fine-grained sandstone, shale and clay with gravel. These velocities, comparable to earlier refraction studies of SLAC materials, indicate materials having bearing values of at least 20, 000 kilograms per sq. m. Structures below these materials showed wave velocities in excess of 1500 m per second. Thus, the refraction surveys, as might be expected, indicated increasing C 0111 petence of materials with depth...|$|R

40|$|Oil and gas {{production}} {{has been a}} subject intensively emphasized during the last decade, due to its magnitude on our daily life. Invaluable amount of money is being constantly invested worldwide for research into this non-renewable resource, especially on technology and materials. For this reason, the present article aims to bring an approach to material selection for subsea, topside and down <b>hole</b> <b>rigs,</b> taking into consideration the major challenges for each side. By pointing out the major particularities of inconel, super duplex, hastelloy and their cheaper alternatives, engineers willing to deepen the material science for petroleum industry will be having a good starting point. Another aspect that {{has been linked to}} the study concerns the corrosion control of production systems. Starting with the evaluation of the parameters that affect the process, the paper states some basic measures for counteracting this destructive phenomena. Considering that all products in this branch of technology are operating under heavy duty and need to have long warranty, the authors perspective conveys the most innovative materials, almost unaffordable for batch production in other industries...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{igneous rocks}} within Amata – Lekwesi Area in Eastern Nigeria is {{believed}} to have intruded the Cretaceous Eze Aku and Asu River group shales in dyke – like and dome – like structures {{in different parts of the}} region. This study classifies the rock strength in Amata-Lekwesi area based on in-situ properties. Eleven holes were drilled to a depth ranging from 15 - 25 meters and were probed over an area of 81, 750 m 2 using Slanzi Diamond rotary <b>rig.</b> Each drill <b>hole</b> was cored continuously and samples retrieved at every 1. 50 m interval. Coring covers both the host country rock (shale and shaley carbonate) and the intrusive (where both are encountered in the same hole). Specific energy of the cored materials was determined using a standard thrust (F) and torque (T) on the rotary drill. Rock strength evaluation was therefore made based on the drill penetration rate (µ), total percentage recovery (TPR), and the rock quality designation (RQD). The results so obtained compared favourably with uniaxial compressive strength for similar rock types elsewhere _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

40|$|New bolt {{machines}} of {{the make}} and model Atlas Copco Boltec-LC has been acquired in Kristineberg mine, which also meant that a new bolting method started {{to be used in}} the mine. The old bolting method was based on a drilling <b>rig</b> that predrilled <b>holes</b> and then have another machine comes after to put the bolt in the holes. The new acquired Boltec can perform the drill-ing and put a bolt in that hole itself without a repositioning of the boom. The thesis work primary goal was to investigate if the new bolt machines can make the productiongoals of the mine by collecting and studying the data from the control center. The secondary goal in the thesis, is about studying the differences among operators and see how their approach can affect the bolt quality. The result in the issue of capacity shows that it takes two Boltec to have the same capacity as one of the old bolting machines from the old method. However, there are several factors that influenced these numbers, especially how the operators reports their work in the mine. The secondary goal of the thesis was set up after that several bolts have shown that they were not properly embedded in the rock. Therefor the quality was questioned in Kristineberg. Devia-tion in the operator's approach has not been noted, however, a theory have been created and probably the answer to why the quality of the bolts varies.
