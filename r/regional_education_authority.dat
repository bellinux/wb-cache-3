40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} study is to measure and compare the performance of Portuguese secondary schools. Some data on the schools was collected via an electronic questionnaire sent to 103 secondary schools of the Centre Region of Portugal; other needed data was available through the Centre <b>Regional</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Authority.</b> Of the 33 schools that participated in the study, there was complete data for 29. We first use a non-parametric technique, data envelopment analysis, to assess the sample of schools. Then we compare the results obtained with some preliminary results of a national evaluation programme of schools. From our findings, we tentatively conclude that most schools are following national education policy priorities relating to decreasing wastage rates and increasing completion rates. School performance {{does not seem to}} relate to geographic location, size of the school, typology of the school or rotation of its executive committee. The article concludes by discussing the need for metric benchmarking exercises of the type proposed, to inform schools, evaluators and policy decision-makers. Finally, the complementarities between metric and practice benchmarking exercises are argued for...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{case study}} in one rural {{district}} {{in the state of}} NSW in Australia with high Indigenous enrolments was initiated by the local Indigenous community and <b>Regional</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Authority</b> to directly address serious concerns they had about Indigenous completion rates in their district. The study aimed to provide the first comprehensive holistic Indigenous examination of why Aboriginal students switch off school, when this takes place, and to propose key interventions to address the problem. The study was longitudinal and followed 43 students, across two cohorts (Year 5 and 7) from six high schools, one central school and six primary feeder schools in the district over a four year period. Key informants and data were drawn from education systems (drilling down to regional level), schools and their staff, and the Indigenous parents/community from the district. The research is grounded in Indigenous Methodologies which prioritize Indigenous voices including the author’s unique perspectives as a leading Indigenous educator and his journey in the study as Indigenous researcher. It further utilises mixed-mode tools with an emphasis on qualitative data collection including over 160 interviews embracing the storied nature of Indigenous experience in their community and schools/district, alongside supporting data collected from survey and questionnaire and existing statistical databases. Outcomes from the study clearly demonstrated the diversity of Indigenous students, their backgrounds, school results and consistently strong cultural family backgrounds. Defined engagement levels were established for the case students, namely engaged, disengaged and unengaged. These levels of Indigenous Engagement (‘ie’) call for specific strategic approaches if outcomes around retention are to be significantly improved. The research further highlighted the great strength and resilience in the Indigenous community {{in the face of what}} has become a deeply entrenched problem of misrepresentation of community by the system and schools and underestimation of both Indigenous students and community, which typically has resulted in stereotypical responses from schools and their staff. The Indigenous researcher’s own journey through the study and the impact of the research on his varied, high level, Indigenous educational leadership roles provided a further layer of personal and cultural dialogue throughout the study that offered a space for continuous reflection, analysis and interpretation. Through this reflection a level of clarity emerged which is captured through a critical use of traditional ‘Rarrk’ painting analogy possibly extending Indigenous interpretive approaches and the discourse around Indigenous research method. The findings challenge the unproblematic interpretation of state level policy and opinions generated on limited or no data...|$|E

This paper is based on the field notes analysis and non-participant direct observation that took place at 20 SL during November and December 2006 and January 2007. This was the 2 nd phase, out of four, of a PhD program research for which was adopted a qualitative methodology both for data gathering and analysis techniques. In this sense, the majority of data were obtained through semi-structured interviews and field notes taken during about 4 hours of non participant direct observation to selected respondents. By the end of this research phase {{it was found that the}} most significant element in bring about improvements was the commitment and support of the school’s management board. Nevertheless, school libraries with more students coming in, more activities, larger and catalogued/classified book stock, more equipment and with better physical space, have team members with adequate training for the development of their tasks and roles. Recommendations/suggestions are given both to school management boards and the ones responsible for the development of school libraries in schools, the RBE and the <b>regional</b> <b>education</b> <b>authorities,</b> aiming at placing school libraries on the top educational priorities, therefore recognizing them as an important point of access to information for everyone...|$|R
