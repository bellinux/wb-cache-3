As no vapour-liquid equilibrium {{data are available}} for these chemicals in this mixture, new vapour-liquid equilibrium data were experimentally generated and modelled {{for use in the}} design of the batch distillation column. The data were fitted to the Peng-Robinson equation of state, utilizing the Mathias-Copeman alpha function. The model was used with the Wong- Sandler mixing rules alongside the NRTL alpha function. The model was fitted with mean relative deviations lower than 1. 2 %, indicating an acceptably accurate description of the VLE data gathered by the model. The experimental data and the model also passed the thermodynamic consistency test for all the systems and isotherms. The design simulations were completed by means of the Aspen Batch Distillation, a module of the Aspen Technologies package. The results show that the optimum design for recovering high-purity products requires six equilibrium stages in the column. The batch column should consist of a still pot, also functioning as a reboiler, a packed column section and a total condenser. The total condenser and the reboiler both count as equilibrium stages. Using this design, a TFE product purity of 99. 999 % is predicted with a recovery of 96 %. An HFP product purity of 99 % is predicted at a recovery of 68 %. The recovery of the HFP product can be increased, but entails a significant loss of product purity. The minimum column diameter required to achieve the flow rates suggested in the simulation is 29 mm. The column diameter was selectedas 1 ¼ ″ (or 31. 75 mm) on the basis of the standard pipe diameters available in the industry.

40|$|The most {{difficult}} and challenging {{area for the}} tribology of reciprocating internal combustion engines to improve efficiency and life is the lubricant health within the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack.</b> It is here where extreme temperatures, pressures and noxious gases interact with the small volume of lubricant {{designed to protect the}} components. There is a lack of knowledge of the correlation between the lubricant condition and its performance. This research is an original contribution to this field and addressed the influence of lubricant degradation on lubricant film thicknesses and residence times in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack.</b> A laser induced fluorescence (LIF) system was first implemented on an operating motored gasoline engine to examine the piston ring to cylinder wall lubricant film thickness. A bespoke optical setup was designed and developed with excellent spatial resolution incorporating an argon ion laser, operating at 488 nm, combined with photomultiplier tubes to measure reference laser and incoming fluorescent light via a sapphire window in the cylinder liner. Lubricants were doped with Pyrromethene 567 A fluorescent dye and the fluorescence signals were calibrated through a strict method, which allowed the fluorescence of degraded samples, and hence the lubricant film thickness, to be quantified. A range of degraded engine lubricant samples were acquired from Mercedes Benz, Leeds, UK and Southwest Research Institute, Texas, USA. The LIF system was then adapted and transferred to a high speed, fired Ricardo Hydra single cylinder gasoline engine. The capability of the LIF system was finally extended to examine lubricant flow in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> through a novel tracer technique, which enabled direct measurement of piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> lubricant residence time. A LIF system was developed that could clearly distinguish between lubricants of different viscosities and degradation state. It was found that degraded lubricants, with increased viscosity compared to fresh lubricant, produce thicker lubricant films in the piston ring to cylinder wall interface, which would directly impact on engine efficiency.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the liquid fuel in the intake manifold, the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> crevices and the oil film on the {{unburned}} hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of a spark-ignited, carbureted, air-cooled V-twin engine was studied. Tests were performed {{for a range of}} engine load, two engine speeds, various air-fuel ratio and with a fixed ignition timing. To isolate liquid fuel effects due to the poor atomization and vaporization of the fuel when using a carburetor, a specially conditioned homogeneous, pre-vaporized mixture system (HMS) was developed. The results from carburetor and HMS are compared. To verify the existence of liquid fuel in the manifold, and to obtain an estimate of its mass, a carburetor-mounted liquid fuel injection (CMLFI) system was also implemented. Stop-injection tests performed with the CMFLI system show that 60 - 80 cycles worth of liquid fuel is held in the intake manifold depending on operating condition. The results of the comparison show that the liquid fuel in the intake manifold does not have a statistically significant influence on the averaged HC emissions. In addition, the cycle-resolved HC emissions for both systems follow the same trends and are comparable in magnitude. Heat release analysis showed little difference between fuel mixture delivery system. These results suggest that under steady state operation the HC emissions for this engine are not sensitive to the presence of liquid fuel in the intake manifold. The <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> contribution to the engine-out HC emissions was estimated using a simplified <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> gas flow model; the model was tested against the experimentally measured blowby. The tests were performed using the homogeneous fuel mixture system. The integrated mass of HC leaving the crevices from the end of combustion (the crank angle that the cumulative burn fraction reached 90 %) to exhaust valve closing was taken to represent the potential contribution of the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> to the overall HC emissions; post-oxidation in the cylinder will consume some of this mass. Time-resolved exhaust HC concentration measurements were also performed, and the instantaneous HC mass flow rate was determined using the measured exhaust and cylinder pressure. At high load the model predicts that the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> returns approximately three times as much HC mass to the cylinder as is measured in the exhaust, indicating that the HC emissions are dominated by the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> contribution. At the lightest load condition tested, the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> model predicts less mass returning to the cylinder from the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> than is observed in the exhaust, clearly indicating that another HC mechanism is significantly contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. The integrated exhaust HC mass from the time-resolved HC measurement was found to correlate inversely with the IMEP on a cycle-by-cycle basis, which strongly suggest that incomplete combustion is materially contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. A statistical analysis showed that the correlation was significant. The intermediate load condition represents a combination of these two extremes. The ensemble-average <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> model results indicate that the mass returned to the cylinder from the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> is slightly higher than the amount measured in the exhaust. But, a conditional sampling analysis indicates that there are sub-groups, i. e. late-burning cycles, for which this is not true. There is expected to be some in-cylinder post-oxidation of the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> HC mass at this condition, and the late burning cycles were not found to excessively contribute to the HC emissions, which both strongly suggests that there are other mechanisms besides the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> that are significantly contributing to the HC emissions at this condition. The most likely mechanism is incomplete combustion. The contribution of fuel adsorption in engine oil and its subsequent desorption following combustion to the engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions was studied by comparing steady state and cycle-resolved HC emission measurements from operation with a standard full-blend gasoline, and with propane, which has a low solubility in oil. Experiments were performed at two speeds and three loads, and for different mean crankcase pressures. The crankcase pressure was found to impact the HC emissions, presumably through the ringpack mechanism, which was largely unaltered by the different fuels. The average and cycle-resolved HC emissions were found to be in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the two fuels. Further, the two fuels showed the same response to changes in the crankcase pressure. The experiments were supported by a numerical analysis. The simulation of the liquid-gas phase equilibrium of the fuel-oil system showed the solubility of propane in the oil was approximately an order of magnitude lower than for gasoline. Further the numerical analysis of the adsorption-desorption of the fuel in the oil along the cycle showed that the oil layer contribution is very small compared with the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> contribution. This suggests that the effect of fuel adsorption in the oil is not significant for small air-cooled utility-type engines...|$|R

40|$|Engine oil {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the primary interests for the automotive industry in controlling emissions and reducing service cost. Due to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of oil transport along the piston, reducing {{oil consumption}} from the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> of internal combustion engines has been extremely challenging for engine manufacturers and suppliers. This work addressed the fundamental aspects of oil transport in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> through experiments and modeling. A two-dimensional multiple-dye Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) visualization system was successfully implemented in a diesel and a spark-ignition engine. Real time high resolution images of the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> oil distribution were acquired and analyzed for the entire range of operating conditions typically encountered by passenger car engines. Based on experimental observations, major oil flow patterns in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> were identified and characterized. Physically based models were proposed to describe each individual oil transport process, such as, oil flows on the piston lands in both axial and circumferential directions and oil flows through the ring grooves and gaps. Modeling results showed good agreement with the experimental data. (cont.) Then, using the individual oil transport models, the contributions of the different oil transport mechanisms to oil flow in and between the piston regions and the effects of piston and ring designs were analyzed. Finally, a global oil transport scheme was presented by integrating all major paths and mechanisms of oil transport along the piston. It highlighted that the rate at which oil is lost to the combustion chamber is mostly determined by the competing oil transport processes occurring on the piston lands. While the effect of the inertia force results in a net oil flow toward the top of the piston, the dragging action of the blow-by gases removes oil from the piston lands and recycles it to the crankcase. This work was the first comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms of oil transport in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> of internal combustion engines. It constitutes a major step in the development of analytical tools for oil consumption reduction. by Benoist Thirouard. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Piston <b>ring</b> <b>packs</b> {{are used}} in {{internal}} combustion engines to seal both the high pressure gas in the combustion chamber and the lubricant oil in the crank case. The interaction between the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> and the cylinder bore contributes substantially to the total friction power loss for IC engines. The aim of this thesis work is to advance {{the understanding of the}} ring liner lubrication through numerical modeling. A twin-land oil control ring lubrication model and a top two-ring lubrication model are developed based on a deterministic approach. The models take into consideration the effect of both the liner finish micro geometry and the ring face macro profile. The liner finish effect is evaluated on a 3 D deterministically measured liner finish patch, with fully-flooded oil supply condition to the oil control rings and starved oil supply condition to the top two rings. Correlations based on deterministic calculations and proper scaling are developed to connect the average hydrodynamic pressure and friction to the critical geometrical parameters and operating parameters so that cycle evaluation of the ring lubrication can be performed in an efficient manner. The models can be used for <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> friction prediction, and ring pack/liner design optimization based on the trade-off of friction power loss and oil consumption. To provide further insights to the effect of liner finish, a wear model is then developed to simulate the liner surface geometry evolution during the break-in/wear process. The model is based on the idea of simulated repetitive grinding on the plateau part of the liner finish using a random grinder. The model successfully captures the statistic topological features of the worn liner roughness. Combining the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> model and the liner finish wear model, one can potentially predict the long term <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> friction loss. Finally the thesis covers the experimental validation of the twin-land oil control ring model using floating liner engine friction measurements. The modeled ring friction is compared with the experimental measurement under different ring designs and liner finishes. The result shows that the model in general successfully predicts the friction force of the twin-land oil control ring/liner pair. by Haijie Chen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Improving {{fuel economy}} of {{internal}} combustion engines {{is one of}} the major focuses in automotive industry. The piston ring friction contributes as much as 25 % of total mechanical loss in internal combustion engines [1] and is an area of great interests to the automotive industry in their overall effort to improve engine efficiency. However, typical methods to reduce friction loss from piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack,</b> such as <b>ring</b> tension reduction, may cause additional oil consumption. A compromise between reduction of friction loss and control of gas leakage and oil consumption needs to be made, which requires a deep understanding of oil transport mechanism. This compromise gives rise to the interest in modeling work. Both experimental results and previous experience showed that oil film distribution on the piston varies significantly along the circumference and the oil leakage occurs locally. Therefore to predict oil transfer across different <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> regions, one needs to integrate both global and local processes. This work is aimed at establishing an enduring framework for all the cycle-based processes at different length scales. As a first step, a multi-scale multi-physics piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> model was developed by coupling the structural dynamics of the piston rings with gas flows and local interactions at ring-groove and ring-liner interfaces. A curved beam finite element method was adopted to calculate the ring structural response to interaction between the ring and the liner as well as the ring and the groove. Compared to a traditional straight beam finite element method, the curved beam separates the structural mesh and contact grid by utilizing the shape functions. In this work, a multi-length-scale <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> model was, for the first time, successfully assembled. This model bears its fundamental values to truly reflect the integral results of all the relevant mechanisms. The significance of the current work is that it demonstrated such an integration of all the length scales is possible for a cycle model with a reasonable computation cost. With the current model, one can realistically investigate the effects of all kinds of piston and liner distortion, piston secondary motion, bridging, and lube-oil dilution on gas sealing, oil transport and lubrication. As a result, optimization of the ring designs and the part of block design contributing to bore distortion can be coordinated to reduce development costs. by Yang Liu. Thesis: Ph.

The performance of the OCR design was primarily dependent on the gap area of the ring and the variation of groove clearances. The OCR groove drain holes were also deemed a necessity. This research, though theoretical in nature, brings together many ideas that offer solutions to common problems. Radial collapse, reverse flutter, OCR cost, and the use of drainage holes all are part of the attempts to improve the piston-ring-pack performance while driving down cost of production.

Lubricating oil travels through distinct regions along the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> before being consumed in the combustion chamber, with the oil distribution and dominant driving forces varying substantially for each of these regions. This experimental work focuses on specific regions in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack.</b> A detailed 2 D LIF (Two Dimensional Laser Induced Fluorescence) study has been performed on the oil distribution observed with the LIF generated real time high-resolution images, as were changes in piston and ring design. The results reveal the third land, located between the second compression ring and the oil control ring, oil flow patterns and timing are consistent and predictable at each operating point. Speed and load variation alter the basic flow pattern and oil balance through a corresponding change in inertia and gas dragging effect respectively, with ring design variation instigating specific and repeatable phenomenon onto the consistent oil flow pattern.

The impact of speed and load were experimentally changes were found to {{have a significant impact on}} inertia driven oil transport; however, their effects on oil consumption were not as clear. As the majority of lubricating oil consumed in the engine crosses the third land at some point, an understanding of the timing and magnitude of the oil transport processes will allow means to be specifically developed to reduce the net oil flow across the third land(cont.) towards the combustion chamber. This work forms a foundation for developing oil control strategies for the third land and for identifying how and when oil reaches the upper piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> regions that directly contribute to oil consumption. The ability to control, or impact, oil transport on the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> will have an impact on all engine classes, including engines in the maritime community. This experiment study is directly comparable to small marine engines, and can be used to help reduce maritime exhaust emissions related to lubrication consumption; additionally, this approach would be much more rugged and cost effective then other current technological improvements being investigated. Were a similar 2 D LIF experiment to be performed on large slow speed diesel engifes, the annual savings per vessel, assuming only a 10 % reduction in lube oil consumption was achieved, could amount to $ 30, 000 as cylinder lube oil is one of the most expensive operating costs for large slow speed diesel engines. by Adam Vokac.

40|$|The {{nonuniform}} abrasion {{failure and}} high-temperature thermal failure of <b>packing</b> <b>rings</b> {{have a significant}} influence on compressor reliability, particularly that of oil-free compressors. In this study, a test rig was constructed to measure the dynamic temperature of <b>packing</b> <b>rings</b> under different operational conditions in an oil-free reciprocating compressor. The dynamic axial and radial temperature distributions of the <b>packing</b> <b>rings</b> were obtained using an innovative internal temperature testing device that kept the thermocouples and packing box relatively static during compressor operation. A three-dimensional heat transfer model was also developed to analyze the temperature distribution of the packing boxes, piston rod, and cylinder during such operation. Good agreement was observed between the simulation results and experimental data, which showed an average relative error of less than 2. 35 %. The {{results indicate that the}} pressure ratio exerts a significant effect on the axial temperature distribution and determines which <b>packing</b> <b>ring</b> reaches the maximum temperature. They also show the average temperature to rise with an increase in the rotational speed and to fall with an improvement in the external cooling conditions.

40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} to study engine oil vaporization and oil vapor transport in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> of internal combustion engines. With {{the assumption that the}} multi-grade oil can be modeled as a compound of several distinct paraffin hydrocarbons, a set of equations governing the oil vapor density variations were derived by applying the mass conservation law to the amount of oil vaporized from the piston and the amount of oil vapor transported within the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack.</b> The model was applied to a heavy-duty diesel engine. First, the case with the maximum oil supply to all the piston regions was studied and the results showed that, under this condition, the oil consumption from vaporization alone was far greater than the typical oil consumption value measured in the engine. Then, to show the contribution of oil vaporization to oil consumption and the dependence of vaporization on oil supply to different regions, different lubrication conditions for the high temperature regions of the piston were studied. Finally, a liquid oil transport model was integrated with this oil vaporization model in order to investigate the change of oil composition on the crown land with each engine cycle and the contribution of liquid-phase oil and vapor-phase oil to the total oil consumption under a fixed liquid oil supply rate to the crown land. by Yeunwoo Cho.

The performance of this column fitted with 5 spray nozzles was compared with a column packed with 1 / 8 th in. Dixon <b>rings</b> (<b>packing</b> depth = 1480 mm). More detailed experiments were then performed in the column <b>packed</b> with Dixon <b>rings</b> at: liquid flows from 4 to 8 dm 3 min− 1; gas flows 18 and 36 N dm 3 min− 1, column pressures = 1 and 4 bar(g); column temperatures approximately 5 and 17 °C. In general, CO 2 removal increased as column operating pressure was increased, or fluid temperature was decreased. When approaching low gas outlet CO 2 levels {{at the top of}} the column (e. g. 0. 1 vol%), the concentration of carbonate species in the tap water (fed into the column) restricted further improvements in the performance of the column.

40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} reduction {{of more than}} 20 % can be achieved through engine friction reduction. Piston and piston rings contribute {{approximately half of the}} total engine friction and are therefore central to friction reduction efforts. The most common method to reduce mechanical losses from piston rings has been to lower ring tension, the normal force providing sealing between the piston ring and the cylinder liner. However tension reduction can result in additional lubricant consumption. The objective of this thesis is to understand and model the physical mechanisms resulting in flow of oil to the combustion chamber in order to achieve optimal designs of piston rings. The optimal design is a compromise between friction reduction and adequate gas and lubricant sealing performance. To do so a multi-scale curved beam finite element model of piston ring is developed. It is built to couple ring deformation, dynamics and contact with the piston and the cylinder. Oil flow at the interfaces between the ring and the cylinder liner and between the ring and the piston groove can thus be simulated. The piston ring model is used to study the sealing performance of the Oil Control Ring (OCR), whose function is to limit the amount of oil supplied to the <b>ring</b> <b>pack.</b> The contributions of the three main mechanisms previously identified, to oil flow past the OCR are quantified: - Deformation of the cylinder under operating conditions can lead to a loss of contact between the ring and the liner. - Tilting of the piston around its pin can force the OCR to twist and scrape oil from the liner. - Oil accumulating below the OCR can flow to the groove and leak {{on the top of the}} OCR The OCR is found to be flexible enough to limit the impact of cylinder deformation on oil consumption. Both ring scraping and flow through the OCR groove can contribute to oil consumption in the range of engine running conditions simulated. Reduction of scraping is possible by increasing the ability of both OCR lands to maintain contact with the liner regardless of piston groove tilt. The flow of oil through the OCR groove can be reduced by designing appropriate draining of oil in the groove and an adequate oil reservoir below the OCR. The piston ring oil transport model developed in this thesis will be a valuable tool to optimize <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> designs to achieve further <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> friction reduction without increasing oil consumption. by Camille Baelden.

The automotive industry is subject to increasing pressure to reduce the CO emissions and improve fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines. Improvements may be achieved {{in a number of}} ways. The parasitic losses throughout the engine cycle emanate from friction in all engine contact conjunctions in addition to pumping losses. In particular one main contributory conjunction is the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> assembly. At low engine speeds, the contribution of friction to the total losses within the engine is increased significantly compared with the thermodynamic losses. Additionally, the sealing capability of the ring is crucial in determining the power output of the engine with any loss of sealing contributing to power loss, as well as blowby. Most reported studies on compression ring-cylinder conjunction do not take into account complex ring in-plane and out-of-plane elastodynamics. Hitherto, {{there has not been a}} numerical methodology which integrates tribology of an elastic compression ring, subject to modal behaviour in a coupled solution. This paper discusses the inclusion of transient ring elastodynamics of the top compression ring, interacting with blowby effects within the <b>ring</b> <b>pack.</b> The <b>ring</b> dynamics methodology is briefly highlighted for both in-plane and out-of-plane motions. In addition, a one-dimensional gas flow model that captures blowby behaviour is included. A case study is presented, using measured engine data. Gas flow and frictional losses at various engine speeds are predicted. The effect of gas blowby on the ring's tribological response can be ascertained, as well as the ring's dynamic motion within its retaining groove. Copyright © 2014 SAE International...|$|R
