5|$|Following the {{announcement}} on August 24, {{the provincial government}} and MTO set out to design new signs. The signs were erected and unveiled on September 7, and include a smaller <b>reassurance</b> marker (shield), {{as well as a}} larger billboard version.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, rumination {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside <b>reassurance,</b> explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Dean Winchester (Ackles) being chased through a forest by a hellhound; as it mauls him, he awakens from his dream. His brother, Sam (Padalecki), {{tells him that}} Bobby has devised a way to locate Lilith, but unconvinced that it will succeed, Dean {{suggests}} he live {{up the rest of}} his time. Sam insists that he will be saved, but Dean feigns <b>reassurance</b> as he hallucinates a demonic-looking Sam.|$|E
5000|$|High anxiety: Because the <b>reassurances</b> {{given by}} {{hospital}} personnel were not effective pre-operatively, there aren’t any real <b>reassurances</b> available to aid {{with the stress}} stimuli that are subsequently encountered.|$|R
5000|$|Low anxiety: The {{defenses}} of denial and other <b>reassurances</b> that {{were created to}} ward off the worry and apprehension preoperatively are not effective long-term. When all the pain and stress is experienced post-operatively, the emotional tension is unrelieved because there aren’t any real <b>reassurances</b> available from the pre-operational stage.|$|R

5|$|The goal of {{his policy}} was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe. The settlement reached {{would give the}} Kremlin sufficient <b>reassurance</b> against the establishment of regimes in Eastern Europe hostile to the Soviet Union, tempering the degree of control over that area that the Soviet leaders {{felt it necessary to}} exercise.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Washington {{unveiled}} a new numbering system for highways. Concurrencies with state primary state highways would be repealed in 1970 and US410 {{would be a}} non-concurrent highway. On June20, 1967, US12 was extended west from Lewiston, Idaho, over White Pass to Aberdeen, eliminating most of the original route of the highway. The remaining sections were split amongst other routes. The segment from Elma to Olympia became State Route8 (SR8). Interstate5 (I-5) took the Olympia–Tacoma segment, and the Tacoma–Naches segment became SR410. The last <b>reassurance</b> markers for US410 were taken down by December 1967.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is not necessary. Education {{is an important}} part of any treatment plan, and explanation and <b>reassurance</b> alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E

50|$|When David VIII {{required}} <b>reassurances</b> {{from the}} Mongols, {{in the shape}} of promises and hostages, Kutlushah provided his own sons together with the sons of other Mongol princes, and brought the Ghazan's ring. These <b>reassurances</b> help establish more confident relations between the Georgians and the Mongols, as the Georgians were key in maintaining the northern defenses of the Il-Khan realm against the Golden Horde.|$|R
5|$|With {{war with}} Germany now a reality, Menzies sent Richard Casey to London to seek <b>reassurances</b> about the defence of Australia {{in the event}} that Australian forces were sent to Europe or the Middle East. In November, Australia and New Zealand were given <b>reassurances</b> that Singapore {{would not be allowed to}} fall, and that in the event of war with Japan, the defence of the Far East would take {{priority}} over the Mediterranean. This seemed possible as the Kriegsmarine, the German navy, was relatively small and France was an ally. Bruce, now Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and Casey met with British Cabinet ministers on 20 November and left with the impression that, despite the <b>reassurances,</b> the Royal Navy was not strong enough to deal with simultaneous crises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East.|$|R
5|$|On 11 July 2012, {{the show}} {{producer}} Christer Björkman advised the public {{not to buy}} tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead to wait for tickets to be released through official channels. Björkman said that official tickets {{had not yet been}} released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made. Björkman also gave <b>reassurance</b> that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, some may be made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|Purring {{may have}} {{developed}} as an evolutionary advantage {{as a sign}}alling mechanism of <b>reassurance</b> between mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr {{as a sign of}} contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. The cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound. It was, until recent times, believed that only the cats of the Felis genus could purr. However, felids of the Panthera genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, and leopard) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling.|$|E
5|$|The letter M in {{the state}} highway numbers is an {{integral}} part of the designation and included on the diamond-shaped <b>reassurance</b> markers posted alongside the highways. The state's highways are referred to using an M-n syntax as opposed to Route n or Highway n, which are common elsewhere. This usage dates from 1919, when Michigan's state trunklines were first signed along the roadways, and continues to this day in official and unofficial contexts. Michigan is one of only two states following this syntax, the other one being Kansas.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of Tourette's focuses on identifying {{and helping the}} individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require pharmacological treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and <b>reassurance</b> may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, {{can be divided into}} those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.|$|E
5|$|As a {{circular}} highway, M-185 has no specific termini; the generally accepted {{starting point is}} at the mile0 marker {{placed in front of}} the Mackinac Island State Park Visitor Center. The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage; these signs are erected by the MISPC, as MDOT does not install the standard state highway <b>reassurance</b> markers along this roadway. M-185 is one of only three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands; the others are M-134 on Drummond Island and M-154 on Harsens Island. No part of M-185 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Over a half million people travel along the trunkline in a year.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed <b>reassurance</b> {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E

5|$|In the four-armed form, a {{right hand}} holds a parashu (axe) and another makes an abhaya mudra (gesture of <b>reassurance),</b> {{or one of}} the right arms is {{slightly}} bent and rests on the head of Shiva's bull mount, Nandi, while the other is held in the abhaya mudra gesture. Another configuration suggests that a right hand holds a trishula (trident) and another makes a varada mudra (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through <b>reassurance</b> of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E
5|$|On Bennett's third trip, from January to March 1842, {{in which}} he also visited Kassel, Dresden and Berlin, he played his Caprice for piano and orchestra, Op. 22, in Leipzig. Despite his then-pessimistic view of music in England, Bennett missed his chance to {{establish}} himself in Germany. The musicologist Nicholas Temperley writes One might guess that the early loss of both parents produced in Bennett an exceptionally intense need for <b>reassurance</b> and encouragement. England could not provide this for a native composer in his time. He found it temporarily in German musical circles; yet, when the opportunity came to claim his earned place {{as a leader in}} German music, he was not quite bold enough to grasp it.|$|E

60|$|As I stole {{about the}} battlements towards the--gallows, I {{was about to}} write--the sergeant-major, perhaps {{doubtful}} of my resolution, kept close by me, and occasionally proffered the most indigestible <b>reassurances</b> in my ear. At last I could bear them no longer.|$|R
5|$|Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted <b>reassurance</b> {{that the}} {{character}} would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol Loop {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} highway {{running through}} Lansing that was commissioned on October 13, 1989. It forms a loop route off I-496 through downtown near the Michigan State Capitol complex, home of the state legislature and several state departments. However, unlike other business loops in Michigan, it has unique <b>reassurance</b> markers—the signs that serve as regular reminders of the name and number of the highway. It is known internally at MDOT as Connector496 for inventory purposes. The highway follows a series of one-way and two-way streets through downtown Lansing, directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings. Unlike the other streets downtown, the seven streets composing the Capitol Loop are under state maintenance and jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Doggett {{wakes up}} and discovers that he now has a third eye {{in the middle of}} his forehead. Suddenly, it vanishes. At the FBI building, he talks to Skinner, hoping for <b>reassurance.</b> He expresses his fear that, despite Tipet being in a coma, Tipet may still be able to enter into his dreams. Skinner, however, dismisses his {{concerns}} and sends him home. While leaving, Doggett has a hallucination of Tipet, ordering him to kill Scully. Suddenly, Doggett finds himself in front of Scully. Rather than kill his partner, he turns the axe upon himself. Doggett is immediately awakened from his dark reverie and finds himself in his bedroom, with Scully standing over his bed. He begins to thank her for saving his life, but she informs him that Tipet died due to his coma.|$|E
50|$|Whether by {{informal}} deal {{or simply}} <b>reassurances</b> already {{in line with}} Hayes's announced plans, talks with Southern Democrats satisfied the worries of many. This prevented a Congressional filibuster that had threatened to extend resolution of the election dispute beyond Inauguration Day 1877.|$|R
50|$|The 2002-03 {{season was}} a financially {{difficult}} {{one with the}} playing and management staff going weeks without payment {{at one point in}} the season. This even forced O'Shaughnessy to resign out of principle during this time. Fortunately, he returned after <b>reassurances</b> were given.|$|R
50|$|Both the House of Representatives and the Senate {{rejected}} Crittenden's proposal.
