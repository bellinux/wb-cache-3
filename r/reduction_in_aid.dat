Four days after Pearl Harbor, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States, drawing the country into a two-theater war.

50|$|In the past, {{especially}} during the Cold War and the War on Terror under the Bush administration, there was the perceived notion that Republicans were more pro-Pakistani than Democrats. However, that trend reversed itself from 2011 onwards. Since then, {{there has been an}} increasing anti-Pakistani sentiment among Republican congressman which has alienated some Pakistani-Americans. Some Republican presidential candidates have criticised the democrats policy toward Pakistan. During the 2012 Republican Party presidential debates, the Republican candidates ganged up on Pakistan and questioned whether the United States could trust it. Texas governor Rick Perry called Pakistan unworthy of US aid because it had not done enough to help fight al-Qaeda. In the same year a bill was introduced by Dana Rohrabacher in the US House of Representatives proposing a hefty <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>aid</b> to Pakistan. President Obama has vowed to veto any proposed anti-Pakistan bills. President Obama also courted the Pakistani-American community for votes and money for his 2012 re-election campaign.

Federal formulas implicitly tax {{the amount of}} financial aid students are eligible to receive {{by as much as}} 50 cents for each marginal dollar of income. This tax creates an incentive for college students to reduce income, though abstruse formulas and the timing of financial aid receipt are likely to limit responses. Using data from a national sample of financially independent college students in the United States, I do not find that students bunch below earnings protection thresholds in a manner that would indicate attempts to avoid reductions in financial aid in total or grants specifically. Moreover, I do not find evidence that implicit income taxes predict lower earnings in a manner that suggests that students meaningfully reduce earnings in response to the tax.

Another equilibrium outcome can be low aid and strong institutions. Their model encompasses such diverse experiences as those of Tanzania and the Republic of Korea. When the development community ignores aid's effect on institutions, the outcome depends greatly on initial conditions.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{official}} development assistance (ODA) to Tanzania {{and its impact on}} economic growth and poverty reduction. Although there has been much debate about the relationship between foreign aid and economic development, in Tanzania's case, econometric analysis shows a significant dependence of GDP growth on ODA flows. On the other hand, ODA has not had much impact on poverty reduction, despite the efforts made by donors and the Tanzanian government to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Overall, ODA has been beneficial to the country's economic growth, but only because other factors — implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, increase in foreign direct investment (FDI), stable political and economic environment — were also present. In order to underline the importance of ODA, this paper also presents the impact of FDI, trade, and remittances on Tanzania's economic development, and concludes that, by comparison, ODA has been the most influential factor in the country's recent growth. It is argued that due to the ongoing financial crisis and the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>aid</b> flows, the Tanzanian government needs to look at other sources of financing — public-private partnership, external borrowing, increased domestic revenue — in order to improve investment rate and eventually graduate from aid...|$|E

At the same time the international financial crisis of 2008 has weakened both Europe and America ideologically, as well as in terms of their comparative international power based on their economic strength. For many states this has meant a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>aid</b> budgets, making it more likely that the influence of non-OECD donors, including China, will continue to grow.
