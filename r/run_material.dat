60|$|The {{thoughtful}} {{will not}} throw this war-paper of mine lightly aside as being valueless. It has this value: it is a not unfair {{picture of what}} went on in many and many a militia camp in the first months of the rebellion, when the green recruits were without discipline, without the steadying and heartening influence or trained leaders; when all their circumstances were new and strange, and charged with exaggerated terrors, and before the invaluable experience of actual collision in the field had turned them from rabbits into soldiers. If this side of the picture of that early day has not before been put into history, then history has been to that degree incomplete, for it had and has its rightful place there.

30|$|Intuition {{and some}} simple {{calculations}} {{show that in}} this model the appeal of fines to the firms and other “populist” policies increases relative to their appeal in a setting where anger plays no role (that is λ =  0). To illustrate, imagine that a policy with wage w and transfer T >  0 to the firm is slightly better in terms of total welfare (in a standard model with no anger) to the policy (w, T =  0). In the model with anger, when consumers are angry, the second policy that “beats on the firm” is preferred, since it reduces the amount of anger. This {{is an example of}} a policy that looks bad in a standard model (a bad “populist” policy), but that is potentially welfare enhancing when emotions are taken into account. Although we don’t claim that all of the bad Argentine policies are driven by attention to emotions, we believe that there is at least some truth to the idea that policies that are bad for long <b>run</b> <b>material</b> growth may be optimal when workers (or consumers more generally) are angry at certain business sectors.|$|E
30|$|In the {{literature}} surveyed, the routing and scheduling {{were related to}} each other. Some studies assumed that routing is input and they investigated the scheduling problem. On the other hand, some studies assumed that the periods are the input, and they investigated the routing problem. However, other studies such as (Emde & Boysen 2012 a) studied the routing and scheduling together. According to (Kilic et al. 2012), the periods in train routes scheduling can be fixed or variable. Emde & Boysen (2012 a) showed that the variable periods are optimal for reducing inventory costs. However and {{from the point of}} view of lean manufacturing, it is better to standardize the system by fixing the periods. Some studies even considered fixed periods as a must to call the system as milkrun such as (Bozer and Ciemnoczolowski 2013). Moreover, (Hanson and Finnsgård 2012) presented a real case study in which the time period of the tugger train was constant.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} {{the effect of a}} pre-exercise meal with different glycemic index (GI) on plasma IL- 6 concentration and glucose metabolism during sub-max exercise (endurance performance <b>run).</b> <b>Material</b> : Ten men completed 1 h running at 70 %- 75 % VO 2 max on a level treadmill on three occasions. In each trial, one of the three prescribed beverages as meal, i. e. high GI and low GL or placebo was consumed by the subjects 45 min before exercise. Blood samples were collected before, after, 1 h and 24 h after exercise. Result: Concentration of Plasma IL- 6 in LGI group was less than HGI and Pla groups, IL- 6 tended to significantly increase after exercise in groups (all P < 0. 05), also there was significant difference for plasma IL- 6 concentration between placebo and low glycemic groups in after exercise (P=. 003) and 1 hour after exercise (P=. 005). CK was significantly elevated at all- time points after exercise in 3 groups (all P < 0. 05). Concentration of serum CK in LGI group was less than HGI and Pla groups but there not significantly. The consumption of the LGI beverage before exercise could minimize the increasing of plasma IL- 6 concentration immediately after exercise and during the 1 h recovery period compared with the HGI beverage and Pla. Conclusion: This result suggested that the LGI beverage consumed as pre-exercise meal could modify the inflammatory response in prolonged exercise...|$|E

40|$|The present book {{relies on}} various editions of my earlier book "Nonlinear Economic Dynamics", first {{published}} in 1989 in the Springer series "Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems", and republished in three more, successively revised and expanded editions, as a Springer monograph, in 1991, 1993, and 1997, and in a Russian translation as "Nelineynaia Economicheskaia Dinamica". The first three editions were focused on applications. The last was differ­ ent, as it also included some chapters with mathematical background mate­ rial -ordinary differential equations and iterated maps -so as to make the book self-contained and suitable as a textbook for economics students of dynamical systems. To the same pedagogical purpose, the number of illus­ trations were expanded.

40|$|International audienceAbstract “Stone runs” is the Falklands vernacular {{term for}} {{openwork}} boulder accumulations, which include extensive blockstreams like the famous Darwin “stone-river” and associated {{features such as}} stone stripes. Since the early 20 th century, they have been interpreted {{as the product of}} a suite of periglacial processes, including frost-wedging, gelifluction, frost heave, frost-sorting and snowmelt runoff. Following a literature review, the results of recent field investigations of the valley-floor blockstreams of East Falkland are presented. Access to the internal structure of these forms provides evidence for the existence of a three-fold profile, with clear vertical size gradation presenting striking similarities with an inverted weathering profile. Micromorphological analyses, SEM, XRD, thin sections and grain-size analyses lead to the hypothesis of an alternative model of stone run formation. It is suggested that the material forming the stone run profile lato sensu (including the superficial pavement) is not of periglacial origin, but derives directly from the stripping and accumulation downslope of a regolith, possibly Tertiary in age and formed under subtropical or temperate conditions. The valley-floor stone runs should, therefore, be considered as complex polygenetic landforms that may have formed according to a six-stage scenario, including in situ chemical weathering, regolith stripping by mass movements, soil formation, further regolith stripping, downslope accumulation and matrix washing-out (all phases possibly achieved by the Early Quaternary). Periglacial reworking of the stone <b>run</b> <b>material</b> would have operated at a “final” stage, i. e. during Quaternary cold stages, with boulder bioweathering and limonite-staining operating during the temperate intervals including the present one. The suggested antiquity of the Falklands blockstreams is in accordance with Caine's pioneer interpretation of Tasmania blockfields and with recent analyses and cosmogenic datings of blockfields from Scandinavia and North America...|$|E
40|$|Alkaline {{rocks and}} carbonatites, {{including}} nepheline syenites, are well established as mantle-derived magmatic products, but {{the nature and}} location of their mantle sources is debated. Some workers have used isotopic compositions to infer mixed mantle plume type sources such as EM 1, HIMU, and FOZO, implying derivation from the subcontinental asthenosphere. Other models favour an entirely lithospheric source, whereby the magmas, originally formed during intracontinental rifting, became deformed and subducted into the mantle lithosphere during later continental collisions, and constituted part of a source component for later rift-related alkaline and carbonatite magmatism. We tested this model using Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic compositions of deformed and undeformed nepheline syenites and carbonatites from three occurrences in southern Africa, representing emplacement over a ~ 1 Ga time span. These include Bull’s Run, South Africa (1134 Ma); Tambani, Malawi (726 Ma); and the Chilwa Alkaline Province, Malawi (130 Ma). Mixing modelling indicates that the isotopic compositions of the early Cretaceous Chilwa samples can be accounted for if their source consisted of a blend of ~ 99 % depleted subcontinental mantle lithosphere and ~ 0. 5 %– 1 % of a subducted component similar to the Neoproterozoic Bull’s Run nepheline syenites. We do not consider the Bull’s <b>Run</b> <b>material</b> specifically as the component involved in the Chilwa source, but our model illustrates {{an example of how}} recycled, older, alkaline magmatic rocks can contribute to the mantle sources of younger alkaline rock and carbonatite magmatism. This model accounts for the observation of recurrent alkaline rock and carbonatite magmatism over hundreds of millions of years in spatially restricted areas like southern Africa. Carbonatite and related alkaline magmatic rocks, therefore, need not owe their origin to deep, sublithospheric melting processes...|$|E

40|$|Master project report. The {{hydraulic}} {{efficiency of the}} river Araranguá will be increased by the construction of jetties {{at the mouth of}} the river. The river tends to migrate from south to north which decreases the {{hydraulic efficiency}} and causes flooding upstream during events of high discharge. To stop the migration the construction of jetties at the mouth of river Araranguá is proposed. A design for a jetty system is available (INHP, 1993), but should be updated. Due to the construction of a jetty system longshore sediment transport will be interrupted and this will cause morphological changes. At Araranguá river a large and highly varying longshore sediment transport is present with a high energy wave climate and micro tidal range. These conditions cause increased morphological changes when constructing a jetty system. The objective of this research is to design a jetty system that prevents flooding upstream and induces as less morphological changes as possible. The jetty should be designed at the specified location, using available datasets from previous research and according to modern design standards. Also navigation through the channel should be possible. The channel width and depth are determined by navigational and morphological purposes and are 120 m and 6 m respectively. A weir jetty, which has been implemented in the SW arm of the design, was considered the best sediment bypass system after a multi criteria analysis. Because of the placing of the deposition basin waves could penetrate much further in the jetty channel and lengthening the NE arm to 630 m and a depth of 6, 6 m was necessary. The length of the SW arm of the jetty from the previous is kept at 650 meter to a depth of 7, 2 meter. The final result of the structural design is a statically stable rubble mound breakwater with granite as construction material. Rock has been applied in the range of 0, 4 m (170 kg) to 1, 0 m (2, 7 tons) in diameter, with a core of quarry <b>run</b> <b>material.</b> In sections where the required rock mass exceeded the threshold value for economical construction (2, 7 t), tetrapods have been applied to stabilize the slope. Tetrapods have been applied of 6, 6 and 9, 7 tons. The total use of material is about 42. 000 tons of tetrapods and 490. 000 tons of granite rocks. Overtopping requirements determine the crest freeboard and 0, 3 meter is added for post construction settlement. The crest width depends on construction considerations. All other dimensions are directly related to the stone size and weight, which are dependent on the design wave heights. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
