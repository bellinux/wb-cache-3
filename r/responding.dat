5|$|Another related form of {{experiment}} is the double-task experiment, {{in which a}} subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while <b>responding</b> to linguistic stimuli; this kind {{of experiment}} {{has been used to}} investigate the use of working memory in language processing.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. <b>Responding</b> to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. <b>Responding</b> to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E

25|$|The vehicle <b>responds</b> to the PID query on the CAN {{bus with}} message IDs {{that depend on}} which module <b>responded.</b> Typically the engine or main ECU <b>responds</b> at ID 7E8h. Other modules, like the hybrid {{controller}} or battery controller in a Prius, <b>respond</b> at 07E9h, 07EAh, 07EBh, etc. These are 8h higher than the physical address the module <b>responds</b> to. Even though the number of bytes in the returned value is variable, the message uses 8 data bytes regardless (CAN bus protocol form Frameformat with 8 data bytes).|$|R
5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune {{response}} by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects. Immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} cyclosporin prevent T cells from <b>responding</b> to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.|$|E
5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium <b>responding</b> to a local sugar gradient is <b>responding</b> to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not <b>responding</b> appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5000|$|In a Go/No-Go {{paradigm}} {{participants are}} told to <b>respond</b> with their right or left hand according to a specific feature of a presented target.

For the No-Go part, subjects {{are told to}} only <b>respond</b> to the hand-referenced feature based on some other feature of the target. For example, they may be instructed to not <b>respond</b> if the letter is a vowel. Trials consistent with instructions to <b>respond</b> are [...] "Go" [...] trials, and trials consistent with instructions to not <b>respond</b> are [...] "No-Go" [...] trials.|$|R
