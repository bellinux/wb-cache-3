40|$|Middleburg Ferro-Chrome (MFC), {{a company}} in Samancor Chrome, {{commissioned}} a new Ferro-Chrome smelter in March 2009. This is a 60 MW DC-arc furnace with a DC power supply for the smelting of Transvaal chromite ore fines. With the benefit of 12 years experience with this technology while operating a 44 MW DC-arc furnace, MFC mitigated all known challenges and considered up scaling risk in the new plant, which had a rapid ramp up to full power in Q 2 of 2009. Good operating practices, as made possible by robust equipment selection, including a thyristor <b>rectifier</b> <b>set</b> of proven technology, and operation with optimal slag chemistry, leads to a safe and effective plant operation. With the optimized furnace design and a correctly sized power conditioning system, using only standard (static) harmonic filters and a correctly sized smoothing reactor, the arc furnace is not a ‘dirty load ’ for the utility, staying well within IEC limits for power quality. A patented Arc Compensation system is installed and allows for full arc position control (to compensate for magnetic field induced arc deflection) so that a symmetrical crucible is maintained, significantly benefitting refractory life. The principle benefits gained from the MFC process {{is the fact that}} ore fines are processed, without metallurgical coke, and higher chrome recoveries are achieved compared to other smelting technologies when using a DC open arc for smelting. ...|$|E

5000|$|Specially {{designed}} selenium rectifiers {{were once}} widely used as EHT <b>rectifiers</b> in television <b>sets</b> and photocopiers. A layer of selenium {{was applied to}} a sheet of soft iron foil, and thousands of tiny discs (typically 2mm diameter) were punched out of this and assembled as [...] "stacks" [...] inside ceramic tubes. Rectifiers capable of supplying {{tens of thousands of}} volts could be made this way. Their internal resistance was extremely high, but most EHT applications only required a few hundred microamps at most, so this was not normally an issue. With the development of inexpensive high voltage silicon rectifiers, this technology has fallen into disuse.|$|R
50|$|Selenium {{rectifiers}} {{are made}} from stacks of aluminum or steel plates coated with about 1 μm of bismuth or nickel. A much thicker layer of selenium (50 to 60 μm) which has been doped with a halogen is deposited {{on top of the}} thin metal plating. The selenium is then converted into polycrystalline gray (hexagonal) form by annealing. Each plate is able to withstand about 20 volts in the reverse direction. The metal squares, or disks, also serve as heat sinks in addition to providing a mounting place for the selenium disks. Plates can be stacked indefinitely to withstand higher voltages.

40|$|Piezoelectric-device-based {{vibration}} energy harvesting requires a rectifier for conversion of input ac to usable dc form. Power loss due to diode drop in rectifier {{is a significant}} fraction of the already low levels of harvested power. The proposed circuit is a low-drop-diode equivalent, which mimics a diode using linear region-operated MOSFET. The proposed diode equivalent is powered directly from input signal and requires no additional power supply for its control. Power used by the control circuit is kept at a bare minimum to have an overall output power improvement. Diode equivalent was used to replace the four diodes in a full-wave bridge rectifier, which is the basic full- wave rectifier and {{is a part of}} the more advanced rectifiers like switch-only and bias-flip rectifiers. Simulation in 130 -nm technology and experiment with discrete components show that a bridge rectifier with the proposed diode provides a 30 - 169 % increase in output power extracted from piezoelectric device, as compared to a bridge rectifier with diode-connected MOSFETs. The bridge rectifier with the proposed diode can extract 90 % of the maximum available power from an ideal piezoelectric device-bridge <b>rectifier</b> circuit. <b>Setting</b> aside the constraint of power loss, simulations indicate that diode drop as low as 10 mV at 38 mu A can be achieved...|$|R
5000|$|The {{envelope}} detector {{is a very}} simple method of demodulation that {{does not require a}} coherent demodulator. It consists of an {{envelope detector}} that can be a rectifier (anything that will pass current in one direction only) or other non-linear component that enhances one half of the received signal over the other and a low-pass filter. The rectifier may be {{in the form of a}} single diode or may be more complex. Many natural substances exhibit this rectification behaviour, which is why it was the earliest modulation and demodulation technique used in radio. The filter is usually an RC low-pass type but the filter function can sometimes be achieved by relying on the limited frequency response of the circuitry following the <b>rectifier.</b> The crystal <b>set</b> exploits the simplicity of AM modulation to produce a receiver with very few parts, using the crystal as the rectifier and the limited frequency response of the headphones as the filter.|$|R
50|$|A {{rectifier}} and {{a filter}} capacitor were connected directly to the mains. If the mains power was AC, the rectifier converted it to DC. If it was DC, the rectifier effectively acted as a conductor. When operating on DC, the voltage available was reduced by the voltage drop across the rectifier. Because an AC waveform has a voltage peak that {{is higher than the}} average value produced by the <b>rectifier,</b> the same <b>set</b> operating on the same root mean square AC supply voltage would have a higher effective voltage after the rectifier stage. In areas using 110-120 volt AC, a simple half-wave rectifier limited the maximum plate voltage that could be developed; this was adequate for relatively low-power audio equipment, but television receivers or higher-powered amplifiers required either a more complex voltage doubler rectifier or warranted the use of a power transformer with a conveniently high secondary voltage. Areas with 220-240 volt AC supplies could develop higher plate voltage with a simple rectifier. Transformerless power supplies were feasible for television receivers in 220-240 volt areas. Additionally, the use of a transformer allowed multiple independent power supplies from separate transformer windings for different stages.|$|R
40|$|Small, {{one to a}} few horsepower, {{three-phase}} induction {{machines with}} three sets of electrically-isolated, magnetically-coupled stator winding circuits are described. A voltage inverter is developed and used to drive one set of the machine stator winding circuits. The second set of machine stator winding circuits is connected to a three-phase rectifier in which a path for zero-sequence current is provided from the winding circuits to the <b>rectifier.</b> The last <b>set</b> of stator winding circuits is connected to another three-phase rectifier, however, the stator circuit star point is floating, not providing a zero-sequence current path. By controlling the phase of the third harmonic on the machine drive stator circuits, and thus the waveforms present on the secondary and tertiary stator winding circuits, the output voltage of the rectifier with a zero-sequence current path can be tune above or below the rectifier output without third harmonic injection. The rectifier connected without a zero-sequence current path does not display this tunability with respect to third harmonic phase. by Jack Wade Holloway. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} distortion on the electrical distribution {{system for a}} high voltage DC Integrated Power System (IPS). The analysis was concentrated on the power supplied to a propulsion motor driven by an inverter with simulated silicon carbide switches. Theoretically, silicon carbide switches {{have the advantage of}} being able to withstand a very large blocking voltage and carry very large forward currents. Silicon carbide switches are also very efficient due to their quick rise and fall times. Since silicon carbide switches can withstand high voltage differentials and switch faster than silicon switches, the switching effects on the electrical distribution system were investigated. The current state of silicon carbide power electronics was also investigated. This research quantifies the current and voltage distortion over various operating conditions. A system model was developed using Matlab, Simulink, and SimPowerSystems. The model consisted of a synchronous generator supplying a <b>rectifier</b> and inverter <b>set</b> driving an induction motor. This induction motor simulates the propulsion motor for a Navy ship.

40|$|This master thesis was {{executed}} at the Department of Electrical Power Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The thesis was initiated {{to establish and}} evaluate an alternative model representation of the facility at Ormen Lange. Traditionally, a PQ-model {{has been used to}} represent Ormen Lange. This thesis, however, has implemented three two-terminal dc line models (converter models) to represent the facility. The first part of the thesis starts with an overall introduction to the basic principles of configuration, operation and control of HVDC systems. The objective of this part is to provide an overview of the HVDC technology which is treated in detail later in the thesis. The software tool 9 ̆ 3 Power System Simulator for Engineering 9 ̆ 4 (PSS/E) was used for both power flow and dynamic simulations performed in this thesis. The second part of the thesis describes the power flow establishment, and constitutes the basis for both power flow and dynamic simulations. The main focus in this part is the modeling of the two-terminal dc line model which is implemented at Nyhamna. Data for the two-terminal dc line model is presented on three consecutive data records. Since these data enables not only power flow analysis but also establishes the initial steady-state for the dynamic analysis, a detailed description is presented in this section. The latter data is based on technical information provided by ABB and default values in PSS/E. The third part of the thesis presents the power flow simulations. The objective of this part is to gain knowledge about the performance of the two-terminal dc line model implemented at Ormen Lange. This knowledge facilitates the understanding of the following dynamic simulations. Two cases were studied to simulate the action of the converter control system when exposed to a depression in rectifier bus voltage. In the first case the rectifier transformer tap settings were adjustable. In the second case the rectifier tap settings were locked to its initial value. The purpose of locking the tap setting was to represent a transient situation where the tap changer action is too slow and hence not considered. The result showed that with adjustable rectifier tap settings, the depression in rectifier bus voltage is handled by reducing the rectifier transformer tap position and firing delay angle. This increased the voltage on the valve side of the rectifier transformer and enabled the rectifier to maintain dc current control. Consequently, the scheduled dc values were unaffected by the depression in rectifier bus voltage. However, with the <b>rectifier</b> tap <b>setting</b> locked, the transformer did not boost the voltage on the valve side of the rectifier transformer. This caused the control logic to reduce the rectifier firing delay angle to its minimum, and the inverter assumed control of the dc current. With the inverter in control of the current, the scheduled dc current was reduced by a fraction equal to the current margin along with the remainder dc values. Hence, the presence of an adequate <b>rectifier</b> transformer <b>setting</b> is essential for the two-terminal dc line model to maintain scheduled dc values during voltage depression. All simulations showed that a voltage depression at the rectifier bus leads to a reduction in rectifier reactive power consumption. This is due to the action from the control logic which reduced the rectifier firing delay angle to counteract the voltage depression. The greatest reduction in rectifier reactive consumption was experienced when the rectifier firing delay angle was reduced to its minimum value. Hence, in situations with depressed bus voltage, the latter operation of the converter control logic causes the two-terminal dc line model to exhibit less stress to the ac system than the PQ-model. The fourth part of this thesis contains {{a detailed description of the}} dynamic modeling of the two-terminal dc line model (CDC 4 T). Many of the chosen parameters are based on an example in [15], and do not necessary represent realistic values. The final part of this thesis presents the dynamic simulations. The objective of this part is to analyze the control actions of the CDC 4 T model under normal regulation and during temporary overriding the normal regulation. This was performed by introducing ac system faults which depressed the rectifier bus voltage to a varying degree. Further, this part analyzed the consequence of using the dynamic model CDC 4 T to represent Ormen Lange instead of a PQ-model. The purpose was to determine whether the response from the ac system differs when using the CDC 4 T model instead of a PQ-model. It is important to emphasize that this part does not evaluate stability issues associated with the implementation of CDC 4 T. The results from the dynamic simulations showed that CDC 4 T exhibited an instantaneous response to changes in rectifier ac voltage. This is because CDC 4 T is a pseudo steady-state dynamic model which omits the L/R dynamic of the dc system and high frequency firing angle controller dynamics. Further, the results revealed an important characteristic of the CDC 4 T model. After fault clearance, the rectifier bus exhibited small voltage fluctuations. The rectifiers compensated these fluctuations by adjusting their firing delay angles correspondingly. Consequently, the latter resulted in fluctuations in reactive power consumption. This means that the ac system perceives the CDC 4 T model as a varying reactive load following fault clearance. Comparing the ac system response when using the CDC 4 T model and when using the PQ-model, the results showed that the main difference was CDC 4 T 9 ̆ 2 s generation of reactive power fluctuations. These fluctuations were experienced in the transmission line going into Nyhamna and Viklandet, and were substantial compared to the initial loading of the transmission lines. Two arguments were used to substantiate why the response from the CDC 4 T model only differs from the PQ-model in terms of reactive power fluctuations: I. The calculated value of the short circuit ratio at Nyhamna indicated a strong interconnected ac/dc system. II. The dynamic behavior of the pseudo-steady state model, CDC 4 T, is limited. Both the L/R dynamic of the dc line, smoothing reactors and high frequency controller dynamics are omitted. In further studies where converter modeling at Ormen Lange is considered, a more complex dynamic dc model should be utilized to represent the converters. This model should include L/R dynamic of the dc system and high-speed controller dynamics, and will thus influence the ac system to a greater extent than CDC 4 T. Further, the model establishment should focus on achieving a sufficiently realistic load representation of Ormen Lange. In this manner, the converters 9 ̆ 2 influence on system stability can be evaluated...|$|R
