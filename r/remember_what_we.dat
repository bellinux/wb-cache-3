500|$|With {{the great}} Union {{victory at the}} Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and {{the defeat of the}} Copperheads in the Ohio {{election}} in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the New York City draft riots. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863. Defying Lincoln's prediction that [...] "the world will little note, nor long <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> say here", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.|$|E

Having been deprived of her power by Wesley, she is drawn to Bete Noire as a potential source for not only becoming what she was before, but even achieving her previous status. <b>Remember,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> see of her in Angel is not her true appearance."

[Footnote 19: Observe, {{we are not}} {{speaking}} of emotions felt on <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ourselves have enjoyed, for then the imagination is productive of pleasure by replacing us in enjoyment, but of the feelings excited in the indifferent spectator, by the evident decay of power or desolation of enjoyment, of which the first ennobles, the other only harrows, the spirit.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah; {{but tell}} me the truth. <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> said as we parted,--about being friends. One tells one's friend the real truth. But I suppose you do not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> said?" ...|$|E

There is no sense in our talking of leaving town, {{at least until the}} Britishers have quieted down. We must carry the Tory into the loft again, and say to {{ourselves}} that we are held prisoners in the village of York even as he is in this cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mary, {{the time}} to shake hands has not yet come; that you must know very well. You did not say in your letter {{what you had to}} tell me, but only that you had {{something}} to tell me; <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> parted in anger about, and knowing that you know how deeply I feel on that subject, I naturally concluded that you wished to see me about it. I do not wish to be trifled with." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Always {{something}} like that. Always. I heard an old mate tell Captain Colchester once {{that it had}} come to this with him, that he was afraid to open his mouth to give any sort of order. She was as much of a terror in harbour as at sea. You could never be certain what would hold her. On the slightest provocation she would start snapping ropes, cables, wire hawsers, like carrots. She was heavy, clumsy, unhandy--but that does not quite explain that power for mischief she had. You know, somehow, when I think of her I can't help <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> hear of incurable lunatics breaking loose now and then." ...|$|R

5000|$|The bliss {{point for}} salt, sugar, or fat is a range within which {{perception}} {{is that there is}} neither too much nor too little, but the [...] "just right" [...] amount of saltiness, sweetness, or richness. The human body has evolved to favor foods delivering these tastes: the brain responds with a [...] "reward" [...] {{in the form of a}} jolt of endorphins, <b>remembers</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did to get that reward, and makes us want to do it again, an effect run by dopamine, the neurotransmitter. Combinations of sugar, fat, and salt act synergistically, and are more rewarding than any one alone. In food product optimization, the goal is to include two or three of these nutrients at their bliss point.|$|R

Over fifteen years of laboratory and field research that has led us to conclude that better office lighting delivers benefits to individuals, their employers, and the environment. We now ask how we might apply this knowledge {{to the development of}} LED lighting systems. Our past research focused on the benefits of individual workstation control over light levels. LED lighting systems offer the potential to add individual or automatic color tuning of light source spectrum. We have begun to study these effects on office occupants, finding that there is a broad range of preferred light source spectra and a desire to have this feature. Adding innovative features will enhance the attractiveness of LED technology, speeding uptake and achieving sustainability sooner. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
