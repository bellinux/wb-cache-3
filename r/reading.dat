5000|$|... == <b>Read</b> length == Sequencing {{technologies}} vary in {{the length}} of <b>reads</b> produced. <b>Reads</b> of length 20-40 base pairs (bp) {{are referred to as}} ultra-short. Typical sequencers produce <b>read</b> lengths in the range of 100-500 bp. However, Pacific Biosciences platforms produce <b>read</b> lengths of approximately 1500 bp. <b>Read</b> length is a factor which can affect the results of biological studies. For example, longer <b>read</b> lengths improve the resolution of de novo genome assembly and detection of structural variants. It is estimated that <b>read</b> lengths greater than 100 kilobases (kb) will be required for routine de novo human genome assembly. Bioinformatic pipelines to analyze sequencing data usually take into account <b>read</b> lengths.|$|R
