40|$|ABSTRACT. Among {{the various}} {{artificial}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>markers</b> (mainly from atmospheric nuclear tests), the contamination from the Chernobyl accident {{has been found}} at five sampling sites on Northern Hemisphere glaciers. Total beta-activity measurements reveal a very high radioactive level. However, due to the short time of its occurrence, the temporal resolution of this event in the snow layers can be generally quite low and positive results require careful sampling. The size of the signal also depends on the trajectory of the contaminant cloud, the amount of precipitation, and the surface conditions during deposition...|$|R

50|$|Developments since ca. 2000 in IMC (e.g. massively {{parallel}} instruments, real-time, computer-based storage {{and analysis of}} heat flow data) have stimulated further use of IMC in cultured cell biology. For example, IMC has been evaluated for assessing antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation (Murigande et al. 2009) and revealed aspects of proliferation not seen using a conventional non-continuous <b>radioactive</b> <b>marker</b> assay method. IMC has also been applied {{to the field of}} tissue engineering. One study (Santoro et al. 2011) demonstrated that IMC could be used to measure the growth (i.e. proliferation) rate in culture of human chondrocytes harvested for tissue engineering use. It showed that IMC can potentially serve to determine the effectiveness of different growth media formulations and also determine whether cells donated by a given individual can be grown efficiently enough to consider using them to produce engineered tissue.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>marker</b> can either take place in vivo or in vitro.In the in vivo method, stannous (tin) ions are injected into the patient's bloodstream. A subsequent intravenous injection of the radioactive substance, technetium-99m-pertechnetate, labels the red blood cells in vivo. With an administered activity of about 800 MBq, the effective radiation dose is about 8 mSv to 12 mSv.In the in vitro method, some of the patient's blood is drawn and the stannous ions (in the form of stannous chloride) are injected into the drawn blood. The technetium is subsequently added to the mixture as in the in vivo method.In both cases, the stannous chloride reduces the technetium ion and prevents it from leaking out of the red blood cells during the procedure.The in vivo technique is more convenient {{for the majority of}} patients since it is less time-consuming and less costly and more than 80 percent of the injected radionuclide usually binds to red blood cells with this approach. Red blood cell binding of the radioactive tracer is generally more efficient with the in vitro labeling, and it is preferred in patients with indwelling intravenous catheters to decrease the adherence of Tc-99m to the catheter wall and increase the efficiency of blood pool labeling.|$|E
50|$|Axonal {{transport}} methods use {{a variety}} of dyes (horseradish peroxidase variants, fluorescent or <b>radioactive</b> <b>markers,</b> lectins, dextrans) that are more or less avidly absorbed by neurons or their processes. These molecules are selectively transported anterogradely (from soma to axon terminals) or retrogradely (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain. These 'physiologic' methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons. Detailed synaptic connections can be determined by correlative electron microscopy.|$|R

40|$|The {{reactions}} of polioviruses in single-radial-immunodiffusion (SRD) tests were investigated {{with a view}} to developing accurate and sensitive antigen assay systems. In direct SRD tests, employing high concentrations of immune polio-virus serum in agarose gels, poliovirus D-antigens produced clear reaction zones demonstrated by protein staining. The reactions were type-specific forpolioviruses of types I, 2 and 3 but the tests were of low sensitivity, being applicable only to the assay of virus concentrates. A novel autoradiographic zone size enhancement (ZE) test was developed which increased the sensitivity of the SRD assay 40 - to Ioo-fold. The ZE test was depen-dent upon the ability of unlabelled poliovirus to co-migrate with the <b>radioactive</b> <b>marker</b> virus and so enhance the zone size detected autoradiographically. Theareas of the autoradiographic zones were directly proportional to the concentration f unlabelled antigen. The ZE test was capable of detecting poliovirus D antigens in diluted cell culture fluid harvests in amounts corresponding to IO 3. 3 to Io 4 " 8 TCIDs 0 of infectious virus.
