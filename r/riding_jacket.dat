5000|$|English sidesaddle {{classes are}} based on style and norms found in the hunt field from 100 years ago. Dress, appointments, riding style, and even the type of horse used are all judged against a formalized {{standard}} for an [...] "ideal" [...] appearance. The riding habit in such classes is the formal attire found in the hunt field, starting with a coat and apron. The apron used {{is based on the}} open-sided safety apron developed in the late 19th century. The rider wears ordinary breeches or jodhpurs, over which she will wear the apron, which can partially open in the back. The jacket is usually cut a bit longer than a standard <b>riding</b> <b>jacket.</b> A vest, shirt, choker or stock tie, gloves, boots and riding breeches are similar to those used when riding astride. For classes on the flat, a derby or top hat is traditional. When jumping, however, tradition gives way to safety and most riders use a modern equestrian helmet, which is often mandatory equipment in competition rules.|$|E

Cueca dancing resembles a rooster-chicken relationship. The man approaches the woman and offers his arm, then the women accompanies him and they walk around the room.

50|$|The cult of {{personality}} primarily existed among the Soviet masses; {{there was no}} explicit manifestation of the cult {{among the members of}} the Politburo and other high-ranking Party officials. However, Stalin had a notoriously low tolerance for dissent within the Party; as such, the fear of backlash from Stalin made Party officials hesitant to honestly express their viewpoints, especially during the Stalinist show trials of 1937 and 1938. This atmosphere of fear and self-censorship created the illusion of undisputed government support for Stalin, and this perceived support further fueled the cult for the Soviet populace. Although it was not an official uniform, party leaders throughout the Soviet Union emulated the dictator's usual outfit of dark green <b>jacket,</b> <b>riding</b> breeches, boots, and a cap to prove their devotion.|$|R

40|$|Pask to the Future In 1979, I helped {{welcome the}} British cyberneticist, Gordon Pask, to Montréal. He {{stood out from}} the crowd, {{sporting}} a powder blue <b>riding</b> <b>jacket,</b> derby, and the mandatory English brolly. Over lunch, he animatedly expounded on his ideas of educational cybernetics, knocking the wine onto the table and his p-soup into his lap. After clearing the collateral damage, we carried on to the Concordia University TV studio to record his presentation on conversation theory. Whether due to the audience, the lights, or the lunch, the talk quickly disintegrated into a disjointed ramble and was never edited into a final program. Gordon stayed in Montréal for a few years, building prototypes of conversationally linked documents and sharing his philosophy of serialist versus holist learning styles in well-lubricated graduate seminars. Unfortunately, his ability to express his ideas was severely limited by the technology of the day, his confusing notational system, and the spirits of Montréal.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the Zheng organization, which flourished from 1625 to 1683, {{during a time}} when the Ming-Qing transition in China intersected with the formation of an integrated early modern economy in maritime Asia. This quasi-governmental commercial enterprise reached the apex of its power under Zheng Chenggong (1624 - 1662), and his son and successor Zheng Jing (1642 - 1681). From bases along the southeastern Chinese coast and Taiwan, they relied upon overseas commerce to maintain a sustained resistance against the Manchus, who had taken over most of China in 1644 from the collapsing Ming, the ethnic Chinese dynasty to which both men had pledged their support. Like their fiercest competitor, the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the organization protected the safety and property of Chinese subjects abroad, engaged in armed trade, and aggressively promoted overseas expansion. Zheng Chenggong and Jing proved far more successful and profitable at these endeavors than the VOC. In 1662, shortly before his death, Chenggong even defeated and expelled the company from its colony of Taiwan, and opened the island for Chinese colonization and settlement. Yet, operating within an imperial world order that looked upon overseas contact of any form as a potential source of political instability, the Zhengs, lacking "native" maritime sources of legitimacy, had to receive recognition for their authority from continental centers of power. Father and son skillfully utilized the ranks and titles from the Ming Yongli pretender to rule over territory, develop a civil bureaucracy, and sign treaties with foreign powers, functioning essentially as an autonomous "state. " Moreover, by successfully intermediating between continental and maritime Chinese cultural discourse, they forged a complex social unit of traders, militarists, and Ming imperial descendants and loyalist elites. However, this ambiguous arrangement, which gave the organization maximum autonomy and flexibility, came under threat due to the gradual consolidation of Qing rule. Chenggong's successor, Zheng Jing, turned away from Ming symbols of authority on Taiwan during the 1660 s, and tried to institutionalize a new identity based upon Han Chinese customs and Confucian moral values on an island considered by contemporaries to be geographically and culturally outside of "China. " In negotiations with the Qing court, he pressed hard for the emperor to recognize Taiwan as a tributary kingdom along the lines of Korea. The talks broke down, however, over ethnic identity, as Zheng insisted upon keeping his Han Chinese long hair and flowing robes, while the Qing ruler ordered him to shave his head and wear tight <b>riding</b> <b>jackets</b> in the Manchu style. Despite the failure of negotiations, Zheng took significant steps toward articulating a distinct Han Chinese state. He traded extensively, signed a commercial treaty with the English East Indies Company, and nearly launched an invasion of the Spanish Philippines. However, his return to China to participate in the Rebellion of the Three Feudatories (1674 - 1681) ruined his organization and {{paved the way for the}} Qing invasion and occupation of Taiwan in 1683, two years after his death. This project moves beyond the standard Confucian trope of the Zhengs as ardent Ming loyalists or the Western narrative of ruthless pirate entrepreneurs, extreme discourses later appropriated to serve different nationalisms. Instead, the two men should be viewed as both the initiators and products of a dynamic and internally generated East Asian modernity within an interdependent economic and cultural region that nonetheless enjoyed significant interactions outside the system. Such an approach imbues maritime China with agency and revises the role commonly attributed to it as a marginalized appendage of its bureaucratic and agrarian continental counterpart. An examination of interstate relations unique to this East Asian world region also allows one to conceive of communities beyond the nation-state, and make sense of their identity formation and change, especially when combined with shifts in spatial settings...|$|R
