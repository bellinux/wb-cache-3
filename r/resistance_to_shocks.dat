40|$|We analyse the {{resilience}} of UK regions to employment shocks. Two basic notions of resilience are distinguished. With engineering resilience, there is an underlying stable growth path to which a regional economy rebounds following a shock. With ecological resilience, shocks can permanently affect the growth path of the regional economy. Our data set consists of quarterly employment series for 12 UK regions (NUTS I) for the period 1971 - 2010. Using a SUR model specification, we test for the relevance of (engineering) resilience of UK regional employment to the 4 recessionary shocks in our sample. It turns out that UK regions do indeed differ in their resilience, but that these differences mainly concern the initial <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> {{and not so much}} the recovery stage. The SUR model does not allow shocks to have permanent effects and it also does not take the possibility of time differentiated shock spillovers between the 12 regions into account. To this end, we also estimate a VECM specification where employment shocks can have permanent effects and where also inter-regional employment linkages are included. We find that employment shocks typically have permanent effects when it concerns the own region effects. Permanent effects can also be found for the impact on other regions but the inter-regional effects are typically only significant for nearby regions...|$|E
40|$|In 2000 the Basle Committee on the Global Financial System defined {{stress testing}} as 'a generic term {{describing}} various techniques used by financial firms to gauge their potential vulnerability to exceptional but plausible events'. Exceptional events refer to one-off or recurring events with far-reaching {{consequences for the}} concerned financial institution and the financial sector s stability overall. Such unexpected (exceptional) events include, for instance: bankruptcy in Argentina in 2001, stock markets collapse ('Black Monday') on 19 October 1987, or {{the fall of the}} energy giant Enron in 2001. The adoption of the new Basle Accord (better known as Basle II) in 2001 envisaged the implementation of stress tests for the identification of events and future changes in economic circumstances that could cause some unfavorable effects on banks' credit exposure, along with the assessment of banks' ability to survive in the new circumstances. Negative experiences from the past, having undermined the stability of financial systems worldwide, made a decisive impact on regulators at all levels to additionally consider the issue of increasing the financial system's resistance to the occurrence of unexpected - exceptional events. To this end, the introduction of stress tests was the turning point in the process of increased banking systems' <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shocks.</b> This paper primarily deals with stress testing methodology and bank risk measurement techniques, along with the main results of conducted tests, directly impacting the entire financial system...|$|E

40|$|Upflow {{anaerobic}} {{sludge blanket}} reactors may offer {{a number of}} advantages over conventional mixed-tank, SBR, and biofilm reactors, including high space-loading, low footprint, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> and toxins. In this study, we assessed the use of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor technology as applied to anaerobic ammonia removal, or Anammox. Four 200 ml UASB reactors were inoculated with 50 % (by volume) anaerobic granular sludge and 50 % flocular sludge from different sources (all {{with the potential for}} containing Anammox organisms). Tools used to assess the reactors included basic analyses, fluorescent in-situ hybridisation, and mathematical modelling, with statistical non-linear parameter estimation. Two of the reactors showed statistically identical Anammox activity (i. e., identical kinetic parameters), with good ammonia and nitrite removal (0. 14 kgNH(x) m(- 3) reactor day(- 1), with 99 % ammonia removal). The third reactor also demonstrated significant Anammox activity, but with poor identifiability of parameters. The fourth reactor had no statistical Anammox activity. Modelling indicated that poor identifiability and performance in the third and fourth reactors were related to an excess of reduced carbon, probably originating in the inoculum. Accumulation of Anammox organisms was confirmed both by a volume loading much lower than the growth rate, and response to a probe specific for organisms previously reported to mediate Anammox processes. Overall, the UASB reactors were effective as Anammox systems, and identifiability of the systems was good, and repeatable (even compared to a previous study in a rotating biological contactor). This indicates that operation, design, and analysis of Anammox UASB reactors specifically, and Anammox systems in general, are reliable and portable, and that UASB systems are an appropriate technology for this process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the problem of thermal and {{mechanical}} shocks, which rising during operation, mostly at interrupted cut. Here will be solved their impact on the cutting edge tool life, the impact of coating technology on <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> and experimental determination of tool life in heating flame. Resistance of removable cutting edges against thermal and mechanical shock is an important indicator of quality as well as its abrasion resistance. Breach of the edge or its crumble may occur due to cyclic loading. We can observe it not only during the interrupted cutting (milling, turning areas abandoned hole or slot), but also in continuous cutting. This is due to the volatility of cutting force on cutting. Frequency of the volatility in this case depends on the type of rising chips (chip size element). For difficult-to-machine materials such as austenitic steel particularly happened at higher cutting speeds for the localization of plastic deformation in the shear plane and for the inception of separate elements substantially continuous chips. This leads to variations of cutting forces substantially greater than for other types of steel. During the uninterrupted cutting the cutting edge is cyclically loaded due to period oscillation of the cutting force main component. The frequency is given by the character of shaving element size [1]. Experiments have shown that during cutting of hard to machine materials with higher cutting speeds, for example austenitic steel, plastic deformation occurs in the shearing plane, in which the elements of continuous shaving are removed. This leads to large variations in the cutting force in these types of steels under the given cutting conditions. The amplitude of the main cutting force component in comparison with a different type of steel is shown on the fig. 1 to illustrate characteristics of a fatigue failure, abrasive wear and cutting edge crumbling away...|$|E
