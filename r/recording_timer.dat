40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the {{individual}} needs of consumers for recording TV programs in some different ways, an improved scheme is presented to implement Personal Video Recorder (PVR) function in Android set-top box (STB). As for live TV programs, there are three alternative ways which are continuous <b>recording,</b> <b>timer</b> recording and time-shifting recording being designed. As for TV programs in the future, the way of scheduled recording is designed. Namely, monitor task in the background is checked by the updating of Time and Date Table (TDT) in accordance with Electronic Program Guide (EPG) information. The results show that this scheme is effective and feasible, and it enriches the interface function between TV and consumers. </p...|$|E
25|$|An eight-day Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) is {{available}} and allows viewers to see programme descriptions and broadcast times well in advance. PVRs will {{make use of}} this facility allowing <b>recording</b> <b>timers</b> to be set. This Eight-Day EPG was not an original feature of the Digital Terrestrial system, therefore some early receivers, such as receivers originally made to operate with the ONdigital service, will only display details of 'now and next' programme information.|$|R
50|$|TAPs are {{applications}} written {{using an}} API available {{free from the}} manufacturer. The API provides access to almost all features of the device: TAPs can access EPG information, change channels, start or stop a recording session, change pre-set <b>recording</b> <b>timers,</b> write text and draw graphics to the screen, and react to buttons pressed on the remote control. It is possible to write a useful program, adding useful functionality, in ten lines of C code.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{improvements}} included VOX <b>recording</b> facilities, <b>timer</b> <b>recording,</b> dithering, 192 kHz {{sampling rate}} support {{and most importantly}} a [...] "Live Feed-through mode" [...] was added which enabled a multifilter to perform a record restoration on the fly often required for radio broadcasting. Changes were also made to the functionality of the continuous noise filter whereby new inflexion points could be added to better match the FFT filter curve {{to that of the}} sampled noise in order to facilitate its removal without producing digital artifacts.|$|R

50|$|Other {{features}} include a built-in photo-only camera, video viewing, Java support, a speakerphone, MP3/MIDI ringtones, a USB connection for computer syncing, a built in modem for providing Internet access to computers, animated wallpapers, sound <b>recording,</b> a <b>timer,</b> task manager, stopwatch, phone book, games and notes.|$|R
50|$|Several {{problems}} exist {{with regard}} to on-screen displays. One of them is diagnostics if a television's display system is damaged. Without any external screens, {{it is almost impossible}} (without opening the TV) to determine the source of the error. TV accessories that depend heavily on OSDs, such as VCRs or DVD players, are also difficult to configure without the use of a TV. On older VCRs, it was possible to program <b>recording</b> <b>timers</b> without turning on the TV; a modern VCR requires the user to turn on the TV to do so. Usability is generally also decreased with OSDs, as it is necessary to control a multitude of parameters with a few buttons, where earlier, real analog controls with mechanical feedback were available.|$|R
30|$|The {{impedance}} {{trajectory of}} this case is shown in Fig.  4. According to the figure, after power swing initiation, impedance moves toward distance zones so that it crosses the CPSB {{for the first time}} and then the <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> the traveling time between outer and inner zones. Therefore, power swing can be detected by comparing the recorded time with threshold value and then distance relay is blocked. As a consequence of power swing, impedance trajectory moves back and gets away from the distance zones and so leaves the outer zone of CPSB. Next a three-phase fault occurs at t[*]=[*] 0.85 [*]s during power swing. This causes the impedance trajectory crosses CPSB again during fault and so a new travelling time is <b>recorded</b> by <b>timer,</b> which can be used for detecting fault individually. Hence, traditional CPSB can detect both power swing and fault during power swing in this case.|$|R
50|$|By 1986, Shintom {{began to}} market its {{own brand of}} VHS players/recorders lineup and other {{electronic}} devices to compete with other makes, along with industry's first 2-week, 6-event <b>timer</b> <b>recording.</b> A new North American headquarter opened in United States as Shintom West Corp. of America located in Torrance, CA. Shintom's original advertisement consisted of industrial-design, ruggedness, and simplicity without the high cost.|$|R
5000|$|Accurate Recording (AR, {{equivalent}} to PDC) - programmes are recorded based on {{signals from the}} broadcaster rather than scheduled time. (Since {{this is based on}} signals from the broadcaster, the broadcaster can prevent recording by sending nonsense signals as a form of copy protection, as already happens on music channels. However, this can be circumvented by specifying a <b>timer</b> <b>recording</b> instead of a programme recording or by connecting the receiver to a traditional videocassette recorder.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Nintendo 3DS Camera" [...] is a {{built-in}} photo and video recorder with an integrated media gallery and photo editing functionality. The app uses the system’s two front-facing cameras to take 3-D photos, and the user-facing camera to take regular 2-D photos. All photographs are taken at {{a resolution of}} 640 × 480 px (VGA), or 0.3 megapixels. In addition to manual <b>recording</b> controls, <b>timers</b> can be set to take a photo three or ten seconds after pressing the [...] "Take" [...] button, or by means of voice commands such as saying [...] "OK!" [...] when wishing to take a photo. SD Cards can hold up to about 3,000 photos. Because photo data size can vary, the number may be reduced by two, or it may not decrease at all.|$|R
500|$|The {{timing of}} the race was questioned, as the {{official}} clock malfunctioned and the official <b>timer</b> <b>recorded</b> a result slower than that recorded by clockers for the Daily Racing Form, who maintained that Secretariat had set a record. The dispute was not resolved until 2012, when newer technology allowed for a forensic review of the videotapes and an accurate calculation of the actual time, which was formally recorded as 1:53, a record time for the race still standing [...]|$|R
40|$|The data {{recorder}} {{has at least}} one sensor unit for determining at least one parameter to be recorded during a monitoring period. A control unit, preferably a microprocessor, controls the detecting and <b>recording.</b> A <b>timer</b> prepares a reference time, on the basis of which the actual measuring time can be determined. A storage unit is provided for storing the determined parameters and preferably also stores the reference time prepared for each measuring value by the timer. A battery unit supplies power, and a fixing unit is provided to secure the {{data recorder}} at an article to be monitored. An interrupting unit interrupts the measuring operation, as soon as the fixing unit is manipulated. USE - Also for measuring humidity, air pressure, sound levels, radioactivity or chemical or biological substances. ADVANTAGE - Data recorder is substantially protected against manipulation...|$|R
40|$|Summary. What is {{the nature}} of the human timing mecha-nism for perceptual judgements about short {{temporal}} in-tervals? One possibility is that initial periodic events, such as tones, establish internal beats which continue after the external events and serve as reference points for the per-ception of subsequent events. A second possibility is that the <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> the intervals produced by events. Later, the stored intervals can be reproduced or compared to other intervals. A study by Schulze (1978) provided evi-dence favoring beat-based timing. In contrast, our two ex-periments upport an interval theory. The judgements of intervals between tones is not improved when the events are synchronized with internal beats established by the ini-tial intervals. The conflict between the two sets of results may be resolved by the fact that an interval timer can recy...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that a strand burner is an apparatus that provides burning rate measurements {{of a solid}} propellant at an elevated pressure {{in order to obtain}} the burning characteristics of a propellant. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the facilities developed by author that was used in the author’s studies. The low pressure strand burner has a mounting stand that allows the propellant strand to be mounted vertically. The strand was ignited electrically using hot wire, and the burning time was <b>recorded</b> by electronic <b>timer.</b> Wire technique was used to measure the burning rate. The burning rate characteristics of solid propellant have be evaluated over five different chamber pressures ranging from 1 atm to 31 atm. Preliminary results from these techniques are presented. This study shows that the strand burner can be used on propellant strands to obtain accurate low pressure burning rate data...|$|R
50|$|Skiing is {{a single}} player only game, in which the player uses the {{joystick}} to control the direction and speed of a stationary skier {{at the top of}} the screen, while the background graphics scroll upwards, thus giving the illusion the skier is moving. The player must avoid obstacles, such as trees and moguls. The game cartridge was programmed with five variations each of two principal games. In the downhill mode, the player's goal is to reach the bottom of the ski course as rapidly as possible, while a <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> his relative success. In the slalom mode, the player must similarly reach the end of the course as rapidly as he can, but must at the same time pass through a series of gates (indicated by a pair of closely spaced flagpoles). Each gate missed counts as a penalty against the player's time.|$|R
50|$|The contestants {{must pass}} the midway control {{three hours after}} the start. The maximum time limit for Helsingborg Marathon is six hours. The {{participants}} (four in each team) run in the relay, alongside the marathon runners. The first relay runner will start one hour after the marathon runners. The minimum age for the marathon distance is 18, while age 15 is enough for the relay. Water stations are located regularly along the path. Some of these also offer energy drinks, bananas and oranges. Timing is done with an electronic disposable chip that {{is built into the}} bib number. The <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> the runner's net time, which means that the timing starts when the participant cross the starting line, and stops when he or she runs across the finish line. Sprinters who choose to abort the race are offered free taxi ride down to the finish area.|$|R
5000|$|The tach(ometer) timer is an {{instrument}} used in aviation to accumulate {{the total number}} of revolutions performed by the engine. The unit of measure is equivalent to the number of hours of running at a certain, specific reference speed of rotation. If the reference speed of rotation is 2400 RPM then the timer runs in real time when the engine is running at 2400 RPM, half speed while the engine is run at 1200 RPM (a fast idle for some aviation engines) or at 5/6ths real time at 2000 RPM (a slow cruise speed).The tach timer integrates over time the instantaneous rotation speed displayed by the tachometer. The displayed number is incremented by one if the engine is run at its reference speed for one hour. The quantity recorded is referred to as tach(ometer) hours. If the reference rotation speed is 2400 RPM then the tach <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{test unit}} is a custom photodetector/event timer, PET, {{built for the}} Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, SAO, by Los Alamos which records elapsed time in 10 ps steps. The 1 Kg, 12 cm {{diameter}} PET unit uses 10 watts of electrical power and was tested to SAO`s specified flight conditions. The event timer has two inputs [...] a reference clock oscillator input and a stop signal. Like a stop watch with split timing capability, the event <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> the instant a stop signal arrives. At that sample instant, the number of elapsed clock cycles are stored and the sample instant position between two reference clock edges is interpolated and stored. Then that stored data can be shifted serially to an external computer. The photodetector part of the PET responds to an optical input and provides the electrical output signal to the event timer specifying the sample instant. This test report discusses the event timer test results. Test equipment is shown {{for most of the}} operational tests. The relay rack contains test pursers and clocks. The environmental chamber controls temperature. The computer reads and records the serial data from the PET. Reported testing topics include: Pulse shapes to be used as test inputs, test results obtained using the electrical source`s input, optical test results which are the best simulation of specified operational conditions, heat sink operation in vacuum. Vibration tests performed to SAO`s specification...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{research}} into the effect in the consultation {{of the use of}} a computer to prompt opportunistic preventive care a valid, objective, and practical measure of the consultation process was required. After a review of the alternative methods the Time Interval Medical Event Recorder (Timer) was developed, its reliability tested, and applied to 93 control consultations and 49 computer assisted consultations. <b>Timer</b> <b>records,</b> every five seconds, four consultation events: the problems being dealt with, the physical activity, the verbal activity, and the secondary tasks being attempted. Timer showed that control consultations lasted an average of 6 minutes 58 seconds. The doctors spent 35 % of their time on administration, and patients and doctors were both conversational for just 33 % of the consultation. Giving information was the most common verbal activity (48 % of the duration of the consultation) with silence accounting for 21 % of the time. When the computer was used the average consultation was longer, at 7 minutes and 46 seconds. The doctor's contribution to the consultation appeared to have increased. Patient centred speech fell from 36 % in controls to 28 % of the duration of the consultation when the computer was used, while doctor centred speech rose from 30 % to 34. 5 %. Secondary tasks (exploring patient concepts, education, management sharing, and prevention) were attempted during 28 % of the control consultations and 40 % of the computer consultations. This was accounted for by the increase in prevention (p less than 0. 001). Timer is a reliable and practical tool for researching the consultation, and though it has shown validity in detecting differences between consultations that use a computer and those that do not, further applications are required to establish its full value...|$|R
