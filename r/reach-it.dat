5000|$|The European Commission {{supports}} businesses {{affected by}} REACH by handing out [...] - [...] {{free of charge}} [...] - [...] a software application (IUCLID) that simplifies capturing, managing, and submitting data on chemical properties and effects. Such submission is a mandatory part of the registration process. Under certain circumstances {{the performance of a}} chemical safety assessment (CSA) is mandatory and a chemical safety report (CSR) assuring the safe use of the substance has to be submitted with the dossier. Dossier submission is done using the web-based software <b>REACH-IT.</b>|$|E
3000|$|ECHA {{has already}} changed several times its rules for {{mandatory}} {{information in the}} IUCLID software for registrations and is currently planning further changes. This impacts dossier updates, too: it can become necessary to work on formerly accepted items of information beyond the actual changes for submission to function and/or for no confidential information to be published. For this reason, inter alia, the following points should be considered for <b>REACH-IT</b> and IUCLID to prevent unnecessary bureaucracy in the future: [...]...|$|E
40|$|The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) {{has long}} {{maintained}} that CMMI is primarily about applying proven best practices {{and can be}} used with many other methods and models. To see real improvement, we need to recognize that it’s not about how well we “do ” Agile or what level of CMMI we <b>reach—it’s</b> about the software quality and development performance those methods enable. While Agile and CMMI are sometimes presented as competitors, it’s important to remember that they were both created to address many of the same concerns about software development. The benefits of Agile are widely discussed, but the engineering disciplines needed to apply agility to mission-critical software-reliant systems at scale are not as well defined or practiced. This article describes research being conducted at the SEI to understand and explicate solutions to challenges that will help guide the evolution of existing methods and models, including CMMI and Agile, and enable the success of development efforts building ever larger and more complex software-reliant systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|The REACH Regulation was {{formally}} adopted on 18 December 2006 by the Council of Environment Ministers following {{the vote in}} second reading of the European Parliament on 13 December 2006. REACH will enter into force on 1 June 2007. To facilitate {{the transition to the}} existing chemicals legislation to REACH, the European has developed an interim strategy to ensure that the stakeholders, industry and regulatory authorities, are adequately prepared for the implementation of the legislation. This includes the development of technical guidance and tools, through a number of REACH Implementation Projects. One project, REACH IT, addresses the development of IT tools. The <b>REACH-IT</b> project underpins the requirements that follow from the REACH regulation. It includes tools for industry aimed at preparing and submitting REACH-compliant dossiers. It also includes support to Authorities in their tasks. This paper gives an overview {{on the state of the}} development of IUCLID 5 (status April 2007). It includes the state of play of the project and the support put in place. It also gives insight on the complete <b>REACH-IT</b> workflow: from data gathering to the submission of the registration dossier. JRC. I. 3 -Toxicology and chemical substance...|$|E
30|$|Helbing and Molnár {{propose that}} there are three main effects with which the motion of single {{pedestrians}} can be explained: (i) destination to <b>reach—it</b> consists in the shortest path to follow in order to go towards a goal; (ii) influences caused by other pedestrians and barriers—in which they define a repulsive force model for describing the effect that pedestrians exert among others at the moment of avoiding people. They also propose a repulsive model to explain the effect of barriers, such as borders of buildings or obstacles. (iii) Temporary attractive effects— they define a model that explains the sudden attractiveness that could be experienced by a pedestrian, it is the case of feeling attraction to other people (friends, street artists, etc.) or going towards static objects such as window displays.|$|E
40|$|The recent measles {{epidemic}} in the United States has aroused public disbelief that a disease well-controlled for decades is reemerging to threaten {{children in the}} United States. Controversy surrounds measles vaccination in the United States; some parents have even avoided vaccinating their healthy children by exposing them to measles-infect-ed children. However, measles has repeatedly reemerged in the United States during the past 3 centuries or longer (1, 2), and its emergence patterns and means of preventing and controlling it are well understood. Until measles is glob-ally eradicated—a goal within <b>reach—it</b> will continue to reappear, sicken, and kill almost anywhere, and we must energetically control each outbreak. When we consider modern measles prevention, it is worth recalling what epidemics were like before vaccines and organized public health systems. One vivid account of measles describes the disease’s deadly spread through a prominent Boston household> 300 years ago. In 1713, America’s first important medical figure (3), Puritan minis-ter Cotton Mather (1663 – 1728), called by one authority “the Dr. Spock of the colonial New England ” (4), wrote about a measles {{epidemic in}} the American colonies, describing not only its epidemiology and devastation but also the fear it elicited. Mather’s account {{reminds us of the}} need for such modern medical and public health tools as vaccination, pa-tient isolation, and prevention policies in saving families from the once-unpreventable diseases that compelled us to develop effective medical advances in the first place. The following account, condensed from Cotton Mather’s personal diary (5), focuses on illnesses in his own household, including those of his wife, 9 children, and a maidservant, over the course of 6 weeks during October...|$|E
