40|$|The current {{expansion}} {{has seen}} record-high levels of transactions in housing, extraordinary {{growth in the}} aggregate value of owner-occupied housing, and large increases {{in the amount of}} funds realized from the <b>refinancing</b> <b>of</b> mortgage <b>debt.</b> Many analysts thus have pointed to the strong housing market and rising home prices as a major pillar supporting recent economic growth and have expressed concern that a contraction in housing activity and values could pose a significant risk to consumer spending and real economic growth. This paper explores the channels by which the housing market may affect consumer spending and assesses the potential risk from a softening in the housing market. Our assessment is that while a housing slowdown by itself may slow consumer spending some, it is probably insufficient to precipitate a downturn without some additional shocks outside of the sector.

Also, compared to the IMF metrics our indicator provides more weighting coefficients of the other portfolio liabilities and the money supply that represents the sensitivity to financial account shocks.
