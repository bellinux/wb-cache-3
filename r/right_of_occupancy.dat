40|$|Abstract: The ruling of the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal (1999) {{states that}} the Land Use Act (LUA) {{does not apply to}} lands within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Ipso facto. The {{distinction}} between urban and non-urban Land created by the Land Use Act is not applicable within the territory. Hence only the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) is competent to grant <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Occupancy</b> in respect <b>of</b> land within the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. This paper examines how land may be acquired in FCT with particular emphasis on the payment of compensation; it reveals that, apart from delayed payment of compensation, current provisions of the law cannot adequately compensate dispossessed owners. It recommends that the National Assembly should come to the rescue with a definite legislation that will be applicable to the incidence of land holding in the FCT, Abuja and the establishment of a Lands Tribunal system to deal with compensation valuation issues in all the States of the Federation including Abuja...|$|R
50|$|Land Trusts have {{traditionally}} {{been used as a}} non-profit entity to own property. In recent years, many companies have developed methodologies that allow for Land Trusts to be used to acquire properties in foreclosure allowing homeowners to save their homes and making it possible for investors to see incredible returns. In a Real Estate Investment model Land Trusts bring ease to the transaction. While some people believe that using a Land Trust also brings a benefit of not causing Due-on-sale clauses to force the refinancing of the subject property, this is only true when the borrower is and remains a beneficiary of the trust and which does not relate to a transfer <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> in the property. While the use of Land Trusts by real estate investors does {{make it more difficult for}} a lender to discover a transfer has occurred, the loan can still be accelerated if it is discovered since a transfer has occurred.|$|R

30|$|The {{areas that}} are now {{designated}} as state-protected areas were formerly used and occupied by local communities, with parks such as Serengeti and Tarangire occupied by pastoralists prior to their gazettement. When the colonial and post-independence governments established national parks and game reserves in these customarily owned lands, local people were evicted and <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> gradually extinguished. Despite this long-running effort to divide the landscape into areas for people and areas for wildlife conservation, northern Tanzania continues to be characterized by {{a high level of}} interaction and co-existence between local resident people and wildlife. Parks and reserves are invariably situated within larger ecosystems, and wildlife continues to move across the artificial boundaries dividing communal and state lands. Many species of large mammals, such as elephants, wildebeest, and zebra, undertake annual migrations based on the seasonal availability of water, forage, and nutrients. Wildlife in northern Tanzanian ecosystems continues to rely on many lands and resources which are located outside protected areas on private and community lands, making these latter areas essential for the long-term conservation of wildlife.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are certain}} {{exceptions}} to enforceability of due-on-sale clauses. These are generally contained in Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 591. For example, borrowers may place {{their homes in}} their own trust without triggering the due-on-sale clause. [...] "A lender may not exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause upon a transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> in the property."

Similarly, transfer of the borrower's home to a spouse {{as part of a}} divorce or dissolution of marriage generally does not trigger a due-on-sale clause. There are other exemptions in the law as well. Use trusts also facilitates transfers of property to heirs and minors.

40|$|In Tanzania, ongoing land {{insecurity}} is {{a structural}} cause of food insecurity particularly for pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and small-scale crop farmers leading to land use conflicts, compromised {{access to resources}} including grazing and water and rangeland degradation. Land tenure security and management can be improved through village land use planning (VLUP) and land certification – namely the issuing of certificates <b>of</b> customary <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> (CCROs). In situations where villages share resources such as grazing areas and water, joint village land use planning {{and the provision of}} group CCROs are more appropriate. Due to a lack of resources and capacity the implementation of these has been limited to date and particularly in ‘difficult’ areas where land use conflicts occur. Indeed only about 1. 28 million hectares or 2. 1 % of the 60 million hectares of rangelands is protected as grazing in village land use plans [in 479 villages in 69 districts] (21 regions) (Ministry of Lands 2015). Between 2010 - 2015 the Sustainable Rangeland Management Project (SRMP) assisted nine villages to carry out village land use planning, and successfully piloted the implementation of joint village planning across three of these, leading to the protection through certification of a shared grazing area called OLENGAPA, found in Kiteto District, Manyara Region.

Catholic Bishop Taché, the Anglican bishop of Rupert's land Robert Machray, and the HBC governor of Assiniboia William Mactavish all warned the federal government that such surveys would precipitate unrest. Headed by Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, the survey party arrived at Fort Garry on August 20, 1869. The Métis were anxious about it, as they did not possess clear title to their lands but held a tenuous <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy.</b> In addition, the lots had been laid out according to the French seigneurial colonial system, with long, narrow lots fronting the river, rather than the square lots preferred by the English. [...] The Métis considered the survey to be a forerunner of increased Canadian migration to the territory, which they perceived {{as a threat to}} their way of life [...] more specifically, they feared losing their farms. The larger fear was for losing their language and Catholic religion, and facing marginalisation and discrimination in what had been their squat.|$|E

In Ulster, and in an embryo degree elsewhere, this was what in a varying and irregular way actually had come about. Agrarian customs developed that undoubtedly belong to a backward social system, but they sprang from the necessities of the case.

More than once, whilst he was in prison himself, Esmond had thought where those papers could be, which the Jesuit had shown to his patron, and which had such an interest for himself. They were not found on Mr. Holt's person when that Father was apprehended, for had such been the case my Lords of the Council had seen them, and this family history had long since been made public. However, Esmond cared not to seek the papers. His resolution being taken; his poor mother dead; what matter to him that documents existed proving his right to a title which he was determined not to claim, and of which he vowed never to deprive that family which he loved best in the world? Perhaps he took a greater pride out of his sacrifice than he would have had in those honors which he was resolved to forego.

Among other things, it will be seen that the intended benefits, and beneficiaries, of land registration have changed over the century or so since the first systems were put in place. In addition to these variations over time, there are also differences among Anglophone, Francophone, and Lusophone countries, differences that not only influenced the structure of registration systems established during the colonial era, but also continue to inform the kinds of registration systems adopted today.

40|$|Defence date: 19 December 1990 First made {{available}} online on 11 April 2014. The views of Greek historians on {{the conditions of}} existence and the strategy of peasant families tend to converge around a set of assumptions that may be depicted as following: - The peasantry held virtual control over {{large part of the}} land it cultivated. A great part of this land consisted of "National Estates" - that is, of land which before 1830 belonged to the Porte and to Ottoman subjects and after that date became property of the Greek state. Until 1871, any individual, as well as peasant families, might occupy and cultivate part of this land, by paying a relatively low rent, proportional to gross output, as a "right of usufruct" to the Treasury. Although the legal framework was unclear and liable to changes, regular occupants of this land might sell, rent, give as a dowry or even mortgage their rights on it. Thus, <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> on national land were de facto almost as strong as <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> property. -Ownership of large estates represented an exceptional and rather marginal situation; the wealthy and powerful strata of the population were mainly oriented towards commerce, money-lending, political and administrative careers, and showed a relative indifference towards the prospect of acquisition and exploitation of agricultural estate property. -The massive sale of "National Estates", organized according to the law of 1871, which gave priority to longstanding occupants, permitted a further consolidation of the peasants' position. It is commonly held that longstanding occupants became full proprietors of the land they traditionally cultivated. -Peasant farms, which represented the prevalent type of productive unit in Greek agriculture, were "target producers" oriented towards subsistence. This they sought through a varying combination of activities, including production of foodstuffs for home consumption, occasional wage-labour, and highly commercialized crops, such as currant viticulture, growing of cotton or tobacco. These latter were a supplementary opportunity for further differentiation of activities - differentiation which contributed to the security of household income - and a way to face monetary needs, aggravated by the usurious interest rates charged by money-lenders on their advances to the peasantry...|$|R
