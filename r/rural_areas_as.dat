5|$|Although much of Massachusetts {{had been}} cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old-growth forest in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts.

Rural areas with moderate urban influence and a population density of about 6.5people per square kilometre account for 26percent of the rural population. Areas with low urban influence {{where the majority of}} the residents work in the rural area house approximately 42percent of the rural population. Remote rural areas with a density of less than 1 person per square kilometre account for about 14percent of the rural population.|$|E

5|$|NY167 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US20 (West Main Street) near {{the northern tip of}} Canadarago Lake {{in the village}} of Richfield Springs. The route proceeds north as a two-lane highway along Church Street, passing through the village's residential northern portion before leaving Richfield Springs and crossing the Otsego–Herkimer county line just a half-mile (0.8km) from the junction with US20. The residential surroundings follow NY167 into the town of Warren; however, they give way to more open, undeveloped areas as the route intersects Millstone Road (County Route78 or CR78, an unsigned number) about a half-mile (0.8km) from the county line. From Millstone Road, the route winds northeast through Warren, traveling through increasingly <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> it serves the hamlet of Cullen and intersects Cullen and Hogsback roads (CR183) {{in the center of the}} small community.|$|E

5|$|The {{first several}} miles of NY149 in Washington County pass through isolated, <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> it curves {{to the north}} and south while {{following}} a generally east–west alignment. In West Fort Ann, the only community along the route between the county line and the village of Fort Ann, NY149 intersects with Old State Route149, a loop route of NY149 that was created when the highway was realigned. The route continues east from the community, exiting Adirondack Park and crossing over Halfway Creek on its way into the village of Fort Ann, where it becomes Ann Street. Within the village, NY149 passes the Fort Ann Cemetery and two blocks of homes before intersecting with US4 at George Street. NY149 turns to the south, joining US4 along George Street through downtown Fort Ann. After passing the town park, US4 and NY149 leave the village and become nameless as they head south into the town of Kingsbury.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, Table  1 {{indicates}} that land distribution is more unequal in <b>rural</b> <b>area,</b> <b>as</b> the Gini of <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> is higher for land per household, land per capital, or land per adult.
