Although keratinocyte stem cells have not yet been completely characterized and purified for gene targeting purposes, lentiviral vectors may be superior to <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> at gene introduction into these stem cells, which are believed to divide and cycle slowly. Our initial in vitro studies demonstrate that lentiviral vectors are able to efficiently transduce nondividing keratinocytes, unlike <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors,</b> and do not require the lentiviral accessory genes for keratinocyte transduction. When lentiviral vectors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were directly injected into the dermis of human skin grafted onto immunocompromised mice, transduction of dividing basal and nondividing suprabasal keratinocytes could be demonstrated, which was not the case when control <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> were used.

5000|$|The viral vectors {{described}} above have natural host cell populations that they infect most efficiently. Retroviruses have limited natural host cell ranges, and although adenovirus and adeno-associated virus {{are able to}} infect a relatively broader range of cells efficiently, some cell types are refractory to infection by these viruses as well. Attachment to and entry into a susceptible cell is mediated by the protein envelope {{on the surface of}} a virus. Retroviruses and adeno-associated viruses have a single protein coating their membrane, while adenoviruses are coated with both an envelope protein and fibers that extend away {{from the surface of the}} virus. The envelope proteins on each of these viruses bind to cell-surface molecules such as heparin sulfate, which localizes them upon the surface of the potential host, as well as with the specific protein receptor that either induces entry-promoting structural changes in the viral protein, or localizes the virus in endosomes wherein acidification of the lumen induces this refolding of the viral coat. In either case, entry into potential host cells requires a favorable interaction between a protein on the surface of the virus and a protein on the surface of the cell.For the purposes of gene therapy, one might either want to limit or expand the range of cells susceptible to transduction by a gene therapy vector. To this end, many vectors have been developed in which the endogenous viral envelope proteins have been replaced by either envelope proteins from other viruses, or by chimeric proteins. Such chimera would consist of those parts of the viral protein necessary for incorporation into the virion as well as sequences meant to interact with specific host cell proteins. Viruses in which the envelope proteins have been replaced as described are referred to as pseudotyped viruses. For example, the most popular <b>retroviral</b> <b>vector</b> for use in gene therapy trials has been the lentivirus Simian immunodeficiency virus coated with the envelope proteins, G-protein, from Vesicular stomatitis virus. This vector is referred to as VSV G-pseudotyped lentivirus, and infects an almost universal set of cells. This tropism is characteristic of the VSV G-protein with which this vector is coated. Many attempts have been made to limit the tropism of viral vectors to one or a few host cell populations. This advance would allow for the systemic administration of a relatively small amount of vector. The potential for off-target cell modification would be limited, and many concerns from the medical community would be alleviated. Most attempts to limit tropism have used chimeric envelope proteins bearing antibody fragments. These vectors show great promise for the development of [...] "magic bullet" [...] gene therapies.|$|E

Deletion of the viral enhancer in the Mo-MLV long terminal repeat was necessary to detect LCR activity in the context of these <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors.</b> It was found that a full-length (2. 1 kb), but not a truncated (1. 0 kb), CD 2 LCR retained the ability to modulate reporter gene expression by Mo-MLV-derived <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors,</b> leading to a homogeneous, unimodal pattern of EGFP expression that remained unmodified in culture over time, specifically in T-cell lines; on the other hand, viral titer was strongly reduced compared with vectors not carrying the LCR.

Many variables can affect the fidelity of reverse transcriptase during reverse transcription, including specific sequences within the retroviral genome. ^ Previous studies have observed that multiple cloning sites (MCS) and sequences predicted to form stable hairpin structures are hotspots for deletion during retroviral replication. The studies described in this dissertation were performed to elucidate the variables that affect the stability of MCS and hairpin structures in <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors.</b> Two series of <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> were constructed and characterized in these studies. ^ Spleen necrosis virus-based vectors were constructed containing separate MCS insertions of varying length, orientation, and symmetry. The only MCS that was a hotspot for deletion formed a stable hairpin structure. Upon more detailed study, the MCS previously reported as a hotspot for deletion was found to contain a tandem linker insertion that formed a hairpin structure. Murine leukemia virus-based vectors were constructed containing separate sequence insertions of either inverted repeat symmetry (122 IR) that could form a hairpin structure, or little symmetry (122 c) that would form a less stable structure. These insertions were made into either the neomycin resistance marker (neo) or the hygromycin resistance marker (hyg) of the vector. 122 c was stable in both neo and hyg, while 122 IR was preferentially deleted in neo and was remarkably unstable in hyg. ^ These results suggest that MCS are hotspots for deletion in <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> if they can form hairpin structures, and that hairpin structures can be highly unstable at certain locations in <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors.</b> This information may contribute to improved design of <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> for such uses as human gene therapy, and will contribute to a greater understanding of the basic science of retroviral reverse transcription. ...|$|R

The predictions of the model also suggest the use of <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> as cell cycle markers, as an alternative way to detect cell cycle dependence of retroviral transduction. This method obviates the need for cell synchronization and therefore, it does not perturb the cell cycle or interfere with the life cycle of <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors.</b> Moreover, it does not depend on the intracellular stability of <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors.</b> Our results show that in contrast to previously reported results, transduction of murine fibroblasts is cell cycle dependent, and they are consistent with the current notion that mitosis is the phase that confers transduction susceptibility. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{cationic}} liposomes (Lipofectin) to facilitate retrovirus infection of cells lacking the homologous viral receptor. Ecotropic {{murine leukemia virus}} and packaged <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> were shown to infect mink cells, and amphotropic packaged <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> were shown to infect hamster cells {{in the presence of}} Lipofectin but not in the presence of Polybrene. Lipofectin-mediated infection of cells lacking the homologous receptor results in a titer approximately 0. 1 % of the titer in cells with the homologous receptor, using the standard Polybrene protocol. The use of Lipofectin may provide a simple means to experimentally infect a wide variety of cells with viruses not normally infectious for the species, tissue, or cell type of interest...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recombinant retroviruses are now an estab-lished {{tool for}} gene delivery. Presently they are mainly {{produced}} using adherent cells. However, {{due to the}} restrictive nature of adherent cell culture, this mode of production is hampered by low cell-specific productivity and small production units. The large-scale production of <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> could benefit from the adaptation of retrovirus packaging cell lines to suspension culture. Here, we describe {{the ability of a}} 293 packaging cell line to produce <b>retroviral</b> <b>vectors</b> in suspension culture at high titer. Adherent 293 GPG cells, producing a Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMLV) retrovirus vector pseu-dotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVG) envelope protein and expressing a TK-GFP fusion protein, were adapted to suspension culture in calcium-fre...|$|R
