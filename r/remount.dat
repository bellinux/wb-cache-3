5|$|During the First World War, an Army <b>Remount</b> Service depot {{was located}} nearby, with Shirehampton station {{handling}} the goods traffic, {{with up to}} 60 wagons per day inbound, mostly containing hay and sawdust for the horses. Twelve wagons of manure were dispatched each day, some to Cadbury Road on the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{strictly}} a missing serial, {{production of the}} 1979 Tom Baker story Shada was curtailed by a technician's strike partway through recording. To prevent the half-finished material from being junked, incoming Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner placed a preservation order on it with an intention to later finish the production. Although repeated attempts to <b>remount</b> the serial failed, a clip from Episode 1 was later used in the 1983 story The Five Doctors after Tom Baker declined to reprise his role.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable Crabbet-bred stallions Brown {{eventually}} kept at Maynesboro was *Astraled, {{who had come to}} America in 1909. This horse had been sold by Wilfrid Blunt to an American buyer from Massachusetts, but after siring only two purebred foals in New England, was sold to the <b>remount,</b> shipped west, and lived in obscurity in Oregon, where he sired no purebred Arabian offspring. *Astraled was ultimately obtained by Brown in 1923, who shipped the aged horse by rail from Idaho to New Hampshire. *Astraled only sired one foal crop at Maynesboro, but that group of foals included his most notable American-bred son, Gulastra.|$|E

5|$|Thoroughbreds in the United States have {{historically}} been used not only for racing but also to improve other breeds. The early import Messenger was {{the foundation of the}} Standardbred, and Thoroughbred blood was also instrumental {{in the development of the}} American Quarter Horse. The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred. Between World War I and World War II, the U.S. Army used Thoroughbred stallions as part of their <b>Remount</b> Service, which was designed to improve the stock of cavalry mounts.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the 12th Light Horse Regiment {{remained}} in the Middle East for a number of months, during which time, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Chambers, they were used to suppress the 1919 Egyptian Uprising. During the uprising, the 12th carried out security operations to protect infrastructure in the Ismailia area. As the situation was resolved, the regiment handed back its stores and equipment in preparation for repatriation back to Australia and most of their horses were transferred to the Australian <b>Remount</b> Depot at Moascar. Due to concerns about costs, availability of shipping and quarantine restrictions, the decision was made that the horses would not be returned to Australia, but that they would be sold to the British Indian Army for further service, or to local Egyptians. According to Hollis, though, many were also put down by the troopers due to concerns they might be mistreated.|$|E
5|$|Major Arabian importations to the United States {{included}} {{those of}} Davenport and Bradley, who {{teamed up to}} purchase several stallions and mares directly from the Bedouin in 1906. Spencer Borden of the Interlachen Stud made several importations between 1898 and 1911; and W.R. Brown of the Maynesboro Stud, interested in the Arabian as a cavalry mount, imported many Arabians {{over a period of}} years, starting in 1918. Another wave of imports came in the 1920s and 30s when breeders such as W.K. Kellogg, Henry Babson, Roger Selby, James Draper, and others imported Arabian bloodstock from Crabbet Park Stud in England, as well as from Poland, Spain and Egypt. The breeding of Arabians was fostered by the U. S. Army <b>Remount</b> Service, which stood purebred stallions at public stud for a reduced rate.|$|E

5|$|On 17 March {{the whole}} brigade {{was ordered to}} deploy to assist the civil {{authorities}} dealing with growing unrest among the Egyptian civilian population. The regiment moved to the Nile Delta on 23 March, forming a column with four armoured cars and an armoured train. Any one found rioting was arrested and tried {{in front of a}} court headed by the commanding-officer, who also imposed sentences. Within weeks the rioting was quelled and the regiment returned to their camp, remaining there until 17 June when they were ordered to send their horses to the <b>remount</b> depot and move to Ismailia on the Suez Canal. On 30 June they embarked on the transport ship HMNZT Ulimaroa for New Zealand and the regiment was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Civil War and World War II {{also had}} a devastating impact on horse {{breeding}} throughout Europe. The Veragua stud was destroyed, and its records lost, with the only survivors being the broodmares and the younger horses, who were rescued by Francisco Franco. Crabbet Park, Tersk, and Jan√≥w Podlaski survived. Both the Soviet Union and the United States obtained valuable Arabian bloodlines as spoils of war, which they used to strengthen their breeding programs. The Soviets had taken steps to protect their breeding stock at Tersk Stud, and by utilizing horses captured in Poland {{they were able to}} re-establish their breeding program soon after the end of World War II. The Americans brought Arabian horses captured in Europe to the United States, mostly to the Pomona U.S. Army <b>Remount</b> station, the former W.K. Kellogg Ranch in California.|$|E
5|$|Palairet married Caroline Mabel Laverton, the {{daughter}} of William Henry Laverton, a prominent cricket patron in Wiltshire, in 1894. The pair had two children: Evelyn Mabel Hamilton, born in 1895, and Henry Edward Hamilton the following year. Palairet's brother, Richard, played first-class cricket for Somerset between 1891 and 1902, albeit without as much success as Lionel. In addition to cricket, Palairet maintained an interest {{in a range of}} other sports; a 1901 profile of him in Baily's Magazine records that foxhunting was his primary sporting interest. After his retirement from cricket, Palairet became a prominent golfer in the south-west. He was the first chairman of the Devon County Golf Union upon its formation in 1911, captained Devon at golf either side of the First World War, from 1914 through until 1926, and was also president of the Union from 1923 until 1932. He developed the idea of an inter-club team championship within Devon, and donated the prize, which remains named the Palairet Trophy. During the First World War, he had command of a <b>Remount</b> Depot at Powderham, the seat of the Earl of Devon. He died in Exmouth on 27 March 1933, aged 62.|$|E

5|$|The Year of the Sex Olympics {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} production when the 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained a copy of the script and attempted to block the production. Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene. Location filming for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The Live Life Show took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968. A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist. Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May, covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex, Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots. The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing. Following rehearsals, the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June. Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production, {{and by the end of}} the recording session the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped, leading to a <b>remount</b> on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Witez II {{and other}} horses {{captured}} from the Nazis were shipped to the United States, much to the dismay of the Poles, who had hoped to recover the horses they had lost. The journey by ship from Europe to America was quite rough, but the horses arrived safely in Newport News, Virginia in late 1945, and spent the winter at the U.S. Army <b>Remount</b> station at Front Royal, Virginia. In early 1946, Witez II and the bulk of the imported Arabians were shipped to the Army <b>Remount</b> station at the former W.K. Kellogg Arabian Ranch in Pomona, California, where he stood at stud until 1948. In that year, the <b>remount</b> service was put under the authority of the United States Department of Agriculture, and the horses were sent off for auction.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{focuses on}} <b>remounting</b> existing dance choreographies. It reveals {{a shift from}} traditional notions of the choreographer as a figure of centralized authority to a decentralized model of collaborative exploration. Questions raised throughout this investigation are: How are the outcomes of choreographic <b>remounting</b> affected by defining the place of imitation in the process? How can the artist's creative voice remain present and active {{in the context of}} executing already established choreography? What is the place of the dancer's adaptive choices, and how do they manifest in the <b>remounting</b> process and subsequent performance of the work? Three phases are identified in order to contextualize these questions within the <b>remounting</b> process. The three phases are: Mimesis, Embodiment and Interpretation. The theoretical framework for this study comes from dance and performance studies, using references from Mark Franko, Bojana Cvejic, and William Forsythe...|$|R
