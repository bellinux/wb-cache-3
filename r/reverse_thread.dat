40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of variations in thread shape on the axial pullout strength of orthodontic miniscrews. Methods: A total of 35 miniscrews, 7 of each design being considered, were tested by performing pullout tests on a synthetic bone support. We used self-tapping and self-drilling miniscrews having a diameter of 2 mm and a thread shaft length of 12 mm (the longest and the largest supplied by the manufacturer). A buttress <b>reverse</b> <b>thread</b> shape served as the control design and was tested against 4 experimental designs, each manufactured with a modification in thread shape while maintaining all other characteristics. The experimental groups had the following thread designs: buttress, 75 ° joint profile, rounded, and trapezoidal. Results: The control group with a buttress <b>reverse</b> <b>thread</b> shape had consistently higher pullout strength values than did the other designs. A statistically significant reduction in pullout force was found between the buttress reverse and the buttress thread miniscrews. Conclusions: Thread design influenced the resistance to pullout of the orthodontic miniscrews. The buttress <b>reverse</b> <b>thread</b> shape provided the greatest pullout strength. © 2012 by the American Association of Orthodontists...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The use of {{locking plate}} {{technology}} for anterior lumbar spinal fusion has increased {{stability of the}} vertebral fusion mass over traditional nonconstrained screw and plate systems. This case report outlines a complication due {{to the use of}} this construct. Case. A patient with a history of L 2 corpectomy and anterior spinal fusion presented with discitis at the L 4 / 5 level and underwent an anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) supplemented with a locking plate placed anterolaterally for stability. Fifteen months after the ALIF procedure, he returned with a hardware infection. He underwent debridement of the infection site and removal of hardware. Results. Once hardware was exposed, removal of the locking plate screws was only successful in one out of four screws using a <b>reverse</b> <b>thread</b> screw removal device. Three of the <b>reverse</b> <b>thread</b> screw removal devices broke in attempt to remove the subsequent screws. A metal cutting drill was then used to break hoop stresses associated with the locking device and the plate was removed. Conclusion. Anterior locking plates add significant stability to an anterior spinal fusion mass. However, removal of this hardware can be complicated by the inherent properties of the design with significant risk of major vascular injury...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} enhance design {{reliability}} of a co-rotating twin screw pulping extruder (TSPE), optimum design on screw {{parameters of the}} TSPE was studied based on the extrusion model. The maximum shear flux or the minimum power consumption, or the two synchronous optimizations were taken as objective functions, and constraint conditions, such as thread lead, depth of thread, screw rotational speed, number of <b>reverse</b> <b>thread</b> lead, actual top width of the flight, torsional strength and stiffness of the screw mandrel, and so on were confirmed base on actual requirements of the TSPE manufacture and application. The optimizing results show that two-objective optimum design results split the difference of the two single-objective optimum design, {{and it is the}} most economical in reducing manufacture cost of the equipment and pulping expenses...|$|E
5000|$|Track {{sprocket}} - There is no {{mechanism that}} allows the rider to coast. There are two sets of threads on the hub shell. The threads are in opposite directions. The inner (clockwise) set of threads is for a track sprocket and the outer (counter-clockwise) set is for a <b>reverse</b> <b>threaded</b> lock ring. The <b>reverse</b> <b>threads</b> on the lock ring keep the sprocket from unscrewing from the hub, which is otherwise possible when slowing down.|$|R
50|$|However, the GriGri's {{automatic}} {{action can}} lead to less alert belayers. The GriGri is not a hands-free belay device and constant vigilance is required by the belayer {{no matter what kind}} of device is used. One common mistake with the GriGri is <b>reverse</b> <b>threading</b> it, rendering the camming action useless. Though, in a fall with a <b>reverse</b> <b>threaded</b> GriGri, bending the rope sharply under the GriGri provides more than enough friction to hold a falling climber as long as the belayer locks off the rope as they would with a tube style (passive) device.|$|R

50|$|Most (except for Italian and French) designs use {{right-hand}} (normal) threading for {{the left}} side and left-hand (<b>reverse)</b> <b>threading</b> for the right (drive) side. This is opposite of most pedal threading and is done for the same reason: to keep the bottom bracket cup from backing out of the bottom bracket shell due to precession.|$|R
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the <b>reverse</b> <b>threads</b> for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not <b>reverse</b> <b>threaded,</b> the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|R
5000|$|An arbor bolt is {{the bolt}} {{that holds the}} blade to the miter saw. The {{diameter}} of the arbor bolt must match the blade hole size in order to properly secure the blade (12" [...] blades commonly use 1" [...] arbor holes and 10" [...] blades favor 5/8"). Arbor bolts are <b>reversed</b> <b>threaded</b> meaning you have to turn clockwise to loosen the bolt. Many inexperienced users will strip their arbor bolt as a result. The arbot bolt is designed so that the rotational spin of the saw blade is exerting a tightening pressure on the blade, {{as opposed to the}} bolt working its way loose and having the flying blade injure the operator.|$|R
5000|$|The smaller {{diameter}} thread on {{the fixed}} side has reverse/left hand threads {{to accept a}} lockring. The lockring is <b>reverse</b> <b>threaded</b> to prevent the cog from coming loose when applying reverse/braking power to the pedals. There are also different sized threads for the left hand lockring (English/ISO 1.29" [...] x 24 TPI), Campagnolo/Phil Wood (1.32" [...] x 24 TPI) and Old French (33 mm x 1.0 mm). The first two are the most common, with the French threading being older, and a little less common. It is advisable to check with the manufacturer of the hub for lock ring compatibility. Wrong thread type lockrings may easily thread onto the wrong hub, but over time, the poorly-mating thread interface will cause the threads on the hub to become damaged or destroyed.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Clinical {{success of}} implant {{prosthodontics}} is dependent in part upon {{the type of}} implant thread design. The selection of implant thread design {{plays an important role}} in the outcome of the treatment. This study was undertaken to evaluate the pattern of stress distribution using a finite element analysis; hence, the area which would be bearing maximum load for a given design would be arrived. Materials and Methods: Three implants with different thread designs, namely V-thread, buttress, and <b>reverse</b> buttress <b>thread</b> designs were considered and dimensions were standardized. The site considered was the mandibular molar region with cortical and trabecular bone assuming to be isotropic and homogeneous. The implant modeling was done with the CATIA software. Vertical loads of 100 N were applied. The stresses were calculated as Von Mises stress criterion. Results: Maximum stresses were seen at the cortical bone and were transferred to the implant. Minimum Von Mises stresses were seen with <b>reverse</b> buttress <b>thread</b> design at the cortical bone. The stresses were observed least at the cancellous bone and maximum at the implant. Conclusion: Hence, within the limitations of this study the results obtained can be applied clinically for appropriate selection of implant thread design for a predictable success of implant therapy...|$|R
50|$|Hutton {{approached}} the instrument makers Blunt Brothers, {{who came up}} with a number of tiny compasses so small, they could be secreted {{in the back of a}} button. Aircrew uniforms contained one unscrewable button with a compass inside. These buttons had <b>reversed</b> screw <b>threads</b> so that when prison guards tried to unscrew the buttons they tightened them instead. When these were discovered, other versions were invented, including a magnetised razor blade on which the G of ‘Gillette’ always pointed north when the blade was hung on a thread. From that point on, all razor blades were magnetised.|$|R
50|$|The pedal spindle is {{threaded}} to match a threaded {{hole at the}} outboard end of the cranks. Multi-piece cranks have a 9/16 in hole with 20 TPI (a diameter/pitch combination fairly unique to this application). One-piece cranks use a 1/2 in by 20 TPI hole. French pedal spindles use M14 x 1.25 (14 mm metric diameter with 1.25 mm pitch) threads, and thread loosely into a 9/16 pedal hole. The threading size is often stamped into the crank, near the pedal hole.The right-side (usually the drive-side) pedal spindle is right-hand threaded, and the left-side (usually the non-drive-side) pedal spindle is left-hand (<b>reverse)</b> <b>threaded</b> to help prevent it from becoming loose by an effect called precession.Although the left pedal turns clockwise on its bearing relative to the crank (and so would seem to tighten a right-hand thread), the force from the rider's foot presses the spindle against the crank thread at a point which rolls around clockwise {{with respect to the}} crank, thus slowly pulling the outside of the pedal spindle anticlockwise (counterclockwise) because of friction and thus would loosen a right-hand thread.For a short time in the early 1980s, Shimano made pedals and matching cranks that had a 1 in by 24 TPI interface. This was to allow a larger single bearing, as these pedals were designed to work with just one bearing on the crank side rather than the conventional design of one smaller bearing on each side.|$|R

50|$|It has two warp beams, {{though it}} can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a sley with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all back warp ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The <b>reverse</b> warp <b>threads</b> (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|R
30|$|The {{external}} morphology of {{the dental}} implant {{is a factor}} {{which leads to the}} mechanical engagement of the implant with the bone. Three-thread-design dental implants consist of three different thread designs. The first design is the micro-thread, or supra-fine thread, which is on the coronal third of the implant fixture and is attached to the cortical bone. These small, fine threads are designed for force distribution, an increase in the bone-implant contact area and a decrease in the force concentration at the abutment-implant connection area. The second design is the <b>reverse</b> buttress <b>thread,</b> which is on the middle third of the implant fixture. This design increases the retention between the implant and spongy bone and produces resistance to compressive force. The third design, the condensed thread, is located at the apical third of the implant fixture. The thinness {{at the beginning of this}} thread and an increase in thickness along the implant fixture are designed for the soft spongy bone condensability [2].|$|R

25|$|Thrilling is {{the process}} of {{threading}} and drilling (accomplished in the <b>reverse</b> order) internal <b>threads</b> using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting endmill, while the body has a thread-shaped form with a countersink cutter form near the shank. The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. This tool drills, chamfers, and threads a hole all in one compact cycle. The advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three times the diameter of the tool.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes the {{opposite}} (left-handed, counterclockwise, <b>reverse)</b> sense of <b>threading</b> {{is used for}} a special reason. A thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it. For example, some older cars and trucks had right-handed lug nuts on the right wheels and left-handed ones on the left wheels, so that, as the vehicle moved forward, the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen. For bicycle pedals, {{the one on the}} left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use. Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening. A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other. Some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections: oxygen fittings are right-handed, but acetylene, propane, and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings.|$|R
40|$|Since 1990 we {{have used}} partially-threaded 6. 5 mm {{cannulated}} steel screws to fix 14 slipped upper femoral epiphyses (SUFE). Six patients have come to screw removal, and in five of them we failed to remove {{at least one of}} the screws. In each of these five hips, the retained screw became increasingly more difficu!tto move and eventually became stuck, resisting even the use of a mole wrench. The screws were cut and left in situ (Fig. 1). In one patient deep infection led to osteomyelitis which required extensive surgery to remove the metalwork and treat the infection. Discussion. Cannulated screws are commonly used because they can be accurately placed under fluoroscopic control through small incisions. It is possible to avoid penetration of the femoral head and the clustering of screws which may lead to chondrolysis and segmental avascular necrosis (Lehman et a! 1984; Stambough et a! 1986). The removal ofsuch screws has been recommended because of the risk of trochanteric bursitis (Crandall, Gabriel and Akbarnia 1992), difficulty with subsequent arthroplasty, a possible stress riser effect leading to fracture (Stambough et a! 1986) and the theoretical risk of neop!asia from long-term corrosion of metal implants (Black 1988). Cannulated screws were designed with <b>reverse</b> cutting <b>threads</b> to facilitate easy removal, but the increasing bone mass of adolescence seems to result in dense bony ingrowth around the screws. Considerable torque is required to cut a way out, and the thread tends to clog with bone swarf that has nowhere to go. Some screws may be placed abutting the cortex and this further increases the risk of the thread engaging dense bone during removal (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{number of}} different numerical algorithms can be understood and analyzed using the concepts of symmetric spaces and Lie triple systems, which are well known in differential geometry {{from the study of}} spaces of constant curvature and their tangents. This theory can be used to unify a range of different topics, such as polar-type matrix decompositions, splitting methods for computation of the matrix exponential, composition of selfadjoint numerical integrators and dynamical systems with symmetries and <b>reversing</b> symmetries. The <b>thread</b> of this paper is the following: involutive automorphisms on groups induce a factorization at a group level, and a splitting at the algebra level. In this paper we will give an introduction to the mathematical theory behind these constructions, and review recent results. Furthermore, we present a new Yoshida-like technique, for self-adjoint numerical schemes, that allows to increase the order of preservation of symmetries by two units. Since all the time-steps are positive, the technique is particularly suited to stiff problems, where a negative time-step can cause instabilities...|$|R
