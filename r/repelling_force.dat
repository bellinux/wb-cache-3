They were conscious, therefore, that they were no favourites with the rulers of the period, and that, if Captain Porteous's violence was not altogether regarded as good service, it might certainly be thought, that to visit it with a capital punishment would render it both delicate and dangerous for future officers, in the same circumstances, to act with effect in repressing tumults. There is also a natural feeling, on the part of all members of Government, for the general maintenance of authority; and it seemed not unlikely, that what to the relatives of the sufferers appeared a wanton and unprovoked massacre, should be otherwise viewed in the cabinet of St. James's. It might be there supposed, that upon the whole matter, Captain Porteous was in the exercise of a trust delegated to him by the lawful civil authority; that he had been assaulted by the populace, and several of his men hurt; and that, in finally <b>repelling</b> <b>force</b> by force, his conduct could be fairly imputed to no other motive than self-defence in the discharge of his duty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Topological surgery {{occurs in}} natural {{phenomena}} where two points are selected and attracting or <b>repelling</b> <b>forces</b> are applied. The two points are connected via an invisible ‘thread’. In order to model topologically such phenomena we introduce dynamics in 1 -, 2 - and 3 -dimensional topological surgery, {{by means of}} attracting or <b>repelling</b> <b>forces</b> between two selected points in the manifold, and we address examples. We also introduce the notions of solid 1 - and 2 -dimensional topological surgery, and of truncated 1 -, 2 - and 3 -dimensional topological surgery, which are more appropriate for modelling natural processes. On the theoretical level, these new notions allow to visualize 3 -dimensional surgery and to connect surgeries in different dimensions. We hope that through this study, topology and dynamics of many natural phenomena as well as topological surgery may now be better understood...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{phenomena}} frequently {{involve a}} very large number of interacting molecules moving in confined regions of space. Cellular transport by motor proteins is an example of such collective behavior. We derive a deterministic compartmental model for the unidirectional flow of particles along a one-dimensional lattice of sites with nearest-neighbor interactions between the particles. The flow between consecutive sites is governed by a "soft" simple exclusion principle and by attracting or <b>repelling</b> <b>forces</b> between neighboring particles. Using tools from contraction theory, we prove that the model admits a unique steady-state and that every trajectory converges to this steady-state. Analysis and simulations of the effect of the attracting and <b>repelling</b> <b>forces</b> on this steady-state highlight the crucial role that these forces may play in increasing the steady-state flow, and reveal that this increase stems from the alleviation of traffic jams along the lattice. Our theoretical analysis clarifies microscopic aspects of complex multi-particle dynamic processes...|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{electrostatic}} {{charges are}} used to attract or repel differently charged material. When electrostatic separation uses the force of attraction to sort particles, conducting particles stick to an oppositely charged object, such as a metal drum, thereby separating them from the particle mixture. When this type of beneficiation uses <b>repelling</b> <b>force,</b> it is normally employed to change the trajectory of falling objects to sort them into different places. This way, when a mixture of particles falls past a repelling object, the particles with the correct charge fall {{away from the other}} particles when they are repelled by the similarly charged object.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} the maximum binding energy is found in {{medium-sized}} nuclei {{is a consequence of}} the trade-off in the effects of two opposing forces that have different range characteristics. The attractive nuclear force (strong nuclear force), which binds protons and neutrons equally to each other, has a limited range due to a rapid exponential decrease in this force with distance. However, the repelling electromagnetic force, which acts between protons to force nuclei apart, falls off with distance much more slowly (as the inverse square of distance). For nuclei larger than about four nucleons in diameter, the additional <b>repelling</b> <b>force</b> of additional protons more than offsets any binding energy that results between further added nucleons as a result of additional strong force interactions. Such nuclei become increasingly less tightly bound as their size increases, though most of them are still stable. Finally, nuclei containing more than 209 nucleons (larger than about 6 nucleons in diameter) are all too large to be stable, and are subject to spontaneous decay to smaller nuclei.|$|E
5000|$|The {{binding energy}} of an {{electron}}, or the energy needed {{to remove the}} electron from the atom, {{is a function of}} the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nucleus. In Iron, atomic number 26, for instance, the nucleus contains 26 protons. The electrons that are closest to the nucleus will 'see' nearly all of them. However, electrons further away are screened from the nucleus by other electrons in between, and feel less electrostatic interaction as a result. The 1s electron of Iron (the closest one to the nucleus) sees an effective atomic number (number of protons) of 25. The reason why it is not 26 is because some of the electrons in the atom end up repelling the others, giving a net lower electrostatic interaction with the nucleus. One way of envisioning this effect is to imagine the 1s electron sitting on one side of the 26 protons in the nucleus, with another electron sitting on the other side; each electron will feel less than the attractive force of 26 protons because the other electron contributes a <b>repelling</b> <b>force.</b> The 4s electrons in Iron, which are furthest from the nucleus, feel an effective atomic number of only 5.43 because of the 25 electrons in between it and the nucleus screening the charge.|$|E
