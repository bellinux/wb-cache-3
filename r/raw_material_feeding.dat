As the systems can never be emptied, there is a continous inoculation of 10 - 50 % left-over feed in the tank and the pipes, which leads to a fermentation. The dominating lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus and Pediococcus) produce lactic acid and to a minor extent acetic acid, thereby lowering the pH to 4. 0 - 5. 5.

40|$|A {{range of}} options was {{explored}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that diets for dairy cows could be formulated to reduce the carbon footprint (CFP) of feed, increase efficiency of conversion of potentially human-edible feed into milk, increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and reduce methane (CH 4) emissions per kg milk. Diets based on grazed grass, grass silage, maize silage or straw, supplemented with <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>feeds,</b> were formulated to meet requirements for metabolizable energy and metabolizable protein for a range of daily milk yields. At similar levels of milk yield, NUE, predicted CH 4 emissions and diet CFP were generally higher for diets based on maize silage than for those based on grazed grass, grass silage or straw. Predicted CH 4 emissions and human-edible proportion decreased, while NUE increased with the increasing level of milk yield. It is concluded that there is potential to reduce the environmental impact of milk production by altering diet formulation, but the extent to which this might occur is likely to depend on availability of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>feeds</b> with low CFPs...|$|R

30|$|An {{interesting}} observation, {{which was}} not related to {{the primary purpose of the}} investigation, was that the raw asphaltenes feed was detrimentally affected by heating to 100  °C. The asphaltenes content of the feed that was maintained at 100  °C for 16  h (Fig.  1) increased compared to the <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>feed,</b> but this was not reflected by a change in MCR value (Table  3). The observed increase in the asphaltenes content on heating under inert atmosphere adds evidence that indicates that oilsands bitumen-derived materials are heat sensitive [9].

40|$|A {{simple method}} was {{optimized}} and validated for determination of ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) in <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> and <b>feed</b> additives by HPLC {{for use in}} quality control in veterinary industries. The best-optimized conditions were a C 8 column (250 x 4. 6 mm id, 5. 0 mu m particle size) at room temperature with acetonitrile- 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5. 0; 75 + 25, v/v) mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min and UV detection at 275 nm. With these conditions, the retention time of RAC was around 5. 2 min, and standard curves were linear in the concentration range of 160 - 240 mu g/mL (correlation coefficient >= 0. 999). Validation parameters, such as selectivity, linearity, limit of detection (ranged from 1. 60 to 2. 05 mu g/mL), limit of quantification (ranged from 4. 26 to 6. 84 mu g/mL), precision (relative standard deviation <= 1. 87 %), accuracy (ranged from 96. 97 to 100. 54 %), and robustness, gave results within acceptable ranges.

40|$|Secondary {{aluminum}} smelting (SAl) processes {{have previously}} {{been found to}} be important sources of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). It is crucial that the key factors that influence the formation and emission of PBDD/Fs are identified to allow techniques for decreasing PBDD/F emissions during SAl processes to be developed. In this study, stack gas samples were collected from four typical secondary aluminum smelters that used different <b>raw</b> <b>materials,</b> and the samples were analyzed to allow differences between PBDD/F emissions from different SAl plants to be assessed. The composition of the <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> was found {{to be one of the}} key factors influencing the amounts of PBDD/Fs emitted. The PBDD/F emission factors (per tonne of aluminum produced) for the plants using 100 % (Plant 1), 80 % (Plant 2), and 50 % (Plant 3) dirty aluminum scrap in the <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>feed</b> were 180, 86, and 14 mu g t(- 1), respectively. The amounts of PBDD/Fs emitted at different stages of the smelting process (feeding-fusion, refining, and casting) were compared, and the feeding-fusion stage was found to be the main stage in which PBDD/Fs were formed and emitted. Effective aluminum scrap pre-treatments could significantly decrease PBDD/F emissions. Much higher polybrominated dibenzofuran concentrations than polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxin concentrations were found throughout the SAl process. The more-brominated congeners (including octabromodibenzo-p-dioxin, octabromodibenzofuran, heptabromodibenzo-p-dioxins, and heptabromodibenzofurans) were the dominant contributors to the total PBDD/F concentrations. The results could help in the development of techniques and strategies for controlling PBDD/F emissions during metallurgical processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In the case of an established process such as the ethylbenzene production process investigated here, the optimization involves improving an established process and choosing the best available case within a set of constraints that also considers maximizing the economic bottom line. An objective function must be selected for an optimization problem which defines the achievable goal. The objective function of the optimization process presented here is to minimize the estimated annual operating cost (EAOC). An EAOC takes in to account all the necessary variables that add up to the yearly operating costs of a chemical process such as utility and <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> costs. The secondary objective function presented here is maximizing the net present value (NPV) which is directly related to minimizing the EAOC. The NPV takes in to account the recurring costs of plant operation over a plant’s expected lifetime. Both objective functions are assessed and considered. By defining a number of constraints and decision variables related to the objective function, an optimization problem becomes a dynamic and creative exercise.

Initial <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>feeds</b> may fluctuate over time, possibly resulting in inefficient use of energy resources. This paper describes a study on power generation capabilities of such a plant. Off-gasses from various steel production processes are utilized in boilers; producing steam for the Works. Excess steam is used for power generation. The Works experienced unstable power generation, due to fluctuations in available steam. This resulted in regular turbine trips, causing power generation losses, additional gas flaring and reducing machine life expectancy. To address this problem; off-gas and steam production data were analyzed over three months. A control approach was set up, where the algorithm’s objective was optimum power generation, for a 5 MW and 30 MW turbine. Results showed potential power generation increase over 26 % was possible, still not eliminating trips. The algorithm incorporated the possibility of burning natural gas in a boiler, when needed.

Numerous models has been published depicting the optimization of the <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> usage in an arc furnace, as well as the thermal and electrical efficiency; however, to obtain a holistic view of the cost-effectiveness of the process one needs to expand the model to include the cost of all the operational variables. This project therefore aimed to not only include the <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>feeds</b> and power consumption as input variables, but also the labour, maintenance, and environmental costs to generate an all-inclusive financial balance. In the end, the model was able to mathematically optimize the ferrochrome (FeCr) production process through evaluating the effect of a specified combination of input parameters. It could therefore be used as a tool to aid in managerial decisionmaking; to appraise and correspondingly adjust certain operational variables in order to achieve a maximum return on investment.
