5000|$|While making {{statements}} of regret about the incident, the airman was quickly transported {{back to the}} United States. More detailed data about the hearings on the Hatfield case were published in late December 2010 via the web site Russian Reporter, which issued a series of dispatches from the State Department and U.S. embassies, supposedly originating from the WikiLeaks archive. In one of them, dated July 2009, the State Department provided a briefing to the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek regarding the case of Hatfield. It recommended communication with the Kyrgyz authorities in respect of the incident. Hatfield was subject to [...] "administrative measures", details of which are not disclosed in the dispatch. [...] "Junior Sergeant Hatfield was subject to severe administrative measures against him, which will have long-term effects and negatively affect his career," [...] the dispatch promised. But criminal charges against Hatfield never went to a military court. According to the dispatch, the officer authorized to initiate court-martial was General Arthur Lichte, a commander at the airbase, who, [...] "after reviewing {{the report of the}} Article 32 investigation and considering the advice of his staff judge advocate...dismissed the charge against SrA Hatfield," [...] the dispatch states. It said that Lichte had ruled for a non-prosecution based [...] "on his own professional and impartial judgment of {{the facts of the case}} and the evidence that was available." [...] The reasons for Lichte’s decision were not explained in the dispatch. [...] "Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a convening authority generally does not explain his or her rationale for a <b>referral</b> <b>decision,</b> so as to preserve the impartiality and independence of the military justice system", explained the dispatch. The paper reports that General Lichte was given the power of referral because he was not previously involved in the investigation of the case, nor in the chain of command relating to SrA Hatfield.|$|E

40|$|Gender disproportionality {{in special}} {{education}} has been an issue for many years. This disproportionality is most apparent among students with emotional or behavioral disorders, where males make up approximately 75 % of the population. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> of secondary regular education and special education teachers based on externalizing and internalizing behaviors associated with emotional/behavioral disorders. Results from two schools, urban and suburban, were compared based on teacher gender and area of expertise (regular education vs. special education). The hypotheses were: Externalizing behaviors would elicit more referrals; Females would refer more; Regular education teachers would refer more for externalizing behaviors; and Special education teachers would refer more for internalizing behaviors. In the urban school, the only hypothesis supported was that regular education teachers would be more likely to refer for externalizing behaviors. In the suburban school, the only hypothesis not supported was that special education teachers would be more likely to refer for internalizing behaviors. The urban and suburban characters of the schools, along with the differences in teacher' perceptions, ages, and years of experience, likely affect <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> Given the implications of <b>referral</b> <b>decisions,</b> more research ofthese variables should be conducted.

This study explores the factors that influence GPs <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> Qualitative interviews were conducted with 50 GPs from two cities in southern UK. The study found that GPs draw on notions of abnormal bereavement in making <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> Indicators of bereavement problems related to: the nature of the death; level of social support; and reaction to the death. GPs views about the types of patients likely to benefit from counselling were further criteria employed in <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> The study indicated that consideration of these factors may discriminate against certain types of patients being referred.

The {{applicability}} of published models of the <b>referral</b> <b>decision</b> in general practice was investigated by asking general practitioners (GPs) to record data on consultations during which referral to a consultant's out-patient clinic was considered, whether this resulted in referral or not. The GPs were then interviewed about their decisions with particular reference to patient factors, clinical factors, {{their perception of the}} risk involved, consultant factors and time factors. The doctors varied in the weight that they gave to the patient's wishes, and also in their selection and interpretation of diagnostic data. Risk to the patient was rarely a major consideration; neither was risk to the doctor's self-esteem. There was virtually no evidence of conflict arising during the decision-making process, and doctors on the whole, did not feel pressed for time. This was, however, a serf-selected sample of highly motivated general practitioners. It is suggested that the assumptions on which the conflict model of decision-making is based do not apply to the majority of referral decisions in general practice...|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} examine the factors {{influencing}} referral to rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury (TBI) by using social problems theory as a conceptual model to focus on practitioners {{and the process of}} decision-making in two Australian hospitals. The research design involved semi-structured interviews with 18 practitioners and observations of 10 team meetings, and {{was part of a larger}} study on factors influencing referral to rehabilitation in the same settings. Analysis revealed that <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> were influenced primarily by practitioners 2 ̆ 7 selection and their interpretation of clinical and non-clinical patient factors. Further, practitioners generally considered patient factors concurrently during an ongoing process of decision-making, with the combinations and interactions of these factors forming the basis for interpretations of problems and referral justifications. Key patient factors considered in <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> included functional and tracheostomy status, time since injury, age, family, place of residence and Indigenous status. However, rate and extent of progress, recovery potential, safety and burden of care, potential for independence and capacity to cope were five interpretative themes, which emerged as the justifications for <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> The subsequent negotiation of referral based on patient factors was in turn shaped by the involvement of practitioners. While multi-disciplinary processes of decision-making were the norm, allied health professionals occupied a central role in referral to rehabilitation, and involvement of medical, nursing and allied health practitioners varied. Finally, the organizational pressures and resource constraints, combined with practitioners 2 ̆ 7 assimilation of the broader efficiency agenda were central factors shaping referral.

It is important for orthodontists to understand the factors influencing the <b>referral</b> <b>decision</b> {{in order to be}} able to satisfy both the referring dentists and the patients. A specifically designed questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 634 GDPs in The Netherlands. In part A, general characteristics of the GDPs such as gender, years in practice, number of patients in the practice, possibilities to refer to an orthodontist, and number of patients referred to the orthodontist per year were collected. Part B assessed the importance of 20 various factors related to the GDPs’ usual <b>referral</b> <b>decision.</b> Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess the relationship in rank scores of the items of the various groups. The response rate was 60 per cent. Most GDPs (38 per cent) had the possibility to refer to three to four orthodontists, 22 per cent could choose between five and six, and 21 per cent could refer to one or two. Most GDPs (55 per cent) actually referred to one to two orthodontic specialists, while 34 per cent choose between three and four orthodontists. The rank order of the items for male and female dentists was nearly equal (ICC = 0. 99, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background A well-functioning {{referral}} system {{is fundamental to}} primary health care delivery. Understanding the providers' referral decision-making process becomes critical. This study's aim {{was to assess the}} correctness of diagnoses and appropriateness of the providers' referral decisions from health centers (HCs) to district hospitals (DHs) among patients with severe malaria and pneumonia. Methods A record review of twelve months of consultations was conducted covering eight randomly selected HCs to identify severe malaria (SM) cases among children under five and pneumonia cases among adults. The correctness of the diagnosis and appropriateness of providers' referral decisions were determined using the National Clinical Guidebook as a 'gold standard'. Results Among the 457 SM cases affecting children under five, only 66 cases (14. 4 %) were correctly diagnosed and of those 66 correctly diagnosed cases, 40 cases (60. 6 %) received an appropriate <b>referral</b> <b>decision</b> from their providers. Within these 66 correctly diagnosed SM cases, only 60. 6 % were appropriately referred. Among the adult pneumonia cases, 5. 9 % (79 / 1331) of the diagnoses were correctly diagnosed; however, the appropriateness rate of the provider's <b>referral</b> <b>decision</b> was 98. 7 % (78 / 79). There was only one case that should not have been referred but was referred. Conclusions The adherence to the National Guidelines among the health center providers when making a diagnosis was low for both severe malaria cases and pneumonia cases. The appropriateness of the referral decisions was particularly poor for children with severe malaria. Health center providers need to be better trained in the diagnostic process and in disease management in order to improve the performance of the {{referral system}} in rural Burkina Faso. </p...|$|E

The development of the self-administered online questionnaire for the assessment of familial and hereditary CRC risk was based on nationwide criteria for referral to genetic specialists due to a Lynch syndrome suspicion, as well as existing criteria for surveillance colonoscopies because of an increased risk of familial CRC. The questionnaire was validated at a private colonoscopy center. Patients scheduled for colonoscopy were enrolled (n = 150). Performance of the questionnaire was assessed by comparing referrals based on questionnaire data against <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> based on full pedigree data. In a second validation phase, referrals based on questionnaire data were compared with referrals based on data collected in a telephone interview. We also calculated inter-observer agreement in <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> In the first validation phase, the questionnaire had a sensitivity of 90 % (95 % CI 55 - 98 %) at a specificity of 98 % (95 % CI 87 - 100 %) in identifying persons qualifying for referral.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether there is regional variation in environmental (non-medical) factors affecting <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> of family physicians (FPs). DESIGN: Cross-sectional interview survey. SETTING: Nova Scotia. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 125 FPs grouped into 1 of 5 functionally defined geographic regions of Nova Scotia (25 in each group). Groupings were based on access to general hospital beds through active staff hospital appointments or to specialist consultants in the community, or both. Participants were personally interviewed on site. No physician refused an interview. In 9 cases the physician indicated {{that he or she}} did not fit the profile of the assigned group; the physician was excluded from the study and the next doctor on the list was substituted. OUTCOME MEASURES: The questionnaire was designed to test several hypotheses about factors known to potentially influence <b>decisions</b> about <b>referral.</b> Geographic differences in factors affecting <b>referral</b> and in <b>decisions</b> about 5 hypothetical cases were assessed with the use of significance tests for proportions that were sensitive to specific orders across groups. RESULTS: Three factors affecting referral showed unequivocal variation across the 5 groups. Access to hospital facilities and remoteness from specialist care, leading to local styles of practice or treatment policies, and the FP's relationship with specialist consultants appeared to be important nonmedical factors affecting <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> For similar case scenarios the physicians living in rural areas would refer only half as often overall as those living in urban areas with tertiary care hospitals; for some cases, such as a severe asthma attack, the difference was more than 7 -fold. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in nonmedical factors affecting referral, and in <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> about hypothetical cases, were found between the groups of FPs. Differences in access to resources, creating local styles of practice, appeared to explain most of the variation. The results may account for previously observed differences in actual rates of referral for these particular groups...|$|R

High referrers were found to mention significantly more negative factors than low referrers, i. e. they referred ‘in spite of’ reasons against referral. In particular, they referred patients in spite of having doubts about treatment effectiveness. Low referrers mentioned factors related to interpersonal processes significantly more often than high referrers, for example, GP-patient communication as an influence.

This model also comprises of a set of healthcare service discovery processes: articulating a service need, matching the need with the healthcare service offerings, and deciding on a best-fit service for acceptance. As a result, the healthcare service provision can carry out coherent analysis using personalised information and iterative processes that deal with requirements change over time...|$|E
40|$|Background: Specialty care {{access is}} {{increasingly}} constrained due to increasing demand for specialty care.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of new patient visits using electronic medical record data. The primary outcome was a follow-up visit. Results: Substantial variation in practice patterns by provider persisted after accounting for patient and disease factors. Most follow-up care was concentrated in a small population of patients. Conclusion: Specialty care follow-up visits may represent a significant opportunity for standardization and quality improvement, and further studies are warranted to understand follow-up visits in specialty care. Implications: Better understanding of between-provider differences could identify ways to reduce unnecessary follow-up visits. Level of Evidence: Single-institution study...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To explore midwives’ intrapartum <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> in {{relation}} to their dispositional attitude towards risk. Design: A web-based correlation study examined the association between midwives personality (personal risk tendency); place of work (location); years experience and the timing of their <b>decisions</b> to make <b>referrals</b> (referral score) in a series of fictitious case scenarios (vignettes). Participants: Sample - 102 midwives providing labour care in both Consultant Led Units (CLU) and Community Maternity Units (CMU) from four Scottish Health Board areas. Analysis: A correlational analysis was carried out to test the association between total risk scores and midwives’ referral scores. Between-group comparisons were also conducted for experienced versus inexperienced midwives, midwives practising in consultant versus CMU settings and between the four Health Board Areas. Findings: Despite being presented with identical information in the vignettes, midwives made a wide range of <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> There was no association between referral scores and measures of risk, personality or years of experience. No statistically significant difference between the referral scores of midwives working in CLUs or CMUs was observed. However, a statistically significant difference did emerge between the four Health Board areas, with midwives from one area making referrals at a significantly earlier stage. The maternity services in this area had experienced several high profile adverse events prior to this study; which may have influenced their referral behaviour (the availability heuristic), so as to make more cautious decisions. Key conclusions: There was no evidence that variability in the range of <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> was due to personality factors, risk propensity, experience or whether the midwife worked in a CLU or CMU. Local factors such as recent adverse events may significantly influence subsequent referral behaviour. Further research is required to identify why the midwives showed so much unexplained variability in their responses to the vignettes...|$|R

40|$|Background- Report cards of {{risk-adjusted}} {{mortality rates}} of individual cardiac surgeons have been publicly available in New York State since 1991. A survey of New York cardiologists in 1996 {{found that these}} report cards {{had little effect on}} their referral recommendations to cardiac surgeons. It is unknown whether the influence of report cards on referral behavior has changed over time. Methods and Results- We surveyed cardiologists in New York State in 2011 to determine their awareness of cardiac surgeon report cards, their use of the report card in formulating judgments about the quality of cardiac surgeons and selecting cardiac surgeons for referral of patients, and discussion of the report with patients in need of cardiac surgery. The relation between demographic (age, sex) and professional (teaching, board certification, faculty appointment, general cardiology practice, and hospital employee) characteristics and the influence of report cards on <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> was assessed using chi(2) for categorical variables and t test for continuous variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to determine the independent association of any variable with P< 0. 1 on univariate analysis. Almost all (94 %) cardiologists were aware of report cards of cardiac surgeons. The influence of the report cards on cardiologists' <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> was limited, with 25 % of cardiologists reporting a moderate or substantial influence on <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> The report card was not discussed with any patients by 71 % of cardiologists. The mean age of cardiologists reporting moderate or substantial influence of report cards was 58 years compared with 54 years for those who reported no/little influence (P= 0. 012). Fewer cardiologists who reported moderate or substantial influence were board certified (91 % versus 99 %; P= 0. 003). On multivariate analysis, general cardiology practice and employment by a hospital were independently associated with greater report card influence (odds ratio, 1. 03; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 01 - 1. 05; P= 0. 13).

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that primary care should become more involved in providing genetic services, such as basic risk assessment, to enable patients with a moderate/high risk to be referred and those with a low risk to receive reassurance and advice from their general practitioner (GP). However, GPs currently lack knowledge and confidence in this area. Aim: To investigate the effect of an in-practice educational session and information pack on GP management of familial breast/ovarian cancer cases. Design of study: Cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: GP principals in 170 practices in Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire. Of the 688 GPs, 426 (62 %) participated. Method: Practices were randomised either to Group A (receiving an inpractice educational session plus information pack), Group B (receiving an information pack alone), or Group C (receiving neither an educational session nor a pack). The main study outcome was the proportion of GPs making the correct <b>referral</b> <b>decision</b> on at least five out of six family history vignettes. A secondary outcome was GPs' reported confidence in managing patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer, measured by a score that was generated by combining responses to four questions. Results: There was a 40 % (95 % CI = 30 - 50 %, P < 0. 001) improvement in the proportion of GPs who made the correct <b>referral</b> <b>decision</b> on at least five out of the six vignettes in Group A (111 / 140 [79 %]) compared with Group C (controls) (63 / 162 [39 %]), and a 42 % (95 % CI = 31 - 52 %, P < 0. 001) improvement in Group B (100 / 124 [81 %]) compared with the control group. There was a trend in reported confidence in the management of individuals with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer from a mean confidence score of 2. 3 in Group A to 2. 0 in Group B and 1. 5 in Group C (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Providing GPs with an information pack significantly improved referral decisions regarding patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer. Although extremely well received, an in-house educational session produced no additional improvements. There were, however, greater levels of reported confidence in the group who received the educational session in addition to the information pack...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} part of Unni Ringberg's {{doctoral}} thesis which is available in Munin at [URL] Referral rates of general practitioners (GPs) are an important determinant of secondary care utilization. The variation in these rates across GPs is considerable, and cannot be explained by patient morbidity alone. The main objective {{of this study was}} to assess the GPs’ referral rate to secondary care in Norway, any associations between the <b>referral</b> <b>decision</b> and patient, GP, health care characteristics and who initiated the referring issue in the consultation. The probabilities of referral to secondary care and/or radiological examination were examined in 100 consecutive consultations of 44 randomly chosen Norwegian GPs. The GPs recorded whether the issue of referral was introduced, who introduced it and if the patient was referred. Multilevel and naive multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore associations between the probability of referral and patient, GP and health care characteristics. Of the 4350 consultations included, 13. 7 % (GP range 4. 0 %- 28. 0 %) of patients were referred to secondary somatic and psychiatric care. Female GPs referred significantly more frequently than male GPs (16. 0 % versus 12. 6 %, adjusted odds ratio, AOR, 1. 25), specialists in family medicine less frequently than their counterparts (12. 5 % versus 14. 9 %, AOR 0. 76) and salaried GPs more frequently than private practitioners (16. 2 % versus 12. 1 %, AOR 1. 36). In 4. 2 % (GP range 0 %- 12. 9 %) of the consultations, patients were referred to radiological examination. Specialists in family medicine, salaried GPs and GPs with a Norwegian medical degree referred significantly more frequently to radiological examination than their counterparts (AOR 1. 93, 2. 00 and 1. 73, respectively). The issue of referral was introduced in 23 % of the consultations, and in 70. 6 % of these cases by the GP. The high referrers introduced the referral issue significantly more frequently and also referred a significantly larger proportion when the issue was introduced. The main finding of the present study was a high overall referral rate, and a striking range among the GPs. Male GPs and specialists in family medicine referred significantly less frequently to secondary care, but the latter referred more frequently to radiological examination. Our findings indicate that intervention on high referrers is a potential area for quality improvement, and there is a need to explore the <b>referral</b> <b>decision</b> process itself...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to detect Turkish pre-service {{elementary}} school teachers' perceptions of giftedness and factors affecting their <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> through eleven profiles (scenarios) originally created by five experts in the field of gifted education and semi-structured interview questions created for this study. The original profiles were translated from English to Turkish and adapted to be more relevant to Turkish culture. These profiles were named as Student Profiles Survey in this study. The profiles were varied based on characteristics embedded in each profile and I was able to create eight versions (pile) of the Student Profiles Survey. Profiles in each version (pile) of Student Profiles Survey differed from each other based on the characteristics embedded in each profile. Participants of the study were Turkish pre-service elementary school teachers who were attending two colleges of Education at Gaziantep University, namely Gaziantep College of Education and Nizip College of Education. A total of 204 Turkish pre-service elementary school teachers participated in the study and filled out the different versions of Student Profiles Survey. Approximately 25 pre-service teachers filled out each version of Student Profiles Survey. In addition, 16 of the pre-service teachers were asked for a follow-up interview. The convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used to shed light on the research questions. The findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses were combined to support each other and to better investigate Turkish pre-service elementary school teachers' perceptions of giftedness and factors affecting their <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> The results of this study indicated that Profile 11 was the most appropriate and Profile 4 was the least appropriate profile for Turkish pre-service elementary school teachers' perceptions of giftedness. Turkish pre-service elementary school teachers explained their reasons for including the students in the profiles to gifted education programs mostly based on the personal, academic, and social characteristics of the students embedded in the profiles but they did not often referred students' characteristics when they were explaining their reasons for exclusion. Rather than explaining their reasons based on characteristics of the students, Turkish pre-service teachers increased their expectations and created excuses to underestimate the potentials of the students in the profiles when they were asked to explain their reasons for exclusion. The results of factorial ANOVAs indicated that Turkish pre-service elementary school teachers' <b>referral</b> <b>decisions</b> were influenced by the following factors: Students’ and pre-service teachers’ gender, students' ability areas, personality traits of the students, words describing the student, and students' length of passion...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{diagnosis}} of {{motor neurone disease}} (MND) {{is known to be}} challenging and there may be delay in patients receiving a correct diagnosis. This study investigated the referral process for patients who had been diagnosed with MND, and whether a newly-developed tool (The Red Flags checklist) might help General Practitioners (GPs) in making <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> Methods We carried out interviews with GPs who had recently referred a patient diagnosed with MND, and interviews/surveys with GPs who had not recently referred a patient with suspected MND. We collected data before the Red Flags checklist was introduced; and again one year later. We analysed the data to identify key recurring themes. Results Forty two GPs took part in the study. The presence of fasciculation was the clinical feature that most commonly led to consideration of a potential MND diagnosis. GPs perceived that their role was to make onward referrals rather than attempting to make a diagnosis, and delays in correct diagnosis tended to occur at the specialist level. A quarter of participants had some awareness of the newly-developed tool; most considered it useful, if incorporated into existing systems. Conclusions While fasciculation is the most common symptom associated with MND, other bulbar, limb or respiratory features, together with progression should be considered. There is a need for further research into how decision-support tools should be designed and provided, in order to best assist GPs with <b>referral</b> <b>decisions.</b> There is also a need for further work at the level of secondary care, in order that referrals made are re-directed appropriately. ...|$|R
