40|$|Validation of {{land cover}} {{products}} {{is a fundamental}} task prior to data applications. Current validation schemes and methods are, however, suited only for assessing classification accuracy and disregard the reliability of land cover products. The <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of land cover products should be undertaken to provide reliable land cover information. In addition, the lack of high-quality reference data often constrains validation and affects the reliability results of land cover products. This study proposes a validation schema to evaluate the reliability of land cover products, including two methods, namely, result <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> and process <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Result <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> computes the reliability of land cover products using seven reliability indicators. Process <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> analyzes the reliability propagation in the data production process to obtain the reliability of land cover products. Fuzzy fault tree analysis is introduced and improved in the reliability analysis of a data production process. Research {{results show that the}} proposed <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> scheme is reasonable and can be applied to validate land cover products. Through the analysis of the seven indicators of result <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation,</b> more information on land cover can be obtained for strategic decision-making and planning, compared with traditional accuracy assessment methods.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{importance}} and necessity of conducting studies on grid <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> have been increasingly important {{in recent years}} due {{to the number of}} black-out events occurring through in the world. Quantity evaluation of transmission system reliability is very important in a competitive electricity environment. The reason is that the successful operation of electric power under a deregulated electricity market depends on transmission system reliability management. Also in Korea it takes places.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a systematic}} study of electric {{power distribution system}} <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> and improvement. <b>Reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of electric power systems has traditionally been {{an integral part of}} planning and operation. Changes in the electric utility coupled with aging electric apparatus create a need for more realistic techniques for power system reliability modeling. This work presents a <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> technique that combines set theory and Graph Trace Analysis (GTA). Unlike the traditional Markov approach, this technique provides a fast solution for large system <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> by managing computer memory efficiently with iterators, assuming a single failure at a time. A reconfiguration for restoration algorithm is also created to enhance the accuracy of the <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation,</b> considering multiple concurrent failures. As opposed to most restoration simulation methods used in reliability analysis, which convert restoration problems into mathematical models and only can solve radial systems, this new algorithm seeks the ii...|$|E

30|$|The {{composite}} system <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> gives potential shedding load indices in the subsystem [9]. The evaluation is commonly {{implemented by the}} methodology of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). In the conventional works solving reserve allocation problems, however, the {{composite system}} <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> based on MCS has not received direct application since {{it is difficult to}} include the process in the optimization frame. In this paper, we proposed a two-level iterative model that includes economic reserve allocation and composite <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Through the iteration method the reserve schedule is progressively optimized, while simultaneously the <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> based on composite generation and transmission system is completed. Additionally, regional reliability indices are obtained among the iteration steps.|$|E
40|$|<b>Reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of phasor {{measurement}} unit (PMU) is a primary key element in the <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of wide-area monitoring system (WAMS). In this paper, a comprehensive <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> method based on Monte Carlo dynamic fault tree (MCDFT) analysis is proposed to conduct the <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> on PMU. The reliability model of PMU is constructed using dynamic fault tree modeling and analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the reliability indices of PMU. The validity and advantages of the proposed MCDFT <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of PMU were verified with simulation and comparison studies. Importance analysis showed that basic components in the GPS receiver and CPU hardware modules have high impacts on the reliability of PMU.

40|$|<b>Reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> is {{the basis}} for {{reliability}} design of NC machine tools. Since traditional <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods do not consider the working conditions’ effects on reliability, there is a great error of a result of a traditional method compared with an actual value. A new <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> model of NC machine tools is proposed based on the Cox proportional hazards model, which describes the mathematical relation between the working condition covariates and the reliability level of NC machine tools. Firstly, the coefficients of working condition covariates in the new <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> model are estimated by the partial likelihood estimation method; secondly, the working condition covariates which have no effects on the reliability of NC machine tools are eliminated by the likelihood ratio test; then parameters of the baseline failure rate function are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method. Thus, the <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> model of NC machine tool is obtained under different working conditions and the reliability level of NC machine tools is obtained. Case study shows that the proposed method could establish the relation between the working condition covariates and the reliability level of NC machine tools, and it would provide a new way for the <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of NC machine tools...|$|E
40|$|System {{identification}} and <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{play a significant}} role in structural health monitoring to ensure the serviceability and safety of existing structures. Although the development of system identification methods has attained much attention and some degree of maturity, <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of existing structures still remains a challenging problem especially when uncertainties in measurement data and inherent randomness, which are inevitably involved in civil structures, are considered. In this regard, this paper presents a framework for integrated system {{identification and}} <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of stochastic building structures. Two algorithms are proposed to respectively evaluate component reliability and system reliability of stochastic building structures by combining a statistical moment-based system identification method and a probability density evolution equation-based <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> method. System identification is embedded in the procedure of <b>reliability</b> <b>evaluation</b> of a stochastic building structure. The uncertainties in both the structure and the external excitation are considered.
