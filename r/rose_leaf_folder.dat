In the present study, the physiological and cytological mechanisms underlying the enhanced resistance of plants with Si addition were investigated {{for one of}} the most destructive rice pests in Asian countries, the rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder,</b> Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée). Activities of defense-related enzymes, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and polyphenol oxidase, and concentrations of malondialdehyde and soluble protein in leaves were measured in rice plants with or without <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> infestation and with or without Si amendment at 0. 32 g Si/kg soil. Silicon amendment significantly reduced <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> larval survival. Silicon addition alone did not change activities of defense-related enzymes and malondialdehyde concentration in rice leaves. With <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> infestation, activities of the defense-related enzymes increased and malondialdehyde concentration decreased in plants amended with Si. Soluble protein content increased with Si addition when the plants were not infested, but was reduced more in the infested plants with Si amendment than in those without Si addition. Regardless of <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> infestation, Si amendment significantly increased leaf Si content through increases in the number and width of silica cells. Our results show that Si addition enhances rice resistance to the <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> through priming the feeding stress defense system, reduction in soluble protein content and cell silicification of rice leaves...|$|R

The main objectives of the studies were to screen out the various genotypes of rice against the rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> in order not only to identify the primary and secondary metabolites in comparatively resistant genotypes responsible for resistance mechanism but also to find out the impact of abiotic factors, like relative humidity, temperature, rainfall etc. on the population fluctuations of rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> in addition to checking out of the efficacy of microbial and botanical insecticide against Cnaphalocrocis medinalis alone and in integration with an egg parasitoid Trichogramma chilonis for a successful control of the rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder.</b> The data on post treatment increase in leaf-infestation and larval-population were recorded 10 days after the application of various treatments. The data on paddy-yield were, however, recorded at harvest. Cost benefit ratios were calculated, respectively, for each treatment, in order to evaluate their relative cost efficiency. In the present project, sixteen advanced elite lines of coarse and fine rice including locally recommended varieties were screened for their high, intermediate resistance and susceptible responses based on the percentage of leaf-infestation, caused by Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee) during 2005.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{for determining}} the multiple insect-pest incidence on yield loss in basmati rice was conducted for two crop seasons. Five treatments were, viz. application of imidacloprid in vegetative stage; application of granular insecticide in vegetative stage; application of higher dose of Urea; augmentive releases of yellow stem borer egg mass at vegetative and booting stage; untreated control. During both the years, the correlation between grain yield and dead heart, <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> damage and planthopper population at 50 and 65 DAT and white ear at maturity was negative. The analysis of variance of regression analysis of yield Vs damage levels at different crop growth stages during both the years revealed a significant linear relationship. The yield loss was highly related to incidence of stem borer and <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> damage at 50 and 65 DAT during both the years. For integrated pest management, effective monitoring of stem borer and <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> from 50 to 65 DAT is required, which appeared as a critical crop growth stage.

40|$|Lepidopteran {{insect pests}} {{are the main}} class of pests causing {{significant}} damage to crop plant yields. Insecticidal scorpion peptides exhibit toxicity specific for insects. Here, we report that a peptide LMX, optimized from the insect-specific scorpion neurotoxin LqhIT 2, showed high levels of activity against rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> in vitro and in planta. Oral ingestion of LMX protein led to {{a significant decrease in}} feeding on rice leaves, repression of larval growth and development, delay in molting, and increase in larval lethality. Compared with LqhIT 2 protein, the stability and insecticidal efficacy of LMX was better. Meanwhile, biochemical analysis showed that LMX protein ingestion dramatically decreased ecdysone content in rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> larvae, and down-regulated enzymatic activities of the detoxification system (a-naphthyl acetate esterase and glutathione S-transferase), the digestive system (tryptase and chymotrypsin), and the antioxidant system (catalase). These changes were tightly correlated with the dosage of LMX protein. Transgene analysis showed that the rate of leaf damage, and the number of damaged tillers and leaves in the transgenic line were greatly reduced relative to wild type plants and empty vector plants. Based on these observations, we propose that the insect-specific scorpion neurotoxin peptide LMX is an attractive and effective alternative molecule for the protection of rice from rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against <b>leaf</b> <b>folders</b> for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Incidence of <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> (LF), Cnaphalocrocis medinalis {{population}} in paddy crop (Oryza sativa L.) {{was assessed by}} light trapping during four consecutive kharif crop seasons (2005 - 2008) at Hemtabad, Uttar Dinajpur, West Bengal. The LF population was initiated at about 25 standard meteorological weeks (SMW), improved at first slowly up to 27 SMW then steadily up to 32 SMW attaining the maximum at about 34 SMW which was maintained up to about 37 SMW. The population then subsumed at first slowly up to 40 SMW then abruptly. Abiotic conditions such as minimum temperature, temperature gradient, maximum relative humidity and average relative humidity had significant positive influence on C. medinalis population. In case of minimum relative humidity and sunshine hours a negative influence was observed. In addition, other factors such as maximum temperature, relative humidity gradient, average relative humidity, number of rainy days and rainfall imparted insignificant positive effect on population development. Based {{on the nature of}} incidence and abundance of C. medinalis, a package can be generated and accordingly time fitted seedling transplantation as the precautionary measure may be highlighted in the northern parts of West Bengal.

Initially putative transformants were screened for pesticidal activity against rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> larvae. Selected putative transformants showed a range of larval mortality from 20 - 100 percent to C. medinalis. The integration of the Bt cry gene was checked by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), using primers 5 ` ACA GAA GAC CCT TCA ATA TC 3 ` and 3 ` GTT ACC GAG TGA AGA TGT AA 5 ` for amplification of a 656 bp fragment of DNA from the genomic DNA of putative transformants. Selection based on PCR and initial bioassays, two transgenic plants designated as, CAMB 1148 and CAMB 1150 were further confirmed for toxin expression by ELISA, Western blot analysis and comparative biotoxicity assay. ELISA and Western blot were performed with polyclonal antibody of Cry 1 Ac toxins that showed the presence of active ingredient of Bt toxin in both plants.
