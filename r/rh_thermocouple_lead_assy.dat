40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{between the}} working fluid and the combustion chamber in an {{internal combustion engine}} {{is one of the}} most important parameters for cycle simulation and analysis.

40|$|A gas {{containment}} vessel {{that is not}} in thermal equilibrium with the bulk gas can affect its temperature measurement. The physical nature of many gas dynamics experiments often makes the accurate measurement of temperature a challenge. The environment itself typically requires that the thermocouple be sheathed, both to protect the wires and hot junction of the instrument from their environment, and to provide a smooth, rigid surface for pressure sealing of the enclosure. However, that enclosure may also be much colder than the gas to be sensed, or vice-versa. Either way, the effect of such gradients is to potentially skew the temperature measurements themselves, since heat may then be conducted by the instrument. Thermocouple designers traditionally address this problem by insulating the sheath from the <b>thermocouple</b> <b>leads</b> and hot junction as much as possible. The <b>thermocouple</b> <b>leads</b> are typically packed in a ceramic powder inside the sheath, protecting them somewhat from temperature gradients along the sheath, but there is no effective mechanism to shield the sheath from the enclosure body itself. Standard practice dictates that thermocouples be used in installations that do not present large thermal gradients along the probe. If this conduction dominates heat transfer near the tip of the probe, then temperature measurements may be expected to be skewed. While the same problem may be experienced in the measurement of temperature at various points within a solid in a gradient, it tends to be aggravated in the measurements of gas temperature, since heat transfer dependent on convection is often less efficient than conduction along the thermocouple. The proposed solution is an inefficient fin thermocouple probe. Conventional wisdom suggests that in many experiments where gas flows through an enclosure (e. g., flow in pipe, manifold, nozzle, etc.), the thermocouple be introduced flush to the surface, so as not to interfere with the flow. In practice, however, many such experiments take place where the flow is already turbulent, so that a protruding thermocouple probe has a negligible effect on the flow characteristics. The key question then becomes just how far into the flow should a thermocouple protrude in order to properly sense the gas temperature at that point. Modeling the thermocouple as an "inefficient fin" directly addresses this question. The appropriate assumptions in this case are: one-dimensional conduction along the fin; steady-state, constant, and homogeneous thermal conductivity; negligible radiation; and a uniform, constant heat transfer coefficient over the probe surface. It is noted that the nature of the ceramic-filled probe makes the key assumption of homogeneous thermal conductivity that much more conservative...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{stress in}} {{livestock}} production consistently alters several commercial aspects within the agricultural industry. Reproductive efficiency and variability, growth performance, and carcass merit {{are a few}} of those factors. Ultimately, the agricultural research community has been investigating technologies to combat the effects of heat stress to increase commercial productivity and general animal husbandry. This research project investigated the effect of the temperature probe orientation of a Swine Cooling Pad developed at Purdue University through collaboration between Agricultural and Biological Engineering and Animal Sciences. The overall purpose of the Purdue Swine Cooling Pad is to reduce heat stress on sows pre- and post-farrowing, and during lactation stages. The original design expressed a temperature probe orientation in a horizontal manner in which the probe’s tip, where temperature data were collected, did not directly contact with the unit’s platform plate. The platform plate was where the sow was laying during testing and the main component of heat transfer between the sow’s warmer body temperature and the cooler groundwater running through internal copper coil system. One of the main points of interest in this Swine Cooling Pad research investigation was accurately expressing the heat transfer from the sow to the copper coil system and obtaining accurate temperature data in real time. Several varieties of temperature probe orientations were proposed while trying to keep every other aspect of the Swine Cooling Pad the same, with the end goal being able to identify which temperature probe orientation offers the most accurate and precise data relative to known values and which orientation was the most feasible with the commercialization process for the research stakeholders. Temperature data from two separate collection systems were assessed using analyses that document differences in the probe’s responsiveness and accuracy. Thermal differences were documented in the Hilitchi DS 18 B 20 probe when compared to the K-Type <b>Thermocouple</b> <b>lead</b> at each respective research location on the Swine Cooling Pad.

40|$|Shape Memory Alloy is {{an amazing}} material, which can “remember” and return to its {{original}} shape when heated due to its temperature dependent phase transformation. Shape Memory Alloy wire has significant potential for application in the automobile industry due to its high ratio of energy / weight and silent actuation. However, a dependable method to measure the operating temperature of SMA wire and a reliable heat transfer model to characterize {{the dynamics of the}} SMA wire limit its widespread use in the automobile industry. This thesis presents {{a detailed description of the}} work performed to develop a reliable method for determining surface temperature of current carrying SMA wires and the development of a heat transfer correlation for natural convection cooling of heated SMA wires. The major findings of the research are as follows: When a spot welded thermocouple measures the temperature of a current carrying SMA wire, there is a “spurious voltage” ΔV added to the thermo electro-motive force (EMF) of the thermocouple as a result of a voltage drop across the two points of contact that the thermocouple wires make with the SMA wire. This leads to an erroneous temperature reading that can be higher or lower than the actual temperature depending on the direction of current flow. When the carrying current is reversed in direction, the “spurious voltage” becomes –ΔV allowing a correct temperature reading to be obtained by averaging the readings based on opposed current flow. A two-step spot welding procedure for attaching thermocouples to SMA wire can eliminate the influence of the “spurious voltage” in the temperature reading. By spot welding the thermocouple wires onto the SMA wire one by one, the <b>thermocouple</b> <b>lead</b> offset is eliminated and the thermocouple provides an accurate point source reading. Infrared thermal imaging can be a good supplement in the experiment to monitor errors in temperature readings from thermocouples. Due to the curvature of the SMA wire, the temperatures of the locations on the SMA wire that are the closest to the infrared camera represent the temperature of the SMA wire. So a line analysis across the SMA wire on the software “ThermaCAM” is required to determine the temperature of the SMA wire by infrared thermal imaging and the highest temperature on the line is the temperature of the SMA wire. A new natural convective heat transfer correlation comprising the inclination angle φ is developed based on experimental results, which can be used to predict the temperature of a SMA wire given its diameter and inclination angle. The comparisons show that the new correlation agrees with existing correlations in a vertical orientation and for small Rayleigh numbers (0. 001 < RaD < 0. 05) in the horizontal orientation. The correlation developed in this work for horizontal orientation tends to overestimate values of Nusselt numbers as predicted in other correlations when the Rayleigh number is high (0. 05 < RaD < 0. 6). It is speculated that this overestimation can be attributed to a temperature distortion associated with thermocouple measurement at or near ambient pressure conditions...|$|R

The versatility of droplets can be increased further if droplet dynamics are better understood. Recently, a pioneering experiment involving Ga droplet dynamics on GaAs (001) was reported [9], stimulating further investigations in related systems [10 - 13]. These reports are conducted principally by in situ real-time observation under a low-energy electron microscope (LEEM), with limited availability, leading some to experiment using more readily available molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) chambers [14 - 16], albeit with limited yields since MBE is optimized for deposition, not for microscopy. It is now accepted that group III droplets nucleate and run on certain III-V surfaces undergoing sublimation, but many aspects of the self-running or self-propelled droplets remain unanswered [17]. With easier access and deposition capability, MBE has the potential to advance droplet dynamics studies with the ultimate aim of droplet controls in micro- and nanofabrication. Producing running droplets using MBE however is not trivial as inaccurate <b>thermocouple</b> temperatures often <b>lead</b> to under- or overdecomposition.|$|R
