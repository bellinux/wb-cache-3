5|$|Amalthea radiates {{slightly}} more heat than it <b>receives</b> <b>from</b> the Sun, {{which is probably}} due to the influence of Jovian heat flux (<9 kelvin), sunlight reflected from the planet (<5K), and charged particle bombardment (<2 K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.|$|E
5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it <b>receives</b> <b>from</b> the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E

5|$|Models predict that, if its non-Keplerian orbit {{could be}} {{averaged}} to a Keplerian eccentricity of 0.28, then tidal heating {{would play a}} significant role in the planet's geology to the point of keeping it completely molten. Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104–5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2. This is similar to the radiative energy it <b>receives</b> <b>from</b> its parent star of about 40,000 W/m2.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d <b>receives</b> <b>from</b> its star has about 30% of the {{intensity}} of light the Earth <b>receives</b> <b>from</b> the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E
5|$|Southwest of {{the city}} of Rexburg, the Snake <b>receives</b> <b>from</b> the right the Henrys Fork, {{sometimes}} called the North Fork of the Snake River. The confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls, rounding the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir, receiving the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into the Snake River Plain, carving out many topographic features and significantly altering the Snake River landscape. The Snake River resumes its journey westwards, then enters the Snake River Canyon of Idaho, where it drops over Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon, and passing under the Perrine Bridge. Close to Twin Falls, the Snake approaches the southernmost point in its entire course, after which it starts to flow generally northwest.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 38 - 42). vi, 42 leaves, bound 29 cmUsing an expectancy violation theoretical framework, {{this investigation}} provides {{an examination of}} the association between workplace social support and job satisfaction. In particular, this study explores the relationship between the appropriateness of emotional social support and job satisfaction. To assess these relationships, employees (N = 206) reported on the social support they <b>received</b> <b>from</b> their coworkers and supervisors. Results indicated that emotional support <b>received</b> <b>from</b> coworkers was not viewed to be more appropriate than emotional support <b>received</b> <b>from</b> supervisors. Emotional support <b>received</b> <b>from</b> supervisors was not found to have a stronger association with job satisfaction than emotional support <b>received</b> <b>from</b> coworkers.

5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino <b>receives</b> <b>from</b> the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E
5|$|Though {{during the}} 1970s most of Sierra Highway was {{bypassed}} by freeways and expressways, the old two-lane road remained a famous roadway. In 1971, Steven Spielberg {{made his first}} feature-length film, Duel, along Sierra Highway, near Acton. The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck's game. It prominently shows the desert portions of Sierra Highway. With Duels status, one of the trucks used in the film {{is still on the}} road and {{in the process of being}} restored.

5|$|Voyager 1 {{found that}} about {{seven percent of}} the volume of Saturn's upper {{atmosphere}} is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is hydrogen. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it <b>receives</b> <b>from</b> the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500m/s (1,100mph). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.|$|E

5|$|Fordham College at Rose Hill has a {{long history}} of college theater, as well as non-major theater groups at both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill (the Mimes and Mummers, Fordham Experimental Theater, the Theatrical Outreach Group, Splinter Group).

The Mimes and Mummers, the oldest entirely student-run club at Fordham University and among the oldest college theater groups in the United States, was founded in 1855 as the Saint John's Dramatic Society. The Mimes put on two musicals, a drama, and a comedy each year – all non-student-written shows – as well as workshops designed to help students at Fordham learn about theater.
