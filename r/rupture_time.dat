3000|$|The rupture {{velocities}} {{were initially}} estimated at 1.67  km/s {{for the northern}} rupture and 1.18  km/s for the southern one from the entire source duration, containing the <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> and rise time (Eq. (3)). Hence, these two rupture velocities are underestimated because we did not exclude the rise time from the entire source duration for the two ruptures. In Eq. (3), the apparent source time includes three components: <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> (L/V_r); rise time (τ); (L/Ccos), which is created from rupture directivity along the rupture length. However, separating the rise time from the apparent source duration in the time domain is difficult. Here, following Hwang et al. (2011), we first selected the stations approximately normal to the rupture directivity; then, L/Ccos vanished because of [...] = 90 ^^∘, and the apparent source time is L/V_r + τ. This would make the analysis simplified for separating the rise time from the entire source duration. In the time domain, the <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> and rise time increase the travel time of surface waves, whereas in the frequency domain, the <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> and rise time all represent sinc functions that produce many nodes in the surface-wave Fourier spectra. Hence, these periods of nodes {{can be used to}} indicate <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> and rise time. In general, the rise time is about 0.10 – 0.25 times smaller than the <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> (cf. Geller 1976; Heaton 1990) so that the period of node created from the <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> is relatively easier to be inspected than that from the rise time. From the Fourier spectra influenced by the sinc functions, the <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> is a multiple of the period of the node (cf. Chang et al. 2010; Hwang et al. 2001, 2011). Moreover, the longest period among nodes, the first node, directly denotes the <b>rupture</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

METHODS: From January, 2013 to December, 2015, 200 cases(200 eyes) of lacrimal passage obstruction were treated with lacrimal passage laser combined with lacrimal drainage tube implantation in our hospital. Before and 1 mo after operation, after the tube was draw out, ocular surface was assessed. The test included tear film <b>rupture</b> <b>time,</b> tear secretion, corneal fluorescein staining and dry eye syndrome questionnaire. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} in tear film <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> between the two groups before and after 1 mo, after the tube was draw out(P > 0. 05). The amount of tear secretion increased at 1 mo after operation and the amount of tear secretion decreased after extubation. The difference was statistically significant(P P > 0. 05). The dry eye symptom questionnaire showed that the tearing laser combined drainage tube implantation significantly improved the tearing symptoms. CONCLUSION: The lacrimal duct laser combined drainage tube implantation has no significant effect on tear film <b>rupture</b> <b>time</b> and corneal fluorescein sodium staining.

40|$|New {{methods of}} {{site-specific}} ground motion prediction {{in the time}} and frequency domains are presented. A large earthquake is simulated as a composite (linear combination) of observed small earthquakes (subevents) assuming Aki-Brune functional models of the source time functions (spectra). Source models incorporate basic scaling relations between source and spectral parameters. Ground motion predictions {{are consistent with the}} entire observed seismic spectrum from the lowest to the highest frequencies. These methods are designed to use all the available empirical Green’s functions (or any subset of observations) at a site. Thus a prediction is not biased by a single record, and different possible source-receiver paths are taken into account. Directivity is accounted for by adjusting the apparent source duration at each site. Our time-series prediction algorithm is based on determination of a non-uniform distribution of <b>rupture</b> <b>times</b> of subevents. By introducing a specific rupture velocity we avoid the major problem of deficiency of predictions around the main event's corner frequency. A novel notion of partial coherence allows us to sum subevents' amplitude spectra directly without using any information on their <b>rupture</b> <b>times</b> and phase histories. Predictions by this spectral method are not Jependent on details of rupture nucleation and propagation, location of asperities and other predominantly phase-affecting factors, responsible for uncertainties in time-domain simulations...|$|R

These thin liquid films usually {{have to be}} stabilized against rupture by surface active substances, such as proteins or low molecular weight surfactants. However, horizontal thin liquid films of pure water with a radius of 100 µm also show remarkable stability when created in closed Sheludko cells. To understand thin film stability of surfactant-free films, the drainage behavior and <b>rupture</b> <b>times</b> of films of water and NaCl solutions were determined. The drainage was modeled with an extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) model, which combines DLVO and hydrophobic contributions.

Of various antithrombotic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting human GPIba, 6 B 4 is a potent one to inhibit the interaction between GPIba and vWF-A 1 under static and flow conditions.
