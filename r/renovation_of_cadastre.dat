The <b>cadastre</b> <b>of</b> a country is its register of property titles and is usually managed by government agencies 1. The Cadastre in Kosovo is managed by the Kosovo Cadastral Agency (KCA), which is the highest authority for cadastre in the Republic <b>of</b> Kosovo. <b>Cadastre</b> <b>renovation</b> in Kosovo has started since 2003, with the pilot project in cadastral zone (CZ) Dobrashec in Gllogovc municipality. In that time, this pilot project was declared successful. After this pilot there has been another pilot project in three CZ. These CZ are Brekoc in Gjakova, Livoq I poshtem in Gjilani and Sofalia in Prishtina. Since 2003 until now, renovation is finished in 42 CZ, and actually in 2012 there are 22 CZ in process. After completion of these 22 CZ at the end <b>of</b> 2012, <b>renovation</b> will be finished in 64 CZ. Considering that 1238 CZ have yet not been renovated, according to the current rate of this process, we can conclude that if we renovated 22 CZ every year, renovation process will take 56 years. This shows that the process <b>of</b> <b>renovation</b> is going very slowly. This project has considered three approaches for <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo’s cadastral database.

40|$|Literature {{on urban}} land {{governance}} suggests cadastres {{play an important}} role in delivering equal land access, adequate tenure security, sustainable land use, accountability of actors, and transparency. Accordingly, land governance is increasingly examined through the domain <b>of</b> <b>cadastres,</b> or more broadly land administration. In Ethiopia, urban cadastres are yet to be studied through this lens. This paper examines the evolution <b>of</b> Ethiopia's urban <b>cadastres</b> in support <b>of</b> urban land governance across three governing regimes: the Imperial, the Military, and the Ethiopian People Republic Democratic Front (EPRDF) regimes. Three data collection techniques are applied: research synthesis is used to understand the nature and role <b>of</b> Ethiopia's urban <b>cadastres</b> during the Imperial and Military regimes, whilst secondary data and primary observational analysis are used to assess the early and contemporary parts of EPRDF regime respectively. The recognized cadastral ‘toolbox’ approach informs the analysis: the comparative role <b>of</b> <b>cadastres</b> in delivering urban land governance across the three study epochs is assessed. The study reveals that during the Imperial and Military regimes, policies and legal frameworks afforded less consideration to important aspects of urban land governance. Meanwhile, results from the early EPRDF regime suggest that whilst urban land governance discourse was popular, the operational role <b>of</b> the urban <b>cadastre</b> in improving urban land governance was limited: the basic requirements needed for the operation <b>of</b> urban <b>cadastres,</b> including political steadiness, policy and legal clarity, technical capacity, sound organizational design and societal support were missing.
