To alleviate this problem, we present a program-ming by example technique (and its tool implementation, called SQLSynthesizer) to help end-users automate such query tasks. SQLSynthesizer takes from users an example input and output of how the database should be queried, and then synthesizes a SQL query that reproduces the example output from the example input. If the synthesized SQL query is applied to another, potentially larger, database with a similar schema, the synthesized SQL query produces a corresponding result {{that is similar to}} the example output. We evaluated SQLSynthesizer on 23 exercises from a classic database textbook and <b>5</b> <b>forum</b> questions about writing SQL queries.
