40|$|A report proposes an {{alternative}} {{method of control}} for precision landing on a remote planet. In the traditional method, the attitude of a spacecraft is required to track a commanded translational acceleration vector, which is generated at each time step by solving a two-point boundary value problem. No requirement of continuity is imposed on the acceleration. The translational acceleration does not necessarily vary smoothly. Tracking of a non-smooth acceleration causes the vehicle attitude to exhibit undesirable transients and poor pointing stability behavior. In the alternative method, the two-point boundary value problem is not solved at each time step. A smooth reference position profile is computed. The profile is recomputed only when the control errors get sufficiently large. The nominal attitude is still required to track the smooth <b>reference</b> <b>acceleration</b> command. A steering logic is proposed that controls {{the position and velocity}} errors about the reference profile by perturbing the attitude slightly about the nominal attitude. The overall pointing behavior is therefore smooth, greatly reducing the degree of pointing instability...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{active safety}} control methods for cars, i. e., the {{antilock}} braking system (ABS), the traction control system (TCS), and electronic stability control (ESC), govern the wheel slip control based on the wheel slip ratio, which relies on the information from non-driven wheels. However, these methods are not applicable in the cases without non-driven wheels, e. g., a four-wheel decentralized electric vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes a new wheel slip control approach based on a novel data fusion method to ensure good traction performance in any driving condition. Firstly, with the proposed data fusion algorithm, the acceleration estimator makes use of the data measured by the sensor installed near the vehicle center of mass (CM) to calculate the <b>reference</b> <b>acceleration</b> of each wheel center. Then, the wheel slip is constrained by controlling the acceleration deviation between the actual wheel and the reference wheel center. By comparison with non-control and model following control (MFC) cases in double lane change tests, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control method has significant anti-slip effectiveness and stabilizing control performance...|$|E

40|$|A {{positioning}} system {{that needs to}} accurately track a reference can benefit greatly from using feedforward. When using a force actuator, the feedforward needs to generate a force proportional to the <b>reference</b> <b>acceleration,</b> which can be measured {{by means of an}} accelerometer or can be created by double differentiation of the reference position. The {{positioning system}}’s response to the feedforward usually shows some delay, caused by calculation time of the digital control computer, the digital-to-analog converter that drives the actuator’s amplifier, and digital differentiation of the reference position. At higher frequencies, even a small delay causes a large tracking error. Prediction of the feedforward signal by one or two samples can reduce this error. This paper describes three methods to predict a feedforward signal over a time span of a few samples. Polynomial extrapolation of past data does not require knowledge of the signal’s properties. Sinusoidal extrapolation produces an exact prediction at a set of chosen design frequencies. Both filter types can be implemented as FIR filters. A particular form of frequency sampling filters, having digital zeros which are not each other’s conjugates, can also be used for prediction purposes. The complex filter output allows reconstruction of input signal properties and its prediction. The filters are compared with regard to their suitability for predicting feedforward signals...|$|E

40|$|The {{wafer stage}} and reticle {{stage in a}} lithographic tool, used to {{manufacture}} integrated circuits (ICs), operate at nanometer accuracy during a scanning motion. The position accuracy and settling time after accelerating to the scanning velocity are largely determined by the feedforward controller. The feedforward controller calculates the required force for the stage to move according to its position profile by multiplying the <b>reference</b> <b>acceleration</b> with the known stage mass. Two effects limit the accuracy directly after the acceleration phase. First, the actual stage acceleration {{in response to the}} controller-calculated force depends on the position of the stage in its working range. A variation of 0. 1 % is observed. Second, dynamic resonances in the stage response require a higher-order feedforward model. Combined, these effects result in a 20 – 30 nm peak position error. This brief investigates online adaptation of the feedforward mass parameter, with the aim of reducing the position-dependent stage behavior. Adaptation of only the feedforward mass is shown {{not to be able to}} compensate for stage dynamics, additionally requiring a higher-order feedforward element. From the control force and the measured motion response, the feedforward mass parameter is estimated on line. Least-squares estimation is fast enough to update the mass parameter during the acceleration phase, which takes less than 100 ms. This brief addresses a number of practical aspects and shows that adaptive feedforward estimation in combination with higher-order feedforward reduces the peak position error consistently by creating position-independent behavior...|$|E

The force limited vibration test technique has been utilized at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other NASA centers to provide more realistic vibration test environments for aerospace flight hardware. In standard random vibration tests, the payload is mounted to a rigid fixture and the interface acceleration is controlled to a specified level based on a conservative estimate of the expected flight environment. In force limited vibration tests, both the acceleration and force are controlled at the mounting interface to compensate for differences between the flexible flight mounting and rigid test fixture. This minimizes the over test at the payload natural frequencies and results in more realistic forces being transmitted at the mounting interface.

40|$|Introduction: Human body {{acceleration}} {{is often}} used {{as an indicator of}} daily physical activity in epidemiological research. Raw acceleration signals contain three basic components: movement, gravity, and noise. Separation of these becomes increasingly difficult during rotational movements. We aimed to evaluate five different methods (metrics) of processing acceleration signals on their ability to remove the gravitational component of acceleration during standardised mechanical movements and the implications for human daily physical activity assessment. Methods: An industrial robot rotated accelerometers in the vertical plane. Radius, frequency, and angular range of motion were systematically varied. Three metrics (Euclidian norm minus one [ENMO], Euclidian norm of the high-pass filtered signals [HFEN], and HFEN plus Euclidean norm of low-pass filtered signals minus 1 g [HFEN+]) were derived for each experimental condition and compared against the <b>reference</b> <b>acceleration</b> (forward kinematics) of the robot arm. We then compared metrics derived from human acceleration signals from the wrist and hip in 97 adults (22 - 65 yr), and wrist in 63 women (20 - 35 yr) in whom daily activity-related energy expenditure (PAEE) was available. Results: In the robot experiment, HFEN+ had lowest error during (vertical plane) rotations at an oscillating frequency higher than the filter cut-off frequency while for lower frequencies ENMO performed better. In the human experiments, metrics HFEN and ENMO on hip were most discrepant (within- and between-individual explained variance of 0. 90 and 0. 46, respectively). ENMO, HFEN and HFEN+ explained 34 %, 30 % and 36 % of the variance in daily PAEE, respectively, compared to 26 % for a metric which did not attempt to remove the gravitational component (metric EN). Conclusion: In conclusion, none of the metrics as evaluated systematically outperformed all other metrics across a wide range of standardised kinematic conditions. However, choice of metric explains different degrees of variance in daily human physical activity...|$|E

Surface-wave analysis gives a solution for the November event of: dip 57 °, rake 100 °, and strike 43 °, which is similar to the locally reported focal mechanism. The seismic moment of the November event is M_ 0 = 1. 7 × 10 ^(27) dynecm and the magnitudes determined from WWSSN data are m_b = 6. 4, M_s = 7. 3. Teleseismic source spectra show that the two events also have similar spectral signatures above 0. 15 Hz. <b>Reference</b> <b>acceleration</b> spectra are computed from the average teleseismic source spectra and compared to the averaged acceleration spectra computed from strong-motion stations for both events. Correlations between the spectral amplitudes of the strong-motion spectra obtained from the main portion of the SMART 1 array and the teleseismically estimated reference spectra are poor above 0. 2 Hz. Data from the hard-rock site situated outside of the basin indicates that amplification of the ground motion between 0. 17 - 1. 7 Hz is due to the alluvial valley where the SMART 1 array is located. The amplitude of the observed spectrum is five times the reference spectrum at the hard-rock site. This is consistent with similar observations from the 1985 Michoacan and 1983 Akita-Oki earthquakes.
