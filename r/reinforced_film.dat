500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Little Ferry facility spurred an interest in fire safety as an aspect of film preservation. Unlike previous large nitrate film fires, the spontaneous combustion of decomposing film stock {{was determined to be}} responsible. Investigators suggested that the older nitrocellulose film stored in the archive was of lower quality than then-current film and thus more prone to instability. The Society of Motion Picture Engineers's Committee on Preservation of Film, three months after the vault fire, cited [...] "recent and rather extensive film fires" [...] as evidence that existing preservation efforts had failed to adequately address the [...] "fire problem". More heavily <b>reinforced</b> <b>film</b> vaults were suggested, to prevent fires in a single vault from destroying entire archival facilities. Film storage cabinets with ventilation and cooling systems were also proposed, as was further research into improving the quality of cellulose acetate film to encourage its use as a safer replacement for nitrate film.|$|E
40|$|The topical {{tendencies in}} the {{development}} of load-bearing structures, which are weight reduction and increase of spans can be accomplished by the application of new materials in combination with structural systems where tensile stresses are dominant. Cable roofs with axially tensioned elements represent one type of these structures. From a constructional point of view and architectonical aspects, the most perspective is a pre-stressed cable net with saddle-shaped surface with a compliant supporting contour covered with <b>reinforced</b> <b>film</b> or textile membrane. But the ratio between the roofed volume and the area is unacceptable at larger spans as it causes an inexpedient increase of the heated volume. This problem can be solved by application of the saddle–shaped roofs as primary repeatable units, and by suspending their corners to a higher level cable structure thus obtaining new innovative hierarchic, inter-subordinated large–span cable roofing. These hierarchic structural modules may be combined together to produce larger roofed areas. Comparing the results with other existing long span cable structures can be concluded that material consumption of such types of structures laid in the rational material consumption area, and the ratio between the deadweight and live load of the presented structure is nearly two times more effective then that of analogous buildings at the identical span. The developed Hierarchic Cable Roofs open the opportunities to cover extremely large spans and can be used as completely or partially dismountable translucent provisional coverings for sports grounds, concert halls, parking places or covered agricultural area...|$|E

The overall material consumption is seriously dependent on structure of the primary repeatable unit which can be made as negative Gaussian bent cable net. The possibility of cable roofs covering with textile-reinforced woven fabric and multiaxially reinforced films based on liquid crystal polymer fibers with regularly oriented aromatic polyester molecules (LCP) was analysed. The main mechanical properties of cladding element based on LCP Vectra basket weave fabric which is covered by the PTFE was evaluated by the engineering approach.

These models describe the extreme observations of real behavior of cladding, which can be in intermediate position: the first – without any shear stiffness, the second – with full membrane shear stiffness.

The current research objective {{was to determine the}} gompertz kinetics of SMB in response of predictive variables; 5, 10, 15 and 20 % lignin, used to reinforce the urea-crosslinked starch (UcS) films in aerobic soil. Through gompertz kinetics, the specific growth rate (μmax), lag phase (λ), asymptote (A) and inflection (ti) of growth curve were determined for SMB. The results of the study showed that gompertz kinetic predicted reasonably a good agreement between the experimental and predicted soil microbial biomass (R 2 > 0. 942; Error Mean Square, 0. 010 - 0. 089) for all lignin <b>reinforced</b> UcS <b>films</b> in aerobic soil. The value of A was 13. 39 % higher in soil added with lignin <b>reinforced</b> UcS <b>films</b> than the control film. The average μmax of lignin <b>reinforced</b> UcS <b>films</b> was achieved 3. 59 day- 1 which was approximately 9. 10 % less than μmax observed in control film. The average λ was delayed 76. 69 % more in lignin <b>reinforced</b> UcS <b>films</b> possible due to the lignin's recalcitrant nature to biodegradation by microorganisms.

Moreover, mechanical properties were determined showing that SPISNC <b>reinforced</b> <b>films</b> became more resistant and less elongable as SNC amount increased. With the incorporation of a considerable amount of reinforcements, a marked variation was observed in these properties.

Materials {{prepared}} from biodegradable polymers can be {{an alternative}} for reducing the environmental problems provoked by petroleum derived polymers used to produce packages. Starches from different sources have been considered as a technically viable raw material for producing biodegradable films at low cost. Moreover, starches are from renewable sources, which allow applying environmental politics for controlling the carbon cycle. Starch based films dot not resist to the mechanical stress they are submitted when used in commercial packages, and have high water vapor permeability (WVP). Incorporation of nanoclay and cellulose fibers have been reported as a viable alternative for <b>reinforcing</b> these <b>films.</b> The objective of this work {{was to investigate the}} influence of the incorporation of nanoclay and cellulose fibers on the properties of starch bases films. The work was performed in two steps. In the first step, films were prepared with different formulations and different processes of nanoclays incorporation their mechanical properties and WVP were determined. In the second step, the addition of nanoclay and cellulose fibers was investigated. For that, starch films, starch-nanoclay films and starch-nanoclay-cellulose fibers composites-films were prepared. The starch-nanoclay composites-films showed WVP one-fold lower that the values found for starch films.

Then FS films were produced and their morphological, thermal and mechanical properties, {{as well as the}} o-GF and o-GNR dispersion along the films were assessed. Their degradation and swelling profiles as well as their biological behavior were evaluated. Graphite and nanotubes were successfully oxidized and exfoliated forming stable suspensions that could be combined with chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG) solutions by layer-by-layer processing. The addition of o-GFs and o-GNRs resulted in rougher, hydrophilic FS films with significantly improved mechanical properties relative to CHI/ALG films. The presence of o-GFs or o-GNRs did not affect the thermal stability and the addition of o-GFs resulted in films with enhanced cytocompatibility.

At low concentration of CNCs (0.1 – 0.3  wt%), {{the properties of the}} polymer composite films containing CNCs hydrolyzed from MFC were slightly better than those containing the CNCs prepared from the water hyacinth fibers. However, when the concentration of the CNCs was further increased above 0.3  wt%, the barrier and optical properties of the composite system containing water hyacinth-based CNCs were more superior. The discrepancies were ascribed to the different compositions, geometries and dimensions of the two types of CNCs. In this study, the most efficient film with lowest water vapor transmission rate (0.0517  g m− 2  day− 1) was the PU/PVDC <b>film</b> <b>reinforced</b> with 0.1 % of CNCm. The optical transparency of the films, described in terms of percentage visible light transmittance values, was maintained well above 75 % when the concentration of the CNCs was kept below 0.5  wt%. In general, these PU/PVDC composite <b>films</b> <b>reinforced</b> with CNCs might be used as moisture barrier film for packaging applications. However, for solar cell encapsulation, considerations of the barrier properties of the polymer encapsulants alone are insufficient to ensure that the system will be effective. An interfacial adhesion between the encapsulating film and the electrodes should be controlled and optimized. In addition, the interaction between polymers and chemicals inside the fabricated cell should also be taken into account.
