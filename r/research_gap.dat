For many developing countries, leather and leather manufacturers constitute an indispensable and dependable source for export trade and foreign exchange earnings. For Bangladesh, leather is a high priority industrial sector and footwear exports, an extreme focus area. Bangladesh has, just few decades since Independence, made significant gains from the leather trade, progressing from the status of an exporter of 90% plus {{raw hides and skins}} to that of an exporter and predominantly leather product manufacturer. However, there is little systematic research into this sector. This study is trying to address the <b>research</b> <b>gap</b> by seeking to understand the current status, problems and prospect of leather industry in Bangladesh.|$|E

Many low-income countries are now incorporating science, technology and innovation in their national development agenda, conscious that their plans to diversify and modernize the economy will be thwarted, if they cannot call upon a critical mass of skilled personnel, including scientists, engineers and technicians. Regional economic communities, too, are increasingly aware that successful economic integration will depend upon how well member states assimilate science and technology.http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/the_g20_accounts_for_92_of_global_spending_on_research/ ...|$|E

Major databases such as ABI/INFORM, and Emerald have been searched to gather literature. The literature on environmental scanning is reviewed with an aim to identify patterns in scanning practices as well as <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the extant literature. Three major phases of the development and three main characteristics of the literature have been identified. Four propositions are suggested to fill the <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the literature of the environmental scanning practices; namely, firm characteristics, market orientation, and top management cognition perspective. Further empirical research is needed to test the four propositions in order to provide a full picture for the environmental scanning literature. The contributions of this paper are: 1) the revelation of the evolution of the environmental scanning literature; 2) the identification of <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the environmental scanning literature; 3) the establishment of propositions through which future research can further the knowledge of environmental scanning. <br /...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Dietary Goals for the United States were {{introduced}} in 1977 and have been followed by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) every 5 years from 1980 to 2010. The DGA provide science-based advice to promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases through diet and physical activity. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees are charged to provide updates of the DGA topics using the best available science. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees' reports also identified 169 <b>research</b> <b>gaps.</b> To date, these gaps have not been compiled and assessed. We evaluated trends in number, topics, and specificity of <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> by year by placing them in the following topic categories: general, chronic diseases/conditions, diet/diet pattern, food/ingredient, and nutrient-specific <b>research</b> <b>gaps.</b> Some <b>research</b> topics (eg, sodium and hypertension and appropriate uses of DGA) have been identified consistently across the years, some emerged in later years (eg, increasingly specific <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> between dietary fatty acids and cardiovascular disease), and others appeared intermittently (eg, relationships between dietary components and cancer). These results are {{a call to action}} for all DGA stakeholders to have an immediate dialogue about how the research enterprise can best address critical research needs in a timely way to support public policy...|$|R
