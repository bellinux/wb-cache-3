40|$|A Stirling cycle {{heat engine}} is {{disclosed}} in which displacer motion is controlled {{as a function}} of the working fluid pressure P sub 1 and a substantially constant pressure P sub 0. The heat engine includes an auxiliary chamber at the constant pressure P sub 0. An end surface of a displacer piston is disposed in the auxiliary chamber. During the compression portion of the engine cycle when P sub 1 rises above P sub 0 the displacer forces the working fluid to pass from the cold chamber to the hot chamber of the engine. During the expansion portion of the engine cycle the heated working fluid in the hot chamber does work by pushing down on the engine's drive piston. As the working fluid pressure P sub 1 drops below P sub 0 the displacer forces most of the working fluid in the hot chamber to pass through the regenerator to the cold chamber. The engine is easily combinable with a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>section</b> to provide a refrigeration system in which the engine's single drive piston serves both the engine and the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>section...</b>|$|E

40|$|Since {{the nuclear}} {{disaster}} {{was caused by}} the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, Japanese energy generation system has been expected to prioritize safety and trustworthiness. To meet this requirement, distributed power supply systems, such as gas engine, fuel cell, photovoltaic system, and solar heat, are considered to be one of solutions. By producing electricity, these systems generate thermal energy as a byproduct, and by using exhaust heat as thermal energy, we can help to minimize the CO 2 emissions. In this study, we aimed energy-conservation and carbon dioxide emission reduction of supermarket which introduced a novel environment-friendly dispersed power. At first, we divided the energy consumption devices of the supermarket into the groups of illumination, air conditioning, refrigeration, hot water supply by using purpose and measured the time changes of its energy consumption in each seasons. And we verified the outside and the indoor air conditions, and the operation characteristics of individual energy consumption devices. The supermarket we measured is located in Isesaki-city, the northern Kanto region in Japan. From this measurement, we understood that the annual energy consumption of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>section</b> was about 60 - 70 % of the whole one of supermarket. It means that the energy reduction of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>section</b> greatly contributes to energy conservation of supermarket. Most of the energy consumption apparatus of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>section</b> of the supermarket are refrigerated cabinets and its power consumption highly depended on the indoor air enthalpy and the outside air temperature. When we are going to introduce dispersed power into a certain facility, the biggest problem that should be solved is annual utilization rate increase in exhaust heat. Because the annual utilization rate increment of the exhaust heat was not guaranteed by using only to heating, we built the demonstration supermarket which equipped environmental friendly dispersed power (gas engine, solar cell, solar heat), and utilized this supermarket for waste heat helpful use. In this study, we tried to increment the condenser exit supercooling of the refrigerated cabinet which had had the biggest energy consumption in a supermarket and, validated its energy conservation effect and carbon dioxide emission reduction one. The cold temperature that used for supercooling was manufactured by adsorption type refrigerator. The energy conservation effect of supercooling is about from 10 to 25 % during the summertime and intermediate time. However there is no effect of supercooling in the winter because the outside temperature is low. At last we found that when the outside temperature is about 15 ? or more, supercooling effect appears. In addition, since energy consumption of the refrigerated cabinet is influenced by the indoor enthalpy, we adjusted the indoor air temperature and humidity by introducing the desiccant system and validated its effect...|$|E

For the estimation of Human Error Probabilities a specific tool has been developed named the Fuzzy Probability Estimator (FPE). The application of the FPE tool in a specific case study is presented in this paper. The specific case study aims at analyzing the start-up of a gas turbine used to drive the compressor of the butane/propane <b>refrigeration</b> <b>section</b> of an LPG storage and treatment complex.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{surrogate}} model is aimed to be constructed for the separation-refrigeration (S-R) {{section in the}} ammonia plant. First, the variables defining the process are classified by input variables and output variables. Then the variables are reduced {{as many as possible}} using the dependency relationships. After the input and output variables are determined by variable identification, adaptive sampling is implemented to sample the input variables to obtain the input sample space with minimized number of sample points. The resultant input sample data is imported to HYSYS to obtain the corresponding output sample data. However, the HYSYS model was not able to calculate the corresponding output samples due to convergence issues. In order to address this issue, we divided the separation-refrigeration section furthermore into the HEx part, the separator part and the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>section.</b> Then we use the same approach to construct {{a surrogate}} model for the HEx part. We used two different variable identifications to define the output variables, of which one used the absolute output variables and the other one used variables differences. Sample spaces of both cases are obtained and surrogate models are generated using artificial neural network based on the sample spaces. The resultant surrogate models are validated by comparing their output predictions with the HYSYS' output results and the relative deviations are calculated. It can be concluded that the surrogate models can be efficiently constructed based on the approach used in this thesis. Using the adaptive sampling, the number of sample points required to generate surrogate models can be successfully minimized, which saved computational expense of model construction effectively. In the approach of surrogate model construction, the variable identification is extremely crucial. It can affect both the computational expense of surrogate model generation and the accuracy of resultant surrogate models. Generally, the variable differences can save the computational expense but results in less accurate surrogate models than absolute variables. The approach used in this thesis can also be implemented to construct the surrogate models for other simulators...|$|E
40|$|Big process {{industries}} like PREEM AB, Sweden refining 16 million tonnes {{of crude oil}} annually are investigating the black boxes at their site to cut down unnecessary power consumption. This project study initiated by PREEM Lysekil Refinery is an example, to investigate the output i. e., recovery of LPG (propane and butane) {{in comparison to the}} power input to the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>section.</b> In oil refineries, it is always interesting to recover valuable products like liquefied petroleum gas – LPG from the refinery streams. An analysis has been conducted at the refrigerated LPG Recovery Unit by modelling and simulating the unit in an advanced process engineering tools, ASPEN HYSYS assisted by ASPEN HTFS+ an energy equipment calculation tool, to investigate the performance and possibilities in the current system. Despite the engineering challenges to model the unique refrigerated LPG recovery system in HYSYS, the system was simulated to analyse the current operation. The simulation concluded that the lean off-gas stream, one out of three, was only cooled but not condensed. This imposed an extra load in the refrigeration cycle only used to extract specific heat from the off-gas stream instead of recovering LPG. Such findings led to investigation of the refrigeration load and LPG recovery only for off-gas streams, rich in propane and butane. 657 kg/h of LPG was recovered from 1078 kg/h of incoming off-gas stream with 25 % reduction in refrigeration power consumption. A minor retrofit for exchanging heat between recovered LPG and incoming rich off-gas stream proved to save comparatively more power, i. e., 37 %, with the same LPG recovery in the refrigerated LPG recovery system in the HYSYS model. The simulated model predicts that the present unit is capable of handling another rich off-gas stream of a size similar to the lean off-gas stream (2814 kg/h), which is proposed to be removed. The introduction of the new rich off-gas stream will lead to more LPG recovery, in an efficient way, at the expense of slightly increased power consumption, due to high dew. Recovering more LPG leads to fuel gas deficiency and that would be compensated by introducing cheaper fuels like natural gas from Norway, included in the strategic planning of the refinery. Another project could be conducted to thoroughly analyse the impact of more LPG recovery, from new rich off-gas stream, on the refrigeration load...|$|E
