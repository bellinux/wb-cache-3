To do so, we propose three different sets of questionnaires, addressed to three groups of people, differing in age. Our main findings are the following: (1) at an aggregate level, Mutual Independence is accurately satisfied, even though there is a higher level of satisfaction of Independence of <b>the</b> future with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past, particularly significant withing the Elderly group; (2) at an individual level, Independence of <b>the</b> future with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past is significantly better fulfilled than the alternative assumption, for every group.
