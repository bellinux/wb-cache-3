The system has been evaluated without and with the hot water load (which is the standard hot water demand for a typical family of two adults and two children in India) in the residential building. To satisfy the heat demand, no auxiliary energy has been assumed to be supplied to the system. The rate of air flow in the system was observed to influence the system performance most significantly. In addition, the mode of operation, i. e. whether the air flow is continuous or intermittent, influences the system performance greatly, a higher and intermittent air flow rate resulting in a more stable and uniform temperature of the living space.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{measured the}} level of sound emitted {{over the course of}} the print cycle by an HP inkjet printer and determined how the level varies with changes in the print quality settings and stages of the print cycle. As a test document was printed on the printer at various print quality settings and in two different environments-in a dorm room and in a laboratory chamber, a Sound Level Meter measured the sound intensity {{over the course of the}} entire print cycle and recorded the values. While sound levels were similar across some stages of the print job, in the actual printing step, the sound level varied directly with the quality and inversely with the time spent printing. For the normal quality setting, the mean sound level in the dorm room [in the chamber] was 55. 242 ± 2. 41 dB [56. 911 ± 2. 12 dB] with 12. 4 s [12. 4 s] of actual printing. These results have implications for a new generation of inkjet printers. Additionally, this experiment determined the noise contributors to a laboratory room containing an optical trap. The laser's fan-based cooling system yields frequencies of approximately 270 Hz and 540 Hz in the room, while the <b>room's</b> <b>heater</b> produces frequencies of approximately 110 Hz. The devices contributing to frequency peaks are the laser's fan-based cooling system and the <b>room</b> <b>heaters.</b> The fan-based cooling system produced consistent frequencies of approximately 270 Hz and 540 Hz. Also, the <b>room</b> <b>heaters</b> yield a lower frequency output of approximately 110 Hz. Even with all controllable devices turned off, a 33. 5 Hz low frequency noise is present in the sound power spectrum FFT graph, most likely from the refrigerator outside the room of interest. To reduce the effect of the electronic equipment's frequencies on the high precision measurements acquired in the optical trap room, data should be taken with the two rooms' heaters off, and a quieter method of cooling the laser should be investigated. by Jennifer H.

40|$|Stochastic {{hybrid system}} (SHS) models {{can be used}} to analyze and design complex {{embedded}} systems that operate in the presence of uncertainty and variability. Verification of reachability properties for such systems is a critical problem. Developing sound computational methods for verification is challenging because of the interaction between the discrete and the continuous stochastic dynamics. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic method for verification of SHSs based on discrete approximations focusing on reachability and safety problems. We show that reachability and safety can be characterized as a viscosity solution of a system of coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations. We present a numerical algorithm for computing the solution based on discrete approximations that are derived using finite-difference methods. An advantage of the method is that the solution converges to the one for the original system as the discretization becomes finer. We also prove that the algorithm is polynomial in the number of states of the discrete approximation. Finally, we illustrate the approach with two benchmarks: a navigation and a <b>room</b> <b>heater</b> example, which have been proposed for hybrid system verification...|$|E

40|$|In 2010, Rural Development, Inc. (RDI) {{completed}} {{construction of}} Wisdom Way Solar Village (WWSV), {{a community of}} ten duplexes (20 homes) in Greenfield, MA. RDI was committed to very low energy use {{from the beginning of}} the design process throughout construction. Key features include: 1. Careful site plan so that all homes have solar access (for active and passive); 2. Cellulose insulation providing R- 40 walls, R- 50 ceiling, and R- 40 floors; 3. Triple-pane windows; 4. Airtight construction (~ 0. 1 CFM 50 /ft 2 enclosure area); 5. Solar water heating systems with tankless, gas, auxiliary heaters; 6. PV systems (2. 8 or 3. 4 kWSTC); 7. 2 - 4 bedrooms, 1, 100 - 1, 700 ft 2. The design heating loads in the homes were so small that each home is heated with a single, sealed-combustion, natural gas <b>room</b> <b>heater.</b> The cost savings from the simple HVAC systems made possible the tremendous investments in the homes' envelopes. The Consortium for Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) monitored temperatures and comfort in several homes during the winter of 2009 - 2010. In the Spring of 2011, CARB obtained utility bill information from 13 occupied homes. Because of efficient lights, appliances, and conscientious home occupants, the energy generated by the solar electric systems exceeded the electric energy used in most homes. Most homes, in fact, had a net credit from the electric utility over the course of a year. On the natural gas side, total gas costs averaged $ 377 per year (for heating, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying). Total energy costs were even less - $ 337 per year, including all utility fees. The highest annual energy bill for any home evaluated was $ 458; the lowest was $ 171...|$|E

50|$|The {{storage heater}} can only heat {{with the energy}} stored the night before. Thus if the system was {{switched}} off or if the charge control was set too low, {{there may not be}} sufficient energy to heat the rooms, and this can only be corrected for the next day. This is a problem for example when the weather turns cold unexpectedly, or when returning from a vacation late at night, or users simply not thinking to change the settings because they are at a comfortable temperature. Some heaters alleviate this problem by also allowing heating during the day, but this is typically expensive (because the electricity is charged at full rate). Even {{under the best of circumstances}} it can be difficult to accurately judge how to set the thermostats as setting them too low overnight can cause the heater to be having no perceived effect while setting them at maximum will increase the cost of running them.

Those women who do deliver in health facilities are unable to receive intensive neonatal care when necessary. Level I and Level II neonatal care is unavailable in most health facilities in India, and in most developing countries. There is a need in India for Level III care units also. The establishment of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in India and developing countries would require space and location, finances, equipment, staff, protocols of care, and infection control measures. Neonatal mortality could be reduced by initially adding NICUs at a few key hospitals. The recommendation is for 30 NICU beds per million population. Each bed would require 50 square feet per cradle and proper climate control. Funds {{would have to be}} diverted from adult care. The largest expenses would be in equipment purchase, maintenance, and repair. Trained technicians would be required to operate and monitor the sophisticated ventilators and incubators. The nurse-patient ratio should be 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 for other infants. Training mothers to work in the NICUs would help ease the problems of trained nursing staff shortages. Protocols need not be highly technical; they could include the substitution of radiant warmers and <b>room</b> <b>heaters</b> for expensive incubators, the provision of breast milk, and the reduction of invasive procedures such as venipuncture and intubation. Nocosomial infections should be reduced by vacuum cleaning and wet mopping with a disinfectant twice a day, changing disinfectants periodically, maintaining mops to avoid infection, decontamination of linen, daily changing of tubing, and cleaning and sterilizing oxygen hoods and resuscitation equipment, and maintaining an iatrogenic infection record book, which could be used to study the infection patterns and to apply the appropriate antibiotics...|$|R
