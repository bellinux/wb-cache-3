2500|$|In April 1998, American {{photographer}} John S Callahan organised {{the first}} surfing {{project in the}} Andamans, starting from Phuket in Thailand {{with the assistance of}} Southeast Asia Liveaboards (SEAL), a UK owned dive charter company. With a crew of international professional surfers, they crossed the Andaman Sea on the yacht Crescent and cleared formalities in Port Blair. The group proceeded to Little Andaman Island, where they spent ten days surfing several spots for the first time, including Jarawa Point near Hut Bay and the long right <b>reef</b> <b>point</b> at the southwest tip of the island, named Kumari Point. The resulting article in Surfer Magazine, [...] "Quest for Fire" [...] by journalist Sam George, put the Andaman Islands on the surfing map for the first time. Footage of the waves of the Andaman Islands also appeared in the film Thicker than Water, shot by documentary filmmaker Jack Johnson, who later achieved worldwide fame as a popular musician. Callahan went on to make several more surfing projects in the Andamans, including a trip to the Nicobar Islands in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a select}} handful of Americans, the 1880s and the [...] "Gay Nineties" [...] meant affluence {{on a scale}} without precedent. Mount Desert, still remote from the cities of the East, became a retreat for {{prominent}} people of the time. The Rockefellers, Morgans, Fords, Vanderbilts, Carnegies, and Astors, chose to spend their summers here. Not content with the simple lodgings then available, these families transformed the landscape of Mount Desert Island with elegant estates, ironically called [...] "cottages". The landscape architect Beatrix Farrand, at the Cadwalder Rawle - Rhinelander Jones family summer home <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Estate, designed the gardens {{for many of these}} people. Projects included the Chinese inspired garden at [...] "The Eyrie" [...] for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller at Seal Harbor (1926–35), and the planting plans for subtle roads at Acadia National Park sponsored by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (c.1930). Luxury, refinement, and ostentatious gatherings replaced buckboard rides, picnics, and day-long hikes of an earlier era. Some rusticators also formed [...] "Village Improvement Societies" [...] which constructed hiking trails and walking paths connecting the Island's villages to its interior mountains. For over 40years, the wealthy held sway at Mount Desert, but the Great Depression and World War II marked the end of such extravagance. The final blow came in 1947 when a fire of monumental proportions consumed many of the great estates.|$|E

50|$|When Farrand {{came to the}} property, {{she brought}} some of her plants from <b>Reef</b> <b>Point,</b> and {{established}} gardens {{on either side of}} her wing. The front garden, east of the wing, featured her favorite Asian and native plants, set in a space lined by a low box hedge with a bluestone path. A rustic bench taken from <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> adorns this space. The rear garden is a larger formal space, surrounded by a fence from <b>Reef</b> <b>Point,</b> and is visually joined to the house, which has French doors from each room opening out onto it.|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} part of her life Farrand devoted herself to {{creating}} a landscape study center at <b>Reef</b> <b>Point,</b> Maine. Here she continued developing the extensive garden and preparing the property for a transition to a public study center. She published the <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens Bulletin (1946-55) in which she reported on the progress of the gardens and center.|$|E
50|$|Following the dismantlement of <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Beatrix Farrand {{joined the}} Garlands, Lewis and Amy at Garland Farm Estate in their 1800s farm house near Salisbury Cove. Lewis Garland was the former {{administrative}} gardener of <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens and Amy his wife, also a horticulturalist, {{was one of}} Farrand’s close friends. The main house at <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> was dismantled; however some fixtures, materials, and architectural elements were salvaged for reuse {{in the construction of}} Farrand's extension and addition to the Garland farmhouse. She also planted a small but interestingly laid out garden behind her addition that was maintained by the subsequent owners of the Garland property before it was acquired by the Beatrix Farrand Society. The <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> property itself was sold to Robert W. Patterson, her long-trusted architect and <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> board member. The vegetation of the estate however held a different future. Charles Kenneth Savage, local innkeeper, garden designer and board member, conceived of bold plan to rescue Farrand’s plants from the estate. With financial support, from John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and other summer residents, the plants were moved and eventually supplied the material for two future gardens. Savage designed these two new gardens in Northeast Harbor (the Asticou Azalea Garden and Thuya Garden), raised funds for their creation, and supervised their construction.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not without}} an effort I tied the tack, or forward corner of the mainsail, down; then, floundering aft, hauled the afterside of {{it down to the}} boom. That {{accomplished}} and the sail thus reduced by some two feet all along its foot, there remained to be tied the row of short lines, or <b>reef</b> <b>points,</b> which would hold the discarded portion when rolled up; and when part of these were knotted it was with misgivings I leaped up on the after-deck. The long, jerking boom projected a fathom beyond the stern, and I must hold on by my toes while leaning out over the water as I pulled the <b>reef</b> <b>points</b> at that end together.|$|R
50|$|Traditional Highland {{practice}} {{was to make}} sails of tough, thick-threaded wool, with ropes being made of moss-fir or heather. Medieval sails, in the Highlands as elsewhere, are shown as being sewn out of many small squares, and there is possible evidence of <b>reef</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{residence}} was shingle-style with turrets, {{and high}} gables overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Wide verandas {{from which to}} view the sea were embroidered by vines of clematis and honeysuckle while the structure itself was shielded from the strong ocean winds by red and white spruce trees. Vegetation of this property proved crucial. The continually evolving gardens interwoven by grass paths that surrounded the <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> structure were essential to creating the estate. In 1917, <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> was deeded to Beatrix by her mother. In 1935 following her mother’s death Farrand and her husband Max Farrand (1869-1945), set about turning <b>Reef</b> <b>point</b> into a horticultural study center, {{one of the most}} ambitious projects in her career. The Farrands spent their summers at <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> and together, began creating their visionary educational enterprise: <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens. This property played an instrumental role in Beatrix Farrand’s life and her dedication to the estate with particular attention to the grounds was a lifelong and heartfelt endeavor. One of many projects which was undertaken at the estate was the creation of a bog garden, to illustrate how indigenous plants could be used creatively. Conversely, groupings of numerous types of azaleas demonstrated how seemingly exotic plants could survive the severe Maine climate.|$|E
50|$|The Asticou Azalea Garden in Northeast Harbor, Maine, United States, is {{a popular}} visitor attraction. It was created by lifelong {{resident}} of the village, Charles Kenneth Savage, in 1956. Savage also created <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Estate in nearby Bar Harbor. It was from <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> that several specimens, with the financial assistance of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., were moved, including the weeping hemlock, {{just north of the}} main bridge.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps in {{part because}} of the {{remoteness}} of location, scholarly use of <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens did not achieve the level Farrand desired. A devastating fire on Mount Desert Island in 1947 wiped out much of Bar Harbor's tax base, and the town badly needed its few taxpayers to assist with the cost of recovery. In 1955, concerned with the survival of <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens, following Bar Harbor's refusal to grant it tax-exempt status, Farrand decided that Reef Point’s future was not secure and reluctantly abandoned the project. Once the decision was made to end <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens, she swiftly took the steps to sell <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> for development. Farrand donated the contents of her library, a large collection of fine art prints, horticulture books, and design drawings to the department of Landscape Architecture at University of California, Berkeley to continue her initial goal of spreading knowledge and education concerning landscape design. Her herbarium of approximately 2000 sheets that documents exactly what plants were used and where they were planted is housed at the University & Jepson Herbaria, University of California, Berkeley.|$|E

50|$|The Garland Farm {{property}} {{consists of}} about 5 acre of woods and fields, with a main house, greenhouse, barn, {{and a small}} shop. The main house, a Cape built c. 1800 and rebuilt in the mid-19th century, was acquired by the Garland family in the 1870s, and was the home of Lewis and Amy Garland, the superintendent and chief horticulturalist of Beatrix Farrand's <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Estate. When Farrand decided in 1955 to abandon <b>Reef</b> <b>Point,</b> the Garlands took her in, building an addition onto {{the rear of the}} house, which was designed by Bar Harbor architect Robert W. Patterson. This addition is separated from the main house by a narrow hyphen, and uses materials recycled from Farrand's <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> cottage, which was demolished.|$|E

50|$|In 1946 Farrand began {{publishing}} the <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Bulletins {{in an attempt}} to explain the undertakings at <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens with the primary focus on the horticulture of the property. The species in the garden were documented, their growth and habits often closely logged and graphed. Plant choices for specific conditions were under intensive study, in this case plants suitable for the Bar Harbor region was of primary interest. Along with this publication, the grounds and gardens of the estate itself Farrand created a large library and collection of educational materials.|$|E
