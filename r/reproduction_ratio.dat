50|$|The {{ratio of}} the subject size on the film plane (or sensor plane) to the actual subject size {{is known as the}} <b>{{reproduction}}</b> <b>ratio.</b> Likewise, a macro lens is classically a lens capable of reproduction ratios of at least 1:1, although it often refers to any lens with a large <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio,</b> despite rarely exceeding 1:1.|$|E
5000|$|To {{calculate}} 35 mm equivalent <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio,</b> simply {{multiply the}} actual maximum magnification {{of the lens}} by the 35 mm conversion factor, or [...] "crop factor" [...] of the camera. If the actual magnification and/or crop factor are unknown (such {{as is the case}} with many compact or point-and-shoot digital cameras), simply take a photograph of a mm ruler placed vertically in the frame focused at the maximum magnification distance of the lens and measure the height of the frame.

5000|$|Micro — Micro-Nikkor lenses {{are capable}} of high <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratios,</b> {{typically}} 1:2 or 1:1, for macro photography. The first Micro-Nikkor lenses were created for producing microforms of Kanji text.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reproduction</b> <b>ratios</b> {{much greater}} than 1:1 are {{considered}} to be photomicrography, often achieved with digital microscope (photomicrography {{should not be confused with}} microphotography, the art of making very small photographs, such as for microforms).|$|R
5000|$|This lens {{is capable}} of macro photography, with minimum {{focusing}} down to 18 cm/7.1" [...] (<b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio</b> 1:2.7). It incorporates a floating focus system {{in order to minimize}} distortion, spherical aberration and astigmatism, and provides high performance at all shooting distances. The high <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio</b> and wide angle of view allow capturing high quality images not only of a subject but also the surrounding scenery.|$|E
50|$|Given its {{unusually high}} 1:4 (0.25x) image <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio,</b> the 24mm lens can be {{considered}} a pseudo-macro lens.|$|E

5000|$|Although labeled as [...] "Macro" [...] on {{the lens}} {{and in some}} literature, {{this is not a}} true macro lens, with a maximum <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio</b> of only 1:5.3.|$|E
5000|$|While a [...] "true" [...] {{macro lens}} {{is defined as}} a lens having a <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1:1 on the film or sensor plane, with small sensor format digital cameras an actual <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1:1 is rarely {{achieved}} or needed to take macro photographs. What macro photographers often care about more is simply knowing the size of the smallest object that can fill the frame. For example, the 12 megapixel Micro Four Thirds Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1 camera with a 2x crop sensor only requires a 1:2 <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio</b> to take a picture with the same subject size, resolution, and apparent magnification as a 12 megapixel [...] "full-frame" [...] Nikon D700 camera, when the images are viewed on screen or printed at the same size. Thus a Four Thirds system macro lens like the Olympus Zuiko Digital 35 mm F3.5 Macro lens with a true maximum image magnification of 1.0x is rated as having a [...] "2.0x 35 mm equivalent magnification".|$|E

50|$|A {{wide-angle}} {{process lens}} with 4 elements in 4 groups, optimized for <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratios</b> between 2:1 and 1:2. The 270 mm lens has an angle of coverage of 72°, the 240 mm has 80°, and the 210 mm has 86°, which give these lenses gigantic image circles, though the image softens considerably near {{the edges of}} coverage.|$|R
50|$|Since digital compact camera sensor sizes {{come in a}} wide {{diversity}} of sizes and camera manufacturers rarely publish the macro <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratios</b> for these cameras, a {{good rule of thumb}} is that whenever a 24 mm vertical object just fits, or is too tall to fit in the camera viewfinder, you are taking a macro photograph.|$|R
40|$|Ebola {{virus disease}} is a lethal human and primate disease that {{requires}} a particular attention from the international health authorities due to important recent outbreaks in some Western African countries and isolated cases in European and North-America continents. Regarding the emergency of this situation, various decision tools, such as mathematical models, were developed to assist the authorities to focus their efforts in important factors to eradicate Ebola. In a previous work, we have proposed an original deterministic spatial-temporal model, called Be-CoDiS (Between-Countries Disease Spread), to study the evolution of human diseases within and between countries by taking into consideration the movement of people between geographical areas. This model was validated by considering numerical experiments regarding the 2014 - 16 West African Ebola Virus Disease epidemic. In this article, we propose to perform a stability analysis of Be-CoDiS. Our first objective is to study the equilibrium states of simplified versions of this model, limited to the cases of one an two countries, and to determine their basic <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratios.</b> Then, {{in order to give}} some recommendations for the allocation of resources used to control the disease, we perform a sensitivity analysis of those basic <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratios</b> regarding the model parameters. Finally, we validate the obtained results by considering numerical experiments based on data from the 2014 - 16 West African Ebola Virus Disease epidemic...|$|R

5000|$|... 35 mm {{equivalent}} magnification, or 35 mm equivalent <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio,</b> is {{a measure}} that indicates the apparent magnification achieved with a small sensor format, or [...] "crop sensor" [...] digital camera compared to a 35 mm-based image enlarged to the same print size.

Despite being more related to other workers’ sons, worker-laid eggs were consumed by other workers. Approximately two thirds of those workers were reproductive workers. Occasionally these workers replaced the egg with {{one of their own}} (in 31% of the cases were due to selfish policing). Workers never removed their own eggs and if a non-reproductive worker removed a worker-laid egg, then the queen would replace it with her own egg.|$|R

The local and global asymptotic stability of the disease free equilibrium are determined and shown to only exist if R 01 ≤ 1 and R 02 ≤ 1.

50|$|The {{first four}} issues were {{published}} as double-sized editions with a 1:1 <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio,</b> meaning the original art was not resized {{when it was}} published. The books were folded in half to fit on standard news racks, and in the current sized protective polymer bags. The back cover of the fourth issue advertised a fifth, coming in June 2003, however that issue was never published.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{advances}} in sensor technology, today’s small-sensor digital cameras can rival the macro capabilities of a DSLR with a “true” macro lens, despite having a lower <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio,</b> making macro photography more widely accessible {{at a lower}} cost. In the digital age, a [...] "true" [...] macro photograph can be more practically defined as a photograph with a vertical subject height of 24 mm or less.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{technical}} {{photography and}} film-based processes, where {{the size of}} the image on the negative or image sensor is the subject of discussion, the finished print or on-screen image more commonly lends a photograph its macro status. For example, when producing a 6×4 inch (15×10 cm) print using 35 format (36×24 mm) film or sensor, a life-size result is possible with a lens having only a 1:4 <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ordinary lenses can be {{used for}} macro {{photography}} by using a [...] "reversing ring." [...] This ring attaches to the filter thread on the front of a lens and makes it possible to attach the lens in reverse. Excellent quality results up to 4x life-size magnification are possible. For cameras with all-electronic communications between the lens and the camera body specialty reversing rings are available which preserve these communications. When used with extension tubes or bellows, a highly versatile, true macro (greater than life size) system can be assembled. Since non-macro lenses are optimized for small <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratios,</b> reversing the lens allows it to be used for reciprocally high ratios.|$|R
40|$|An {{optimal control}} on the {{treatment}} of the transmission of tuberculosis-HIV coinfection model is proposed in this paper. We use two treatments, that is, anti-TB and antiretroviral, to control the spread of TB and HIV infections, respectively. We first present an uncontrolled TB-HIV coinfection model. The model exhibits four equilibria, namely, the disease-free, the HIV-free, the TB-free, and the coinfection equilibria. We further obtain two basic <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratios</b> corresponding to TB and HIV infections. These ratios determine the existence and stability of the equilibria of the model. The optimal control theory is then derived analytically by applying the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. The optimality system is performed numerically to illustrate the effectiveness of the treatments...|$|R
40|$|In a {{companion}} paper two stochastic models, {{useful for the}} initial behaviour of a parasitic infection, were introduced. Now we analyse the long term behaviour. First a law of large numbers is proved which allows us to analyse the deterministic analogues of the stochastic models. The behaviour of the deterministic models {{is analogous to the}} stochastic models in that again three basic <b>reproduction</b> <b>ratios</b> are necessary to fully describe the information needed to separate growth from extinction. The existence of stationary solutions is shown in the deterministic models, which {{can be used as a}} justification for simulation of quasi-equilibria in the stochastic models. Host-mortality is included in all models. The proofs involve martingale and coupling methods...|$|R
