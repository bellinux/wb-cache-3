40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the growth and}} subsequent application of InAs/GaAs quantum dots for novel research applications including entangled photon sources, and coupled quantum well/quantum dot devices. This thesis gives an overview of quantum dot growth and tunable parameters of quantum dots (QDs), showing a review of prior work detailing their composition and properties. Special attention is given to wavelength tuning, and optimisation of the linewidth for a target application, including analysis of post-growth annealing. Subsequent discussion focuses on low-density quantum dot samples, {{both in terms of}} growth and application. In conjunction with Cambridge University, micro-photoluminescence results of a short-wavelength QD sample are demonstrated, showing successful use of the <b>rotation</b> <b>stop</b> growth method, with further analysis and comparisons made with photoluminescence maps and atomic force microscopy. Analysis of long- wavelength (> 1300 nm at room temperature) QDs is also shown, with single dot work being performed on rotation-stop growth samples in analysis of Fine Structure Splitting (FSS) of individual QDs by Heriot Watt University. Results show an unexpectedly low FSS value for samples grown at the University of Sheffield, with potential for long wavelength entangled photon emitters. Growth optimisation of both the long- and short-wavelength structures is described, with optimisation required for the longer-wavelength samples, due to a comparative lack of cross-wafer QD density variation. A novel adjustment to photoluminescence excitation is also discussed, with polarisation analysis being performed on QD samples designed for optical emission. Results indicate that QD properties have little to no effect on the spin retention in GaAs-capped QDs: instead surrounding material has a larger effect, indicating that spin loss happens primarily between excitation and capture...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the effect of}} friction time and friction pressure on tensile strength of carbon steel welded joint by a low heat input friction welding method (LHl method) that was developed by authors. Medium (0. 35 ％) and high (0. 55 ％) carbon steel joints were made by friction speed of 27. 5 s^ through a continuous drive friction welding machine with an electromagnetic clutch {{in order to prevent}} braking deformation during <b>rotation</b> <b>stop.</b> The experiments produced the following summarized results. (1) Medium carbon steel joint did not obtain the same tensile strength as that of the base metal, and the fracture occurred at the welded interface when it was made at friction time up to the initial torque by friction pressure of 30 MPa. However, the joint obtained the same tensile strength as that of the base metal，and the fracture occurred at the base metal when it was made at friction time up to the initial torque by 90 MPa. (2) Medium carbon steel joint by 30 MPa fractured at the welded interface due to the unjoined region, which was produced at the peripheral region of the welded interface during friction process. The unjoined region had not produced with increasing friction pressure. (3) High carbon steel joint did not obtain the same tensile strength as that of the base metal, and the fracture occurred at the welded interface when it was made at friction time up to the initial torque by 30 and 90 MPa. (4) High carbon steel joint fractured at the welded interface due to the quench crack, which was produced during cooling stage after welding. The quench crack reduced with increasing friction pressure. However, the joint by high friction pressure (300 MPa) did not obtain the same tensile strength as that of the base metal, and it fractured at the base metal, because the center portion at the welded interface hardly joined after the initial torque...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the quality and}} its improvement of friction welded joints between a rectangular section bar and a circular section bar. Three kinds of rectangular section bars with different aspect ratio {{were used for the}} experiment. The rectangular section bars and circular section bars were joined by using a continuous drive(brake type) friction welding machine with an electromagnetic clutch in order to prevent a braking deformation during <b>rotation</b> <b>stop.</b> 　The low heat input friction welding method (LHI method) was used for joining. 　　The following conclusions were given. 　　(1) The first phase of the friction stage was composed of wear and seizure stages. 　This result was similar to the join of circular section bars of same diameter. 　　(2) When the areas of the weld faying surfaces were same each other，the initial torque and the elapsed time for initial torque hardly changed in spite of the aspect ratios of rectangular section bars. 　　(3) The welded joints obtained only the first stage (up to initial torque) had 100 ％ joint efficiency， but fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. When small aspcct ratios of rectangular section bars and a circular section bar were welded， several joints fractured at the base metal although they had a little defect in the welded interface. 　　(4) When the joints were made by the LHI method in Ar atmosphere， the welded joints had 100 ％ joint efficiency, but fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. 　　(5) The welded joints had 100 ％joint efficiency and fractured at the base metal when the joints were made by the LHI method with adding forge pressure (improving LHI method). 　On the other hand，most of the welded joints made by the conventional method with forge pressure had fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. 　　(6) The improving LHI method has more advantages than those welded by the conventional method,I. e. ，less burn-off,less burr and less deformation of welded interface area. As a conclusion，it was clarincd that the improving LHI method is the most effective friction welding method for rectangular section bars and circular section bars...|$|E

40|$|The 5 to 10 peritrichously {{inserted}} complex flagella of Rhizobium meliloti MVII- 1 {{were found}} to form right-handed flagellar bundles. Bacteria swam at speeds up to 60 microns/s, their random three-dimensional walk consisting of straight runs and quick directional changes (turns) without the vigorous angular motion (tumbling) seen in swimming Escherichia coli cells. Observations of R. meliloti cells tethered by a single flagellar filament revealed that flagellar rotation was exclusively clockwise, interrupted by very brief stops (shorter than 0. 1 s), typically every 1 to 2 s. Swimming bacteria responded to chemotactic stimuli by extending their runs, and tethered bacteria responded by prolonged intervals of clockwise rotation. Moreover, the motility tracks of a generally nonchemotactic ("smooth") mutant consisted of long runs without sharp turns, and tethered mutant cells showed continuous clockwise <b>rotation</b> without detectable <b>stops.</b> These observations suggested that the runs of swimming cells correspond to clockwise flagellar rotation, and the turns correspond to the brief <b>rotation</b> <b>stops.</b> We propose that single rotating flagella (depending on their insertion point on the rod-shaped bacterial surface) can reorient a swimming cell whenever the majority of flagellar motors stop...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel of a 1 / 40 -scale model of the McDonnell F- 101 A airplane to alleviate the unfavorable spinning characteristics encountered with the airplane. The model results indicate that a suitable strake extended on the inboard side of the nose of the airplane (right side in a right spin) in conjunction with the use of optimum control recovery technique will terminate spin rotation of the airplane. It may be difficult to recover from subsequent high angle-of-attack trimmed flight attitudes even by forward stick movement.

40|$|The single {{flagellum}} of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides {{was found}} to be medially located on the cell body. Observation of free-swimming bacteria, and bacteria tethered by their flagellar filaments, revealed that the flagellum could only rotate in the clockwise direction; switching of the direction of rotation was never observed. Flagellar <b>rotation</b> <b>stopped</b> periodically, typically several times a minute for up to several seconds each. Reorientation of swimming cells appeared {{to be the result of}} Brownian <b>rotation</b> during the <b>stop</b> periods. The flagellar filament displayed polymorphism; detached and nonrotating filaments were usually seen as large-amplitude helices of such short wavelength that they appeared as flat coils or circles, whereas the filaments on swimming cells showed a normal (small-amplitude, long-wavelength) helical form. With attached filaments, the transition from the normal to the coiled form occurred when the flagellar motor stopped rotating, proceeding from the distal end towards the cell body. It is possible that both the relaxation process and the smaller frictional resistance after relaxation may act to enhance the rate of reorientation of the cell. The transition from the coiled to the normal form occurred when the motor restarted, proceeding from the proximal end outwards, which might further contribute to the reorientation of the cell before it reaches a stable swimming geometry...|$|R

25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See Liquid mirror telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the <b>rotation</b> <b>stops,</b> and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|R

40|$|We {{looked for}} a {{feedback}} system in Escherichia coli that might sense the rotational bias of flagellar motors and regulate {{the activity of the}} chemotaxis receptor kinase. Our search was {{based on the assumption that}} any machinery that senses rotational bias will be perturbed if flagellar <b>rotation</b> <b>stops.</b> We monitored the activity of the kinase in swimming cells by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between Renilla luciferase fused to the phosphatase, CheZ, and yellow fluorescent protein fused to the response regulator, CheY. Then we jammed the flagellar motors by adding an antifilament antibody that crosslinks adjacent filaments in flagellar bundles. At steady state, the rate of phosphorylation of CheY is equal to the rate of dephosphorylation of CheY-P, which is proportional to the degree of association between CheZ and CheY-P, the quantity sensed by BRET. No changes were observed, even upon addition of an amount of antibody that stopped the swimming of > 95 % of cells within a few seconds. So, the kinase does not appear to be sensitive to motor output. The BRET technique is complementary to one based on FRET, described previously. Its reliability was confirmed by measurements of the response of cells to the addition of attractants...|$|R

40|$|The reafference {{model has}} {{frequently}} {{been used to}} explain spatial constancy during eye and head movements. We have found that its basic concepts also form part of the information processing necessary for the control and recalibration of reaching movements. Reaching was studied in a novel force environment [...] a rotating room that creates centripetal forces of the type that could someday substitute for gravity in space flight, and Coriolis forces which are side effects of rotation. We found that inertial, noncontacting Coriolis forces deviate the path and endpoint of reaching movements, a finding that shows the inadequacy of equilibrium position models of movement control. Repeated movements in the rotating room quickly lead to normal movement patterns and to a failure to perceive the perturbing forces. The first movements made after <b>rotation</b> <b>stops,</b> without Coriolis forces present, show mirror-image deviations and evoke perception of a perturbing force even though none is present. These patterns of sensorimotor control and adaptation can largely be explained {{on the basis of}} comparisons of efference copy, reafferent muscle spindle, and cutaneous mechanoreceptor signals. We also describe experiments on human locomotion using an apparatus similar to that which Mittelstaedt used to study the optomotor response of the Eristalis fly. These results show that the reafference principle relates as well to the perception of the forces acting on and exerted by the body during voluntary locomotion...|$|R

40|$|Meseres corlissi Petz and Foissner (1992) is an oligotrichine ciliate {{covering}} the resting cyst with epicortical scales called lepidosomes. We studied in detail encystment {{as well as}} the genesis and release of the lepidosomes, using live observation, morphometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Encystment is remarkable in changing body shape distinctly and showing two phases of intense rotation. When encysting, the conical body becomes globular and forms a discoidal “head” via a fibrous ligament. Then, the cell rotates rapidly about its main axis for a minute. We speculate that this rotation transports the lepidosomes and cyst wall precursors to the cell’s cortex. When <b>rotation</b> <b>stops,</b> the lepidosomes are released within about 5 - 20 s. Then occurs a second, slow rotation phase lasting several minutes and possibly distributing the material released by the cyst wall precursors. The lepidosomes develop in Golgi vesicles. Maturation thus occurs in a membrane-bound vesicle and is a complex process with seven distinct stages. The central cavity of the lepidosome develops asymmetrically, and the large meshes of the lepidosome wall develop earlier than the small ones. Growth of the lepidosomes does not occur by vesicular transport processes. The lepidosomes are released by classical exocytosis. The lepidosome (vesicle) membrane closes the port and becomes part of the newly forming cortex. Detailed data on encystment and lepidosome genesis are rare.

The materials joined were mild steels (same materials) ，and a brake type friction welding machine was used for joining. In actual experiment, I. e., the low heat input friction welding method (LHI method) ，the electromagnetic clutch was used in order to exclude braking deformation at <b>rotation</b> <b>stopping.</b> The following are concluded. (1) The joints obtained only in the first stage (up to initial peak torque) had 100 ％ joint efficiency and 90 degrees bend ductility with no crack.

(2) The fracture occurred at the substrates (not at the welded interface) in welded joints when friction torque was close to initial peak torque. It was clarified that those joints has less width of heat affected zone and less width of hardening. (3) It was clarified that the friction welded joints without using the forging stage (the friction welded joints by using the LHI method) have same mechanical properties as those welded by the conventional friction welding process including that stage.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the combined effects on reaching {{movements of the}} transient, movement-dependent Coriolis forces and the static centrifugal forces generated in a rotating environment. Specifically, we assessed the effects of comparable Coriolis force perturbations in different static force backgrounds. Two groups of subjects made reaching movements toward a just-extinguished visual target before rotation began, during 10 rpm counterclockwise rotation, and after rotation ceased. One group was seated on the axis of rotation, the other 2. 23 m away. The resultant of gravity and centrifugal force on the hand was 1. 0 g for the on-center group during 10 rpm rotation, and 1. 031 g for the off-center group because of the 0. 25 g centrifugal force present. For both groups, rightward Coriolis forces, approximately 0. 2 g peak, were generated during voluntary arm movements. The endpoints and paths of the initial per-rotation movements were deviated rightward for both groups by comparable amounts. Within 10 subsequent reaches, the on-center group regained baseline accuracy and straight-line paths; however, even after 40 movements the off-center group had not resumed baseline endpoint accuracy. Mirror-image aftereffects occurred when <b>rotation</b> <b>stopped.</b> These findings demonstrate that manual control is disrupted by transient Coriolis force perturbations and that adaptation can occur {{even in the absence}} of visual feedback. An increase, even a small one, in background force level above normal gravity does not affect the size of the reaching errors induced by Coriolis forces nor does it affect the rate of reacquiring straight reaching paths; however, it does hinder restoration of reaching accuracy...|$|R
