40|$|The {{long wave}} around the {{breakwater}} gap is discussed {{for the case}} of the oblique incidence of a train of periodic waves. In the analysis, the incident wave always meets at a sharp angle with the right-hand, breakwater. The most conspicuous features found in the analysis are as follows. A reverse current appears in the windward waters around the terminus of the left-hand breakwater for the wave of long wavelength which is the current against the direction of the incident wave travel. The stagnation point discriminating between the above <b>reversecurrent</b> and the advancing one is in a sense moving away from the breakwater gap along the left-hand breakwater for the increase of the incident angle of the incoming wave. In the analysis concerning the influence of the breakwater wing upon the diffracted wave from the other breakwater, it is found that the wave is reflected from the breakwater shadow. |本報告においては防波堤に対して進入波が斜入射する場合(ここで進入波は常に右手の防波堤と鋭角をなすように与えられている) の論議がなされている. 数値解析によって判明した著しい現象は次のごとくである. 左手の防波堤端近くの風上側の水域で進入波の進行方向とは逆向きの流れが波長の長い波に対して現われる. そしてこの逆流の規模は進入波の進入角(進入波と右手の防波堤とがなす角) が大きくなるにつれて大きくなってくる. また回析波に対する防波堤端の影響に関する解析において,防波堤の陰から風上側への反射波が見出される...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the organic printed electronics facilitates manufacturing low-cost, light-weighted ﬂexible electronic components and circuits. The ﬂexible circuits {{have the potential to}} be widely used in the future electronic systems. For instance, the chip used in the passive Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) tags can be fabricated on ﬂexible substrates. These passive tags acquire their energy from the incident electromagnetic waves via a harvesting circuit. The Schottky diode is {{the main part of the}} harvesting circuit in order to rectify the input AC signal and deliver the DC output signal required to power the main circuit. The acquired energy is augmented if the rectiﬁcation ratio of the diode increases. The rectiﬁcation ratio increases through increasing the forward current or reducing the <b>reversecurrent</b> of the diode, which can be realized by optimizing the metal-semiconductor interfaces. In fact, the optimization of the ohmic contact increases the forward current, whereas optimizating the Schottky contact decreases the reverse current of the diode. In this thesis, the optimization of the ohmic silver-semiconductor interface of the organic Schottky diode has been studied. The optimization is fulﬁlled through controlling the thickness of the silver oxide layer by utilizing anodization as an electrochemical treatment. The performance of the diode was evaluated by examining the current-voltage and AC rectiﬁcation characteristics of the diode. It was observed that the forward current, and accordingly, the rectiﬁcation ratio of the diode increases as the thickness of the anodic oxide layer increases. The augment of the rectiﬁcation ratio increases the DC output voltage of the half-wave rectifying circuit. However, the existence of the charged traps inﬂuences the DC outputs of the rectiﬁer for the diodes with the same rectiﬁcation ratios...|$|E
