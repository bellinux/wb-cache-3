25|$|Bristol's design, the Type 130, was a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction. Bristol's last monoplane design, the 1927 Bagshot, {{had suffered}} {{from lack of}} torsional rigidity in the wings leading to aileron reversal. This led to an extensive research program at Bristol {{which resulted in a}} wing design with a stressed metal skin <b>rivetted</b> to an internal framework consisting of multiple spars and the ribs. This was the basis of the Bombay's wing, which had seven spars, with high-tensile steel flanges and alclad webs. The aircraft had a twin-tail and a fixed tailwheel undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|The Seastar's {{fuselage}} {{is composed}} of a fiberglass composite material, which is corrosion-proof {{as well as being}} less prone to leaks in comparison to <b>rivetted</b> metal hull counterparts. Unlike typical floatplanes, which are often conversions of land-based aircraft, the Seastar has a low vertical center of gravity, achieved in part by carrying all of its fuel within its sponsons instead of the wings. The sponsons, which provide stability while submerged on the water, are shaped to break surface tension and to generate considerable lift during the acceleration performed during takeoff; they also accommodate the main landing gear. Other flying boats often retract the landing gear into the hull instead. The landing gear can be optionally removed and reinstalled when needed; a special 'water mode' for the landing gear is also present which prevents their deployment during a water-based landing.|$|E

He set about a series of changes that were to reform the way engineering was taught worldwide. He insisted that all of his students received not only lectures in engineering principles but also a firm grounding in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology and the other sciences upon which engineering is based. He also asked that an engineering laboratory be built so that the students could have first hand experience of the applications of their theoretical studies. This proposal met widespread support from the engineering profession and the presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers were among the leading figures who supported it. In 1878 the laboratory was built and put to use, {{it was the first of}} its kind in the world and proved so useful that over the next nine years ten other educational institutions followed Professor Kennedy's example and built their own. Whilst working at the UCL he translated Franz Reuleaux's Kinematics of Machinery into English for the first time in 1876. In 1886, he published Mechanics of Machinery, the first time that a book based on Reuleaux's kinematic analysis had been published in English. He also used the laboratory to carry out experiments to determine the strength and elasticity of various materials and was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society for this work in 1887. There followed a series of other experiments in which he investigated the strength of <b>rivetted</b> joints and the possibility of developing new electric turbines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{methods can}} be used to {{assemble}} large mechanical structures. Using <b>rivets</b> is one of these methods. <b>Rivets</b> are lighter than bolts and allows for efficient assembly. The cylindrical structure has a discontinuous <b>rivet</b> assembled region.

This paper evaluates the force placed upon <b>rivets</b> used to assemble cylindrical structures and strength of structures assembled with <b>rivets.</b> Plastic deformation of <b>rivets</b> occurs at 4 kN and <b>rivets</b> are destroyed at 7 kN. However, <b>rivets</b> are designed to transfer load to neighboring <b>rivets</b> when they are overloaded. Structural test were accomplished using tension and bending load condition. The structural tests showed that plastic deformation first occurs in the fastening where the <b>rivet</b> meets the outside of the cylinder and a number of <b>rivets</b> exhibited this type of deformation. The secondary phase of deformation occurs in the fastening where the <b>rivet</b> meets the inside of the cylinder.

50|$|A <b>rivet</b> gun, {{also known}} as a {{pneumatic}} hammer, is a type of tool used to drive <b>rivets.</b> The <b>rivet</b> gun is used on the manufactured head side of the <b>rivet</b> and a bucking bar is used on the buck-tail side of the <b>rivet.</b> The energy from the hammer in the <b>rivet</b> gun drives the work and the <b>rivet</b> against the inertia of the bucking bar. As a result, the tail of the <b>rivet</b> is deformed and work-hardened. At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the <b>rivet</b> head and the broadened and flattened tail. Nearly all <b>rivet</b> guns are pneumatically powered. Those <b>rivet</b> guns used to drive <b>rivets</b> in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the behaviour and modelling of self-piercing <b>riveted</b> connections using aluminium <b>rivets.</b> The objective has been to establish a database on the behaviour of self-piercing <b>riveted</b> connections using aluminium <b>rivets</b> with respect to the <b>riveting</b> process, the mechanical behaviour of single <b>riveted</b> connections and the structural behaviour of <b>riveted</b> joints. The objective has been met by a combination of laboratory tests, modelling and non-linear finite element numerical simulations. The thesis consists of four parts, i. e. four independent journal articles. Two articles have been published and two articles are submitted for journal publication. The four parts are introduced by a synopsis, comprising a brief introduction to the problem and motivations for using aluminium <b>rivets,</b> as well as a summary of the main findings and conclusions. Part I presents an initial study on the joining of two aluminium plates in alloy AA 6060 in three tempers W, T 4 and T 6 by using aluminium <b>rivets</b> in alloys, i. e. AA 6068 -T 6, AA 7108 -T 5, and AA 7278 -T 6. Tests have been carried out to understand the behaviour of the aluminium <b>rivets</b> during the self-piercing <b>riveting</b> process. Various defects in the aluminium <b>rivets</b> when joining were detected, e. g. <b>rivet</b> compression and <b>rivet</b> fracture. These defects were avoided by heating the plates to be joined into W temper. The mechanical strength of <b>riveted</b> connections using aluminium <b>rivets</b> was then tested under different loading conditions, and compared with that of a steel <b>riveted</b> connection. The data from the <b>riveting</b> process tests was used to validate a 2 D-axisymmetric model generated in the finite element code LSDYNA for modelling the <b>riveting</b> process by using aluminium <b>rivets.</b> The model was able to capture with reasonable accuracy the overall deformation mode of the <b>riveted</b> connection as well as the force evolution during the <b>riveting</b> process. However, the model was not able to capture the fracture in the <b>rivet</b> since no failure criterion was considered for the aluminium <b>rivets.</b> The main objective of Part II is to propose an adequate failure criterion which is able to predict the initiation of the <b>rivet</b> fracture during the <b>riveting</b> process. Here, a damage-based failure criterion, which was originally proposed by Lemaitre (1992), was chosen. A <b>rivet</b> compression test was proposed to better understand the behaviour of the <b>rivet</b> under compressive stresses. A simple calibration procedure for the failure model parameters was proposed based on inverse modelling of two tests, i. e. <b>rivet</b> compression test and uniaxial tension test. It was found that the model was able to predict the failure in the <b>rivet</b> when used for joining two plate materials with an appropriate friction value and <b>rivet</b> mesh size. Part III evaluates how the <b>riveting</b> process and the subsequent natural aging of the plates to be joined influenced the final mechanical performance of a <b>riveted</b> joint using an aluminium <b>rivet.</b> Two U-shaped specimens in alloy AA 6063 -W, obtained by a solution heattreatment of the alloy in temper T 4, were joined using an aluminium self-pierce <b>rivet</b> in alloy AA 7278 -T 6. The mechanical behaviour was tested after 3 and 30 days of natural aging of these <b>riveted</b> connections. In order to evaluate the process effect on the mechanical properties of the <b>riveted</b> connection, a comprehensive material test programme was carried out. Test results revealed that there is an interaction between the pre-straining and natural aging which lowers the material properties in terms of the flow stress compared to the „virgin‟ material, i. e. the curve obtained after heat treatment and aging only. The process effect on the mechanical behaviour of the <b>riveted</b> connections was investigated more closely by using a 3 D-numerical model. Numerical analyses showed that this lowering effect lowered the force level of the <b>riveted</b> joints by approximately 10 %. Part IV presents a study with the structural behaviour of self-piercing <b>riveted</b> joints based on aluminium and steel <b>rivets</b> respectively. Two T-components made of two open aluminium profiles in alloy AA 6063 temper T 4 joined by 6 and 12 <b>rivets,</b> respectively, were designed and tested under quasi-static loading conditions. A new test device was developed to perform the tests of the T-components under two different load cases. Experimental results of the T-components joined by using aluminium self-piercing <b>rivets</b> were then compared with the corresponding components joined by using steel <b>rivets</b> in terms of force-displacement curves, deformation modes of the components as well as <b>rivet</b> failure modes. The experimental results of the T-components based on aluminium <b>rivets</b> were used to validate a resultant-based point-connector model for self-piercing <b>rivets</b> proposed by Hanssen et al. (2011) using shell elements. It was found that the use of the model for predicting the structural behaviour of <b>riveted</b> joints based on the T-component tests by using shell elements gave acceptable results in most of the cases.
