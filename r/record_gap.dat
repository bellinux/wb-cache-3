For x→∞, we heuristically argue that if the limit of N_q,r(x) / x exists, then the limit is 2; we also conjecture that R(n,q,r) =O_q(n^ 2). Numerical evidence supports the conjectural (a. s.) upper bound R(n,q,r) <φ(q) n^ 2 +(n+ 2) q^ 2 q. The median (over r) of R(n,q,r) grows like a quadratic function of n; so do the mean and quartile points of R(n,q,r). For fixed values of q≳ 200 and n≈ 10, the distribution of R(n,q,r) is skewed to the right and close to both Gumbel and lognormal distributions; however, the skewness appears to slowly decrease as n increases. The existence of a limiting distribution of R(n,q,r) is an open question. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables. Sequel to arXiv: 1610. 0334...|$|E
40|$|The NPOESS Program was {{designed}} primarily to serve operational users who typically need near real time observations and products.

However, these characteristics are critical for climate science and applications since climate signatures are generally small compared to normal observation variability. In this article, we describe a joint NOAA, NASA and USGS program plan to develop climate data records (CDRs). The proposed program systematically evolves a candidate algorithm through a 6 -level research and operational path to maturity, and includes ongoing algorithm maintenance and technology insertion. The proposed program is jointly managed by the responsible agencies, but its execution relies extensively on community expertise and resources. The CDRs resulting from this program would provide a comprehensive set of climate data and information records (CIRs) useful for spatio-temporal detection, analysis and prediction of environmental change, and for development of a complete and coherent environment for climate model execution...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this <b>record.</b> <b>Gap</b> genes are involved in segment determination during early development in dipteran insects (flies, midges, and mosquitoes). We carried out a systematic quantitative comparative analysis of the gap gene network across different dipteran species. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the evolution of this pattern-forming network. As a central component of our project, we created a high-resolution quantitative spatio-temporal data set of gap and maternal co-ordinate gene expression in the blastoderm embryo of the non-drosophilid scuttle fly, Megaselia abdita. Our data include expression patterns in both wild-type and RNAi-treated embryos. The data-covering 10 genes, 10 time points, and over 1, 000 individual embryos-consist of original embryo images, quantified expression profiles, extracted positions of expression boundaries, and integrated expression patterns, plus metadata and intermediate processing steps. These data provide a valuable resource for researchers interested in the comparative study of gene regulatory networks and pattern formation, an essential step towards a more quantitative and mechanistic understanding of developmental evolution.

40|$|The EFDA-JET tokamak is an {{experimental}} fusion device researching fusion {{as a means}} of energy production. Inside the toroidal vessel, plasma with temperature in excess of 100 million degrees Celsius is generated and constrained by high power magnetic fields. Additional protection is provided by tiles which clad the inside of the machine. As part of a major upgrade existing heat protective tiles are to be replaced with an advanced design, and renewed interest has been shown in dimensional measurement of the surface. Measurement must occur during shutdown periods where temperature and pressure are at ambient levels. Manned entry is not permissible and all work should be performed remotely. To avoid contamination which could affect the fusion reaction and experimental results, contact with the measurement surface is not permitted. This work assesses non-contact surface measurement technologies, along with standards and guidelines for dimensional surface measurement. Existing measurement test artefacts do not offer the required surface finish and features, so specific test artefacts have been designed and produced. These artefacts are traceable to the national length standard, as traceability is a pre-requisite to evaluate accuracy. Exploratory tests highlighted two technologies for further investigation, laser triangulation and white light fringe projection. Two commercially available, state-ofthe- art examples of each technology have been evaluated using a processing method developed to highlight performance in key areas relevant to EFDA-JET. These areas include quantitative assessments of the effect of surface angle on measurement quality, the effect of depth of field for fringe projection systems and the ability of technologies to <b>record</b> <b>gap</b> and flush from tens of micrometres to millimetres. Tests enable a user to begin to assess the impact the measurement system has on the measurement result, how different technologies and systems used alone or in combination may resolve or compound erroneous results, clarifying or disrupting the meaning of results...|$|E
