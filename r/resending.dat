2500|$|The Court {{believed}} that <b>resending</b> the notice by regular mail {{would have been}} a reasonable step, given that the return of the certified letter meant either that Jones was not home when the postman called, or that he no longer lived at that home. Regular mail would allow the letter to be left without a signature, and it would have made it possible for the letter to be forwarded to him. The State also could have simply posted a notice on {{the front door of the}} home or addressed the mail to [...] "occupant," [...] which are steps that most states require in their tax sale statutes. The Court {{believed that}} in either case, the current occupant of the home would be likely to read the notice and attempt to alert the owner, because a change in ownership would directly affect them. [...] The Court observed that Jones had actually first learned of the tax sale after he was alerted by one of the occupants.|$|E

5000|$|If, {{while you}} are {{transmitting}} data, you receive any data from another station, {{there has been a}} message collision. All transmitting stations will need to try <b>resending</b> [...] "later".|$|E
50|$|Effects of ECN on bulk {{throughput}} {{are less}} clear because modern TCP implementations are fairly good at <b>resending</b> dropped segments {{in a timely}} manner when the sender's window is large.|$|E

50|$|LAPM has an {{optional}} Selective reject (SREJ) functionality which {{allows it to}} <b>resend</b> only the corrupted frames, providing faster recovery from an error.|$|R
50|$|If {{there is}} a problem during the file {{transfer}} and data was corrupted, it is only necessary to resend the few corrupted RAR files instead of <b>resending</b> the entire large file.|$|E
50|$|This feature enables other {{reliability}} {{features in}} the ADN, such as <b>resending</b> a request to a different server if the content returned by the original server {{is found to be}} erroneous.|$|E

30|$|Flooding attack <b>resends</b> {{replicate}} of packets received previously {{from the}} node members. This flooding consumes larger bandwidth and power that might terminate network functionalities.|$|R

50|$|US patent 4,974,952 {{claims a}} method of {{transmitting}} data in a wireless network, specifically fragmenting large messages into smaller messages to avoid <b>resending</b> large amounts of data if network transmission errors occur and,thus, to transfer data more reliably.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "T" [...] (Potentially re-transmitted message) bit - This flag is set after a link {{failover}} procedure, to aid {{the removal}} of duplicate requests.

50|$|Immediate mode is an {{alternative}} approach; the two styles can coexist in the same library and are not necessarily exclusionary in practice. For example, OpenGL has immediate mode functions that can use previously defined server side objects (textures, vertex and index buffers, shaders, etc.) without <b>resending</b> unchanged data.|$|E

5000|$|Greylisting: this forces email to {{be delayed}} for a {{configurable}} period, requiring the remote end to <b>resend</b> mail {{at least once}} in order for it to be delivered.|$|R
5|$|If {{the data}} is {{corrupted}} while transmitted or received, the CRC check fails. When this happens, the receiver does not generate an ACK, which makes the sender <b>resend</b> the packet.|$|R
5000|$|Data {{terminals}} use {{a robust}} error correction protocol. A failure of {{some part of}} the radio backbone may have caused reduced radio signals in field units. The bit errors caused by weaker signals may have caused a corresponding increase in <b>resending</b> of data packets. Resent packets reduce overall data throughput.|$|E
50|$|Retransmission, {{essentially}} {{identical with}} Automatic repeat request (ARQ), is the <b>resending</b> of packets {{which have been}} either damaged or lost. Retransmission {{is one of the}} basic mechanisms used by protocols operating over a packet switched computer network to provide reliable communication (such as that provided by a reliable byte stream, for example TCP).|$|E
5000|$|Retransmission is a {{very simple}} concept. Whenever one party sends {{something}} to the other party, it retains {{a copy of the}} data it sent until the recipient has acknowledged that it received it. In a variety of circumstances the sender [...] automatically retransmits the data using the retained copy. Reasons for <b>resending</b> include: ...|$|E
5000|$|Repeater - A simple {{tool that}} can be used to {{manually}} test an application. It can be used to modify requests to the server, <b>resend</b> them, and observe the results.|$|R
3000|$|... [*]No risk of collision, {{thanks to}} the link scheduling. Because of collisions, in the IEEE 802.11 model, nodes need to <b>resend</b> packets; {{this leads to a}} waste of time which is avoided in our model.|$|R
50|$|A problem {{arises when}} the connection-finalizing ACK packet {{sent by the}} client is lost, and the {{application}} layer protocol requires the server to speak first (SMTP and SSH are two examples). In this case, the client assumes that the connection was established successfully and waits for the server to send its protocol banner, or <b>resend</b> the SYN+ACK packet; however, the server is {{not aware of the}} session and will not <b>resend</b> the SYN+ACK because it discarded the backlog queue entry that would enable it to do so. Eventually, the client will abort the connection due to an application layer timeout, but this may take a relatively long time.|$|R
