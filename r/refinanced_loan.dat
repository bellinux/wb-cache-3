40|$|Housing {{markets and}} {{economic}} growth: {{lessons from the}} US refinancing boom 1 Household spending remained unexpectedly strong in the OECD area during the 2001 downturn. One explanation {{is that it was}} supported by rising real estate values and declining mortgage rates, mainly in the English-speaking countries. 2 Such resilience was particularly remarkable for the United States, where overall household wealth declined because of falling equity prices. The US mortgage market appears to have {{played a significant role in}} this strength. There was a wave of mortgage refinancing in 2001 that was unique in both its nature and magnitude. This special feature discusses the effect of mortgage refinancing during the 2001 slowdown and the role played by changes in the structure of the market for housing finance. 3 The 2001 refinancing boom and household spending An unprecedented number of mortgage loans were refinanced in the United States in 2001. The estimated 11. 2 million refinanced mortgages in 2001 is about twice the figure of 1998, a year that had been perceived as “extraordinary ” at that time. 4 Refinancing of mortgages can add to the effective purchasing power of households in two ways. First, through additional borrowing against an increasing value of property. Such “cash-out ” or “extraction ” of housing equity requires that the new mortgages be for larger dollar amounts than those being refinanced. The difference between the new and <b>refinanced</b> <b>loan</b> principals (less fees) provides immediate cash to the household.

40|$|There {{are growing}} {{concerns}} about the way predatory mortgages erode housing equity. We examine another potential impact: the relationship between abusive loan terms and foreclosure. Do predatory characteristics {{increase the likelihood of}} foreclosure once other risk factors are taken into account? We use a national database of subprime <b>refinance</b> first-lien <b>loans</b> originated in 1999 to analyze this question. Even after we control for other factors, <b>refinance</b> <b>loans</b> with prepayment penalties are 20 percent more likely and those with balloon payments are 50 percent more likely to experience a foreclosure than other loans. These findings suggest that predatory loans have the potential not only to erode household wealth, but also to heighten negative effects on individuals, households, and communities. Excluding losses to borrowers, we estimate that prepayment penalties and balloon payment requirements in 1999 refinance originations increased national foreclosure-related losses to lenders and investors by about $ 465 and $ 127 million, respectively...|$|R
