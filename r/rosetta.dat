5|$|Two other {{inscriptions}} of the Memphis decrees {{have been}} found since {{the discovery of the}} <b>Rosetta</b> Stone: the Nubayrah Stele, and an inscription found at the Temple of Philae (on the Philae obelisk). Unlike the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone, their hieroglyphic inscriptions were relatively intact. The inscriptions on the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone had been deciphered long before the discovery of the other copies of the decree, but subsequent Egyptologists, including Wallis Budge, used these other inscriptions to further refine the actual hieroglyphs that must have been used in the lost portions of the hieroglyphic register on the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone.|$|E

5|$|In {{research}} {{involved with}} the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative, <b>Rosetta</b> {{has been used to}} computationally design novel homing endonuclease proteins, which could eradicate Anopheles gambiae or otherwise render the mosquito unable to transmit malaria. Being able to model and alter protein–DNA interactions specifically, like those of homing endonucleases, gives computational protein design methods like <b>Rosetta</b> an important role in gene therapy (which includes possible cancer treatments).|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1799, with the Napoleonic {{discovery}} of a trilingual (i.e. hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek) stela inscription on the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone, that modern scholars were able to decipher ancient Egyptian literature. The first major effort to translate the hieroglyphs of the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone was made by Jean-François Champollion (1790–1832) in 1822. The earliest translation efforts of Egyptian literature during the 19th century were attempts to confirm Biblical events.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discoveries made during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt was the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone. It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone was discovered by the French, it actually never made it to the Louvre Museum. It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801. It is now on display at the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Rosetta</b> Stone is a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone {{proved to be the}} key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|The stele almost {{certainly}} did not originate {{in the town of}} Rashid (<b>Rosetta)</b> where it was found, but more likely came from a temple site farther inland, possibly the royal town of Sais. The temple from which it originally came was probably closed around AD 392 when Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the closing of all non-Christian temples of worship. The original stele broke at some point, its largest piece becoming what we now know as the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone. Ancient Egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction, and the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone probably was re-used in this manner. Later it was incorporated in the foundations of a fortress constructed by the Mameluke Sultan Qaitbay (c. 1416/18–1496) to defend the Bolbitine branch of the Nile at Rashid. There it lay for at least another three centuries until its rediscovery.|$|E
5|$|During 2005, the British Museum {{presented}} Egypt with a full-sized {{replica of}} the stele. This was initially displayed in the renovated Rashid National Museum, close to {{the site where the}} stone was found. In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone, while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return. In December 2009, he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months for the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013. These requests were refused.|$|E

5|$|From 1807 to 1809, Champollion {{studied in}} Paris, under Silvestre de Sacy, the first Frenchman {{to attempt to}} read the <b>Rosetta</b> stone, and with orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langlès, and with Raphaël de Monachis who was now in Paris. Here he perfected his Arabic and Persian, in {{addition}} to the languages that he had already acquired. He was so immersed in his studies that he took up the habit of dressing in Arab clothing and calling himself Al Seghir, the Arab translation of le jeune. He divided his time between the College of France, the Special School of Oriental Languages, the National Library where his brother was a librarian and the Commission of Egypt, the institution in charge of publishing the findings of the Egyptian expedition. In 1808, he first began studying the <b>Rosetta</b> stone, working from a copy made by the Abbé de Tersan. Working independently he was able to confirm some of the readings of the demotic previously made by Johan David Åkerblad in 1802, finally identifying the Coptic equivalents of fifteen demotic signs present on the <b>Rosetta</b> stone.|$|E
5|$|Just {{minutes after}} the impact, the flyby probe passed by the nucleus at a close {{distance}} of , taking pictures of the crater position, the ejecta plume, and the entire cometary nucleus. The entire event was also photographed by Earth-based telescopes and orbital observatories, including the Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer, and XMM-Newton. The impact was also observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe's <b>Rosetta</b> spacecraft, which was about 80millionkm (50millionmiles) from the comet {{at the time of}} impact. <b>Rosetta</b> determined the composition of the gas and dust cloud that was kicked up by the impact.|$|E

5|$|Two other fragmentary {{copies of}} the same decree were {{discovered}} later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees (the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of PtolemyIV, c. 218 BC). The <b>Rosetta</b> Stone is, therefore, no longer unique, {{but it was the}} essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term <b>Rosetta</b> Stone is now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In May 1798, Bonaparte {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the French Academy of Sciences.

5|$|The <b>Rosetta</b> Stone is a {{fragment}} of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the <b>Rosetta</b> site. Owing to its damaged state, {{none of the three}} texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken on the right side, and 12 of them on the left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Rosetta</b> Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides {{to ensure that the}} cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the <b>Rosetta</b> Stone is now available in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E
