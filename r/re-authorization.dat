5|$|President Roosevelt sought <b>re-authorization</b> of NIRA on February 20, 1935. But the {{backlash}} against the New Deal, coupled with continuing congressional concern over the Act's suspension of antitrust law, left the President's request politically dead. By May 1935, the issue was moot as the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified {{geographically}} or ideologically. However, Whigs {{tended to}} favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, spending on infrastructure, <b>re-authorization</b> of the Second Bank of the United States, moral reform (such as the temperance movement), and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, hard money, and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery. The Whigs tended to control many newspapers, while Democrats were particularly adept at organizing the masses.|$|E
25|$|Sanders was a {{consistent}} {{critic of the}} Patriot Act. As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation. After its 357-to-66 passage in the House, Sanders sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects, and voted against each <b>re-authorization.</b> In June 2005, Sanders proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals' library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority, but was removed on November 4 of that year in House–Senate negotiations and never became law.|$|E
2500|$|The {{enactment}} of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (TVPA) in 2000 by the United States Congress and its subsequent <b>re-authorizations</b> established the Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, which engages with foreign governments to fight human trafficking and publishes a Trafficking in Persons Report annually. The Trafficking in Persons Report evaluates each country's progress in anti-trafficking and places each country onto one of three tiers based on their governments' efforts {{to comply with the}} minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking as prescribed by the TVPA. However, questions have been raised by critical anti-trafficking scholars about the basis of this tier system, its heavy focus on compliance with state department protocols, and its failure to consider [...] "risk" [...] and the likely prevalence of trafficking when rating the efforts of diverse countries.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{infrastructure}} issues intermittently have {{moved toward the}} forefront of the domestic policy agenda. The coming year promises to intensify debate. By September 1991, Congress must re-authorize the federal highway program. Unlike past <b>re-authorizations,</b> this time Congress almost certainly will have to set new priorities and incorporate new principles of cost sharing for highways, since the original mission of the federal highway program will have been accomplished. Sometime in 1991 - 92, workers will complete the last segments of the interstate highway network, bringing to an end an era of road-building that began with Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 and has dominated infrastructure spending since that time. Any consensus that Congress reaches regarding the definition of a new federal role in the highway program, or the appropriate use of price incentives in grant programs, is likely to spill over to the financing of other infrastructure functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{presents}} {{information on the}} characteristics and post-school outcomes of youth {{who participated in the}} Marriott Foundation’s Bridges [...] . from school to work internship program at seven national sites from 1993 to 1997. A comprehensive database of 3, 024 participants was analyzed {{to determine the extent to}} which participant and programmatic variables predict post-school employment status at 6, 12, and 18 month follow-up intervals. Neither gender, race, or primary disability made a significant difference in employment status at six months post-internship. Work behaviors during the internship were highly predictive of post-school employment at 6 and 12 month follow-up intervals. A disparity between disability groups and racial categories was noted in post-school employment rates the further out from school exit. The implications of this program model and these findings for future research and practice are discussed. For at least the last 15 years, when federal policy emphasized the transition from school to work for youth with disabilities, there has been increasing attention focused on post-school outcomes (Will, 1983). Since the enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1990, and reinforced in its subsequent <b>re-authorizations,</b> planning for the transition from school to work and adult life has been mandated for all youth receiving special education services. The impetus for this legislative emphasis and for designing and creating transition programs has been the persistently low employment rates experienced by people with disabilities after they exit secondary schools. An examination of the employment outcomes of people with disabilities indicates that targeted legislative initiatives have yet to achieve their intended impact. In the most recent extensive national longitudinal study of school leavers with disabilities, employment rates for these youth lag significantly behind thei...|$|R

25|$|In 1997, Coburn {{introduced}} a bill called the HIV Prevention Act of 1997, which would have amended the Social Security Act. The bill would have required confidential notification of HIV exposure to the sexual partners of those diagnosed with HIV, along with counseling and testing. The bill was endorsed by the American Medical Association and had over 100 co-sponsors. Coburn also offered an amendment that would have prohibited insurance companies from discriminating against someone who was tested for HIV, regardless of the result and {{introduced a}} bill to expand AIDS coverage for those enrolled in Medicare. He was the primary House sponsor of the 2000 Ryan White CARE Act <b>re-authorization</b> that {{was signed into law}} by President Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} against anti-trafficking raids {{are related}} to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The Trafficking Victims Protection <b>Re-authorization</b> Act of 2005 (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.|$|E
25|$|With {{the defeat}} of Adams, Clay became {{the leader of the}} National Republicans. In 1830, Clay began making {{preparations}} for a presidential campaign in the 1832 election. Early in Jackson's presidency, many doubted that Jackson would seek a second term, and Clay, Vice President John Calhoun, and former Treasury Secretary William Crawford (whose health had somewhat improved since 1824) all began preparations for the upcoming election. In 1831, Jackson {{made it clear that he}} was going to run for re-election, ensuring that support or opposition to his presidency would be a central feature of the upcoming race. While the two previous elections had essentially been intra-party contests among Democratic-Republicans, the election of 1832 saw the development of discrete political parties. Jackson's Democrats rallied around his policies towards the national bank, internal improvements, Indian removal, and nullification, but these policies also earned Jackson various enemies. John C. Calhoun's Nullifier faction opposed Jackson after the president took a strong stance against nullification, but the Nullifiers and National Republicans disagreed about the tariff, limiting the possibility of cooperation. The Anti-Masonic Party, a new political party opposed to Freemasonry, nominated former Attorney William Wirt for president. Clay, himself a Freemason, considered withdrawing from the race in hopes of unifying Jackson's opponents, but he ultimately decided to stay in the race. Inspired by the Anti-Masonic Party's national convention, Clay's followers arranged for a national nominating convention, with the intention of anointing Clay as the National Republican nominee. Facing little opposition at the convention, Clay won the party's presidential nomination, and the convention nominated Pennsylvania Congressman John Sergeant as Clay's running mate. As the election approached, the debate over the <b>re-authorization</b> of the Second Bank of the United States emerged as the most important issue. In his veto of the bank, Jackson effectively made the case that the bank was a tool of the elites, bolstering his popularity with the people.|$|E
500|$|When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{considered}} a 20-year contract extension for the Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station in Plymouth in mid-2012, Keating repeatedly {{took to the}} press.

[...] When the commission voted to renew the license, Keating joined other Massachusetts politicians in deriding the decision as premature. During a labor strike later in the year, Keating joined U.S. Representative Ed Markey in challenging the qualifications of the plant's replacement workers.|$|E
500|$|In March 1986, {{the federal}} {{government}} offered Metro a contract committing $195 million in UMTA funding toward the bus tunnel, requiring that a {{decision on whether to}} move forward with the project be made by December 31. A month later, the King County Council asked Metro to consider delaying construction of the bus tunnel while waiting for assurance on federal funding being able to cover half of the $395 million cost of the project; the council was scheduled to begin awarding contracts for utility relocation along 3rd Avenue and Pine Street in preparation for tunnel construction. On May 15, the Reagan administration signed a contract with Metro to commit $197 million of the $395 million required for the bus tunnel project, assuming <b>re-authorization</b> of a mass transit grant program by Congress, while also extending the deadline for a final decision to September 1987. Hours later, the Metro Council awarded the first construction contract for utility relocation, with construction set to begin in July. The Metro Council accepted the UMTA contract during their June 5 meeting, allowing for bidding on tunnel construction to begin. The tunnel construction contract was awarded to the joint venture of Guy F. Atkinson Construction and Dillingham Construction in late September for $44.16 million, beating seven competing bids with an estimate far lower than the approximately $61 million predicted by Metro engineers. The contract for the dual-mode trolleybuses was awarded by the Metro Council to Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie in October, consisting of an order for 236 buses at a cost of $133 million (equivalent to $million in [...] dollars); it was approved by UMTA in November.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2009, FedEx began a {{campaign}} against United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union, accusing its competitor of receiving a bailout in an advertising campaign called [...] "Brown Bailout". FedEx claimed that signing the Federal Aviation Administration <b>re-authorization</b> bill, which would let some of its workers unionize more easily (and, according to the Memphis-based company, [...] "could expose [...] customers at any time to local work stoppages that interrupted the flow of their time-sensitive, high-value shipments”), was equivalent to giving UPS a [...] "bailout".

2500|$|Polk won {{re-election}} in 1827 {{and continued to}} oppose the Adams administration. In 1828, Jackson ran for President again and Polk was a corresponding advisor on his campaign. Following Jackson's victory in the 1828 election, Polk became one of Jackson's most important and loyal supporters in the House. Polk successfully opposed federally-funded [...] "internal improvements" [...] such as a proposed Buffalo-to-New Orleans road, and he was pleased by Jackson's Maysville Road veto in May 1830. During the Nullification Crisis, Polk sympathized with John C. Calhoun's opposition to tariffs, but Polk condemned secession and supported the Force Bill. In 1833, after being elected to a fifth consecutive term, Polk became {{the chair of the}} House Ways and Means Committee.

2500|$|The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was {{actually}} {{signed into law}} on January 8, 2002 by President George W. Bush. It is commonly abbreviated as NCLB. It was a <b>re-authorization</b> of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and some {{say that it was}} one of the most significant pieces of legislation to affect education in the last 30 years. [...] No Child Left Behind was designed to hold schools accountable for students' proficiency, as determined by testing procedures. NCLB states that the 4 major goals are [...] "stronger accountability for results, increased flexibility and local control, expanded options for parents, and an emphasis on teaching options that have been proven to work.". The goal of NCLB was to have all students testing at proficient levels by the 2012-2013 school year. It also says that 95% of all eligible students must be taking the SOL tests. [...] "Adequate Yearly Progress" [...] (AYP), which is meeting the target proficiency ratings, must be met by the schools annually. [...] If two consecutive years pass where a school does not meet AYP, then they get labeled as [...] "needing improvement", and supplemental services may be offered. [...] No Child Left Behind also regulates employment of teachers, by requiring that all teachers are [...] "highly qualified".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Wyden {{was one of}} 10 {{senators}} to vote against <b>re-authorization</b> of the Patriot Act. In 2011, with the expiration of the Patriot Act approaching and with efforts to reauthorize the Act once more intensifying, Wyden and fellow Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley sharply criticized the rush to pass the bill. Wyden stated on the Senate floor that [...] "The Patriot Act was passed a decade ago {{during a period of}} understandable fear. Now is the time to revisit this, revisit it and ensure that a better job is done of striking that balance between fighting terror and protecting individual liberty." [...] Wyden and Merkley expressed particular concern with a provision of current law allowing law enforcement authorities to collect [...] "a vast array of business records, emails, phone numbers, [...] even DNA from anyone deemed 'relevant' to an investigation." [...] Wyden offered an amendment to reform the [...] "business-records provision" [...] of the Patriot Act, which he views as being used in an abusive and secret way. In a May 2011 speech in the Senate, Wyden sharply criticized the use of Patriot Act, stating: [...] "The fact is that anyone can read the plain text of the Patriot Act, and yet many members of Congress have no idea how the law is being secretly interpreted by the executive branch, because that interpretation is classified. It's almost as if there were two Patriot Acts, and many members of Congress have not read the one that matters. Our constituents, of course, are totally in the dark. Members of the public have no access to the secret legal interpretations, so they have no idea what their government believes the law actually means." [...] In an interview for the documentary [...] Wyden was asked about legal reviews and the scope of potential assassinations (or [...] "targeted killings") of American citizens by their government, and responded that [...] "the American people would be extraordinarily surprised if they could see the difference between what they believe a law says and how it has actually been interpreted in secret," [...] but that he [...] "is not permitted" [...] to disclose the difference publicly.|$|E
