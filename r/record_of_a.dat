5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|Berger {{represented}} the youth teams of Czechoslovakia from the under-15 level, {{working his way}} up through under-16, under-17 and under-18 between 1988 and 1991.

5|$|In 1036, Echmarcach {{replaced}} Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb (died 1042), as King of Dublin. The Annals of Tigernach specifies that Sitriuc fled overseas as Echmarcach took control. An {{alliance with}} Donnchad could explain Echmarcach's success in seizing the kingship from Sitriuc. Although Donnchad and Sitriuc were maternal half-brothersas both descended from Gormlaith ingen Murchada (died 1030)Donnchad's hostility towards Sitriuc {{is demonstrated by}} the <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful attack he led upon the Dubliners in 1026.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{nuclear tests}} in the Pacific were causing {{radioactive}} rainstorms in Japan and one particular incident in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to nuclear fallout, with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawa's next film, <b>Record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Living Being, was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner (Toshiro Mifune) so terrified of {{the prospect of a}} nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family (both legal and extra-marital) to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much more smoothly than the director's previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawa's composer, collaborator and close friend Fumio Hayasaka died (of tuberculosis) at the age of 41. The film's score was finished by Hayasaka's student, Masaru Sato, who would go on to score all of Kurosawa's next eight films. <b>Record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Living Being opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run. Today, it is {{considered by many to be}} among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.|$|E
5|$|Incidents of waterspouts causing {{severe damage}} and {{casualties}} are rare. However, {{there have been}} several notable examples. The Malta tornado in 1555 was the earliest <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deadly waterspout. It struck the Grand Harbour of Valletta, sinking four galleys, numerous boats, and claiming hundreds of lives. The 1851 Sicily Tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western Sicily, ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the {{transept}} chambers {{would have}} been covered with one large (or several smaller) capstones, enclosing the chambers containing human remains.

5|$|Predators on the {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog {{has also been}} recorded as taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked, as reflected in a high breeding success. There is a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corn crake on migration through Gabon being killed by a black sparrowhawk.|$|E

There is one <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris) feeding on an egg. Predation is the commonest cause of nest failure.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> port in Rijeka {{dates back}} to 1281, when the Great Council of the Republic of Venice {{reported}} a conflict of Venetian merchants and ship owners from Zadar and Rab. In 1719, the Port of Rijeka was granted a charter as a free port by Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, and the first road connecting the port to the hinterland, the Caroline road, was completed in 1728. The inland connections were gradually improved by {{the construction of the}} Josephina and Louisiana roads in 1779 and 1810 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} takes a {{wide variety}} of prey, especially spiders, caterpillars, bugs, springtails and flies. Larger prey such as oak bush crickets and tortrix moths may sometimes be taken. Flying insects are taken in hovering flight but not normally pursued; there is a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> goldcrest attacking a large dragonfly in flight, only to be dragged along by the insect before releasing it unharmed. Goldcrests will occasionally feed on the ground among leaf-litter with tits. Non-animal food is rare, although goldcrests have been seen drinking sap from broken birch twigs together with tits and nuthatches.|$|E

5|$|There is a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{windmill}} at Ambrosden in 1300. A {{document of}} 1633 records a Windmill Field and Windmill Way.

By 1623 there had been several small Enclosures of agricultural land in the parish and by 1685 some common lands {{were reported to have}} been enclosed, with further enclosures reported between 1702 and 1785. By 1809 Ambrosden's field system was described as being completely enclosed.|$|E
