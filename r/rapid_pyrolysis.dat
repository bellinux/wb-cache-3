Biofuels are renewable since they are produced from biomass i. e. from organic matter such as plants.

Biomass recycles carbon from the air and spares the use of fossil fuels, reducing the need to pump additional fossil carbon from ground into the atmosphere. Pyrolysis of biomass consists of heating solid biomass in the absence of air to produce solid, liquid and gaseous fuels.

Ultraviolet laser light was used to excite micrometer-Sized thermographic phosphor particles that Were deposited on the investigated materials. and the temperature was obtained from temporally resolved measurements of the laser-induced emission. The wood-based materials show a similar behavior, with small differences being attributed to differences in material properties.

40|$|Coal {{particles}} when {{subjected to}} shock waves can undergo <b>rapid</b> fragmentation, <b>pyrolysis,</b> and combustion, causing enhanced process intensity and efficiency. Particle fragmentation plays {{a crucial role}} in this process. Exposure of coal particles to a shock wave is modelled in the present work as combined convection and radiation at the surface and conduction in the interior. Local temperatures within a coal particle and the corresponding thermal stresses are computed to study particle failure. Particle fracture is modelled by a three-parameter Weibull probability to predict the failure location and time. Simulations indicate that pulverized coal of size up to 250 mu m subjected to a shock wave for varying operational, thermal, and physical parameters can experience initial failure within 150 mu s. Particles of size d ae 50 mu m or higher wave strengths (with Mach numbers M ae 5) mostly trigger exfoliation, while interior fragmentation dominates at smaller sizes (d ae 25 mu m). An initial fracture study reveals that pulverized coal with predominant sizes d ae 100 mu m and the coal rank from lignite to bituminous coal is potentially suitable for detonation combustion in waves at Mach numbers M = 3 - 6. Coal particles under continuous exposure to post-shock conditions undergo recursive exfoliation until the core is 20 - 40 mu m, after which an interior fragmentation phase is seen until the core is about 1 - 3 mu m. Much finer coal particles, of the order of internal fragmenting cores, are hardly fractured due to low thermal stresses caused by rapid uniform heating. The fracture model approach for studying shock-induced combustion is validated by a reasonable match of the computed ignition delay with experiments. The fragmentation history indicates a substantial increase in the particle surface area and temperature under shock exposure, as against conventional combustion, leading to an increased order of the burning rates at the onset of ignition, which can sustain through the entire burning phase...|$|R

The original sawdust {{and the three}} friable solid recovered products from the hydrothermal procedure were characterized in detail. The solid recovered products (SRPs) gave higher C/O and C/H ratios, higher calorific values and reduced moisture contents compared to the original sawdust. The four solid samples were then subjected to <b>rapid</b> high temperature <b>pyrolysis</b> in a fixed-bed reactor to investigate {{the effect of the}} pre-processing routes on the yields and compositions of the pyrolysis products. With increasing pyrolysis temperature, the pre-processed samples produced more CO and H 2, far more char and less tar than the original sawdust. The trends in the composition of gases and the yields of char suggested a combination of Boudouard reaction and CO 2 dry reforming as the predominant reactions during pyrolysis. For all samples, increased temperature led to reduced tar production with an increase in the aromatic oxygenates and aromatic hydrocarbon contents of the tar.

The obtained chars were characterised by ultimate analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), N 2 isothermal adsorption method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that char structure changed upon different pyrolysis temperature. The char yield decreased from 22 % to 18 % and gradual increase in carbon/oxygen ratio was observed with increase in pyrolysis temperature from 550 to 1550 °C. The porosity in chars increased progressively with pyrolysis temperature, and maximum development of pores appeared at 850 °C with surface area 334 m 2 /g. At higher pyrolysis temperature, the chars became more aromatic and ordered, and aliphatic structures decreased significantly. The loss of functional groups at higher temperature such as carbonyl, aliphatic CH was evident by FTIR, XPS and Raman results. The ordered char structure obtained at 1550 °C was used as reductant carbon for iron oxide reduction process, and 90 % reduction was achieved.

40|$|Thermal pre-treatment, or torrefaction, is {{a process}} that can improve the {{handling}} and grinding properties of biomass for combustion and co-firing. This paper compares the combustion properties of raw and torrefied Short Rotation Coppice Willow (SRC), with those of typical bituminous power station coals. The fuels were analysed using a number of standard fuel characterisation tests. Willow SRC was torrefied at 290 Â Â°C for two reaction times (10 Â min (short) and 60 Â min (long)). During torrefaction, longer reaction time promotes loss of nitrogen from the solid product. Chars were produced from the fuels under high heating rates up to 1000 Â Â°C and the char yields and nitrogen partitioning were determined. Results show that the nitrogen partitioning for both raw and torrefied biomass favours release of nitrogen into the volatiles during <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis.</b> In contrast, <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of the coals favours nitrogen retention in the char. The chars were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) combustion tests, which were used to calculate the char reactivities and fate of char nitrogen.

The release of volatile-nitrogen species during char combustion occurs at higher temperatures for the torrefied willow chars compared to the raw willow chars due to their relatively lower reactivities.

40|$|Simultaneous {{combined}} laser-induced fluorescence and laser-induced incandescence (LIF-LII) {{images are}} presented for both a normal and inverse diffusion flame. The excitation wavelength dependence distinguishes the LIF and LII signals in {{images from the}} normal diffusion flame while the temporal decay distinguishes the signals in images of the inverse diffusion flame. Each flame presents a minimum in the combined LIF-LII intensity in a region separating the fuel pyrolysis and soot containing regions. Opacity, geometric in definition, and extent of crystallinity measured through both bright and dark field Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) characterizes the thermophoretically sampled material from within this minimal LIF-LII intensity region. TEM analysis reveals rather different soot processes occurring within the normal and inverse diffusion flame. In the normal diffusion flame, rapid chemical and physical coalescence of PAHs results in initial formation of soot precursor particles that are highly crystalline and evolve toward fully formed soot. In the inverse diffusion flame, <b>rapid</b> coalescence of <b>pyrolysis</b> products occurs, producing tarlike, globular structures equivalent in size to fully formed soot aggregates but with markedly less crystallinity than normal-appearing soot. These different material properties are interpreted as reflecting different relative rates of chemical and physical coalescence of fuel pyrolysis products versus carbonization.

40|$|The use {{of biomass}} derived solid fuels for {{electricity}} generation in combustion, gasification and pyrolysis plant has received increasing levels {{of interest for}} commercial operation in recent years. However, there are limited tools available which allow a prediction {{of the performance of}} these fuels during thermochemical transformation given an understanding of their original chemical structure. As such, this investigation has concentrated on the derivation of a simply utilised classification system able to predict a series of important fuel combustion characteristics given an understanding of both the organic and inorganic chemical and structural composition of any lignocellulosic biomass fuel. A prediction of volatile matter content and char yields during pyrolysis has been made using correlation with aromatic carbon, potassium and calcium contents using both thermogravimetric slow heating and simulated pulverised fuel (PF) entrained flow rapid heating. Alongside this, investigation of the impact of biomass composition, namely aromaticity and alkali/alkaline earth metal concentrations, on char structure and oxidative char reactivity of simulated PF chars has been conducted. Experimental investigation has involved the pre-treatment {{of a wide range of}} commercially available biomass fuels including softwood, hardwood, herbaceous and agricultural waste materials to remove both lignin and ion exchangeable mineral species. In addition to this, torrefaction has been utilised to increase the aromatic character of chosen fuels. This has allowed a quantification of the impact of aromaticity and mineral matter concentration on pyrolysis and char combustion reactions to be derived for a wide range of fuel aromaticity and mineral matter contents. Considerable success has been achieved in the classification of an array of lignocellulosic biomass. Accurate prediction of pyrolysis char and volatile matter yields under both slow and rapid entrained flow drop tube heating conditions have been attained using simple empirical correlations with fuel aromatic carbon and alkali/alkaline earth mineral species concentrations (K+Ca being utilised here). This classification system has relied upon the clear linear correlation observed between aromatic carbon content and char yield in the absence of mineral matter influences (R 2 of 0. 98 and 0. 95 being observed for demineralised biomass under slow and <b>rapid</b> heating <b>pyrolysis</b> respectively). In addition to this, the relative enhancement of char yield due to mineral matter interaction with varying concentration of K and Ca within the fuel has been quantified and is used to calculate total char yields.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{ligno-cellulosic biomass}} is {{considered}} as a renewable carbon resource. It represents a relevant alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Last decades, many scientists and industrials {{have been interested in}} thermochemical conversion of biomass such as gasification. In order to model these reactors, it is important to observe thermochemical phenomena, through dedicated experiments close to the industrial conditions. Accordingly, it is interesting to study the pyrolysis step, notably in conditions representative of fluidized bed, one of the major technologies to gasify biomass. The aim of this communication is to present and compare the new vertical image furnace realized by LRGP and four other fast pyrolysis setups: wire mesh reactor [1], free fall reactor [2], radiant furnace [3] and other image furnaces [4, 5]. The vertical image furnace is based on the former horizontal setup which has been described in details in previous works [4, 6]. The principle is to concentrate the radiation of a 5 kW xenon arc lamp on a biomass sample. The lamp is settled at the first focus of an elliptical mirror. The light beams are concentrated at the second focus where the biomass sample is placed inside a cylindrical reactor. A controlled flow of nitrogen at ambient temperature sweeps this reactor to quench vapours and prevent any gas-phase reactions. The radiant flux applied to the biomass can reach 800 kW. m -². This is the maximum heat flux encountered by a solid fuel injected inside a fluidized bed [6]. During pyrolysis, gases are collected in a sampling bag, liquids are condensed in a cold bath (T = 223 K) and aerosols are filtered. The solid residue is remained in the reactor. As soon as the light beams are switched off, the different products could be recovered, weighted and analysed (CHON, Karl Fischer, GC and HPLC). The main innovations of this setup are the heat flux modulation over time to reproduce fluidized bed conditions, the pyrometric temperature measurement and the vertical orientation of the concentrated beams. This feature allows studying very thin samples of wood pieces which are pyrolysed in chemical regime, but also other kind of biomass (powders and liquids). The comparison of this new setup with other fast pyrolysis lab reactors focuses on technical features: maximum temperature, heating rate, pressure, solid residence time, gas-phase conditions (temperature and residence time), type of biomass sample and its dimensions. This comparison allows evaluating advantages and drawbacks of this vertical image furnace setup. References [1] E.

The particle temperature lagged that of the mesh by 0. 2 seconds at a heating rate of 100 ~C s - 1 and was predicted by modelling. This {{is part of the}} reason the volatile yield (VY) results for 10 s hold-time at b 1. 7 wt% daf of coal, is much more reproducible than 1 s hold-time experiments at b 4. 2 wt% daf of coal. Four coals of the same rank did not behave identically when heated. Three of the coals had a pyrolysis VY the same as the proximate VM when heated to 100 ~C at 1 atm but the fourth, higher inertinite coal had a 1 atm pyrolysis VY 90 % of its proximate VM. All four coals of similar rank had a significant decrease in VY, between 10 and 20 wt% daf of coal, with pressure increasing from 1 to 20 atm. The two lower rank coals showed less decrease in VY with increasing pressure than the higher rank and higher inertinite coals. The lower decrease in VY with increased pressure was mostly attributed to the lower inertinite levels for both the coals of similar rank and VM, and the coals of lower rank. Char characteristics examined focussed on pore Surface Area (SA). For high intensity WMR and Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) pyrolysis experiments CO 2 SA for char from a particular coal was similar but the BET SA different. This was due to the char in the WMR experiments having longer to form larger pores determined by BET N 2 SA. Both the N 2 and CO 2 SA was more than an order of magnitude greater than for low intensity pyrolysis char. This highlights that the WMR can be used to attain char with similar CO 2 SA characteristics as other high intensity pyrolysis experiments and to provide a more meaningful insight into char reactivity than low intensity chars do...|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} {{generation of}} {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) has become a controversial global issue. Pyrolysis and gasification technologies for treating rejects from solid waste disposal sites (SWDSs), for which over 50 % of MSW is attributed to combustible species, have attracted considerable attention. MSW is an alternative energy source that can partly replace fossil resources; there is an increasing awareness that global warming caused by the utilization of fossil resources is occurring. The goal of this thesis is to realize the efficient and rational utilization of MSW and decrease the harmful impact of pollutants, such as dioxin, HCl, and CO 2, on the environment. To achieve this goal, some fundamental studies have been experimentally and numerically conducted to enhance {{the understanding of the}} properties of municipal solid waste thermal conversion. In this thesis, the pyrolysis behaviors of single pelletized recovered fuel were tested. A detailed comparison of the pyrolysis behaviors of typical recovered solid waste and biomass particles was conducted. A swelling phenomenon with a swelling ratio of approximately 1. 6 was observed on the surface of pelletized recovered fuels. Subsequently, a particle model was constructed to describe the thermal conversion process for large recovered fuel particles that are composed of a high fraction of polyethylene (PE) and a comparable low fraction of cardboard. The results indicate that an understanding of the heat transfer mechanism in highly porous and molten structures and the selection of a heat transfer model are crucial for accurate prediction of the conversion process. MSW pyrolysis is a promising method for producing liquid products. With the exception of lignocellulosic materials, such as printing paper and cardboard, PE, polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the six main polymers in domestic waste in Europe. Characterization studies of the products obtained from these individual components, such as PE, PET, PVC, printing paper, and cardboard, have been conducted on a pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) system and a fixed-bed reactor. The possible pathways for the formation of the main primary/secondary products in <b>rapid</b> and conventional <b>pyrolysis</b> were also discussed. MSW steam gasification with CaO was performed in a batch-type fixed-bed gasifier to examine the effect of CaO addition on the heat transfer properties, pollutant removal, and devolatilization and char gasification behaviors in the presence of steam. A new carbon capture and recycle (CCR) system combined with an integrated municipal solid waste system was proposed. The foundation of the system is the development of a novel method to remediate CO 2 using a high-temperature process of reforming CH 4 and/or O 2 and/or H 2 O without catalysts. Thermodynamic and experimental studies were performed. High temperatures significantly promoted the multi-reforming process while preventing the problem of catalyst deactivation. Potential improvements in the efficiency of the novel technology can be achieved by optimizing the reforming reactants. Landfill gas (LFG) and fuel gas from bio-waste treatment contain a considerable fraction of CH 4, which may be a source of CH 4 for this process.    QC 20141028 </p...|$|R
40|$|The use of low rank coals in coal-to-products {{processes}} is {{of particular}} interest for countries with significant domestic resources, including Australia and Germany. Significant advances have been made in coal-derived syngas generation, and high temperature, entrained flow gasification of high rank coals is currently state of the art. Despite their advantageous properties, low rank coals such as Victorian brown coals and Rhenish lignites have yet to be thoroughly investigated for coal-to-products processes via high temperature entrained flow gasification. This is the first publicly available investigation on entrained flow gasification of Victorian brown coals. In this research, a series of interrelated studies of the fuel-dependent processes which occur during entrained flow gasification of these fuels was performed. To facilitate the high temperature part of the investigation, a fit-for-purpose apparatus was designed, implemented and utilised to assess the suitability, behaviour and potential process issues related to the entrained flow gasification of Victorian brown coals and Rhenish lignites. Fundamental kinetics analysis was performed by thermogravimetry of Victorian brown coal chars generated under <b>rapid,</b> entrained flow <b>pyrolysis</b> conditions and indicated that a fuel-specific optimum pyrolysis temperature exists under which the most reactive char for a particular coal is produced. Kinetic data were produced for each coal relating to the rate limiting, heterogeneous char gasification reactions, and the major factors influencing char gasification reactivity with CO₂ and steam were shown to be char morphology and catalytic inorganic constituents, respectively. The release and reaction mechanisms of volatile inorganic species from Victorian and Rhenish coals under CO₂ and steam gasification conditions were investigated by molecular beam mass spectrometry. The mechanisms under different atmospheres were shown to be distinct but related, and separate pyrolysis and gasification phases were observed. The majority of volatilisation occurred during the pyrolysis phase, and was independent of the gasification atmosphere. The NaCl – NaOH and H₂S – COS equilibria showed opposite trends under CO₂ and steam atmospheres. A competitive, cyclic, mechanism involving Na, Ca, S, Si and Al was derived, which results in permanent capture of various species depending on the absence, presence and local partial pressure of the gasification reagent. Low temperature (< 1000 °C) entrained flow gasification of a Victorian brown coal resulted in an increase in syngas yield and decrease in hydrocarbon contaminants with increasing temperature, indicating that tar-free product gas may be expected at higher temperatures. The low temperature assessment confirmed the need for high temperature trials as the char conversion was low (< 55 %) and the syngas contaminant levels high at the maximum possible conditions of 1000 °C and 6 s residence time. A fuel-flexible, high temperature, entrained flow reactor - The HELENA - was therefore designed and commissioned and a comprehensive matrix of pyrolysis and gasification trials conducted using Victorian brown coal and Rhenish lignite. Based on the results of this research, the high temperature, entrained flow gasification of these fuels was determined to be technically feasible, and some important operational considerations were highlighted. High reactivity chars were produced at all temperatures up to 1400 °C, tar generation from all coals was negligible at high temperatures, and char conversions of up to 99 % were achieved. Efficient carbon conversion, high throughput and tar-free syngas may therefore be expected under industrial conditions. The maximum char reactivity for the Victorian coal was observed at 1200 °C, confirming that there exists a fuel-dependant optimum gasification temperature and highlighting the potential for use of Victorian brown coals in moderate temperature, entrained flow apparatus with suitable ash handling systems. The Victorian coal was more reactive than the Rhenish coal under all conditions, possibly due to the low ash melting temperature of the Rhenish coal which can impede gas transfer to reactive carbon sites within the char structure. Slight agglomeration of the Rhenish coal was also observed at low conversion, and significant particle size reduction for both fuels was observed for high conversion experiments. Ammonia was not detected under the conditions tested. However, HCN, H₂S and COS contaminants increased with increasing temperature to ppmv levels at 1400 °C. Through this research, a comprehensive assessment of the high temperature, entrained flow gasification behaviour of Victorian brown coal and Rhenish lignite has been performed using proven experimental techniques under conditions of industrial interest. The generated data provide optimums, limits and trends which are applicable and comparable in their own right, and may also be used as direct inputs to process modelling, design and optimisation of large scale applications. Furthermore, the design and implementation of the HELENA serves both current and future requirements for a dedicated, fuel-flexible, high temperature apparatus to facilitate the continuation of research in this field...|$|R

The precursor was synthesized in a one-step hydrothermal reaction with high yield. After a treatment of the precursor for 10 s at 1000 °C a powdered material was obtained. The X-ray powder pattern exhibits broad reflections indicative for the spinel-type and crystallites in the nanometer range, however, {{the positions of the}} reflections match well with different compounds of the In-S and Cu-In-S systems. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies in connection with EDX analyses evidence the presence of cubic spinel-type Cu-containing In 2 S 3. Two such In 2 S 3 phases coexist with one being Cu-poor and the other having a larger Cu content. The coexistence of these two compounds is reflected by the Raman and UV-vis spectra...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the fire possibility of the cotton packages by the friction heating during the transportation by train. Theoretical simulation was conducted for the friction heating with a typical amplitude and frequency. The results suggest that the hot point induced by the sliding friction between the iron string joints around the package and the iron floor is the heat source for the heat transfer progress. It is also illustrated that the calculated temperatures on the surface of cotton package near the friction point are still a little lower that the <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> temperature of cotton material in a rather worse situation. However, more and more heat may accumulate inside the cotton package if there is a long-time heating for it. The smoldering of the cotton packages may still happen and turn into a cotton fire in train when there are also some other factors at the same time...|$|E
40|$|The sub-Saharan {{region of}} West Africa has {{a lack of}} natural resources, {{especially}} for energy producing. Agroalimentary biomasses like residues from nut processing and vegetable oil producing industries are so far unexploited concerning their potential application as fuel. This study explores the usability of cashew nut shells, jatropha and shea nut presscakes in energetic terms. In contrast to lignocellulosicbiomass these residues are rich in extractives. The feedstocks were characterised in a first step upon their {{physical and chemical properties}} before they were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric system and a tubular reactor under <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> conditions. This approach revealed the influence of extractives on decomposition behaviour and conversion. A detailed study of obtained pyrolysis oils showed that the extractives of cashew nut shells are not entirely cracked while vegetable oils decompose almost entirely. Jatropha oil is more unstable than shea butter. Rubber wood was chosen as a reference feedstock for further comparison with extractive rich biomasses. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-temperature}} pyrolysis behaviour of {{a sample}} of refuse derived fuel (RDF) {{as a model of}} municipal solid waste (MSW) was investigated in a horizontal tubular reactor between 700 and 900 °C, at varying heating rates, and at an extended vapour residence time. Experiments were designed to evaluate the influence of process conditions on gas yields as well as gas and oil compositions. Pyrolysis of RDF at 800 °C and at rapid heating rate resulted in the gas yield with the highest CV of 24. 8 MJ m- 3 while pyrolysis to 900 °C at the rapid heating rate generated the highest gas yield but with a lower CV of 21. 3 MJ m- 3. A comparison of the effect of heating rates on oil products revealed that the oil from slow pyrolysis, contained higher yields of more oxygenates, alkanes (C 8 -C 39) and alkenes (C 8 -C 20), while the oil from <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> contained more aromatics, possibly due to the promotion of Diels-Alder-type reactions...|$|E
40|$|Relative {{toxicity}} {{tests were}} performed on a polyurethane foam containing a trimethylopropane-based polyol and an organophosphate flame retardant. The routine screening procedure involved the exposure of four Swiss albino male mice in a 4. 2 liter hemispherical chamber to the products generated by pyrolyzing a 1. 00 g sample at a heating rate of 40 deg C/min from 200 to 800 C {{in the absence of}} air flow. In addition to the routine screening, experiments were performed with a very rapid rise to 800 C, with nominal 16 and 48 ml/sec air flow and with varying sample rates. No unusual toxicity was observed with either gradual or <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> to 800 C. Convulsions and seizures similar to those previously reported were observed when the materials were essentially flash pyrolyzed at 800 C in the presence of air flow, and the toxicity appeared unusual because of low sample weights required to produce death...|$|E
40|$|Reports {{indicate}} that the worldwide energy consumption and fossil fuel energy production level will have an opposite trend in the coming two decades. The former {{will continue to increase}} while the later will decrease. Therefore, additional sources of energy need to be developed. Field pennycress (Thlaspi, arvense L.) {{has been found to be}} an ideal source of energy because it has prolific yield and has no value as food. We demonstrated conventional and catalytic fast pyrolysis of whole pennycress biomass in a fluidized bed reactor. Characterization studies on field pennycress showed that the biomass had a potential to be converted to energy-rich bio-fuel. Thermogravimetric and kinetic study on field pennycress provided vital information on the degradation behavior of the feedstock. A parametric study was conducted on conventional <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> by using the effects model. The optimum experimental condition that gave maximum liquid yield was found to be at a temperature of 500 °C and a gas flow rate of 24 l/min. The catalysts used for catalytic fast pyrolysis were HZSM- 5, a commercial catalyst, and red mud, an alumina industry waste material. The liquid products obtained from pennycress were found to have better qualities compared to a typical lignocellulosic feedstocks pyrolysis bio-oil. The bio-oil from the red mud catalyzed experiment had almost neutral pH of 6. 5 and the pH in the case of HZSM- 5 was 5. 7. In comparison to bio-oil from conventional <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis,</b> HZSM- 5 and red mud reduced the viscosity of the bio-oil by 3 and 5 times, respectively. However, red mud was only found to be effective in improving the higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-oil from 33. 18 MJ/kg (dry basis) in conventional pyrolysis to 35. 7 MJ/Kg (dry basis). The HHV of HZSM- 5 catalyzed bio-oil was 33. 63 MJ/kg. The composition of non-condensable gases and the chemical makeup of the bio-oil from the two catalysts were different, suggesting that the reaction pathways could be different. HZSM- 5 had higher selectivity for aromatics whereas red mud produced longer aliphatic chains. The bio-oil obtained from red mud catalytic pyrolysis of field pennycress is a promising alternative energy source that could replace petroleum fuels after some upgrading...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} of cobalt nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes by <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of cobalt carbonyl {{in the presence of}} various surfactants. The size and shape of the nanoparticles were influenced by reaction conditions, such as type of the surfactant, molar ratio of surfactant to precursor, reflux temperature and reaction time. The shapes that we have achieved include spherical, nearly spherical, disc and cube. The presence of linear amine yielded nanodiscs and they spontaneously self-assembled into long ribbons. The effect of shape anisotropy on magnetic nanoparticles has been investigated. Spherical nanoparticles of diameter 14. 5 nm show strong ferromagnetic behavior at low temperature and superparamagnetism at room temperature. On the other hand the cubic nanoparticles of 45 nm sides showed negligible coercive field at T = 10 K and ferromagnetism that persisted above T = 300 K. The cobalt nanospheres were oxidized to grow cobalt oxide shell of varying thickness to study exchange bias effect. A pronounced exchange bias and a strong temperature dependant magnetization were observed in oxidized cobalt nanospheres. Comment: 20 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Highly-uniform, {{hollow glass}} spheres (shells), {{which are used}} for {{inertial}} confinement fusion targets, were formed from metal-organic gel powder feedstock in a vertical furnace. As {{a result of the}} <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> caused by the furnace, the gel is transformed to a shell in five distinct stages: (a) surface closure of the porous gel; (b) generation of a closed-cell foam structure in the gel; (c) spheridization of the gel and further expansion of the foam; (d) coalescence of the closed-cell foam to a single-void shell; and (e) fining of the glass shell. The heat transfer from the furnace to the falling gel particle was modeled to determine the effective heating rate of the gel. The model predicts the temperature history for a particle as a function of mass, dimensions, specific heat, and absorptance as well as furnace temperature profile and thermal conductivity of the furnace gas. A model was developed that predicts the gravity-induced degradation of shell concentricity in falling molten shells as a function of shell characteristics and time...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of magnetic nanoparticles with monodispere size distributions, their self assembly into ordered arrays and their magnetic {{behavior as a}} function of structural order (ferrofluids and 2 D assemblies) are presented. Magnetic colloids of monodispersed, passivated, cobalt nanocrystals were produced by the <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of cobalt carbonyl in solution. The size, size distribution (std. dev. < 5 %) and the shape of the nanocrystals were controlled by varying the surfactant, its concentration, the reaction rate and the reaction temperature. The Co particles are defect-free single crystals with a complex cubic structure related to the beta phase of manganese (epsilon-Co). In the 2 D assembly, a collective behavior was observed in the low-field susceptibility measurements where the magnetization of the zero field cooled process increases steadily and the magnetization of the field cooling process is independent the temperature. This was different from the observed behavior in a sample comprised of disordered interacting particles. A strong paramagnetic contribution appears at very low temperatures where the magnetization increases drastically after field cooling the sample. This has been attributed to the Co surfactant-particle interface since no magnetic atomic impurities are present in these samples...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study of}} the performance of the modified plate reactor by <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> experiments with different biomass samples (MDF, bark pine and Avicel cellulose). The use of the plate instead of a grid allowed us to achieve a more homogeneous temperature distribution across the plate and, therefore, biomass sample. The mass yields of the major pyrolysis products CO, CO 2, C 2 H 2, CH 4, C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 6 are measured {{as a function of the}} holding time (from 0 to 50 s) for a number of the final temperatures (from 435 to 1100 C) using the novel approach to quantitative FTIR analysis of biomass pyrolysis spectra. Special care was taken to demonstrate the influence of the secondary tar cracking on the yields of the permanent gases. Yields of major permanent gases plotted versus each other on a logarithmic scale show two distinctive regions reflecting primary and secondary kinetic processes. The experiments show that the modified plate reactor can be used for studying the kinetics of the primary decomposition of the biomass at temperatures = 600 C...|$|E
40|$|Carrier {{multiplication}} is {{an important}} process which can enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic and electronic devices. To investigate this process, diverse experimental setups can be used; the thesis considers some particular artifacts which negatively impact {{the accuracy of the}} measurements, and then proposes solutions to eliminate them. In silicon nanocrystals, the carrier multiplication efficiency can be determined from the excitation energy dependence of the ensemble photoluminescence quantum yield; that is found to be strongly influenced by the fabrication parameters of the samples. In the low energy excitation region, the initial growth of photoluminescence quantum yield is shown to originate from parasitic absorption. In the high energy excitation regime, the competition between space-separated-quantum cutting and carrier trapping at defect levels leads to diversity of photoluminescence quantum yield dependences. As phosphor and boron are co-doped into Si nanocrystals, the optical properties of these nanocrystals are changed due to the existence of impurity levels inside the band gap. In these nanocrystals the mechanism of carrier multiplication is modeled by a combination of impact ionization of impurity levels and as well as band states. In {{the last part of the}} thesis production of intrinsic and N-doped carbon nanodots by <b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of organic precursors is presented and its advantages are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Data on biomass chars {{obtained}} Under conditions {{similar to}} those of practical applications (high heating rate and low residence time) are required for co-combustion and gasification plants. A methodological procedure is developed and applied to two biomass fuels (cacao shells and olive cake) for producing high heating rate chars and characterizing their reactivity and morphology after the first steps of devolatilization. Different chars are produced in a drop tube reactor (<b>rapid</b> <b>pyrolysis)</b> by varying the nominal temperature and the residence time. Oxidation in air is performed to compare typical temperatures and kinetic parameters and evaluate the effect of the operating conditions on char reactivity. A detailed SEM analysis allows to assess the structural variations during the pyrolysis and detect the main phenomena (softening, swelling. melting, formation of bubbles). A quantitative morphological Study is also performed to provide size and shape (important for biomasses) distributions Of the parent fuel and the chars. These data are more significant than average values in advanced model to correctly simulate the fluid dynamic behaviour of each dimensional class of particles in large scale furnaces and gasifiers and predict a more reliable residence time of the particles.
