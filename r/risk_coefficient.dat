40|$|The paper {{examines}} the size effect reversal in the USA {{over the period}} 1970 - 1999, using data for the ten size deciles in the CRSP tapes during this 40 -year period. Betas for small-firm portfolios increase as the return interval analysed increases, and are lower than large-firm portfolios for daily data but higher for monthly and quarterly data. Differences between small- and large-firm portfolio returns are associated with higher betas as return intervals increase, with lower betas for daily data, and higher for quarterly data. Before 1981 when the small-firm effect was published, smaller firms' relative <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients</b> were biased downwards compared to aggregated coefficients, while larger firms' were biased upwards, as expected. But after 1981, a partial reversal occurred with larger firms' relative <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients</b> also biased downwards and by more than the smaller firms. In the post-period, relative risk measures generated higher abnormal returns for large firms than for small firms, effectively a large-firm effect, because large firms' risks were more understated, possibly due to their relatively less frequent trading. However, these abnormal returns were reduced for large (and small) firms when using more appropriate aggregated <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|This paper studies a {{consumer}} search model with prospect utility in a hybrid uncertain environment. Hybrid uncertainty {{consists of the}} uncertainty of the consumer’s valuation for each product and the randomness of stockout. An optimal search strategy is designed for the consumer to search or buy a product. The results show that the presence of prospect utility can result in low purchase threshold. By comparative statics, we demonstrate that the consumer’s purchase threshold for low-value product increases with the <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients</b> for gains and losses, while the purchase threshold for high-value product decreases with the <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients</b> for gains and losses. In addition, we find that the consumer who is more sensitive to the loss will search for much less products. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the relationships between the model without and with prospect utility and further verify the effectiveness and credibility of the conclusions.|$|R

All subjects acted as if they were risk-loving in the English clock auctions and risk-averse in the first-price auctions.

40|$|The nominal <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients</b> for {{radiation}} induced cancer {{are largely}} based on the follow-up of the mortality from solid cancers among the atomic bomb survivors. For {{those who have been}} exposed as adults, the observations are essentially complete, and the risk estimates are, therefore, firmly based on observations. Those who have been exposed as children, have still not reached the age of high cancer incidence. Their observation is, therefore, still incomplete, and the risk estimates are correspondingly uncertain. The modelling of risk has predominantly been based on the postulate, that the relative risk (i. e. the actual cancer rate divided by the age specific normal rate) depend on dose and on age at exposure, and that it does not decline with time since exposure. The high relative risks observed at young ages lead, therefore, with this type of model, to high estimates of life time attributable risk. The ICRP recommendations contain these high risk estimates for young ages at exposure; the high sensitivity of children and juveniles has, indeed, become one of the basic tenets of radiation protection. It is here shown that these conclusions are still hypothetical, because they are merely a matter of the choice of the model. An alternative model assumes a dependence of the excess relative risk on age attained, rather than age at exposure. This model fits the data equally well, and predicts no increased risk for young ages at exposure. A decision between the two models is not possible at present, it will have to await the continued follow- up of those who survived the atomic bombs as children. The ICRP has been criticised for postulating a dose reduction factor (DDREF) in their nominal <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients.</b> If they abandoned this factor, and used the age attained model, rather than their present model, their numerical <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients</b> would remain unchanged. ...|$|R

The article compares the background age and sex distribution, and morbidity and mortality rates of the nominal population, the ICRP used to develop the latest fundamental recommendations, with appropriate indicators for the populations of Russia and Japan as the main source of data for assessment of radiogenic risk {{in the second half of}} the last decade. It is revealed that the functions of survival and age-related morbidity and mortality of the Russian population, especially for males, is significantly different from the composite population, while for the Japanese population, the differences are relatively small. The estimates of radiogenic <b>risk</b> <b>coefficients</b> for cancers of various localization using calculation schemes and risk models of the ICRP Publication 103, but based on background data on incidence and mortality of the Russian population were obtained. Baseline incidence and mortality for the Russian population are worse compared to the composite population.

The results clearly demonstrate the inconsistency of the modern criteria of radiation protection, based almost exclusively on the account of carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation, since it implies that radiation is more harmful for a healthier population. The results also show timeliness of issue of the choice of the calendar period for which the age-dependence of the intensity of cancer incidence and mortality from all causes are taken into account.
