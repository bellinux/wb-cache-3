40|$|Legal {{conflicts}} between multinational firms and host governments are often decided by international arbitration panels - {{as opposed to}} courts in the host country - due to provisions in international investment agreements known as Investor State Dispute Settlements (ISDS). Critics fear that ISDS panels favor multinational firms, and thus make governments reluctant to adopt appropriate policies (<b>regulatory</b> <b>chill).</b> In this paper I develop an economic model to define <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> and to analyze the effects of ISDS. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> occurs when losses from regulatory mismatch are intermediate rather than very high. Moreover, if national courts {{are more likely to}} decide in favor of the host government than an international court, a unilateral shift to ISDS by one country is welfare worsening for the country. The net welfare change is more favorable, and sometimes - but not always - positive, when i) (symmetric) countries switch together to an ISDS based system, and when ii) foreign investment responds elastically to profit conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the issue of <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> and a race to the bottom in {{environmental}} standards and policies. In particular, it explores the possibility that resolution of this problem may lie in a more flexible application of the existing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO) rules. The structure of the discussion is divided into four parts: (i) the standard analysis of trade and environmental policy is laid out; (ii) the theoretical analysis of and empirical evidence for the existence of pollution havens is reviewed; (iii) the main arguments as to why governments may weaken domestic environmental policy with greater trade liberalisation is outlined; and (iv) some recent analysis of border tax adjustments for environmental taxes is laid out, leading to the basic conclusion of the paper: a method for countering any tendency for <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> and a race to the bottom in environmental policies is already embedded in existing GATT/WTO rules.

40|$|With {{internet}} {{regulation and}} censorship on the rise, states increasingly engaging in online surveillance, and state cyber-policing capabilities rapidly evolving globally, concerns about regulatory “chilling effects” online—the idea that laws, regulations, or state surveillance can deter people from exercising their freedoms or engaging in legal {{activities on the}} internet have taken on greater urgency and public importance. But just as notions of “chilling effects” are not new, neither is skepticism about their legal, theoretical, and empirical basis; in fact, the concept remains largely un-interrogated with significant gaps in understanding, {{particularly with respect to}} chilling effects online. This work helps fill this void with a first-of-its-kind online survey that examines multiple dimensions of chilling effects online by comparing and analyzing responses to hypothetical scenarios involving different kinds of regulatory actions—including an anti-cyberbullying law, public/private sector surveillance, and an online regulatory scheme, based on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), enforced through personally received legal threats/notices. The results suggest not only the existence and significance of <b>regulatory</b> <b>chilling</b> effects online across these different scenarios but also evidence a differential impact—with personally received legal notices and government surveillance online consistently having the greatest chilling effect on people’s activities online—and certain online activities like speech, search, and personal sharing also impacted differently. The results also offer, for the first time, insights based on demographics and other similar factors about how certain people and groups may be more affected than others, including findings that younger people and {{women are more likely to}} be chilled; younger people and women are less likely to take steps to resist regulatory actions and defend themselves; and anti-cyberbullying laws may have a salutary impact on women’s willingness to share content online suggesting, contrary to critics, that such laws may lead to more speech and sharing, than less. The findings also offer evidence of secondary chilling effects— where users’ online activities are chilled even when not they, but others in their social networks receive legal processes...|$|R
40|$|Winter canola (Brassica napus cv Crystal) is an oilseed crop that {{requires}} vernalization (chilling treatment) for the induction of stem elongation and flowering. To investigate {{the role of}} gibberellins (GAs) in vernalization-induced events, endogenous GA content and the metabolism of [3 H]GAs were examined in 10 -week vernalized and nonvernalized plants. Shoot tips were harvested 0, 8, and 18 d postvernalization (DPV), and GAs were purified and quantified using 2 H 2 -internal standards and gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring. Concentrations of GA 1, GA 3, GA 8, GA 19, and GA 20 were 3. 1 -, 2. 3 -, 7. 8 -, 12. 0 -, and 24. 5 -fold higher, respectively, in the vernalized plants {{at the end of}} the vernalization treatment (0 DPV) relative to the nonvernalized plants. Thermoregulation apparently occurs prior to GA 19 biosynthesis, since vernalization elevated the concentration of all of the monitored GAs. [3 H]GA 20 or [3 H]GA 1 was applied to the shoot tips of vernalized and nonvernalized plants, and after 24 h, plants were harvested at 6, 12, and 15 DPV. Following high-performance liquid chromatography analyses, vernalized plants showed increased conversion of [3 H]GA 20 to a [3 H]GA 1 -like metabolite and reduced conversion of [3 H]GA 1 or [3 H]GA 20 to polar 3 H-metabolites, putative glucosyl conjugates. These results demonstrate that vernalization influences GA content and GA metabolism, with GAs serving as probable <b>regulatory</b> intermediaries between <b>chilling</b> treatment and subsequent stem growth...|$|R
40|$|This article rejoins one of {{the core}} debates in investor-state arbitration, over {{the extent to which}} arbitrators may refer to sources of {{international}} law beyond the investment treaty that governs the dispute. This issue may appear esoteric, but the political backlash to investment treaty arbitration is largely fueled by uncertainty over the content of the substantive rules that bind states in their relations with foreign investors. Such uncertainty affords arbitrators room to indulge what is alleged to be a pro-investor bias. It may <b>chill</b> <b>regulatory</b> initiatives, even if in the end most states’ actions are vindicated. The problem at the heart of investment arbitration is, therefore, a legal one, so there may be a legal response to the political backlash. This article argues that arbitrators are obligated by the choice of law clauses contained in most investment treaties to consider all potentially relevant sources of international law. Arbitrators are akin to agents of the states that enter into investment treaties, and are bound by choice of law provisions in those treaties. Since most of these refer simply to the text of the treaty and “international law”, tribunals not only may but must refer to international law beyond the treaty. Putting choice of law at the centre of determinations of tribunals’ interpretive authority refocuses arbitrators’ attention on states, which are, after all, the parties to the arbitration agreements that empower investor-state tribunals. It gives proper weight to the economic objectives of international investment law, but also provides arbitrators with an appropriate basis on which to account for the public interest, via international law doctrines of environmental protection, indigenous rights, and the like. Finally, it could help stave off a continued backlash to investor-state arbitration, which would harm the global investment climate and the global rule of law. Not peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|It is an {{important}} prerequisite of sustainable development that countries are able to raise their environmental standards. Environmentalists are concerned, however, that with enhanced international capital mobility the fear of capital loss might induce countries not to raise standards â€” a phenomenon commonly described as "regulatory chill". This article argues that while {{it is difficult to}} prove the validity of this claim, there exists substantial anecdotal evidence that "regulatory chill" is relevant with respect to one issue at least: global warming. Several policy options are evaluated to deal with this problem according to a specified set of criteria.

40|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} of fresh meats can occur during normal slaughter and handling procedures, although this contamination can be minimized by adhering to good hygienic practices during slaughter. Since the bacteria are confined {{almost exclusively to}} the carcass surface {{as compared to the}} deep muscle tissue, procedures which can control the survival and growth of bacteria on tissue surfaces are of interest to both the meat industry and <b>regulatory</b> agencies. <b>Chilling,</b> either by forced air or water spray systems, is used universally to reduce the growth of bacteria on animal carcasses. However, because of the initial heat in an animal carcass, it takes several hours for the temperature to fall low enough to prevent bacterial growth. During the carcass cooling process, the contaminating bacteria can grow, resulting in a bacteria population many times greater than that of the initial contamination. Bacterial growth progresses through several distinct phases. The first phase, called the lag phase, occurs as the bacteria adjust to a new environment. Although the bacteria are metabolically active during this phase, there is no net increase in numbers of bacteria. The second phase of growth is the logarithmic growth phase, where there is a rapid increase in the bacterial population. Eventually, the bacterial population exhausts most of the available nutrients and reaches a stable population, called the stationary phase. When graphed, the growth of bacteria resembles an 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 curve. The time required for a bacterial population to move from a static population (lag phase) to an actively growing state (logarithmic growth) is defined as the lag time. The time required for the bacterial population to double during the logarithmic growth phase {{is referred to as the}} generation time. Bacteria generally have shorter lag and generation times as temperature increases, with the optimum temperature for bacteria of public health significance being very close to that of the body temperature of a cow (approximately 100 - 104 °F). Since temperature has a significant effect on bacterial growth rate, the temperature history of food products has been used to estimate the potential bacterial population on a given product or, in practice, to predict relative rates of microbial growth for different cooling processes, with this process currently being referred to as temperature function integration. Although much of the previous research has focused on spoilage, this area also has applications for foodborne bacteria of public health significance. The temperature function integration technique has been used for assessing beef carcass cooling processes. Researchers have used the temperature history of beef carcasses to predict the growth of E. coli during cooling, based on the growth of the bacterium in liquid cultures. Our intent was to construct a predictive model for the growth of salmonellae using intact beef tissue, with the specific purpose of evaluating beef carcass cooling procedures...|$|R
40|$|The plain {{packaging}} {{of tobacco}} products, {{the disposal of}} hazardous waste and the management of toxic chemicals are all areas of health, safety and environmental (HSE) regulation which have faced legal challenges by private corporations under international investment agreements established {{as a means of}} promoting and protecting inward investment. How these legal challenges are made possible by the international trade and investment regime, and what lasting impact they are having on the regulatory autonomy of governments is the focus of this research. This empirical work seeks to understand the impact of International Investment Agreements (IIAs) on national regulatory autonomy. By probing trends in regulation as well as the level of awareness of IIAs by government regulators, this research aims to identify the likelihood of constrained regulatory decision making or ‘regulatory chill’ amongst those governments who have faced challenges, or the threat of challenges, to their regulatory measures under IIAs. It will also consider whether any chilling effect is more likely in a developing country versus a developed country environment. This research engages with the relevant international relations literature which looks at the impact of the international integration of markets and trends in globalization on the policy autonomy of national governments. More particularly it looks not only at whether globalization leads to the erosion of national policy autonomy, but whether this manifestation of globalization (ie: increasing numbers of negotiated IIAs with private corporate access to binding investor-state arbitration) leads to the erosion of national policy autonomy in the form of forced <b>regulatory</b> restraint or <b>chill.</b> There has been a proliferation of bilateral and regional rules on investment and with worldwide levels of investment expected to reach 1. 8 Trillion by 2015, these agreements are arguably relevant to the overall trade and investment system. In this context, this research will contribute to existing academic literature with respect to the impact of trade and investment agreements on state policymaking autonomy within both developed and developing countries and will make recommendations in the area of trade and investment policy development and negotiations, including the role of investment provisions and investor-state dispute settlement in future bilateral and multilateral trade agreements...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} mega-regional trade Agreements and diet-related health given that such Agreements aim to liberalize “substantially all trade and investment” that could potentially impact on health through tariff elimination and stronger intellectual property commitments in partner countries. We analyse two interlinked policy concerns: first, how tariff reduction/elimination under mega-regional Agreements impact on the production of sugar? Second, how mega-regional Agreements with Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)-style and TRIPS-plus commitments modify intellectual property rules among partner countries and impact on developing countries’ access to life-saving drugs and medicines? Using a dynamic Global Trade Analysis Project model, we find there are significant health consequences of trade commitments undertaken by developing countries with potential detrimental health effect on populations such that first, higher production of sugar alters consumption trends. Second, despite stricter intellectual property rules, which result in net global gains, developing countries suffer from the <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> effect.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{substantial}} increase in investor-state disputes. In many cases matters of public interest, including environmental regulations, are being tried. While it is crucial to assess the outcomes of investor-state disputes that involve matters of public policy, the procedures followed in investment arbitration make this difficult and, in some cases, impossible. This is relevant not only for researchers, but also crucially for regulators. This article focuses on how the lack of transparency in arbitration, and the lack of consistency of tribunal decisions, creates uncertainty for regulators. This uncertainty, when combined with the financial risk involved in proceeding to arbitration, may create situations in which the threat of an investment dispute is sufficient to convince a government to reverse, amend or fail to enforce an environmental regulation - a phenomenon referred to as <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill.</b> These issues are explored in an Indonesian case involving a dispute over mining contracts in protected forests. © 2006 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|E
40|$|Recent European Union {{sustainability}} {{criteria for}} biofuels {{provide an opportunity}} to understand more precisely the relationship between national sustainable development policies and World Trade Organization (WTO) law. A desire to avoid WTO conflict was one reason for the omission of stronger criteria addressing negative social and environmental impacts of increased biofuels production. Thus, despite declarations of sustainable development’s central importance in WTO legal texts and statements by the Secretariat, national sustainability regulations risked trade law conflict. This article documents potential reasons for a WTO <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> effect on the sustainability criteria. It then outlines challenges that the regulatory concept poses to trade law, which result primarily from its breadth and complexity, as well as the lack of targeted international standards, and its emphasis on production processes which intrude heavily, in an extraterritorial sense, on importers. It is important to identify these limitations to the mutual supportiveness between trade liberalization and national policies to achieve sustainability goals. However, despite these limitations, the case study also suggests that, with regard to sustainability criteria, sustainable development’s soft power as a WTO legal principle is an important source of influence...|$|E
40|$|The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is {{the largest}} {{proposed}} trade agreement in history, affecting a total of 800 million people. Included in this trade agreement are provisions that challenge traditional ideas of state sovereignty. Most important of these are Investor-State Dispute Settlement provisions. These provisions allow corporations to circumvent domestic court systems and sue national governments before a tribunal that is insulated from judicial review. While a nation might want to exercise its sovereign right to regulate on the behalf of the safety and welfare of its populace, the potential effect on the assets of its foreign investors {{can lead to a}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> affect causing governments to cancel its adoption of legitimate regulatory changes because of the threat of arbitration. To further investigate the effect of these provisions on state sovereignty, this thesis will employ the neo-Gramscian theory of international relations. Antonio Gramsci and the theorists of neo-Gramscianism break with the notions of state centrism and focus instead on the social classes that exercise global governance. By taking ISDS out of the law perspective and into an international relations perspective, we, with the help of Gramsci, can begin to identify the possible motives of such provisions and, more importantly, attempt to uncover the true origins of power and hegemony...|$|E
40|$|Against that backdrop, {{this article}} has two main objectives. First, it {{provides}} a conceptual framework for examining the relationship between environmental regulation and international competitiveness. Specifically, it categorizes the various competitiveness concerns arising from the intersection of trade liberalization and environmental protection, {{as well as the}} various responses that may be used to address such concerns. In doing so, this article aims to develop a framework for understanding issues of competitiveness in their various forms with greater attention to the nuances and subtleties of this concept than is found in most of the existing trade literature. Second, this article reviews why competitiveness matters. It argues, in particular, that, regardless of whether fears of industrial flight and other traditional focuses of race to- the-bottom theories are legitimate, competitiveness concerns affect the environmental policy-making process. While actual races-to-the-bottom in which environmental standards are lowered appear to be rare, considerable evidence suggests that government officials, facing the prospect of reduced sales, lost jobs and diminished investments in domestic industries caused by competition with foreign companies whose costs are lower due to more lax environmental requirements, often choose not to elevate environmental standards and sometimes even to relax enforcement of current standards. This competitiveness-driven 2 ̆ 2 political drag 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> 2 ̆ 2 creates a strategic dynamic that can make it difficult, and in some circumstances impossible, for governments to move towards optimum levels of environmental protection...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} trade in services is regulated at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and through {{an increasing number of}} rsquo; trade agreements. At both the multilateral and preferential level, the European Union (EU) has committed to obligations that liberalise trade in services. These obligations effectively limit the competent regulator's (the EU, an EU Member State, a sub-central government) regulatory autonomy. There is an inherent tension between the liberalisation of trade in services and domestic regulatory autonomy. In other words, facilitating trade requires, in some way or another, giving up policy space. The complex web of obligations arising out of the fragmented international regulation of trade in services has led to a substantial amount of uncertainty regarding the exact scope of these obligations, their meaning, and the exceptions thereto. Subsequently, {{it is not clear what}} their impact on domestic regulatory autonomy is. In practice, this issue translates into the question of whether a regulator can still issue certain measures in policy fields as diverse as education, public health, social security or culture. Indeed, such measures should take into account the constraints resulting from the international regulation of trade in services. The legal uncertainty surrounding these constraints thus weakens the ability of national policymakers to address certain policy goals. This doctoral research, first, analyses the relevant provisions of the WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) as they apply to the EU. The complicated structure and vague nature of some provisions in this agreement have left considerable room for debate regarding its impact on regulatory autonomy. Building upon that analysis, second, the impact on regulatory autonomy resulting from obligations arising out of the services chapters of three selected trade agreements concluded by the EU are addressed. Again, the focus is constraints on regulatory autonomy in the EU. The case studies are the EU-Colombia and Peru, the EU-Singapore and the EU-Georgia trade agreements. In order to interpret these agreements, it is argued that a presumption of WTO consistent interpretation should be applied. The interpretation of GATS and the services chapters of the three EU trade agreement case studies highlights that, overall, the obligations in these agreements are balanced with regulatory autonomy concerns. This is the case because of several reasons, such as extensive use of the agreement's flexibilities, carve-outs from the scope of the chapters, acceptable interpretations of the provisions in the (limited) case law at hand, and treaty language that allows for such interpretations in the future. Nonetheless, there are some concerns, which mainly have to do with the complexity of the rules, in which scrutiny of the constraints resulting from such provisions is a daunting task. A <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> and under-usage of the agreements are the likely consequences of these findings. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 This study investigates Indonesia’s {{changing}} attitude from embracing to repudiating {{foreign direct}} investments. Opened its door for {{foreign investment in}} the late of 1960 s and enjoyed significant economic growth as the result, the country suddenly changed its foreign investment policy in 2012 to be more protectionist towards domestic investors and skeptical towards foreign investors. The essential issues to be discussed in this research are: what motivates Indonesia {{to move away from}} global investment regime; what actions the country has taken as manifestation of resentment against the regime; and who are the actors behind such a backlash. This is a qualitative study which aims at gaining a deep understanding of a legal development of Indonesia’s foreign investment. It aims to provide explanation of the current phenomenon taking place in the country. Data were collected through interviews and documents. This research reveals that liberalization of foreign investment law has become the major cause of resentment towards the foreign investment. Liberalization which requires privatization and openness toward foreign capital has failed to deliver welfare to the Indonesian people. Instead, foreign investors have pushed local business players, especially small and medium enterprises, out of the market. This is not only disadvantageous for local industries but also in contrary to the economic principle stipulated in the Indonesian Constitution. Liberalization also carries the risk of <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill</b> due to the government’s fear of being sued before an international arbitration if such regulations inflict financial loss for investors. A key finding is the adverse impacts of ‘openness’ toward foreign investors were responded by civil society organizations and several individuals to file judicial review towards various Laws which give opportunity to foreign investors operating in strategic sectors such as electricity, oil and gas, and water resources. As a result, the Constitutional Court annulled the laws or provisions which give legal basis for foreign investor participation in the country. In addition, various measures are taken by the government to reduce the effects of liberalization including the enactment of protectionist policies, bilateral investment treaty moratorium, and drafting a model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT). Therefore, privileges and protections given to foreign investors are significantly reduced. From the examination of judicial review cases and interview, this research discovers that various civil society organizations and some prominent figures actively engage on the backlash by seeking judicial review on laws that give way for foreign investors’ operation in the country. By rendering decisions in favor of the plaintiffs and annulling the laws, the Constitutional Court itself can also be classified as an actor. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, the Indonesian government also plays a crucial role in the shift through more subtle approaches. Its protectionist policy, BIT moratorium and the model BIT are powerful tools to cut down the privileges and protection enjoyed by foreign investors since the late of 1960 s. A combination of factors between people’s power and government legal actions emerge as the most important driver for the current backlash against foreign investment in Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|This article {{covers a}} timely {{set of issues}} {{concerning}} the relationship between intellectual property rights (“IPRs”) associated with foreign investments, state-authorized compulsory licenses, trade law (in particular, the TRIPS Agreement), and claims for indirect expropriation that might be brought in investment arbitration. I focus, as a case study, on compulsory licenses and claims of indirect expropriation. Compulsory licenses bear an inherently contentious character. This government authorized license often presents a clash between significant opposing interests – on one side, the legitimate expectations of patent based foreign investors founded on the international investment agreement (“IIA”) and a patent regime that, for well established reasons, provides relatively strong protection during the patent’s term, {{and on the other}} side, the strength of the public interest in exceptional cases, such as a public health crisis. The circumstances that may be commonly associated with the issuance of a compulsory license, in which an investor’s existing IP rights and investment position are severely impacted, provide the seeds for a dispute and strong incentive for the investor to seek recourse through available means of dispute settlement. In this context, the compulsory license in relation to IP based investments and claims of indirect expropriation illustrates two levels of complexity for international investment law. First, the tension between investor’s rights and government action in the area of compulsory licensing is but a specialized example of a broader recurrent public policy issue in international investment law. The broader question concerns the appropriate balance between the rights and responsibilities of investors and those of governments. The investor is entitled to have its legitimate expectations with regard to the operation and return on its investment respected by the host state. However, the host state must be able to pursue legitimate regulatory goals without risk of 2 ̆ 7 <b>regulatory</b> <b>chill.</b> 2 ̆ 7 The investment dispute context for a compulsory license brings these countervailing interests to a head, as these issues coalesce around questions of how much leeway governments should have to take actions that may interfere with IPRs and IP-based investments, whether these actions contravene the standards of protection established for foreign investors under national patent laws and IIAs, and whether such measures are otherwise defensible as consistent with non-investment law treaty provisions, such as Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement. The reference to the TRIPS Agreement raises the second point of complexity: the compulsory license provides a case in point to show the interplay between two different treaty-based regimes. A compulsory license-based claim for indirect expropriation against a host state under an IIA may implicate several strands of public law that can be complimentary or competing, integrated or overlapping. International investment law as channeled through the IIA confronts intellectual property law as established through national law or the TRIPS Agreement. The compulsory license brings this confluence of competing legal regimes into stark focus. If a foreign investor believes that a host state has improperly authorized a compulsory license with respect to its patent-based investment, it may face not only a choice of forum in which to vindicate its rights, but also choice of law issues in making out a claim of indirect expropriation. Because investment agreements such as bilateral investment agreements (BIT) stand side-by-side with the WTO multilateral trading system, these respective regimes may afford different levels of protection and different remedies to the foreign investor in a dispute where the investor’s home State and the host State are both members of the WTO, or where the IIA itself makes reference to the TRIPS Agreement. While there has been ample scholarly examination in the areas of investment arbitration and international trade law and related public health issues, much less has been written about intellectual property issues arising under BITs, and even less so in relation to intellectual property (including compulsory licenses) in the context of investor-State arbitration. For this reason I believe my article offers an interesting case study, and makes an important scholarly contribution that would be of interest both to academics and to the broader international dispute settlement community...|$|E
