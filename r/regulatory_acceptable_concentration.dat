30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the risk for}} aquatic organisms due to pesticide exposure, the MECs of surface waters were compared to <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration</b> (RAC) which were derived from the registration data for plant protection products (risk quotient RQ = MEC/RAC) (Table  1). If the RAC values are not exceeded in surface water, it can be assumed that no unacceptable effect on aquatic species will occur. If the RAC value {{is lower than the}} MEC, a risk for aquatic organisms cannot be excluded. Since often measurements were taken in weekly intervals, measurements obtained in a month were grouped together as an event of exceedance to enhance comparability of the data for each pesticide. A comparison of the RAC values with MECs is a potential verification of the correct application of plant protection products or the need for further mitigation (Table  1).|$|E

40|$|Assessment {{of risks}} to aquatic organisms is {{important}} in the registration procedures for pesticides in industrialised countries. This risk assessment consists of two parts: (i) assessment of effects to these organisms derived from ecotoxicological experiments (=effect assessment), and (ii) assessment of concentration levels in relevant environmental compartments resulting from pesticide application (=exposure assessment). Current procedures lack a clear conceptual basis for the interface between the effect and exposure assessments which may lead to a low overall scientific quality of the risk assessment. This interface is defined here as the type of concentration that gives the best correlation to ecotoxicological effects and is called the ecotoxicologically relevant concentration (ERC). Definition of this ERC allows the design of tiered effect and exposure assessments that can interact flexibly and efficiently. There are two distinctly different exposure estimates required for pesticide risk assessment: that related to exposure in ecotoxicological experiments and that related to exposure in the field. The same type of ERC should be used consistently for both types of exposure estimates. Decisions are made by comparing a <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration</b> (=RAC) level or curve (i. e., endpoint of the effect assessment) with predicted environmental concentration (=PEC) levels or curves (endpoint of the exposure assessment). For decision making based on ecotoxicological experiments with time-variable concentrations a tiered approach is proposed that compares (i) in a first step single RAC and PEC levels based on conservative assumptions, (ii) in a second step graphically RAC and PEC curves (describing the time courses of the RAC and PEC), and (iii) in a third step time-weighted average RAC and PEC levels...|$|E
40|$|Information from {{effects of}} {{pesticides}} in sediments at an ecosystem level, to validate current and proposed risk assessment procedures, is scarce. A sediment-spiked outdoor freshwater microcosm experiment {{was conducted with}} fludioxonil (lipophilic, non-systemic fungicide) to study exposure dynamics and treatment-related responses of benthic and pelagic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton. Besides blank control and solvent control systems the experiment had six different treatment levels (1. 7 – 614 mg a. s. /kg dry sediment) based around the reported 28 -d No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) for Chironomus riparius (40 mg a. s. /kg dry sediment). Twelve systems were available per treatment of which four were sacrificed on each of days 28, 56 and 84 after microcosm construction. Fludioxonil persisted in the sediment and mean measured concentrations were 53 – 82 % of the initial concentration after 84 days. The dissipation rate increased with the treatment level. Also exposure concentrations in overlying water were long-term, with highest concentrations 28 days after initiation of the experiment. Sediment-dwelling Oligochaeta and pelagic Rotifera and Cladocera showed the most pronounced treatment-related declines. The most sensitive sediment-dwelling oligochaete was Dero digitata (population NOEC 14. 2 mg a. s. /kg dry sediment). The same NOEC was calculated for the sediment-dwelling macroinvertebrate community. The most sensitive zooplankton species was the cladoceran Diaphanosoma brachyurum (NOEC of 1. 6 μg a. s. /L in overlying water corresponding to 5. 0 mg a. s. /kg dry sediment). At the two highest treatments several rotifer taxa showed a pronounced decrease, while the zooplankton community-level NOEC was 5. 6 μg a. s. /L (corresponding to 14. 2 mg a. s. /kg dry sediment). Zooplankton taxa calanoid Copepoda and Daphnia gr. longispina showed a pronounced treatment-related increase (indirect effects). Consequently, an assessment factor of 10 to the chronic laboratory NOECs of Chironomus riparius (sediment) and Daphnia magna (water) results in a <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration</b> that is sufficiently protective for both the sediment-dwelling and pelagic organisms in the microcosms. </p...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{pesticides}} for crop protection may result {{in the presence of}} toxic residues in environmental matrices. In the aquatic environment, pesticides might freely dissolve in the water or bind to suspended matter and to the sediments, and might be transferred to the organisms' tissues during bioaccumulation processes, resulting in adverse consequences to non-target species. One such group of synthetic organic pesticides widely used worldwide to combat pathogenic fungi affecting plants is the strobilurin chemical group. Whereas they are designed to control fungal pathogens, their general modes of action are not specific to fungi. Consequently, they can be potentially toxic {{to a wide range of}} non-target organisms. The present work had the intent to conduct an extensive literature review to find relevant research on the occurrence, fate and effects of azoxystrobin, the first patent of the strobilurin compounds, in aquatic ecosystems in order to identify strengths and gaps in the scientific database. Analytical procedures and existing legislation and regulations were also assessed. Data gathered in the present review revealed that analytical reference standards for the most relevant environmental metabolites of azoxystrobin are needed. Validated confirmatory methods for complex matrices, like sediment and aquatic organisms' tissues, are very limited. Important knowledge of base-line values of azoxystrobin and its metabolites in natural tropical and estuarine/marine ecosystems is lacking. Moreover, some environmental concentrations of azoxystrobin found in the present review are above the <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Acceptable</b> <b>Concentration</b> (RAC) in what concerns risk to aquatic invertebrates and the No Observed Ecologically Adverse Effect Concentration (NOEAEC) reported for freshwater communities. The present review also showed that there are very few data on azoxystrobin toxicity to different aquatic organisms, especially in what concerns estuarine/marine organisms. Besides, toxicity studies mostly address azoxystrobin and usually neglect the more relevant environmental metabolites. Further work is also required in what concerns effects of exposure to multi-stressors, e. g. pesticide mixtures. Even though Log Kow for azoxystrobin and R 234886, the main metabolite of azoxystrobin in water, are below 3, the bio-concentration factor and the bioaccumulation potential for azoxystrobin are absent in the literature. Moreover, no single study on bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes was found in the present review...|$|E
30|$|Exceedances of <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> in {{surface waters}} are undesirable. RAC values {{are derived from}} the risk {{assessment}} {{as part of the}} authorization of pesticides and aim to be protective for edge of the field surface water bodies. Analysis of the Swiss monitoring data shows that exceedances of the RAC value were determined when MECmax was used for comparison. Affected were almost exclusively the small and medium sections of running surface waters (FLOZ 1 – 3). Pesticides with exceedances of RAC value are carefully analyzed to determine possible causes and to define effective risk mitigation measures. Depending on the degree and distribution of the exceedances throughout the country, further risk mitigation might be needed on a local, regional, or national scale.|$|R

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of the pyrethroid insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin to freshwater invertebrates {{has been investigated}} using data from short-term laboratory toxicity tests and in situ bioassays and population-level effects in field microcosms. In laboratory tests, patterns of toxicity were consistent with previous data on pyrethroids. The midge Chaoborus obscuripes was most sensitive (48 - and 96 -h EC 50 = 2. 8 ng/L). Other insect larvae (Hemiptera, Ephemeroptera) and macrocrustacea (Amphipoda, Isopoda) were also relatively sensitive, with 48 - and 96 -h EC 50 values between 10 and 100 ng/L. Generally, microcrustacea (Cladocera, Copepoda) and larvae of certain insect groups (Odonata and Chironomidae) were less sensitive, with 48 -h EC 50 values higher than 100 ng/L. Mollusca and Plathelminthes were insensitive and were unaffected at concentrations at and above the water solubility (5 µg/L). Generally, the EC 50 values based on initial population responses in field enclosures were similar to values derived from laboratory tests with the same taxa. Also, the corresponding fifth and tenth percentile hazard concentrations (HC 5 and HC 10) were similar (laboratory HC 5 = 2. 7 ng/L and field HC 5 = 4. 1 ng/L; laboratory and field HC 10 = 5. 1 ng/L), at least when {{based on the same}} sensitive taxonomic groups (insects and crustaceans) and when a similar concentration range was taken into account. In the three field enclosure experiments and at a treatment level of 10 ng/L, consistent effects were observed for only one population (Chaoborus obscuripes), with recovery taking place within 3 to 6 weeks. The laboratory HC 5 (2. 7 ng/L) and HC 10 (5. 1 ng/L) based on acute EC 50 values of all aquatic arthropod taxa were both lower than this 10 ng/L, a concentration that might represent the <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration.</b> The HC 5 and HC 10 values in this study in The Netherlands (based on static laboratory tests with freshwater arthropods) were very similar to those derived from a previous study in the United Kingdom (1. 4 and 3. 3 ng/L). This suggests that for pesticides like lambda-cyhalothrin, HC 5 values based on static laboratory tests may provide a conservative estimate of the potential for community-level effects under field conditions. While these HC 5 values are conservative for initial effects, they do not provide information on recovery potential, which may be important for regulatory decision-making...|$|E
40|$|In the European {{registration}} procedure for pesticides, microcosm and mesocosm studies {{are the highest}} aquatic experimental tier to assess their environmental effects. Evaluations of microcosm/mesocosm studies rely heavily on no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) calculated for different population-level endpoints. Ideally, a power analysis should be reported for the concentration–response relationships underlying these NOECs, {{as well as for}} measurement endpoints for which significant effects cannot be demonstrated. An indication of this statistical power can be provided a posteriori by calculated minimum detectable differences (MDDs). The MDD defines the difference between the means of a treatment and the control that must exist to detect a statistically significant effect. The aim {{of this paper is to}} expand on the Aquatic Guidance Document recently published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and to propose a procedure to report and evaluate NOECs and related MDDs in a harmonised way. In addition, decision schemes are provided on how MDDs can be used to assess the reliability of microcosm/mesocosm studies and for the derivation of effect classes used to derive <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Furthermore, examples are presented to show how MDDs can be reduced by optimising experimental design and sampling techniques...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} ecological {{effects of a}} range of chronic exposure concentrations of the fungicide azoxystrobin in freshwater experimental systems (1270 L outdoor microcosms). Intended and environmentally relevant test concentrations of azoxystrobin were 0, 0. 33, 1, 3. 3, 10, 33 µg ai/L, kept at constant values. Responses of freshwater populations and community parameters were studied. Over the 42 -day experimental period, the time-weighted average concentrations of azoxystrobin ranged from 93. 5 to 99. 3 % of intended values. Zooplankton, especially copepods and Daphnia group longispina, were the most sensitive groups. At the population level, a consistent NOEC of 1 µg ai/L was calculated for Copepoda. The NOEC at the zooplankton community level was 10 µg azoxystrobin/L. The principle of the EU pesticide directive is that lower-tier <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Acceptable</b> <b>Concentrations</b> (RACs) are protective of higher-tier RACs. This was tested for chronic risks from azoxystrobin. With the exception of the microcosm community chronic RAC (highest tier), all other chronic RAC values were similar to each other (0. 5 – 1 µg ai/L). The new and stricter first-tier species requirements of the EU pesticide regulation (1107 / 2009 /EC) are not protective for the most sensitive populations in the microcosm study, when based on the higher-tier population RAC. In comparison, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) generates Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) which are 5 - 10 times lower than the derived chronic RACs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate whether the acute tier- 1 and tier- 2 methods as proposed by the Aquatic Guidance Document recently published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are appropriate for deriving <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> (RACs) for insecticides. The tier- 1 and tier- 2 RACs were compared with RACs based on threshold concentrations from micro/mesocosm studies (ETO-RAC). A lower-tier RAC was considered as sufficiently protective, if less than the corresponding ETO-RAC. RESULTS ETO-RACs were calculated for repeated (n =¿ 13) and/or single pulsed applications (n =¿ 17) of 26 insecticides to micro/mesocosms, giving a maximum of 30 insecticide¿×¿application combinations (i. e. cases) for comparison. Acute tier- 1 RACs (for 24 insecticides) were lower than the corresponding ETO-RACs in 27 out of 29 cases, while tier- 2 Geom-RACs (for 23 insecticides) were lower in 24 out of 26 cases. The tier- 2 SSD-RAC (for 21 insecticides) using HC 5 / 3 was lower than the ETO-RAC in 23 out of 27 cases, whereas the tier- 2 SSD-RAC using HC 5 / 6 was protective in 25 out of 27 cases. CONCLUSION The tier- 1 and tier- 2 approaches proposed by EFSA for acute effect assessment are sufficiently protective for the majority of insecticides evaluated. Further evaluation may be needed for insecticides with more novel chemistries (neonicotinoids, biopesticides) and compounds that show delayed effects (insect growth regulators) ...|$|R
40|$|Aquatic {{ecological}} {{risk assessment}} of fungicides in Europe under Regulation 1107 / 2009 /EC does not currently assess risk to non-target bacteria and fungi. Rather, <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> based on ecotoxicological {{data obtained from}} studies with fish, invertebrates and primary producers (including algae) {{are assumed to be}} protective to all other aquatic organisms. Here we explore the validity of this assumption by investigating the effects of a fungicide (tebuconazole) applied at its "non-microbial" HC 5 concentration (the concentration that is hazardous to 5 % of the tested taxa) and derived from acute single species toxicity tests on fish, invertebrates and primary producers (including algae) on the community structure and functioning of heterotrophic microbes (bacteria and aquatic fungi) in a semi-field study, using novel molecular techniques. In our study, a treatment-related effect of tebuconazole (238 µg/L) on either fungal biomass associated with leaf material or leaf decomposition or the composition of the fungal community associated with sediment could not be demonstrated. Moreover, treatment-related effects on bacterial communities associated with sediment and leaf material were not detected. However, tebuconazole exposure did significantly reduce conidia production and altered fungal community composition associated with leaf material. An effect on a higher trophic level was observed when Gammarus pulex were fed tebuconazole-exposed leaves, which caused a significant decrease in their feeding rate. Therefore, tebuconazole may affect aquatic fungi and fungally mediated processes even when applied at its "non-microbial" HC 5 concentration...|$|R
40|$|Environmental risk {{assessment}} of chemical mixtures is challenging {{due to the}} multitude of possible combinations that may occur. Aquatic risk from chemical mixtures in an agricultural landscape was evaluated prospectively in two exposure scenario case studies: at field scale for a program of 13 plant protection products applied annually for 20 years, and at a watershed scale for a mixed land use scenario over 30 years with 12 plant protection products and two veterinary pharmaceuticals used for beef cattle. Risk quotients were calculated from regulatory exposure models with typical real-world use patterns and <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> for individual chemicals. Results could differentiate situations when there was concern associated with single chemicals from those when concern {{was associated with a}} mixture (based on concentration addition) with no single chemical triggering concern. Potential mixture risk was identified on 0. 02 % to 7. 07 % of the total days modeled, depending on the scenario, the taxa and whether considering acute or chronic risk. Taxa at risk were influenced by receiving water body characteristics along with chemical use profiles and associated properties. This study demonstrates that a scenario-based approach can be used to determine whether mixtures of chemicals pose risks over and above any identified using existing approaches for single chemicals, how often and to what magnitude, and ultimately which mixtures (and dominant chemicals) cause greatest concern.

40|$|The {{prospective}} aquatic {{environmental risk}} assessment (ERA) of pesticides is generally based on the comparison of predicted environmental concentrations in edge-of-field surface waters with <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> derived from laboratory and/or model ecosystem experiments with aquatic organisms. New improvements in mechanistic effect modeling have allowed a better characterization of the ecological risks of pesticides through the incorporation of biological trait information and landscape parameters to assess individual, population and/or community-level effects and recovery. Similarly to exposure models, ecological models require scenarios that describe the environmental {{context in which they}} are applied. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework for the development of ecological scenarios that, when merged with exposure scenarios, will constitute environmental scenarios for prospective aquatic ERA. These “unified” environmental scenarios are defined as the combination of the biotic and abiotic parameters that are required to characterize exposure, (direct and indirect) effects, and recovery of aquatic nontarget species under realistic worst-case conditions. Ideally, environmental scenarios aim to avoid a potential mismatch between the parameter values and the spatial–temporal scales currently used in aquatic exposure and effect modeling. This requires {{a deeper understanding of the}} ecological entities we intend to protect, which can be preliminarily addressed by the formulation of ecological scenarios. In this article we present a methodological approach for the development of ecological scenarios and illustrate this approach by a case-study for Dutch agricultural ditches and the example focal species Sialis lutaria. Finally, we discuss the applicability of ecological scenarios in ERA and propose research needs and recommendations for their development and integration with exposure scenario...|$|R
30|$|This {{session was}} {{primarily}} focused on prospective risk assessment under the PPP authorization legislation. Katja Knauer (Federal Office for Agriculture, Berne, Switzerland) and Annette Aldrich (Agroscope, Wädenswil, Switzerland) showed how monitoring data {{may be used}} to improve PPP risk assessment and management in Switzerland. They proposed that authorization of PPP should be reviewed, if measured environmental concentrations (MEC) exceed the <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> (RACs). To analyze whether maximal predicted environmental concentrations (PECmax) are indeed “worst case”, Beate Fulda (Agroscope, Wädenswil, Switzerland) compared PECmax in surface waters calculated using the EXPOSIT 3.01 model, with MEC obtained from Swiss monitoring programs. In over 99  % of samples, MEC were lower than PECmax. The authors conclude that the calculated PECmax are sufficiently conservative, but caution that monitoring programs using monthly grab or 7 - to 14 -day composite samples may miss peak concentrations in the environment. A related study (poster) analyzed the effect of PPP application patterns on PEC calculations. For PPP with long degradation half-lives (DT 50), PECmax depends on the time between applications, while for PPP with low DT 50, the frequency of applications is more important. In an example of actual application practices in a vineyard (poster), the median of the time between PPP applications and average amounts applied were equal to predictive model assumptions. Saskia Knillmann (UFZ, Leipzig, Germany) presented evidence that PPP use patterns for a given geographical area are influenced by climatic conditions. Based on an analysis of insecticide use and climate data from several European countries, she concluded that the average spring air temperature is a useful predictor of the amount of insecticide applied: the warmer the spring, the more is the insecticide applied and the earlier is the first application.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the appropriateness of}} several methods, including those recommended in the Aquatic Guidance Document of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), for the derivation of chronic Tier- 1 <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Acceptable</b> <b>Concentrations</b> (RACs) for insecticides and aquatic organisms. The insecticides represented different chemical classes (organophosphates, pyrethroids, benzoylureas, insect growth regulators, biopesticides, carbamates, neonicotinoids and miscellaneous). Chronic Tier- 1 RACs derived using toxicity data for the standard species Daphnia magna, Chironomus spp. and/or Americamysis bahia, were compared with Tier- 3 RACs derived from micro-/mesocosm studies on basis of the ecological threshold option (ETO-RACs). ETO-RACs could be derived for 31 insecticides applied to micro-/mesocosms in single or multiple applications, yielding a total number of 36 cases for comparison. The chronic Tier- 1 RACs calculated according to the EFSA approach resulted in a sufficient protection level, except for one neonicotinoid (slightly under-protective) and for several pyrethroids if toxicity data for A. bahia were not included. This latter observation {{can be explained by}} (1) the fact that A. bahia is the most sensitive standard test species for pyrethroids, (2) the hydrophobic properties of pyrethroids, and (3) the fact that long-term effects observed in (epi) benthic arthropods may be better explained by exposure via the sediment than via overlying water. Besides including toxicity data for A. bahia, the protection level for pyrethroids can be improved by selecting both D. magna and Chironomus spp. as standard test species for chronic Tier- 1 derivation. Although protective in the majority of cases, the conservativeness of the recommended chronic Tier- 1 RACs appears to be less than an order of magnitude for a relatively large proportion of insecticides when compared with their Tier- 3 ETO-RACs. This may leave limited options for refinement of the chronic effect assessment using laboratory toxicity data for additional specie...|$|R

40|$|In {{the aquatic}} tier- 1 effect {{assessment}} for {{plant protection products}} with an herbicidal mode of action in Europe, it is usually algae and/or vascular plants that determine the environmental risks. This tier includes tests with at least 2 algae and 1 macrophyte (Lemna). Although such tests {{are considered to be}} of a chronic nature (based on the duration of the test in relation to the life cycle of the organism), the measurement endpoints derived from the laboratory tests with plants (including algae) and used in the first-tier effect assessment for herbicides are acute effect concentrations affecting 50 % of the test organisms (EC 50 values) and not no-observed-effect concentrations (NOECs) or effect concentrations affecting 10 % of the test organisms (EC 10) values. Other European legislative frameworks (e. g., the Water Framework Directive) use EC 10 values. The present study contributes to a validation of the tiered herbicide risk assessment approach by comparing the standard first-tier effect assessment with results of microcosm and mesocosm studies. We evaluated EC 50 and EC 10 values for standard test algae and macrophytes based on either the growth rate endpoint (ErC 50) or the lowest available endpoint for growth rate or biomass/yield (Er/EyC 50). These values were compared with the <b>regulatory</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> for the threshold option as derived from microcosm and mesocosm studies.

50|$|The VGP sets numeric {{ballast water}} {{discharge}} limits for large commercial vessels. The limits are expressed as the maximum <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration</b> of living organisms {{per cubic meter}} of ballast water. The Coast Guard worked with EPA in developing the scientific basis and the regulatory requirements in the VGP.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to report that the <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration</b> of {{microorganisms}} in a semen sample for insemination may not be safe for an in vitro fertilization procedure. It seems that the semen sample should be completely germ-free, because of the excellent microorganism proliferation condition promoted by the in vitro environment...|$|R
40|$|Prefreeze washing of red {{cells with}} saline and other wash {{solutions}} before freezing with 10 % hydroxyethyl starch does not yield an improved product after thawing. The saline stabilities and cell recoveries are reduced {{and the level}} of supernatant hemoglobin increased. These data further support the use of 14 % as the most <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration</b> of hydroxyethyl starch for cryopreservation of red cells...|$|R
40|$|Data on hydrochemical {{monitoring}} parameters {{and water quality}} for the South-Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant cooling pool are considered in the paper. Changes in the Tashlyk cooling pool water physical and chemical parameters under influence of the South-Ukrainian Power Complex are analyzed. It was shown that values of some parameters exceed limited <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> for water reservoir for fish economy. </p...|$|R
50|$|The MATC {{is used to}} set {{regulatory}} {{standards for}} priority pollutants under the US federal Clean Water Act. Regulatory guidelines give two <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> of pollutants to protect against effects: chronic or acute. Since the MATC should only be reported in chronic toxicity tests, there is a widely accepted method to convert the chronic MATC to a concentration that protects against acute effects.|$|R
50|$|The EPA {{has defined}} <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> of {{particulate}} {{matter in the}} air, through the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated. Due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas, epidemiological {{studies have been conducted}} and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke.|$|R
50|$|On 9 November, {{the city}} of Governador Valadares stopped the water intakes due to the mud on the Rio Doce. The next day, a State of Public Calamity was decreed in {{response}} to the water shortage in the city. According to analyses carried out in the city, the mud contains greater than <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> of heavy metals, substances harmful to health, such as arsenic, lead and mercury.|$|R
