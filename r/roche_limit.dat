40|$|A {{distinct}} {{population of}} planetary systems that contain dynamically isolated, Earth-size planets with orbital periods P_orb∼ 1 day was recently identified {{in an analysis}} of data from the Kepler planet candidate catalog. We argue that these objects could represent the remnant rocky cores of giant planets that arrived at the stellar vicinity on high-eccentricity orbits and were rapidly stripped of their gaseous envelopes after crossing their respective <b>Roche</b> <b>limits</b> (RLs) a_R,p. In this picture, objects with P_orb≳ 1 day are mostly "early" cores that originated in planets with an initial periastron distance a_per, 0 a_R,p; these planets underwent orbital circularization to a radius >a_per, 0 but eventually reached a_R,p through tidal orbital decay. This picture naturally accounts for the spatial distribution of hot Earths and for the similarity of their inferred occurrence rate to that of hot Jupiters, and it fits well with the interpretation of the so-called sub-Jovian desert in the orbital-period [...] planetary-mass plane in terms of high-eccentricity planet migration to the vicinity of the RL.

50|$|A {{fraction}} of the crew, led by George, visit the double planet Rocheworld, landing a Surface Lander and Ascent Module (SLAM) on the water-free , dubbed Roche (French for rock {{as well as the}} name of the French mathematician who worked on <b>Roche</b> <b>limits).</b> After exploring <b>Roche,</b> they again split up, and one group journeys via the space-plane Dragonfly to the other lobe, Eau (French for water), which is covered almost entirely by ocean. The crew are caught in a violent storm that causes their plane to experience a crash water-landing. The flooded propulsion systems of the space-plane are unable to provide enough thrust to break free and take off from the ocean surface. The crew decide to use the plane's lift fans as propellers to {{make their way to the}} inner pole of the double planet, where the gravitation from the other lobe of the double planet should help them to break free and allow rendezvous with the remaining crew in the lander at the zero point between the two lobes.|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} dust disks have been {{discovered}} around white dwarfs (WDs) : small dust disks within the <b>Roche</b> <b>limits</b> of their WDs, and a large dust disk around the hot central WD of the Helix planetary nebula (PN), possibly produced by collisions among Kuiper Belt-like objects. To search for more dust disks of the latter type, we have carried out a Spitzer MIPS 24 µm survey of 71 hot WDs or pre-WDs, and found nine WDs with excess 24 µm emission, seven of which are still central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNs). We have therefore used archival Spitzer IRAC and MIPS observations of PNe to search for CSPNs with excess IR emission, and found five additional IR excesses likely originating from dust disks. For some of these CSPNs, we have acquired follow-up Spitzer MIPS images and IRS spectra, and Gemini NIRI and Michelle spectroscopic observations. The spectral energy distributions show great diversity in the emission characteristics of the IR excesses, which may imply different mechanisms responsible for the excess emission. The two most likely dust production mechanisms are: (1) breakup of bodies in planetesimal belts through collisions, (2) formation of circumstellar dust disks through binary interactions...|$|R
40|$|We report {{observations}} {{of a possible}} young transiting planet orbiting a previously known weak-lined T-Tauri star in the 7 – 10 [*]Myr old Orion-OB 1 a/ 25 -Ori region. The candidate was found {{as part of the}} Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) Orion project. It has a photometric transit period of 0. 448413 ± 0. 000040 days, and appears in both 2009 and 2010 PTF data. Follow-up low-precision radial velocity (RV) observations and adaptive optics imaging suggest that the star is not an eclipsing binary, and that it is unlikely that a background source is blended with the target and mimicking the observed transit. RV observations with the Hobby–Eberly and Keck telescopes yield an RV that has the same period as the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transit center by ≈ − 0. 22 periods. The amplitude (half range) of the RV variations is 2. 4 [*]km[*]s^(− 1) and is comparable with the expected RV amplitude that stellar spots could induce. The RV curve is likely dominated by stellar spot modulation and provides an upper limit to the projected companion mass of M_psin[*]i_(orb) ≾ 4. 8 ± 1. 2 [*]M_(Jup); when combined with the orbital inclination, i_(orb), of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit light curve, we find an upper limit on the mass of the planetary candidate of M_p ≾ 5. 5 ± 1. 4 [*]M_(Jup). This limit implies that the planet is orbiting close to, if not inside, its <b>Roche</b> <b>limiting</b> orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active mass loss and evaporation...|$|R
25|$|The {{orientation}} of the rings is consistent with an edge-on view from Earth in 2008, explaining the observed dimming of Chariklo between 1997 and 2008 {{by a factor of}} 1.75, as well as the gradual disappearance of water ice and other materials from its spectrum as the observed surface area of the rings decreased. Also consistent with this edge-on orientation is that since 2008, the Chariklo system has increased in brightness by a factor of 1.5 again, and the infrared water-ice spectral features have reappeared. This suggests that the rings are composed at least partially of water ice. An icy ring composition is also consistent with the expected density of a disrupted body within Chariklo's <b>Roche</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E
25|$|Saturn's rings {{may be very}} old, {{dating to}} the {{formation}} of Saturn itself. There are two main theories regarding the origin of Saturn's inner rings. One theory, originally proposed by Édouard Roche in the 19th century, is that the rings were once a moon of Saturn (named Veritas, after a Roman goddess who hid in a well) whose orbit decayed until it came close enough to be ripped apart by tidal forces (see <b>Roche</b> <b>limit).</b> A variation on this theory is that this moon disintegrated after being struck by a large comet or asteroid. The second theory is that the rings were never part of a moon, but are instead left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of massive}} early rings was {{subsequently}} extended {{to explain the}} formation of Saturn's moons out to Rhea. If the initial massive rings contained chunks of rocky material (>100km across) as well as ice, these silicate bodies would have accreted more ice and been expelled from the rings, due to gravitational interactions with the rings and tidal interaction with Saturn, into progressively wider orbits. Within the <b>Roche</b> <b>limit,</b> bodies of rocky material are dense enough to accrete additional material, whereas less-dense bodies of ice are not. Once outside the rings, the newly formed moons could have continued to evolve through random mergers. This process may explain the variation in silicate content of Saturn's moons out to Rhea, {{as well as the}} trend towards less silicate content closer to Saturn. Rhea would then be the oldest of the moons formed from the primordial rings, with moons closer to Saturn being progressively younger.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} tidal interactions on the planetary orbits and stellar spin rates of the WASP- 18 and WASP- 19 planetary systems using a forward integration scheme. By fitting the resulting evolutionary tracks to the observed eccentricity, semi-major axis and stellar rotation rate, and to the stellar age derived from isochronal fitting, {{we are able to}} place constraints on the stellar and planetary reduced tidal quality factors, Q's and Q'p. We find that for WASP- 18, log(Q's) = 8. 21 + 0. 90 - 0. 52 and log(Q'p) = 7. 77 + 1. 54 - 1. 25, implying a system age of 0. 579 + 0. 305 - 0. 250 Gyr. For WASP- 19 we obtain values of log(Q's) = 6. 47 + 2. 19 - 0. 95 and log(Q'p) = 6. 75 + 1. 86 - 1. 77, suggesting a system age of 1. 60 + 2. 84 - 0. 79 Gyr and a remaining lifetime of 0. 0067 + 1. 1073 - 0. 0061 Gyr. We investigate a range of evolutionary histories consistent with these results and the observed parameters for both systems, and find that the majority imply that the stars have been spun up through tidal interactions as the planets spiral towards their <b>Roche</b> <b>limits.</b> We examine a variety of evidence for WASP- 19 A's age, both for the value above and for a younger age consistent with gyrochronology, and conclude that the older estimate {{is more likely to be}} correct. This suggests that WASP- 19 b might be in the final stages of the spiral-in process, although we are unable to rule out the possibility that it has a substantial remaining lifetime.

40|$|Cold gas {{entering}} the central $ 1 $ to $ 10 ^ 2 $ pc of a galaxy fragments and condenses into clouds. The {{stability of the}} clouds determines whether they will be turned into stars or can be delivered to the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) to turn on an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The conventional criteria to assess the stability of these clouds, such as the Jeans criterion and <b>Roche</b> (or tidal) <b>limit,</b> are insufficient here, because they assume the dominance of self-gravity in binding a cloud, and neglect external agents, such as pressure and tidal forces, which are common in galactic nuclei. We formulate a new scheme for judging this stability. We first revisit the conventional Virial theorem, taking into account an external pressure, to identify the correct range of masses that lead to stable clouds. We then extend the theorem to include an external tidal field, crucial for the {{stability in the region}} of interest [...] in dense star clusters, around SMBHs. We apply our extended Virial theorem to find the correct solutions to practical problems that until now were controversial, namely, the stability of the gas clumps in AGN tori, the circum-nuclear disk in the Galactic Center, and the central molecular zone of the Milky Way. The masses we derive for these structures are orders of magnitude smaller than the commonly-used Virial masses (equivalent to the Jeans mass).

40|$|Two {{types of}} dust disks have been {{discovered}} around white dwarfs (WDs) : small dust disks within the <b>Roche</b> <b>limits</b> of their WDs and large dust disks around hot WDs extending to radial distances of 10 - 10 ² AU. The majority of the latter WDs are central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNs). We have therefore used archival Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) observations of PNs to search for CSPNs with IR excesses {{and to make a}} comparative investigation of dust disks around stars at different evolutionary stages. We have examined available images of 72 resolved PNs in the Spitzer archive and found 56 of them large enough for the CSPN to be resolved from the PN. Among these, only 42 CSPNs are visible in IRAC and/or MIPS images and selected for photometric measurements. From the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these CSPNs, we find 19 cases with clear IR excess. Of these, seven are [WC]-type stars, two have apparent visual companions that account for the observed excess emission, two are symbiotic CSPNs, and in eight cases the IR excess originates from an extended emitter, likely a dust disk. For some of these CSPNs, we have acquired follow-up Spitzer MIPS images, Infrared Spectrograph spectra, and Gemini NIRI and Michelle spectroscopic observations. The SEDs and spectra show a great diversity in the emission characteristics of the IR excesses, which may imply different mechanisms responsible for the excess emission. For CSPNs whose IR excesses originate from dust continuum, the most likely dust production mechanisms are (1) breakup of bodies in planetesimal belts through collisions and (2) formation of circumstellar dust disks through binary interactions. A better understanding of post-asymptotic giant branch binary evolution as well as debris disk evolution along with its parent star is needed to distinguish between these different origins. Future observations to better establish the physical parameters of the dust disks and the presence of companions are needed for models to discern between the possible dust production mechanisms. 35 page(s...|$|R
