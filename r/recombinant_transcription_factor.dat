40|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is {{a continuing}} threat to public health. The systemic administration of interferon alpha with ribavirin is the only currently approved treatment. However, this treatment {{is associated with a}} wide spectrum of systemic side effects that limits its effectiveness; thus, there is an urgent need for new treatment modalities. In this study, we describe a novel anti-HCV strategy employing a <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> that we have engineered {{in such a way that}} NS 3 / 4 a viral protease controls its intracellular localization, thereby restoring interferon secretion specifically in cells infected with HCV. Proof-of-concept experiments validated the strategy, showing that the <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> was triggered to stimulate interferon promoter by NS 3 / 4 A and remained inactive in cells without NS 3 / 4 a. Using an adenovirus-associated viral vector delivery system, we found that the <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> inhibited HCV replication effectively in vitro in cultured cells...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{disulphide}} isomerase (PDI) is {{a unique}} polypeptide which resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and also functions as the beta-subunit of prolyl 4 -hydroxylase, as a cellular thyroid hormone-binding protein, as the smaller subunit of the microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein complex, as a dehydroascorbate reductase and as a protein that binds various peptides in a specific manner. We have recently demonstrated that the promoter of the PDI gene contains six CCAAT boxes and other elements which are needed for efficient transcription. We now demonstrate that purified human <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> Sp 1 interacts with two perfect GGGCGG sequences and three other GC-rich elements of the PDI promoter. Sp 1 also appears {{to participate in the}} regulation of PDI gene expression, since overexpression of Sp 1 stimulated PDI promoter activity in HeLa cells and mutations introduced into each of these Sp 1 -binding sites separately reduced the promoter strength, although even the largest decrease was only about 50 %. These results support our view that expression of the gene for this polypeptide with multiple functions is secured by several regulatory elements, some of which are functionally redundant...|$|E
40|$|Cys 2 His 2 zinc {{fingers are}} {{eukaryotic}} DNA-binding motifs, capable of distinguishing different DNA sequences, and {{are suitable for}} engineering artificial transcription factors. In this work, we used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the ability of tailor-made zinc finger proteins to activate {{the expression of the}} FLO 11 gene, with phenotypic consequences. Two three-finger peptides were identified, recognizing sites from the 5 ' UTR of the FLO 11 gene with nanomolar DNA-binding affinity. The three-finger domains and their combined six-finger motif, recognizing an 18 -bp site, were fused to the activation domain of VP 16 or VP 64. These transcription factor constructs retained their DNA-binding ability, with the six-finger ones being the highest in affinity. However, when expressed in haploid yeast cells, only one three-finger <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> was able to activate the expression of FLO 11 efficiently. Unlike in the wild-type, cells with such transcriptional activation displayed invasive growth and biofilm formation, without any requirement for glucose depletion. The VP 16 and VP 64 domains appeared to act equally well in the activation of FLO 11 expression, with comparable effects in phenotypic alteration. We conclude that the functional activity of tailor-made transcription factors in cells is not easily predicted by the in vitro DNA-binding activity...|$|E
40|$|In higher eukaryotes, RNA {{polymerase}} (pol) III {{is known}} to use different <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> to recognize three basic types of promoters, but in no case have these <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> been completely defined. We show that a highly purified pol III complex combined with the <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> SNAP(c), TBP, Brf 2, and Bdp 1 directs multiple rounds of transcription initiation and termination from the human U 6 promoter. The pol III complex contains traces of CK 2, and CK 2 associates with the U 6 promoter region in vivo. Transcription requires CK 2 phosphorylation of the pol III complex. In contrast, CK 2 phosphorylation of TBP, Brf 2, and Bdp 1 combined is inhibitory. The results define a minimum core machinery, the ultimate target of regulatory mechanisms, capable of directing all steps of the transcription process-initiation, elongation, and termination-by a metazoan RNA polymerase, and suggest positive and negative regulatory roles for CK 2 in transcription by pol III...|$|R
40|$|TATA binding protein (TBP) and <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> IIB (TFIIB) are {{key factors}} for the {{assembly}} of eukaryotic transcription initiation complexes. We used a rice whole-cell extract in vitro transcription system to characterize the functional interactions of recombinant plant TBP and TFIIB. Bacterially expressed rice TBP (OsTBP 2) bound to the TATA box of the rice pal gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, caused DNA bending, and enhanced basal transcription from the pal promoter in a TATA box–dependent manner. Recombinant rice TFIIB (OsTFIIB) stimulated the DNA binding and bending activities of OsTBP 2 and synergistically enhanced OsTBP 2 -mediated transcription from the pal promoter and the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus but not from the barley pr 1 promoter. We also demonstrate a physical interaction between OsTBP 2 and RF 2 a, a rice bZIP <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> that bound to the box II cis element of the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus, resulting in enhanced transcription from the viral promoter. Enhancement of rice whole-cell extracts with <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> thus provides {{a powerful tool for}} the in vitro determination of plant gene regulation mechanisms. We conclude that OsTBP 2 undergoes promoter-specific functional interactions with both the basal <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> OsTFIIB and the accessory <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> RF 2 a...|$|R
40|$|Although Archaea are prokaryotic and {{resemble}} Bacteria morphologically, their transcription apparatus {{is remarkably}} {{similar to those of}} eukaryotic cell nuclei. Because some Archaea exist in environments with temperatures of around 100 °C, they are likely to have evolved unique strategies for transcriptional control. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature and DNA template topology in a thermophilic archaeal transcription system. Significantly, and in marked contrast with characterized eucaryal systems, archaeal DNA template topology has negligible effect on transcription levels at physiological temperatures using highly purified polymerase and <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factors.</b> Furthermore, archaeal <b>transcription</b> does not require hydrolysis of the β-γ phosphoanhydride bond of ATP. However, at lower temperatures, negatively supercoiled templates are transcribed more highly than those that are positively supercoiled. Notably, the block to transcription on positively supercoiled templates at lowered temperatures is at the level of polymerase binding and promoter opening. These data imply that Archaea do not possess a functional homologue of <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> TFIIH, and that for the promoters studied, transcription is mediated by TATA box-binding protein, <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> TFB, and RNA polymerase alone. Furthermore, they suggest that the reduction of plasmid linking number by hyperthermophilic Archaea in vivo in response to cold shock is a mechanism to maintain gene expression under these adverse circumstances...|$|R
40|$|The RE 1 -silencing {{transcription}} factor (REST) /neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) can repress transcription of {{a battery of}} neuronal differentiation genes in non-neuronal cells by binding to a specific consensus DNA sequence present in their regulatory regions. However, REST/NRSF–/– mice suggest {{that the absence of}} REST/NRSF-dependent repression alone is not sufficient for the expression of these neuronal differentiation genes and that the presence of other promoter/enhancer-specific activators is required. Here we describe the construction of a <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factor,</b> REST-VP 16, by replacing repressor domains of REST/NRSF with the activation domain of a viral activator VP 16. In transient transfection experiments, REST-VP 16 was found to operate through RE 1 binding site/neuron-restrictive enhancer element (RE 1 /NRSE), activate plasmid-encoded neuronal promoters in various mammalian cell types and activate cellular REST/NRSF target genes, {{even in the absence of}} factors that are otherwise required to activate such genes. Efficient expression of REST-VP 16 through adenoviral vectors in NT 2 cells, which resemble human committed neuronal progenitor cells, was found to cause activation of multiple neuronal genes that are characteristic markers for neuronal differentiation. Thus, REST-VP 16 could be used as a unique tool to study neuronal differentiation pathways and neuronal diseases that arise due to the deregulation of this process...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the {{immediate}} early 1 and 2 gene (IE- 1 / 2) of human cytomegalovirus, an important pathogen in immunosuppressed patients, is controlled by a strong enhancer/promoter. To define the promoter domain within this large cis-active region of about 550 nucleotides, DNA-protein interactions were studied. DNase I footprinting experiments using procaryotically expressed transcription factor Sp 1 revealed an extensive interaction of this transcription factor with both consensus and aberrant recognition elements within the IE- 1 / 2 promoter region. Protection of these Sp 1 binding sites could also be observed when nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells and permissive human fibroblast cells were used. After in vitro mutagenesis of Sp 1 targets and transient expression of mutagenized CAT-expression plasmids, however, no significant reduction in CAT activities was found. By analyzing a series of 5 ' deletion mutants of the IE- 1 / 2 promoter region, a strong cis-acting element was localized between nucleotides - 94 and - 78, upstream of sites that interact with Sp 1. Gel retardation experiments demonstrated binding of <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> CREB to this motif which reveals it as an aberrant CREB recognition sequence. Thus, this study identifies several previously unknown binding sites for transcription factors Sp 1 and CREB within the proximal promoter region of the IE- 1 / 2 gene, which differ markedly in their relevance for constitutive promoter function...|$|E
40|$|REST/NRSF is a {{transcriptional}} repressor {{that acts}} at the terminal {{stage of the}} neuronal differentiation pathway and blocks the transcription of several differentiation genes. REST/NRSF is generally downregulated during induction of neuronal differentiation. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> REST-VP 16 binds to the same DNA binding site as does REST/NRSF but functions as an activator instead of a repressor and can directly activate the transcription of REST/NRSF target genes. However, {{it is not known}} whether REST-VP 16 expression is sufficient to cause formation of functional neurons from neural stem cells (NSCs). Here we show that regulated expression of REST-VP 16 in a physiologically relevant NSC line growing under cycling conditions converted the cells rapidly to the mature neuronal phenotype. Furthermore, when grown in the presence of retinoic acid, REST-VP 16 -expressing NSCs activated their target, as well as other differentiation genes that are not their direct target, converting them to the mature neuronal phenotype and enabling them to survive in the presence of mitotic inhibitors, which is a characteristic of mature neurons. In addition, these neuronal cells were physiologically active. These results showed that direct activation of REST/NRSF target genes in NSCs with a single transgene, REST-VP 16, is sufficient to cause neuronal differentiation, and the findings suggested that direct activation of genes involved in the terminal stage of differentiation may cause neuronal differentiation of NSCs...|$|E

We aimed at optimizing a MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) analytical method for {{the characterization of}} such domains after protein enzymatic digestion. A panel of <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> with different basic residue contents was proteolytically digested with the Asp-N endoprotease and resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-MS with alpha-cyano- 4 -hydroxy-cinnamic acid (CHCA) and 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) as matrix. We found that peptides without lysine, arginine, histidine (Lys/Arg/His free peptides) were efficiently detected in the positive ion mode only when using DHB. These findings proved to be very useful for two different targeted proteomic applications. Indeed, the MALDI-MS/MS identification of the CARM 1 proteolytic cleavage site, which happens in a Lys/Arg/His free domain, could only be achieved using the DHB matrix. Moreover, in routine proteomic analyses, the detection efficiency of Lys/Arg/His free C-terminal peptides of two-dimensional gel separated proteins was strongly enhanced when DHB was used instead of CHCA...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for the assay of sequencespecific DNA-binding proteins in this paper. In this method, the sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology {{is combined with}} the common DNA footprinting assay {{in order to develop}} a simple, rapid and high-throughput approach for quantitatively detecting the sequence-specific DNAbinding proteins. We named this method as exonuclease III (ExoIII) protection assay with FRET probe. The FRET probe used in this assay was a duplex DNA which was designed to contain one FRET pair in the center and two flanking protein-binding sites. During protein detection, if a target protein exists, it will bind to the two protein-binding sites of the FRET probe and thus protect the FRET pair from ExoIII digestion, resulting in high FRET. However, if the target protein does not exist, the FRET pair on the naked FRET probe will be degraded by ExoIII, resulting in low FRET. Three kinds of <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> including NF-kB, SP 1 and p 50, and the target protein of NF-kB in HeLa cell nuclear extracts, were successfully detected by the assay. This assay can be extensively used in biomedical research targeted at DNA-binding proteins...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{transduction}} domains (PTDs), {{such as the}} HIV 1 -TAT peptide, {{have been}} previously used to promote the uptake of proteins into a range of cell types, including stem cells. Here we generated pancreatic <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> containing PTD sequences and administered these to endoderm enriched mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells under conditions that were designed to mimic the pattern of expression of these factors in the developing pancreas. The ES cells were first cultured as embryoid bodies and treated with Activin A and Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP 4) to promote formation of definitive endoderm. Cells were subsequently plated as a monolayer and treated with different combinations of the modified <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> Pdx 1 and MafA. The results demonstrate that each <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> was efficiently {{taken up by the}} cells, where they were localized in the nuclei. RT-qPCR was used to measure the expression levels of pancreatic markers. After the addition of Pdx 1 alone for a period of five days, followed by the combination of Pdx 1 and TAT-MafA in a second phase, up-regulation of insulin 1, insulin 2, Pdx 1, Glut 2, Pax 4 and Nkx 6. 1 was observed. As assessed by immunocytochemistry, double positive insulin and Pdx 1 cells were detected in the differentiated cultures. Although the pattern of pancreatic markers expression in these cultures was comparable to that of a mouse transformed b-cell line (MIN- 6) and human islets, the expression levels of insulin observed in the differentiated ES cell cultures were several orders of magnitude lower. This suggests that, although PTD-TFs may prove useful in studying the role of exogenous TFs in th...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that transcription from the vaccinia virus 7. 5 K early promoter is reactivated late in infection (J. Garcés, K. Masternak, B. Kunz, and R. Wittek, J. Virol. 67 : 5394 - 5401, 1993). To identify the sequence elements mediating reactivation, we constructed recombinant viruses harboring deletions, substitutions, or insertions in the 7. 5 K promoter or its flanking regions. The {{analysis of these}} viruses showed that sequences both upstream as well as downstream of the transcription initiation site contribute to reactivation of the 7. 5 K promoter. We tested whether reactivation {{could be explained by}} a high affinity of vaccinia virus early <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> to reactivated promoters. Bandshift experiments using purified protein showed that promoters which bind the factor with high affinity in general also have high early transcriptional activity. However, no correlation was found between affinity of the factor and reactivation. Interestingly, overexpression of <b>recombinant</b> early <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> in vaccinia virus-infected cells resulted in a shutdown of late transcription and in reactivation of promoters, which are normally not reactivated...|$|R
40|$|Avian histone H 5 and alpha A-globin {{genes are}} {{transcribed}} much more efficiently in whole cell extracts derived from immature polychromatic erythrocytes than in extracts from mature duck erythrocytes.

The addition of either highly purified human or <b>recombinant</b> yeast <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> IIA (TFIIA) to extracts from mature erythrocytes resulted in {{a significant increase in}} transcription from TATA-containing promoters, whereas transcription from TATA-less promoters remained unaffected. Moreover, the activity of TFIIA was found to be reduced in extracts from mature erythrocytes. These data support the proposition that inactivation of TFIIA may contribute to a general repression of gene activity in avian erythrocytes, and only those genes with alternative mechanisms of initiation complex formation continue to be expressed in these cells. In the case of the histone H 5 gene, such an alternative mechanism could be mediated via the interaction between duck erythrocyte upstream stimulating factor and TFIID...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacological {{modulation}} of {{the interaction}} between <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> and target DNA sequences of cellular and viral genes could have important effects in the experimental therapy of a large variety of human pathologies. For instance, alteration of the DNA/protein interaction might be among the molecular mechanisms of action of DNA-binding drugs, leading to an inhibition of the expression of genes involved in the control of in vitro and in vivo growth of neoplastic cells and virus DNA replication. Natural oligopeptides, such as distamycin, are powerful inhibitors {{of the interaction}} between nuclear factors and target DNA sequences and, therefore, have been proposed as compounds retaining antibiotic, antineoplastic and antiviral properties. In this study we performed DNAase I footprinting analysis using a PCR product mimicking a region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV- 1) retrovirus. The data obtained suggest that distamycin binds to different regions of the HIV- 1 LTR depending on the DNA sequence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using both crude nuclear extracts from the Jurkat T-lymphoid cell line and the <b>recombinant</b> proteins <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> IID and Sp 1 suggest that distamycin differentially inhibits the interaction of these two proteins with their specific DNA target sequences, in good agreement with the results obtained by DNAase I footprinting analysis...|$|R

Human <b>recombinant</b> TATA-binding protein, <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> (TF) IIB and TFIIF (made up of the 30 and 74 kDa RNA polymerase II-associated proteins RAP 30 and RAP 74) were incubated with calf thymus poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and [32 P]NAD+ at 37 degrees C. On lithium dodecyl sulphate/PAGE and autoradiography, two bands of radioactivity, coincident with RAP 30 and RAP 74, were observed. No radioactivity co-migrated with TATA-binding protein or TFIIB. The phenomenon was dependent on the presence of nicked DNA, which is essential for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. Covalent modification of TFIIF increased with time of incubation, with increasing TFIIF concentration and with increasing NAD+ concentration. High-resolution PAGE confirmed that the radioactive species associated with RAP 30 and RAP 74 were ADP-ribose polymers. From these observations, we conclude that both TFIIF subunits are highly specific substrates for covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation...|$|R

MTD-TFAM treatment of these cell lines reversibly increased oxygen consumption (respiration) rates 3 -fold, levels of respiratory proteins and mitochondrial gene expression. _In vivo_ results demonstrated that respiration increased to lesser degrees in mitochondria from tissues of mice injected with MTD-TFAM.

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are being {{exploited}} in regenerative medicine {{due to their}} tri-lineage differentiation and immunomodulation activity. Currently, {{there are two major}} challenges when directing the differentiation of MSCs for therapeutic applications. First, chemical and growth factor strategies to direct osteogenesis in vivo lack specificity for targeted delivery with desired effects. Second, MSC differentiation by gene therapy is difficult as transfection with existing approaches is clinically impractical (viral transfection) or have low efficacy (lipid-mediated transfection). These challenges can be avoided by directly delivering nonvirally derived <b>recombinant</b> protein <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> with the glycosaminoglycan-binding enhanced transduction (GET) delivery system (P 21 and 8 R peptides). We used the osteogenic master regulator, RUNX 2 as a programming factor due to its stage-specific role in osteochondral differentiation pathways. Herein, we engineered GET-fusion proteins and compared sequential osteogenic changes in MSCs, induced by exposure to GET fusion proteins or conventional stimulation methods (dexamethasone and Bone morphogenetic protein 2). By assessing loss of stem cell-surface markers, upregulation of osteogenic genes and matrix mineralization, we demonstrate that GET-RUNX 2 efficiently transduces MSCs and triggers osteogenesis by enhancing target gene expression directly. The high transduction efficiency of GET system holds great promise for stem cell therapies by allowing reproducible transcriptional control in stem cells, potentially bypassing problems observed with high-concentration growth-factor or pleiotropic steroid therapies...|$|R

Mitotic {{repression of}} transcription of various cellular and viral gene promoters by RNA polymerase II can be reproduced in vitro either with extracts prepared from cells arrested at mitosis with the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole or with nuclear extracts prepared from asynchronous cells and the mitotic protein kinase cdc 2 /cyclin B. Purified cdc 2 /cyclin B kinase is also sufficient to inhibit transcription in reconstituted transcription reactions with biochemically purified and <b>recombinant</b> basal <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> and RNA polymerase II. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 Waf 1 /Cip 1 /Sdi 1 can reverse {{the effect of}} cdc 2 /cyclin B kinase, indicating that repression of transcription is due to protein phosphorylation. Transcription rescue and inhibition experiments {{with each of the}} basal factors and the polymerase suggest that multiple components of the transcription machinery are inactivated by cdc 2 /cyclin B kinase. For an activated promoter, targets of repression are TFIID and TFIIH, while for a basal promoter, TFIIH is the major target for mitotic inactivation of transcription. Protein labeling experiments indicate that the p 62 and p 36 subunits of TFIIH are in vitro substrates for mitotic phosphorylation. Using the carboxy-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II as a test substrate for phosphorylation, the TFIIH-associated kinase, cdk 7 /cyclin H, is inhibited concomitant with inhibition of transcription activity.

Whereas unicellular networks have been studied extensively, metazoan transcription regulatory networks remain largely unexplored. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model to study such metazoan networks because its genome is completely sequenced and many functional genomic tools are available. While C. elegans gene predictions have undergone continuous refinement, {{this is not true}} for the annotation of functional <b>transcription</b> <b>factors.</b> The comprehensive identification of <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> is essential for the systematic mapping of transcription regulatory networks because it enables the creation of physical <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> resources {{that can be used in}} assays to map interactions between <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> and their target genes. RESULTS: By computational searches and extensive manual curation, we have identified a compendium of 934 <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> genes (referred to as wTF 2. 0). We find that manual curation drastically reduces the number of both false positive and false negative <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> predictions. We discuss how <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> splice variants and dimer formation may affect the total number of functional <b>transcription</b> <b>factors.</b> In contrast to mouse <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> genes, we find that C. elegans <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> genes do not undergo significantly more splicing than other genes.

We have used two high-quality <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> prediction databases to annotate wCNE-associated genes. DBD is {{a database of}} <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> predicted through homology to domains of known sequence-specific DNA-binding <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> [1]. The C. elegans genes analysed in DBD correspond to WormBase release WS 150. wTF 2. 0 is a compendium of computationally predicted and manually curated <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> [2]. The C. elegans genes analysed in wTF 2. 0 correspond to WormBase release WS 140.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the ability of the}} neu {{tyrosine}} kinase to induce a signal for the activation of cell growth-regulated genes. Serum-starved NIH 3 T 3 cells expressing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF- R) /neu construct encoding a hybrid receptor protein were stimulated with EGF and the activation of the neu tyrosine kinase and stimulation of growth factor inducible genes were followed at the mRNA, protein, and activity levels, and compared to the corresponding responses in the neu proto-oncogene and oncogene expressing cells. Induction of the expression of jun mRNAs was an immediate early effect of EGF stimulation, followed by a marked increase in the biosynthesis of the fos/jun <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> complex and an increased <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> activity as measured by a <b>recombinant</b> <b>transcription</b> unit using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays. In distinction, elevated AP- 1 /PEA- 1 activity {{in the absence of a}} significant increase in jun and fos expression was characteristic of the neu oncogene-expressing cells. The glucose transporter mRNA increased at 2 h of EGF stimulation and was associated with enhanced glucose transport of the EGF-treated cells. An increase of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA and activity followed these changes. In contrast, serum-starved, EGF-treated neu proto-oncogene- and oncogene-expressing cells showed constitutively low and high glucose transporter and ODC activities, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the chimeric EGF-R/neu receptor is capable of activating the expression of both immediate early genes and biochemical activities associated with cell growth stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{is known}} that <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> {{frequently}} act together to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. In this paper we describe a computational analysis of <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> site dependencies in human, mouse and rat genomes. Results Our approach for quantifying tendencies of <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites to co-occur {{is based on a}} binding site scoring function which incorporates dependencies between positions, the use of information about the structural class of each <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> (major/minor groove binder), and also considered the possible implications of varying GC content of the sequences. Significant tendencies (dependencies) have been detected by non-parametric statistical methodology (permutation tests). Evaluation of obtained results has been performed in several ways: reports from literature (many of the significant dependencies between <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> have previously been confirmed experimentally); dependencies between <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> are not biased due to similarities in their DNA-binding sites; the number of dependent <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> that belong to the same functional and structural class is significantly higher than would be expected by chance; supporting evidence from GO clustering of targeting genes. Based on dependencies between two <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites (second-order dependencies), it is possible to construct higher-order dependencies (networks). Moreover results about <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites dependencies can be used for prediction of groups of dependent <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> on a given promoter sequence. Our results, as well as a scanning tool for predicting groups of dependent <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> binding sites are available on the Internet. Conclusion We show that the computational analysis of <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> site dependencies is a valuable complement to experimental approaches for discovering transcription regulatory interactions and networks. Scanning promoter sequences with dependent groups of <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites improve the quality of <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> predictions. </p...|$|R
