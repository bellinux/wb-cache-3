40|$|The {{chemical}} and electrochemical promotion of highly dispersed nanofilm Rh catalysts (dispersion: about 10 %, film thickness: 40 nm) {{has been investigated}} for the first time. To this end Rh metal was sputter-deposited, either on a purely ionic conductor (8 % Y 2 O 3 -stabilized ZrO 2) or on a mixed ionic-electronic conductor (TiO 2), the latter being a highly dispersed layer of TiO 2 (4 µm) deposited on YSZ. These catalysts are designated as Rh/YSZ and Rh/TiO 2 /YSZ, respectively. It was established analytically that both in the Rh/YSZ and in the Rh/TiO 2 /YSZ system, the catalyst films have a nanoparticle-size grain structure. The Rh supported on titania is rather porous, exhibiting a higher dispersion and surface area than Rh on YSZ. Both after reduction (H 2, T= 400 °C) and after oxidation (O 2, T= 400 °C), Rh supported on TiO 2 {{was found to be}} in a more highly reduced state than Rh on YSZ. After reducing treatment, the Rh/TiO 2 /YSZ samples contain a larger amount of weakly bonded oxygen, which can be attributed to oxygen "backspillover" from the TiO 2. A major feature of this research was the electrochemical characterization of the oxygen/Rh/solid electrolyte three-phase boundary by steady-state polarization measurements and by impedance spectroscopy. These are powerful techniques for extracting experimental trends and details that are useful for an understanding of the electrochemical promotion principles. It was shown that the exchange current densities at the Rh/solid electrolyte interface are lower on account of the TiO 2 layer. The exchange current densities are more than twice lower at Rh/TiO 2 (4 µm) /YSZ than at Rh/YSZ, demonstrating that the former interface is much more polarizable. The mechanism of oxygen exchange occurring close to equilibrium (O 2 /O 2 - couple) was investigated {{for the first time at}} Rh catalyst electrodes interfaced with solid electrolyte. The processes of cathodic oxygen reduction and anodic oxygen evolution are not symmetric, but they are similar in the two systems, Rh/YSZ and Rh/TiO 2 (4 µm) /YSZ. The cathodic process consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption of oxygen at the gas-exposed Rh surface, atomic oxygen diffusion to the electrochemical reaction sites (ERS), and a two-electron transfer to this oxygen on the ERS. The cathodic process is limited by interfacial diffusion of oxygen atoms from the gas-exposed metal surface to the ERS. The anodic process includes two steps: two-electron transfer reaction, which is the rate-determining step, and oxygen desorption to the gas phase. With data obtained from impedance spectroscopy at the equilibrium potential, it was possible to confirm the reaction scheme proposed. It was demonstrated that Rh nanofilm catalysts interfaced with YSZ or TiO 2 /YSZ can be electrochemically promoted for the reaction of ethylene oxidation. Small anodic currents cause periodic oscillations in catalytic rate and potential of the Rh/YSZ catalyst, while at Rh/TiO 2 /YSZ they give rise to a stable and reversible rate enhancement by up to a factor 80. The increase in ethylene oxidation rate is up to 2000 times larger than the electrochemical rate, I/ 2 F, of O 2 - oxidation. The pronounced electrochemical promotion behavior that has been observed is due to the anodically controlled migration of O 2 - species from the electrolyte to the Rh/gas interface. At the Rh surface, these species destabilize the formation of <b>rhodium</b> surface <b>oxide</b> (Rh 2 O 3). The existence of backspillover oxygen species has been confirmed by impedance measurements under positive applied potential. Another significant result for heterogeneous catalysis is the finding that thick as well as thin films of Rh/TiO 2 /YSZ catalyst are open to chemical promotion of ethylene oxidation and partial methane oxidation, ie, they offer a higher catalytic activity and stability than the Rh/YSZ catalysts. The modification of catalytic activity observed for Rh/TiO 2 /YSZ was attributed to either a "long-range" electronic-type SMSI mechanism or to a self-driven electrochemical promotion mechanism. In both cases, the ultimate cause of promotion are different work functions of catalyst and support. Equilibration of the work functions of two solids in contact induces surface charging, a migration of O 2 - ions to the catalyst/gas interface, and a weakening of the Rh-O chemisorptive bonds. It facilitates reduction of oxidized surface sites. Another important achievement of the present work was that of exploring and confirming the possibilities of current-assisted activation of Rh/TiO 2 /YSZ catalysts. In partial methane oxidation using close to stoichiometric gas compositions (CH 4 : O 2 = 2 : 1) at 550 °C, the inactive (oxidized) Rh/TiO 2 /YSZ catalyst was successfully activated by applied currents, either positive or negative. This phenomenon is an example of "permanent" electrochemical promotion furnishing a permanent rate enhancement ratio of γ = 11. The activation by negative currents is explained in terms of an electrochemical reduction of <b>rhodium</b> surface <b>oxide,</b> while the activation by positive currents can be explained by the mechanism of electrochemical promotion...|$|R

The Au/Rh electrodes were prepared utilizing a spontaneous deposition process (SDP) of rhodium adlayer on the gold surface. In particular, rhodium deposition was obtained in non-deaerated 50 mM HClO 4 solution containing 10 mM RhCl 3 at open circuit for a given time. The modified gold electrode with adsorbed rhodium species (Au/ Rh) exhibit higher electrochemical activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. The effects on the electrochemical activity of the Au/Rh electrode such as: rhodium coverage, pH, electrolyte composition and applied potentials were critically evaluated and discussed. An optimized pulsed chronoamperometric detection technique for the analytical determination of several mono- and di-protic organic acids such as acetic, tartaric, oxalic, malic, etc., was successfully proposed. An average film composition of AU 93 (+/- 1) Rh- 7 +/- 1 was evaluated by XPS technique. The film composition remains unchanged after various electrode treatments such as cycling of potentials and/or polarization conditions for long times in alkaline medium. Thus, the adsorbed <b>rhodium</b> <b>oxide</b> particles show a good chemical and mechanical stability despite the conditions of electrochemical treatment of the electrode surface...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} reported {{the synthesis of}} a solid-state heterojunction photocatalyst consisting of zinc <b>rhodium</b> <b>oxide</b> (ZnRh 2 O 4) and bismuth vanadium oxide (Bi 4 V 2 O 11), which functioned as hydrogen (H 2) and oxygen (O 2) evolution photocatalysts, respectively, connected with silver (Ag). Polycrystalline Bi 4 V 2 O 11 (p-Bi 4 V 2 O 11) powders were utilized to form ZnRh 2 O 4 /Ag/p-Bi 4 V 2 O 11, which was able to photocatalyze overall pure-water splitting under red-light irradiation with a wavelength of 700 nm (R. Kobayashi et al., J. Mater. Chem. A, 2016, 4, 3061). In the present study, we replaced p-Bi 4 V 2 O 11 with a powder obtained by pulverizing single crystals of Bi 4 V 2 O 11 (s-Bi 4 V 2 O 11) to form ZnRh 2 O 4 /Ag/s-Bi 4 V 2 O 11, and demonstrated that this heterojunction photocatalyst had enhanced water-splitting activity. In addition, ZnRh 2 O 4 /Ag/s-Bi 4 V 2 O 11 was able to utilize nearly {{the entire range of}} visible light up to a wavelength of 740 nm. These properties were attributable to the higher O 2 evolution activity of s-Bi 4 V 2 O 11...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} and electrochemical {{performances of the}} hybrid architecture of <b>rhodium</b> <b>oxide</b> (Rh 2 O 3) nanofibers (NF) and highly single crystalline RuO 2 nanowires (NW) by combining the electrospinning process and a simple recrystallization process. The amorphous Ru(OH) 3 ·xH 2 O precursors at relatively low temperature were efficiently transformed into highly single crystalline RuO 2 nanowires with the tetragonal rutile structure on electrospun Rh 2 O 3 nanofibers. Pure Rh 2 O 3 NF and hybrid RuO 2 NW-Rh 2 O 3 NF exhibited different electroactivities toward H 2 O 2 electrochemical reaction: Rh 2 O 3 NF facilitates the H 2 O 2 oxidation vs. hybrid RuO 2 NW-Rh 2 O 3 NF promotes H 2 O 2 reduction more favorably. The H 2 O 2 reduction free from O 2 reduction interference at RuO 2 NW-Rh 2 O 3 NF is advantageous and finds the feasibility for selective H 2 O 2 detection in various samples. Furthermore, RuO 2 NW-Rh 2 O 3 NF generated a greatly higher current induced by H 2 O 2 reduction (i. e., enhanced sensitivity to H 2 O 2) than bare Rh 2 O 3 NF. &# 169; 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{spectroscopy}} (SERS) {{combined with}} parallel mass spectrometry has been employed as an in-situ real-time probe of surface speciation during several gas-phase heterogeneous catalytic reactions on transition-metal surfaces. The catalysts are ultrathin metallic films electrodeposited onto SERS-active gold, enabling surface vibrational spectroscopic {{information to be}} obtained with high temporal resolution (≈ 1 s) at elevated temperatures (up to 500 ∘C) and under ambient-pressure flow-reactor conditions. Several reactions have been examined, including NO reduction processes on Rh, Pt and Pd, CO hydrogenation on Rh, methanol oxidation on Rh, and the reduction of surface Rh 2 O 3 by H 2, CO, and CH 3 OH. In {{the case of the}} NO reduction (by CO or H 2), a reaction of much importance for automobile emissions control, NO dissociation was directly monitored {{for the first time at}} high pressures. It was found that the extent of NO dissociation (Rh 3 ̆e Pd 3 ̆e Pt), as adjudged by the presence of surface atomic nitrogen, has a marked effect on N 2 /N 2 O selectivity. In the case of CO hydrogenation, evidence for CO dissociation as well as a proposed mechanism for the conversion of this species between adsorbed and gaseous states was obtained. For methanol oxidation on Rh, the reactivity of surface oxide (Rh 2 O 3) was found to be much less than that observed for CO 2 and H 2 O formation, suggesting that this species is not an intermediate. Furthermore, the amount of adsorbed CO formed under reaction conditions roughly correlates with observed CO/CO 2 selectivity. Finally, surface <b>rhodium</b> <b>oxide</b> reduction by H 2, CO, and CH 3 OH is compared and contrasted, revealing several distinct mechanistic differences. These results indicate that CO is the likely methanol fragment which 2 ̆ 2 scavenges 2 ̆ 2 oxide from the surface under reaction conditions. New insight was afforded in each case by the ability of SERS to monitor surface-adsorbate vibrations and acquire spectra with high temporal resolution (≈ 1 s) under 2 ̆ 2 real world 2 ̆ 2 conditions. Future directions for applying SERS to catalysis research are considered in light of these findings. In particular, preliminary results regarding the examination of supported silver catalysts and bimetallic transition-metal surfaces are discussed. ...|$|E
