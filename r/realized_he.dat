By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided {{it was in the}} best interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were to keep them out of trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E

Hunt met with him, and Shea suggested Harry Wismer, a minority shareholder in both the Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions, as a potential New York franchise owner for the new football league.

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to bring in}} and then kill a Shade {{at the end of}} the book was made when Paolini <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> needed a new ending for the book after it was split up. He was in need of plot points that were strong enough to keep the reader interested through the ending of the book. The point of view of Glaedr and Oromis' confrontation with Thorn and Murtagh was combined with the Shade battle to further keep the reader interested.|$|E

5|$|As king, Matthias waged wars {{against the}} Czech mercenaries who {{dominated}} Upper Hungary (today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary) and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating {{the zone of}} buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of Hungary with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.|$|E

5|$|Beresford was {{alerted to}} the French advance by reports {{received}} on 12 May from Spanish patriots in Seville, who had sent word of Soult's departure. Beresford {{kept up the}} pretence of besieging Badajoz by sending an unsuccessful demand for surrender to the French commander {{on the afternoon of}} that same day, but he <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> would now not have time to finish the job, so he ordered the withdrawal of his siege guns and supplies. On 13 May, the Spanish cavalry attached to Colborne's brigade came into contact with the French force and, in accordance with orders given by Wellington in April, they fell back while sending word of Soult's new position to Beresford. Later that day Long's British cavalry also encountered the advancing French and hastily pulled backâ€”although Long, too, was following Wellington's orders not to engage, Beresford considered his withdrawal somewhat premature and thought Long could have delayed the French by forcing them to deploy.|$|E
5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just {{for the pleasure of}} brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> {{had fallen in love with}} Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E

Chandler proposes to Monica, who says yes even though her ex-boyfriend Richard confesses his love for her.|$|E
5|$|Khrimian {{was born}} in the Aygestan (Aikesdan) quarter of Van. His father, a weaver, died when Mkrtich was a child and he was brought up by his uncle, Khachatur, a merchant. The root of his last name, Khrim, is the Armenian {{language}} term for Crimea, suggests a link his family had with the peninsula. He received informal education at parochial schools of Lim and Ktuts islands in Lake Van and Varagavank, where he studied classical Armenian, history, and ecclesiastical literature. Upon returning to Van in 1842, he embarked on a journey across the region and made a pilgrimage to Etchmiadzin, the center of the Armenian Church. Khrimian wished to continue his education at a European university, but this desire was never <b>realized.</b> <b>He</b> lived in Constantinople from 1844 to 1846 where he made connections with Armenian intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev greatly {{improved}} relations with Yugoslavia, {{which had been}} entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> could not control Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did {{everything he could to}} make the Soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the Informbiro period in Soviet-Yugoslav relations. During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention. Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia's liberal version of communism, and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.|$|E

5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing {{was written}} by A. S. Neill and {{published}} by Hart Publishing Company in 1960. In a letter to Neill, New York publisher Harold Hart suggested a book specific for America devised of parts from four of Neill's previous works: The Problem Child, The Problem Parent, The Free Child, and That Dreadful School. Neill liked his idea and gave the publisher wide liberties in the manuscript's preparation, preferring to write a preface or appendix in reflection on the writings. In rereading his work, he <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> disagreed with his earlier statements on Freudian child analysis. Neill later regretted the liberties he afforded the publisher, particularly his removal of Wilheim Reich's name from the book and index, since Neill saw Reich as an influential figure. They also struggled over issues of copyrights. Neill did not contest his disagreements, as {{he was eager to}} see the book published.|$|E

Also around sunset, Diana turned about in an attempt to avoid being trapped in the shallows of the creek. However, Lieutenant Graves <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> would require assistance, and raised a signal. Vice-Admiral Graves ordered barges manned by marines into the creek to tow Diana out, along with the sloop Britannia, tender of HMS Somerset (under the command of another of Graves nephews, Lieutenant John Graves) to assist and provide additional firepower.|$|E
