50|$|In December 1989 in the {{euphoria}} {{after the fall}} of the Berlin Wall the section from Ilsenburg to Stapelburg was reopened. In the years that followed there was and intensive debate about reconnecting lines between Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt in the North Harz region. It was soon clear that the federal government and the railway authorities only wanted to fund one link at the time. The old goods line was however unsuitable for regional services, the inclines near and Bad Harzburg and the change of <b>running</b> <b>direction</b> there were major drawbacks for goods traffic. As a result, it was decided to create a new route that started in front of Stapelburg on the line from Ilsenburg and rejoined the line to Vienenburg in Saxony-Anhalt. That also meant that the construction work in Lower Saxony could be viewed by the planning authorities as the renovation of an existing line which enabled the installation of level crossings On 12 April 1995 the Ilsenburg-Stapelburg line was closed again and, on 2 June 1996, the new link was taken into service. Stapelburg was given a railway connexion for the third time with a new halt.|$|E

50|$|The main {{sphere of}} {{operations}} for the T 12 was the Berlin area, where it worked the city network, ring railway and suburban lines as a predecessor of electric S-Bahn traction. The engines had to be capable of rapid acceleration when in charge of compartment coach trains in order to achieve acceptable journey times, due to the short distances between stations on some routes. The T 12 was therefore a very powerful locomotive with strong acceleration in both <b>running</b> <b>directions.</b> In 1921 a follow-on order of 40 locomotives was built by Borsig, because the fleet was not large enough. After the electrification of much of the S-Bahn network between 1924 and 1929 the locomotives were switched to normal passenger and goods train services and shunting.|$|R

40|$|Different {{types of}} track {{infrastructure}} {{can be found}} along railway lines. Separation zones between these different types of structures {{are the source of}} a lot of problems. Transition zones on a railway line represent a gradual solution for the problems between conventional railway structure and singular structures located at different points along the line. The different nature, positioning and geometry used with the materials generate changes in the stiffness on both sides of these singular zones leading to an increase in wear and a loss of geometry, with the associated maintenance costs. This article describes the use of mathematical modelling to represent the behaviour of these zones as a function of train <b>running</b> <b>direction</b> and track supports. Available research into transition zones has not studied these separation points where high increases in load are generated for very short periods of time. Finite elements are used to model two types of track (conventional ballasted track and slab track), using a vehicle to dynamically simulate the behaviour in these zones as a function of train <b>running</b> <b>direction</b> and the position of track supports. The magnitudes analysed were the vertical stresses and the vertical displacements under the sleepers and the supports in both types of structure. The results show increased stresses at the separation zone between both structures which varied in magnitude and position depending most of track supports’ location than the train <b>running</b> <b>direction.</b> Railway Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the kinematics of skilled and non-skilled players in dribbling motion: cross-over and inside-out dribbles, which are frequently-used in basketball games. The subjects were three male skilled varsity players and seven male ordinary collegiate players. They performed dodging poles with four types dribbling motion. The motion of the subjects was videotaped from one step before and after the switching step, step to change <b>running</b> <b>direction.</b> The skilled players could be characterised by the continuous acceleration of the CG throughout the cutting phase and the large approach velocity to the poles. These results imply that the skilled players moved so that a defensive player would be unable to predict the change in the <b>running</b> <b>direction</b> and follow the motion of the skilled player. KEY WORDS: three-dimensional motion analysis, switching step, direction change angle INTRODUCTION: In basketball, a dribble motion is one of the most frequently-used techniques to carry a ball and for an offensive player to get a head of a defensive player or to dodge with a cutting motion.

40|$|Contemporary {{railway traffic}} {{requires}} different train services {{share the same}} infrastructure. Capacity consumption together with the homogeneous level of train traffic gives {{a picture of the}} efficient use of infrastructure. Previous research suggests that the utilization is more efficient with a homogeneous operating program. During last decades, many researchers tried to describe and/or define the homogeneity of operating programs in rail service; however, no definition considered the infrastructure occupation. In addition, several methods were developed to evaluate the homogeneity in railway operation considering variations in speed, running time and headway. But, the occupancy of infrastructure has not been discussed in the existing methods. An extension of existing definitions is presented {{from the perspective of the}} infrastructure, which can be characterized by variations in blocking time, buffer time and <b>running</b> <b>direction.</b> The blocking time, buffer time and <b>running</b> <b>direction</b> describe the occupancy of train path on track sections based on the blocking time model. Accordingly, the homogeneity of operating programs is evaluated through three parameters, namely the homogeneity of blocking time (HBL), the homogeneity of buffer time (HBU) and the homogeneity of <b>running</b> <b>direction</b> (HRD). The overall homogeneity (OH) combined HBL; HBU and HRD to realize an integrity evaluation of homogeneity of operating programs. The results show that this new methodology can quantify the homogeneity of railway operations, not only for track sections but for an entire network, which contributes significantly to the efficient utilization of infrastructure. With the method developed in this thesis, the interrelationship between homogeneity of operating programs and operation quality were investigated quantitatively. Firstly, both the influence of each parameter of homogeneity and the overall homogeneity were analyzed. The operation quality (delay-coefficient) is evaluated for timetables with different train types, arrangements of buffer times and sequences of train runs. The results show that the operation quality deteriorates with less homogeneous timetables, in which the variation in buffer time has a more significant influence. Finally, the influence of homogeneity of operating programs is studied for different traffic flows. The low traffic flow is more sensitive to the homogeneity of buffer time and the homogeneity of blocking time is more significant for high traffic flow...|$|E
