5|$|In 2006, Butler {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} computer tomography scans {{of the juvenile}} skull SAM-PK-K10487. To the surprise of these researchers, <b>replacement</b> teeth yet to erupt were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that tooth <b>replacement</b> must have occurred since the juvenile displayed the same tooth morphology as adult individuals – this morphology would have changed if the tooth simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler and colleagues suggested that tooth <b>replacement</b> in Heterodontosaurus must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted <b>replacement</b> teeth in Heterodontosaurus were not discovered until 2011, when Norman and colleagues described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted <b>replacement</b> teeth. As shown by these discoveries, tooth <b>replacement</b> in Heterodontosaurus was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical tooth morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of {{the upper and lower}} jaws.|$|E

5|$|The Washington State Transportation Commission began seeking {{alternatives}} for the bridge <b>replacement</b> project in 1997, including a Sand Point crossing and various designs for a parallel <b>replacement</b> span.

The project's preferred alternative, a <b>replacement</b> span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, {{was chosen by}} WSDOT in 2011. The $4.56 billion megaproject, which encompasses the SR520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state gas tax and electronic tolls on the floating bridge introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay construction bonds over a 40-year period.|$|E

5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone <b>replacement</b> therapy.

Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone.

40|$|Bioisosteric <b>replacements</b> and {{scaffold}} hopping play {{an important}} role in modern drug discovery and design, as they enable the change of either a core scaffold or substitutes in a drug structure, thereby facilitating optimization of pharmacokinetic properties and patenting, while the drug retains its activity. A new knowledge-based method was developed to obtain bioisosteric or scaffold <b>replacements</b> based on the extensive data existing in the Protein Data Bank. The method uses all-against-all ProBiS-based protein superimposition to identify ligand fragments that overlap in similar binding sites and could therefore be considered as bioisosteric <b>replacements.</b> The method was demonstrated on a specific example of drug candidate – a nanomolar butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor, on which bioisosteric <b>replacements</b> of the three ring fragments were performed. The new molecule containing bioisosteric <b>replacements</b> was evaluated virtually using AutoDock Vina; a similar score for the original and the compound with <b>replacements</b> was obtained, suggesting that the newly designed bioisostere compound might retain the potency of the original inhibitor.
