40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issue of the <b>recurrent</b> <b>tax</b> on {{immovable}} property and its significance in the tax systems of the EU Member States. The <b>recurrent</b> <b>tax</b> on immovable property is classified as property taxes, also according to the international methodology of the classification of taxes. This tax is imposed on the owners (in some cases on the lessee or user) of the immovable property in the various tax jurisdictions and belong to the taxes that the taxpayer cannot avoid and from this perspective it represents a stable source of income for the public budgets of the modern market economies. This paper discusses {{the current state of the}} application of this tax in the tax systems of the Member States with an emphasis on numerical characteristics on the defined timeline. In frame of the analysis of the numerical characteristics there are use the primary sources, which are followed by the interpretation of the calculated results. The theoretical introduction is defining the theoretical basis for the application of this tax in modern tax systems and its conflict {{with the issue of}} double taxation...|$|R

Empirical evidence from a panel of OECD countries This paper examines the relationship between tax structures and economic growth by entering indicators of the tax structure into a set of panel growth regressions for 21 OECD countries, in which both the accumulation of physical and human capital are accounted for. The results of the analysis suggest that income taxes are generally associated with lower economic growth than taxes on consumption and property. More precisely, the findings allow {{the establishment of a}} ranking of tax instruments with respect to their relationship to economic growth. Property taxes, and particularly <b>recurrent</b> <b>taxes</b> on immovable property, seem to be the most growth-friendly, followed by consumption taxes and then by personal income taxes. Corporate income taxes appear to have the most negative effect on GDP per capita. These findings suggest that a revenue-neutral growth-oriented tax reform would be to shift part of the revenue base towards recurrent property and consumption taxes and away from income taxes, especially corporate taxes. There is also evidence of a negative relationship between the progressivity of personal income taxes and growth. All of the results are robust to a number of different specifications, including controlling for other determinants of economic growth and instrumenting tax indicators...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with tax shifting and capitalisation of <b>recurrent</b> <b>taxes</b> on immovable property, known as business rates in the United Kingdom and payable by occupiers of business property. The empirical research seeks to identify to what extent business rates are transferred into rents and thus capitalised. If the tax is capitalised, then freehold owners will {{bear the burden of}} the tax. If not, the tax may be shifted in some other way, for example, reducing the occupiers' profits or increasing the prices charged to customers. The extent of any tax shifting will be affected by the value of any benefits received by the occupier in exchange for the tax paid. Previous studies of business property tax incidence in the UK have met with mixed results and problems of poor and inadequate data have hampered research efforts. In this work particular emphasis has been given to detailed data collection, which has been carried out in the field at the property unit level and, by using this meticulous approach, it was possible to control for data issues that have confounded earlier studies. The empirical research is based on data collected for business properties in six London boroughs. Matched pair data has been collected for industrial, retail and office property. The study takes advantage of a one-off historic situation that existed before the introduction of the Uniform Business Rate in 1990. At that time, large differences in the property tax burden existed between many local authority areas and these differentials had been present for several years. The chief hypothesis predicts that property values will gradually adjust so that total occupation costs between matched pairs of properties will be equalised over time. The results of the empirical study confirm the hypothesis and show that total occupation costs do tend to be equalised in the long term. The results justify the painstaking approach to data collection that was {{an important part of the}} overall research design...|$|E

The study reveals that the current objection mechanism leads to increasing {{the time needed to}} settle the objections. It shows that the objections in general take 1117 days on average to be settled. The study finds Zakat objections require more time for settlement (1338 days) comparing with tax objections (844 days). This finding reflects the fact that the Zakat objection settlement requires reviewing many different Islamic constitutional approaches that could be applicable to it. The study also shows that the average amount of the objections reviewed by the First Instance Committee reaches 48, 479, 878 Saudi Riyals. This shows the importance of quick settlement of these objections to expedite benefiting from potentially large outstanding amounts. In addition, the study shows that the most recurring Zakat objection items are as follows: investments, provisions and allowances, administrative and general expenses, fixed assets and depreciation and loss carry forward respectively. On the other hand, the most <b>recurrent</b> <b>tax</b> objection items are related to: head office expenses and technical services performed abroad, pension expenses paid abroad, administrative and general expenses, employees’ benefits and revenue recognition respectively. The results of this study stress the importance of improving the objection mechanism in order to expedite the objection settlement. The results could open the door to future research aiming at formulating suitable treatments for the most recurring objections. In addition, the findings should appeal to Zakat and tax authorities, in that the evidence presented in this study will help Zakat and tax authorities in their efforts to enhance the objection process in its procedural and objective aspects...|$|R

40|$|Cilj rada je razmotriti osnovna obilježja poreza na vlasništvo nad nekretninama, analizirati važnost ovog poreznog oblika u poreznim sustavima zemalja članica Europske unije (EU) te dati usporedni prikaz njegove primjene po zemljama članicama EU (EU- 28). Također, u radu se razmatraju i efekti uvođenja i primjene ovog poreznog oblika u Hrvatskoj. Provedena analiza ukazuje na značajne razlike u prihodnom potencijalu ovog poreznog oblika između novih zemalja članica (EU- 10) i zemalja koje su postale članicama prije 2004. godine (EU- 17). Prihodi od periodičkog poreza na nekretnine čine u prosjeku 0, 5 posto BDP-a (1, 7 posto ukupnih poreznih prihoda) EU- 10, dok na razini EU- 17 oni čine 1, 0 posto BDP-a (2, 5 posto ukupnih poreznih prihoda). Na temelju usporednog pregleda predmeta oporezivanja, načina utvrđivanja porezne osnovice, poreznih stopa te poreznih olakšica i izuzeća po zemljama članicama Europske Unije (uključujući i Hrvatsku), vidljivo je kako je u većini zemalja članica EU porez na nekretnine izvor proračuna lokalnih vlasti koje ujedno određuju i visinu poreza. U radu se zaključuje kako bi prilikom provođenja poreznih reformi koje uključuju i reforme poreza na nekretnine, valjalo voditi računa o specifi čnosti poreznog sustava pojedine zemlje. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{consider}} the main features of immovable property tax, the arguments for using real property taxation and to give a survey of recurrent property tax regimes across EU countries. Recent empirical studies have identifi ed taxes on real estate property as least detrimental to GDP growth. In line with these results the Council of Europe invites Member States to review their tax systems, shifting tax intensity from labour taxes towards taxes on consumption and property. However, when interpreting aforementioned results, we should take into account the fact that these fi ndings are based on a sample of OECD countries whose tax systems are traditionally based on the taxation of income, profi ts and property. In contrast, tax structure in Croatia is rather different. Croatian tax system is predominantly based on consumption taxation. The most abundant source of budget revenues is Value Added Tax – VAT which accounts for 60 % of total tax revenues of government budget revenues, followed by special taxes and excise (18. 3 % of total government budget revenues). The one part of the paper is dedicated to the analysis of importance of recurrent tax on real estate property across EU member states. The importance is measured by the share of the revenues of recurrent property taxes in the total governmental revenues and in the GDP. The results of the analysis indicate that there is a signifi cant gap between the new EU countries (EU- 10) and the old member states (EU- 17) in terms of <b>recurrent</b> <b>taxes</b> on property in GDP and in total tax revenues. In 2011 the average for EU- 10 countries was around 0. 5 % in GDP (1. 7 % total tax revenues) vs 2. 0 % GDP average for EU- 17 countries (2. 5 % of the total tax revenues). In addition, this paper examines the application of recurrent property tax in the EU Countries. The research leads to the conclusion that in most of the EU member states the recurrent property tax is a local tax and it is typically levied at the sub-central level. On the other hand, objects taxable with recurrent property tax, tax rates, procedure for setting tax rates, tax reliefs and exemptions signifi cantly differ in the EU member states. Each country has a different defi nition of real estate property, different approach on real property value and taxation...|$|E

This paper examines the various bases of value on which this tax is assessed internationally then focuses on the valuation of land, being the dominant basis of value used to assess this tax in Australia.

It demonstrates the challenges of using value as the base of this tax and in particular land or site value used in Australia. The paper concludes that while issues exist in the determination of any basis of value, the practices of valuers are most important in the determination of a consistent and neutral base on which to assess the tax...|$|R

40|$|The {{conflict}} between the need to attend to acute poverty {{in the present and}} the need to invest in longer-term poverty-reducing economic growth is a primary feature of the South African public policy landscape. Economic growth rates, while not alarmingly low (3. 4 % on average, annually, between 2000 and 2012, 1 % from 2007 - 2012), have also not been sufficiently high or reflective of the type of growth needed to fuel job creation. On income, the economy’s classification as an upper-middle income country, based simply on a GNI per capita measure, obscures {{the extent to which it}} is structured into two nearly distinct and large sub-economies – one resembling that of a high income country, the other among the poorest in the world. Furthermore, with South Africa’s tax burden already high – at 26. 1 %, it is among the 10 % highest figures internationally – the financing of increasingly costly redistributive and growth programs is less likely to be achieved through rate increases in taxes on current income or consumption. Recognizing the need to identify alternative financing vehicles, the Minister of Finance established the Davis Tax Committee to, in large part, explore the implications of changes to the tax structure on growth, poverty, and income distribution. 2 This first in a series of policy notes on tax topics focuses on the <b>recurrent</b> property <b>tax</b> [...] how its use, in combination with changes in other tax levers, may interact with economic growth and poverty outcomes. In particular the use of a tax on “excess property ” (which conceptually may be extended to non-productive assets, in general) is found to be an effective tool for generating public revenue, is expected to induce a shift of such assets into growth-promoting activities, has little impact on future economic behaviour, and is generally non-regressive.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between conceptions of status and processes of militarization of peasants in the medieval and early-modern society. In an initial overview we see how many revolts in western Europe in late middle ages were connected to an increased military participation of peasant groups. After 1500 similar processes {{can be found in}} the east european frontier regions. Economic rights, tax privileges, political and legal competences, a ”peasant gentry” status, antiaristocratic sentiments - were issues of status which often were raised. These patterns are also found in the border region between Denmark and Sweden around 1500. The peasantry was drawn into <b>recurrent</b> levies, and <b>tax</b> exemptions developed. In several larger rebellions the issues of the right to be armed, of taxes/exemptions and anti-aristocratism were central, and several political/legal competences of the peasantry were temporarily strengthened. The tensions regarding status around 1500 could involve material manifestations of status as well. In at least one revolt in the region, also the right to lavish buildings and clothing was defended. In many ways revolts were about status, and military participance could in some contexts highten the status of peasant groups, but we also have to understand status in a broader way...|$|R
40|$|Efforts to {{increase}} the responsiveness and accountability of local governments [...] as well as fiscal constraints at the central level [...] have prompted an interest in reviving the urban property tax as {{a major source of}} municipal revenue. At present, the urban property tax is the most widely used municipal tax instrument in the developing world, but typically accounts for less than half of municipal <b>recurrent</b> revenues. Property <b>tax</b> yields can be increased by either increasing tax rates or reducing losses arising from evasion and maladministration. In the case of the property tax, there is a strong argument for beginning with the latter. Efforts {{to increase}} rates alone would exaggerate the inequities arising from existing maladministration, placing the burden of the increase on those who already pay their fair share, whereas improvements in administration place the burden on those who evade. A focus on administration achieves the objectives of increasing revenue while improving fairness. Brazil's experience with urban property taxation yields several generalizable lessons on both the practice of property tax administration and the process of implementing administrative reforms. Brazilian municipalities have found solutions [...] wholly or partly successful [...] to the following problems confronting property taxation: (a) rapid urban growth; (b) scarcity of skills; (c) inaccessible market data; (d) inflation; (e) disputed liability; and (f) slow judicial procedures.
