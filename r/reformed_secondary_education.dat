40|$|The chaotic {{condition}} {{of the school system}} was an unfortunate legacy bequeathed to the Slovene system by Austria. The two classical languages were under the same pressure as ever, with the amount of time allotted to their instruction coming under constant criticism. Soon there emerged ideas about <b>reforming</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education,</b> particularly about its unification for the entire state, with the chief initiative coming from the Minister of Education, Svetozar Pribièeviè. The <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> <b>reform</b> began to be implemented in 1924, following numerous political changes, replacements, and heated debates on the issue. The classical gymnasiums (Slovenia had three at the time, one in Ljubljana, one in Maribor, and a private (episcopal) institution at Šentvid by Ljubljana) were not affected by these changes. Their implications, however, were more serious for Latin instruction at the so-called "Realgymnasiums" (i. e. gymnasiums with an emphasis on the modern languages or mathematics and the sciences), which was reduced in favour of lessons in the mother tongue, history, and French. These conditions were maintained (with occasional temporary modifications) until the end of World War II...|$|R

50|$|The {{system of}} {{academic}} degrees and the cours supérieurs was organised in the organic law of 23 July 1848: the Athénée would provide cours supérieurs, {{preparing for the}} degree of candidat (obtainable after only one year) in physical sciences and mathematics on the one hand, and in philosophy and letters on the other. Degrees were to be awarded by examination juries in Luxembourg. Qualifications obtained elsewhere were not recognised in the Grand Duchy. The law did, however, oblige students to take courses at foreign universities, the contents {{of which would be}} tested by Luxembourgish juries. The law of 1848 was continually adapted over the next half-century. These changes, accompanied by passionate debates, concerned the subject matter to be examined, the creation of new degrees for certain professions, and an adaptation to the realities of university education: there were cases where the state prescribed the attendance of courses that were no longer offered anywhere. From 1882, the need to <b>reform</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> set off an argument over the nature, and indeed the purpose, of the cours supérieurs. The Council of State was against abolishing them, as this would entail a reform of the law on academic awards. The debate was to flare up again in the early 20th century, but national sentiment prevailed: abandoning the cours supérieurs, and the end of awarding degrees, would mean abandoning a part of the Luxembourgish nation's independence.|$|R

The study identified three types of teachers, with different emotional profiles, who were able to properly manage curricular reform in the Chinese context. Subsequently, the same authors Yin and Lee (2012) explored the emotional rules that govern the work of Chinese teachers and showed that there were four rules that govern their feelings and emotional expressions: a commitment to teach with passion, hiding negative emotions, keeping negative emotions in check, and manipulating (managing) emotions to achieve teaching objectives.|$|R

While attention is paid to the results of critical thinking tests and excerpts extracted from the students' dialogues, the research also seeks to highlight the role of the teacher in breaking stalemates in discussion with appropriate interventions. In sum, this article concludes by illustrating the importance of collaborative group work in the development of students' critical thinking skills. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some problems}} in innovating {{in the context}} of the school system in Catalonia and Italy. The process leading to <b>reform</b> of <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> is briefly described. The issue of teachers' interpretations and reactions to the guidelines of reforms and innovations is focused on. For basic science education, two specific innovative teaching proposals about Energy and Motion/Force are briefly described, together with a study of teachers' interpretations of their rationale and guidelines. The main transfornzing trends of these interpretations are discussed: these indicate that since teachers are main actors in the school innovation process, unless they internalise the proposed approaches, no real, successful implemetation in classroom practice will take place. Finally, some guidelines and recommendations are suggested, which will interest education policy makers and teacher education agencies...|$|R
