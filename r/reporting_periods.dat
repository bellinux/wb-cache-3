2500|$|Suncor {{invested}} $1.2 {{billion in}} their Tailings Reduction Operations (TROTM) method [...] that treats mature fine tails (MFT) from tailings ponds with chemical flocculant, an anionic Polyacrylamide, {{commonly used in}} water treatment plants to improve removal of total organic content (TOC), to speed their drying into more easily reclaimable matter. Mature tailings dredged from a pond bottom in suspension were mixed with a polymer flocculant and spread over a [...] "beach" [...] with a shallow grade where the tailings would dewater and dry under ambient conditions. The dried MFT can then be reclaimed in place or moved to another location for final reclamation. Suncor hoped this would reduce the time for water reclamation from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being recycled into the oil sands plant. Suncor claimed the mature fines tailings process would {{reduce the number of}} tailing ponds and shorten the time to reclaim a tailing pond from 40 years at present to 7–10 years, with land rehabilitation continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations. For the <b>reporting</b> <b>periods</b> from 2010 to 2012, Suncor had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance from this technology.|$|E
