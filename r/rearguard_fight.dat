60|$|It {{was obvious}} that Adam knew the family history, for Christopher Askew was a {{turbulent}} Jacobite who lost the most part of his estate when he joined Prince Charlie's starving Highlanders in the <b>rearguard</b> <b>fight</b> at Clifton Moor. Afterwards the sober quietness at Ashness had now and then been disturbed by an Askew who inherited the first Kit's reckless temperament.|$|E
50|$|The losses {{remained}} {{high in the}} Allied {{forces as}} well as in the retired German army. <b>Rearguard</b> <b>fights</b> took place at Ypres, Courtrai, Selle, Valenciennes, the Sambre and at Mons. As a result, the forces of the Entente could enter Germany.|$|R
50|$|The corps {{was later}} engaged at Bloody Pond and {{assisted}} Breckinridge's Reserve Corps in the <b>rearguard.</b> <b>Fighting</b> at Corinth, the corps served successfully {{for a few}} more months until the four corps of the Army of the Mississippi were consolidated and the corps discontinued. The brigades which made up the corps later constituted a division under Simon Buckner, and then more famously, Patrick Cleburne.|$|R
25|$|Kimura {{accepted}} that his forces stood little chance against the numerically and materially superior Allies in open terrain. He therefore intended {{that while the}} Twenty-Eighth Army defended the coastal Arakan Province, relying on the difficult terrain to slow the Allied advances, and the Thirty-Third Army continued to <b>fight</b> <b>rearguard</b> actions against the American and Chinese forces which were trying to open a land route from India to China, the Fifteenth Army would withdraw behind the Irrawaddy River. He hoped that the Allies would be overstretched trying to overcome this obstacle, perhaps {{to the point where}} the Japanese might even attempt a counteroffensive.|$|R
2500|$|Feisal's 4,000 {{strong force}} {{including}} Nuri esh Shalaan's camel force made a forced march overnight on 26/27 September, crossing the railway north of Deraa and tearing up rails {{to arrive at}} Sheikh Sa'd [...] north north-west of Deraa, at dawn on 27 September. Auda abu Tayi captured a train and 200 prisoners at Ghazale Station, while Talal took Izra' a few miles to the north. They captured a total of 2,000 prisoners between noon on 26 September and noon on 27 September, when the Anazeh an Arab tribal confederation, attacked the <b>rearguard</b> defending Deraa. <b>Fighting</b> in the town continued into the night.|$|R

2500|$|Miyazaki's {{detachment}} {{continued to}} <b>fight</b> <b>rearguard</b> actions and demolish bridges {{along the road}} to Imphal, but was eventually driven off the road and forced to retreat eastwards. The remainder of the Japanese division retreated painfully south but found very little to eat, as most of what few supplies had been brought forward across the Chindwin had been consumed by other Japanese units, who were as desperately hungry as Sato's men. Many of the 31st Division were too enfeebled to drag themselves further south than Ukhrul (near the Sangshak battlefield), where hospitals had been set up, but with no medicines, medical staff or food, or Humine [...] south of Ukhrul, where Sato vainly hoped to find supplies.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle of}} Kohima {{took place in}} two stages. From 3 to 16 April 1944, the Japanese 31st Division {{attempted}} to capture Kohima ridge, a feature which dominated the road from Dimapur to Imphal on which IV Corps at Imphal depended for supply. On 16 April the small British force at Kohima was relieved, and from 18 April to 16 May the newly arrived Indian XXXIII Corps counter-attacked to drive the Japanese from the positions they had captured. At this point, with the Japanese starving, Lieutenant General Kōtoku Satō ordered his division to withdraw. Although a detachment continued to <b>fight</b> <b>rearguard</b> actions to block the road, XXXIII Corps drove south to link up with the defenders of Imphal on 22 June.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{following}} days Gough detached himself from Allenby's command and linked up with Haig's I Corps on the BEF's right. Gough's {{version of events}} {{was that he had}} become dissatisfied with Allenby on 24 August after his retreat exposed Fergusson’s 5th Infantry Division to German attack on its left flank, requiring 2nd Cavalry Brigade to mount a charge and Gough's 3rd Brigade, which was to have been the <b>rearguard,</b> to <b>fight</b> dismounted. After the Germans fell back, Gough was able to resume the planned retreat, only to find that Allenby had sent the division transport, containing food, ammunition and maps, far into the rear. Gough later claimed (in The Fifth Army) that Allenby had been [...] "mesmerised" [...] by the enemy during an engagement at Solesmes on 25 August. Gough may also have been panicking, telling another officer that the British were [...] "surrounded" [...] and that the Germans were already in Amiens - southwest of the BEF's present position. Allenby publicly laughed this episode off as [...] "only Gough's little way" [...] but was privately furious both at Gough's behaviour and at the way it was tolerated by French and Haig. Relations between Allenby and Gough were strained thereafter.|$|R
2500|$|As the {{remnants}} of the Ottoman Fourth Army retreated northward via Deraa they were pursued over [...] "many waterless miles", by Arab forces which [...] "joined Feisal's force, with horrific consequences." [...] Three quarters of Prince Feisal's 4,000 strong force including Nuri esh Shalaan's camel force, were irregulars. They had made a forced march overnight on 26/27 September, crossing the railway north of Deraa and tearing up rails to arrive at Sheikh Sa'd [...] north northwest of Deraa, at dawn on 27 September. Auda abu Tayi captured a train and 200 prisoners at Ghazale Station, while Talal took Izra' a few miles to the north. A total of 2,000 prisoners were captured between noon on 26 September and noon on 27 September, when the Anazeh, an Arab tribal confederation attacked the <b>rearguard</b> defending Deraa. <b>Fighting</b> in the town continued into the night.|$|R
50|$|Some hours later, the Prussians and Austrians {{discovered}} the retreat {{and started to}} pursue.This withdrawal to Als and Dybbøl has gone down in Danish history {{as one of the}} worst that Danish soldiers have been exposed to. Some of them compared it to Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. It was northwards in a north gale with driven snow, and most of the soldiers had had no rest for the last four days and nights:image. The march was burdened with artillery guns and supply carts and had to be as slow as its slowest component. Men and horses had trouble standing. Horses could not carry or pull their loads properly because of the snow and ice; riders had to dismount and lead their horses. Artillery guns and carts overturned. The column of men and horses and vehicles seemed endless. The army had to march from the Danevirke to Flensburg, which took about 14-18 hours. (Schleswig (town) by the east end of the Danevirke is 20 miles from Flensburg as the crow flies, but further by road, plus getting from their positions to Schleswig town first.) They also had to <b>fight</b> <b>rearguard</b> against pursuing Prussians and Austrians. Some men in sight of Flensburg and thankful for the coming rest were ordered to stop or go back to man checkpoints. Many men were missing at the roll call, and it was thought that the many Schleswig men among the soldiers would desert the march on the way and go home; but most of them came in that morning or the next morning.|$|R
