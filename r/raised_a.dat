40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{data from}} the Public Concern at Work advice line in the UK, to find out to what extent trade unions are recipients of whistleblower concerns, and whether <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> concern with a trade union is successful. We consider that successful whistleblowing involves both {{where it has been}} safe for the whistleblower and effective in stopping wrongdoing. Our findings show that trade unions are not the first choice recipient for workers who want to <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> concern about wrongdoing. Workers tend to <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> concern with other recipients first, if they raise their concern at all with a union. Our findings suggest that it is safer for <b>a</b> whistleblower to <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> concern with a union than it is with other recipients. However, our findings also suggest that <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> concern with a union is less effective in stopping wrongdoing than using other external or internal recipients...|$|R
