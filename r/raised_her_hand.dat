5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in his defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member}} of the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the semifinals}} of the 2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's {{serve in the}} third set, Henin <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to {{indicate}} she {{was not ready to}} receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the 2010 Australian Open where Williams won in three sets, earning her 12th Grand Slam title.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 656, {{finding the}} gate of Uthman's house {{strongly}} guarded by his supporters, the Egyptian rebels climbed the back wall and crept inside, leaving the guards on the gate unaware {{of what was going}} on inside. The rebels entered his room and struck blows at his head. Naila, the wife of Uthman, threw herself on his body to protect him and <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to deflect a sword. She had her fingers chopped off and was pushed aside. The next blow killed Uthman. Some of Uthman's slaves counter-attacked, one of whom killed the assassin and was in turn killed by the rebels.|$|E

25|$|Less {{than two}} months after the murder of Dawn Basom, on June 9, three teenage boys {{discovered}} a partially nude body of a young woman in a field close to an abandoned farmhouse on North Territorial Road. The victim had received multiple slash and stab wounds to the body (including two stab wounds which had pierced her heart), and a gunshot wound to the forehead before her neck had been cut through to the spine. The victim's right thumb had also received a gunshot wound, suggesting the woman had instinctively <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to protect herself before her killer had fired the gun at point-blank range. She had also been raped, although the pathologist was unable to determine whether this act had occurred before or after death. Sections of her clothing were scattered around her body, although one of her shoes was missing.|$|E
500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station. [...] Cambridge's cox Dowbiggin <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to {{indicate}} {{that she was not}} ready to start just as Umpire Boris Rankov started the race. [...] This allowed Oxford the initiative and they took an early lead. [...] Cambridge slowly edged their way back into contention, and held a half-a-length lead at the two-mile mark. [...] At St Paul's School, Cambridge were two-thirds of a length ahead before a series of oar clashes and umpire warnings forced the boats apart. [...] A larger clash, between Cambridge's Monaghan and Oxford's Smith, took place by Chiswick Eyot before Oxford made the better recovery and quickly pushed out to secure a clear-water lead. [...] Cambridge failed to threaten, and Oxford won by three-and-a-half lengths.|$|E
500|$|Having {{determined}} {{to obtain the}} highest education she could, Stone enrolled at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1839, {{at the age of}} 21. But she was so disappointed in Mary Lyons’ intolerance of antislavery and women’s rights that she withdrew after only one term. The very next month she enrolled at Wesleyan Academy (later Wilbraham & Monson Academy), which she found more to her liking: “It was decided by a large majority in our literary society the other day,” she reported to a brother, “that ladies ought to mingle in politics, go to Congress, etc. etc.” Stone read a newspaper account of how a Connecticut antislavery meeting had denied the right to speak or vote to Abby Kelley, recently hired as an antislavery agent to work in that state. Refusing to relinquish her right, Kelley had defiantly <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> every time a vote was taken. “I admire the calm and noble bearing of Abby K,” Stone wrote to a brother, “and cannot but wish there were more kindred spirits.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A fan of The Oprah Winfrey Show, Sansone {{occasionally}} went to tapings {{with her}} family. [...] In 2002, {{she went to}} the show for her 40th birthday. [...] The show's theme for that day was [...] "How?", about how some mothers with many children were still able to stay in good physical shape. [...] During the audience Q, Sansone was one of the women who <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to speak. [...] She stood up, six months pregnant with her ninth child, and told how she trained with weights and stayed fit. [...] On the spot, Oprah invited her on stage to give her a hug. [...] A few weeks later, one of Oprah's producers called to invite Sansone onto the show as a guest.|$|E
2500|$|Leung's father saw an {{advertisement}} for a Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire casting call, and suggested she should try out. She waited four hours {{in line for a}} five-minute audition, despite feeling she had little likelihood of obtaining the role, Two weeks later, she was called back for a workshop and was cast as Cho Chang, beating out over 3,000 other girls for the part. In retrospect, she stated {{in an interview with the}} Daily Record that her Scottish accent probably gave her an advantage in the casting, as the casting director asked the girls who attended the audition, [...] "Is there anyone here from Scotland?", to which only Leung <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> In a 2011 interview, Leung said her fondest memory of the Harry Potter experience was the first audition, because both her parents, who were separated at the time, went with her. [...] "It was a really nice moment because my parents hadn't seen each other for a long, long time," [...] Leung said. In an effort to heavily promote Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Warner Bros. sent Leung to China in the film's second week of release, which was unusual for a market not used to frequent celebrity visits.|$|E
