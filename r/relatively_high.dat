5|$|Carbon is brittle, and behaves as a {{semiconductor}} in {{a direction}} perpendicular to its planes. Most of its chemistry is nonmetallic; it has a <b>relatively</b> <b>high</b> ionization energy and, compared to most metals, a <b>relatively</b> <b>high</b> electronegativity. Carbon can form anions such as C4− (methanide), C (acetylide) and C (sesquicarbide or allylenide), in compounds with metals of main groups 1–3, and with the lanthanides and actinides. Its oxide CO2 forms carbonic acid H2CO3.|$|E

30|$|XRF {{showed the}} {{presence}} of potassium, calcium, iron, cobalt, and arsenic in all samples, including the book’s paper. Hence, arsenic detected in all textiles is more likely related to the book’s fumigation at some point, rather than the use of sulphuret of arsenic, or orpiment, used as mordant [34]. Cobalt and (partially) potassium {{can be related to}} smalt, a potassium cobalt-containing glass pigment, which could be used as an optical brightener in paper [35]. Relative ratios of these elements were different amongst fabrics. In general, <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> quantities of iron were present in two of the three brown samples; <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> ratios of copper in most of the greens; <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> ratios of calcium and tin in pinks and reds; and <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> ratios of zinc in purples.|$|R
40|$|The urban political-economy {{perspective}} {{contends that}} the actions of elites have made certain neigh-bourhoods susceptible to deleterious conditions. We draw on this logic to argue neighbourhoods that are winners of {{the political economy of}} place are rewarded with <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> levels of home mortgage lending and thus enjoy lower levels of homicide. Neighbourhoods that are the losers of the political economy receive relatively little bank lending and have <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> levels of ho-micide. We find that Chicago neighbourhoods during the mid- 1990 s experience lower homicide per capita rates if banks have awarded them <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> home mortgage loan dollars and they are surrounded by <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> infusions of home mortgage loan dollars. Results underscore the importance of economic elites in providing resources like home mortgage lending capital to neighbourhoods...|$|R

40|$|The {{variability}} of input parameters {{is the most}} important source of overall model uncertainty. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the variability is essential for uncertainty analysis of stormwater quality model outputs. This paper presents the outcomes of a research study which investigated the {{variability of}} pollutants build-up characteristics on road surfaces in residential, commercial and industrial land uses. It was found that build-up characteristics vary highly even within the same land use. Additionally, industrial land use showed <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> variability of maximum build-up, build-up rate and particle size distribution, whilst the commercial land use displayed a <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> variability of pollutant-solid ratio. Among the various build-up parameters analysed, D 50 (volume-median-diameter) displayed the <b>relatively</b> <b>highest</b> variability for all three land uses...|$|R
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} <b>relatively</b> <b>high</b> {{dependency}} ratio {{and the slow}} demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by the <b>relatively</b> <b>high</b> prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E
