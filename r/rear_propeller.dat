25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 30 May 1939 {{powered by}} two Walter Sagitta I-SR air cooled vee piston engines. The trial flights identified {{problems with the}} cooling of the rear engine and general engine performance. It was proposed to use Rolls-Royce or Daimler-Benz engines in the production aircraft. Concerns were also raised about the pilot clearing the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> {{if he had to}} bail out and an ejector seat was studied. As a provisional solution, rails were put {{on both sides of the}} forward fuselage for the Fokker test pilot, Gerben Sonderman, to use to bail out in an emergency. The aircraft was flown 11 times for a total flight time of less than four hours. The rear fuselage paneling was modified significantly before the last few flights in an attempt to address chronic rear engine cooling problems. On the 11th flight in April, the undercarriage was damaged, and the programme was abandoned in May 1940 when the German forces invaded the Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes did {{not follow}} the agreed testing program and {{communications}} protocol, and remained airborne almost {{twice as long as}} planned. An hour into the flight (after onboard recording cameras had run out of film), a leak caused the right-hand propeller controls to lose their effectiveness and the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> subsequently reversed its pitch, disrupting that engine's thrust, which caused the aircraft to yaw hard to the right. The USAAF account said that, [...] "It appeared that loss of hydraulic fluid caused failure of the pitch change mechanism of right <b>rear</b> <b>propeller.</b> Mr. Hughes maintained full power of right engine and reduced that of left engine instead of trying to fly with right propeller windmilling without power. It was Wright Field's understanding that the crash was attributed to pilot error." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Tandem Twin {{was another}} early {{example of a}} twin engine aircraft. It was built for Francis McClean, using parts of S.27. fitted with a short nacelle {{on top of the}} lower wing with a [...] Gnome Omega at either end, access to the cockpit being via a hole in the nacelle floor. [...] Tail {{surfaces}} were modified by the addition of an extra pair of rectangular rudders above the tailplane. It was first flown by McClean on 29 October 1911. with equal-span wings: extensions were later fitted to the upper wing. The aircraft suffered from stability problems due to insufficient aileron control and unpredictable variations caused by the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> working {{in the wake of the}} front one. [...] It was lent to the RNAS for pilot training and was eventually crashed by Samson. [...] The aircraft was given the nicknames the Vacuum Cleaner and [...] the Gnome Sandwich.|$|E
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of tests of full-scale propellers made in the 20 -foot propeller-research tunnel (PRT) at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. The power coefficients of all dual-rotating propellers in the report represent the sum of the power coefficients of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>propellers</b> and are for the test conditions in which blade angles of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>propellers</b> were set to absorb approximately equal power at peak efficiency only...|$|R
50|$|The HB.5's four water-cooled, nine-cylinder Salmson 9Z radial engines were mounted as push-pill pairs {{with each}} pair sharing a single nacelle placed midway between the centre section wings on {{a frame of}} {{horizontal}} members and diagonal struts, tied to the inner interplane struts and the centre section V-struts. The 3.40 m interplane gap allowed the <b>rear</b> <b>propellers</b> to turn between the wings; the tractor pairs were {{just ahead of the}} wing leading edge. 1000 L of fuel was equally distributed between four fuselage tanks.|$|R
50|$|The {{so-called}} push/pull layout, {{combining the}} tractor and pusher configurations — that is, {{with one or}} more propellers facing forward and one or more others facing back — was another idea that continues to be used from time to time as a means of reducing the asymmetric effects of an outboard engine failure, such as on the Farman F.222, but at the cost of a severely reduced efficiency on the <b>rear</b> <b>propellers,</b> which were often smaller and attached to lower-powered engines as a result.|$|R
5000|$|..... {{and this}} was {{transmitted}} to the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> (which was rotating in the opposite direction) through the transitional bearing mechanism. If this failed the pitch of the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> was no longer under control and might do anything which was potentially dangerous. Quill ...|$|E
5000|$|On December 13, 2007, Toyota Motor Corp {{recalled}} 15,600 4x4 2007 model-year Tundras in the United States {{because a}} <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft joint may fail. [...] "There {{is a possibility}} that a joint in the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft may have been improperly heat treated, resulting in insufficient hardness," [...] Toyota said. Adding, [...] "This may cause a section of the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft to separate at the joint." [...] There has been one reported case of abnormal noises in the affected vehicles. No accidents have been connected to the recall. Tundra owners will be notified beginning in late-December 2007 and are requested to contact their local Toyota dealer for inspection. If the hardness is not correct the dealer will then replace the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after {{entering}} service, the ballonet air-scoop was relocated {{from behind the}} front propeller to behind the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller.</b> This not only improved {{the efficiency of the}} system, but greatly improved the visibility from the front cockpits, making the difficult task of landing the airships slightly easier.|$|E
25|$|The Skymaster's unique {{sound is}} made by its <b>rear</b> pusher <b>propeller</b> slicing through {{turbulent}} air from the front propeller and over the airframe while its front tractor propeller addresses undisturbed air.|$|R
2500|$|Voyager had {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>propellers,</b> powered by {{separate}} engines. It was originally flown on June 22, 1984, powered by Lycoming O-235 engines with fixed-pitch propellers. In November 1985, the aircraft was rolled out, fitted with world-flight engines, an air-cooled Teledyne Continental O-240 {{in the forward}} location and a liquid-cooled Teledyne Continental IOL-200 in the aft location. [...] Both were fitted with wooden, variable-pitch electrically actuated MT-Propellers. [...] The plan was for the rear engine to be operated throughout the flight. The front engine was intended to provide additional power for takeoff and the initial part of the flight at heavy weights.|$|R
5000|$|Concept {{design of}} the present day LCAC {{began in the early}} 1970s with the {{full-scale}} Amphibious Assault Landing Craft (AALC) test vehicle. During the advanced development stage, two prototypes were built. JEFF A was designed and built by Aerojet General in California, with four rotating ducted propellers. JEFF B was designed and built by Bell Aerospace in New Orleans, Louisiana. JEFF B had two ducted <b>rear</b> <b>propellers</b> similar to the proposed SK-10 which was derived from the previous Bell SK-5 / SR.N5 hovercraft tested in Vietnam. These two craft confirmed the technical feasibility and operational capability that ultimately led to the production of LCAC. JEFF B was selected as the design basis for today’s LCAC. [...] The JEFF A was later modified for Arctic use and deployed in Prudhoe Bay to support offshore oil drilling.|$|R
50|$|With {{no common}} {{crankshaft}} {{it became more}} practical {{for all of the}} accessories to be powered by one engine alone, in this case the rear engine. The supercharger itself used up several hundred horsepower, so the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> delivered considerably less power than the front one.|$|E

50|$|In 1930 it was {{refitted}} {{with two}} 600 hp Curtiss Conqueror engines and reinforced for the Chicago Daily News as a cargo plane named The Blue Streak.The aircraft crashed on 26 May, 1931 when the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> driveshaft broke due to vibration and all four on board lost their lives.|$|E
50|$|The Anatra DE was a three-engined {{prototype}} Russian medium bomber of World War I. The biplane bomber {{was designed}} to hold four people. It was planned to use three engines to reach its target, then return using only one engine, having been lightened after dropping its payload. There was a single 140 hp Salmson engine {{at the front of}} the fuselage, and an 80 hp Le Rhône engine on each wing, which turned propellers attached to the rear of the engine, behind the wing. These engines were placed in a pusher configuration, and each wing also had a gun turret one each engine nacelle. In total, the aircraft had three guns, and could carry 400 kg of bombs. The only prototype that was built, weighing 327 kg more than expected, first flew on June 23, 1916. During testing, however, the fuselage and <b>rear</b> <b>propellers</b> became damaged when a tail skid broke, and it became evident that the design needed to be changed; the project was then abandoned.|$|R
50|$|The blended wings {{merge with}} the {{fuselage}} {{into a single}} airfoil to reduce aerodynamic drag, improve fuel economy, and increase flight endurance. Made largely of composites, including epoxy/carbon fiber and fiberglass, the airfoil is rigid, providing structural efficiency and stiffness, reducing materials and manufacturing costs. With net hooks in the nose and a <b>rear</b> push <b>propeller,</b> the craft lands in a mobile retrieval net.|$|R
5000|$|A secret {{training}} facility was located at Fritton Lake during the Second World War. British Valentine Tanks, {{as well as}} American made Sherman tanks were turned into amphibious vehicles by attaching a special collapsible screen made of waterproof canvas. The screen {{was supported by a}} series of rubber air filled tubes, connected to three tubular frames. The tanks were fitted with <b>rear</b> <b>propellers,</b> which provided propulsion when buoyant, and gave them their name [...] "DUPLEX DRIVE" [...] due to the two forms of mobility. Between April 1943 and May 1944 British, American, and Canadian units came to Fritton Lake to be trained in the use of these tanks. On D-Day, 128 out of 240 Duplex Drive Shermans tanks were launched, with 78 of them making it to shore. Many of the losses {{can be attributed to the}} high seas. However a large percentage of the crew survived. The site remained in Military use into the early 1950s as part of the Specialised Armoured Development Establishment during which further amphibious experiments and trials were undertaken.|$|R
50|$|The Ca.1 was a three-engine biplane of fabric-covered wooden construction. It {{had four}} crew members {{in an open}} central nacelle: two pilots, a front gunner, and rear gunner-mechanic, who manned upper machine guns, {{standing}} upon the central engine in a protective cage, {{just in front of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller.</b> The Ca.1 had a tricycle landing gear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cruciform}} tail {{is arranged}} like a cross, {{the most common}} configuration having the horizontal stabilizer intersecting the vertical tail somewhere near the middle. The PBY Catalina uses this configuration. The [...] "push-pull" [...] twin engined Dornier Do 335 World War II German fighter used a cruciform tail consisting of four separate surfaces, arranged in dorsal, ventral, and both horizontal locations, to form its cruciform tail, just forward of the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller.</b>|$|E
50|$|The design {{typically}} has a {{range of}} some 900 km and reaches top speeds of 125 km/h. The standard cruising speed of 70 km/h for tourist flights can be attained using the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> only. Standard operational altitude is 300 m, but up to 2600 m is possible. Their maximum permitted takeoff weight is 10960 kg, with a payload of 1900 kg. A long endurance system can also be installed for extended range and longer flight times.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{designed}} as the Do P.93 for passenger transatlantic service from Lisbon to New York, the Do 214 was re{{designed as}} the P.192 {{for military service}} in early 1940. In 1941, a full-sized fuselage mockup was constructed in order to evaluate the interior layout. The fuselage was streamlined, having a round cross-section, with the interior consisting of two decks. Its wings featured {{a small amount of}} sweep on the leading edge, with straight trailing edges, and were shoulder-mounted on the fuselage. Eight Daimler-Benz DB 613 24-cylinder [...] "power-system" [...] engines — themselves consisting of a pair of Daimler-Benz DB 603 inverted V12 engines, paired up to run a single propeller like the DB 605-based [...] "DB 610" [...] engines of the Heinkel He 177A, and themselves weighing over 1.5 tonnes apiece (the DB 613 [...] "power systems" [...] would have weighed more like 1.8 tonnes apiece) — provided the power, with four tractor engines and four pusher engines. All eight [...] "power system"engines, using a total of 16 DB 603s to complete them, provided power to two quartets of four-blade VDM variable-pitch propellers; the front propellers had a 5.00 m (16 ft 5 in) diameter, the <b>rear</b> <b>propellers</b> had a 4.60 m (15 ft 1 in) diameter.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from its}} <b>rear</b> mounted pusher <b>propeller,</b> shaft driven from a {{centrally}} mounted engine, the W-1 was unusual in other respects. It was an all-metal aircraft; a single bay biplane with constant chord, equal span, unswept and unstaggered wings, braced by parallel interplane struts assisted by flying wires. There were ailerons on both {{upper and lower}} planes, externally connected.|$|R
5000|$|At takeoff {{the pilot}} angles the top rotor flat (zero angle of attack) and spins it to very high speed (between 365 and 425 rpm). [...] The rotor is then {{disconnected}} from the engine and the angle of attack of the main rotor blades is increased suddenly so that the vehicle leaps into the air. The aircraft's main rotor has enough momentum due to heavy counterweights in the tips that it can hover {{for a short time}} safely. The pilot then applies full power to the <b>rear</b> pusher <b>propeller</b> and the vehicle starts to move forwards. As it does so, air is forced through the main rotor, spinning it faster and generating more lift. The vehicle climbs into the air, flying as an autogyro.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{four-wheel drive}} pickups {{featured}} manual locking hubs and a two-speed dual range New Process 205 transfer case with four drive modes: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, while Four High yielded a locked 50:50 torque split. Four Low applied reduction gearing. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> shafts were locked {{at all times}} in Four High and Four Low. Neutral allowed for flat towing, or use of the power take off (PTO).|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to this design over {{the more traditional}} system of placing one engine on each wing, the most important being power from two engines with the frontal area (and thus drag) of a single-engine design, allowing for higher performance. It also keeps {{the weight of the}} twin powerplants near, or on, the aircraft centerline, increasing the roll rate compared to a traditional twin. In addition, a single engine failure does not lead to asymmetric thrust, and in normal flight there is no net torque, so the plane is easy to handle. The choice of a full [...] "four-surface" [...] set of cruciform tail surfaces in the Do 335's rear fuselage design, included a ventral vertical fin-rudder assembly to project downwards from the extreme rear of the fuselage, {{in order to protect the}} <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> from an accidental ground strike on takeoff. The presence of the rear pusher propeller also mandated the provision for an ejection seat for safe escape from a damaged aircraft, and designing the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> and dorsal fin mounts to use explosive bolts to jettison them before an ejection was attempted — as well as twin canopy jettison levers, one per side located to either side of the forward cockpit interior just below the sills of the five-panel windscreen's sides, to jettison the canopy from atop the cockpit before ejection.|$|E
50|$|During {{his time}} at SRI, Shoulders also worked on ideas for a flying car, the Gyrodyne Convertiplane. It {{combined}} features of a car, a helicopter (a rotor on the roof for take-off and landing) and a small airplane (rigid wings and a <b>rear</b> <b>propeller).</b> Shoulders developed preliminary sketches and specifications, promoting {{the idea of a}} ground-to-air vehicle that could rescue long-distance commuters from hours of grid-lock traffic. In 1963, Shoulders asked the California State Senate’s Transportation Committee for permission to use his invention on public roads, and in 1964 they agreed. However, a number of nearby municipalities banned the Convertiplane from their airspace.|$|E
5|$|Coandă was {{interested}} in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller <b>rear</b> lift <b>propeller</b> was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow. It was around this time that Coandă's interest in jet propulsion began, claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the Sporthalle indoor sports arena in Berlin.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, Dornier {{was busy}} {{working on the}} P.59 {{high-speed}} bomber project, which featured the tandem engine layout. In 1940, he commissioned a test aircraft, closely modeled on the airframe of the early versions of the Dornier Do 17 bomber but only 40% {{of the size of}} the larger bomber, with no aerodynamic bodies of any sort on the wing panels (the original Do 17 had twin engine nacelles on its wings) and fitted with a retractable tricycle landing gear to validate his concept for turning the <b>rear</b> pusher <b>propeller</b> with an engine located far away from it and using a long tubular driveshaft. This aircraft, the Göppingen Gö 9, showed no unforeseen difficulties with this arrangement, but work on the P.59 was stopped in early 1940 when Hermann Göring ordered the cancellation of all projects that would not be completed within a year or so.|$|R
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{increasing}} power ratings could first be answered with larger rudderpropellers. Limits {{were set to}} this trend by mechanical stress {{and the fact that}} with an increasing propeller diameter, the draft of the vessel inevitably increases. Schottel therefore developed a thruster where the required power is divided between two counter-rotating thrusters that share a single shaft. The Twin Propeller is equipped with a pull propeller and a push propeller. The vortex street of the front pull propeller passes between the blades of the <b>rear</b> push <b>propeller</b> without impeding it. Contraction of the slip stream in the pull propeller means that more water reaches the push propeller from the sides. The strut is equipped with a fin, thus the swirl energy generated in the propeller stream is recovered. Additionally, the flow around the fins creates a lift component in the thrust direction, which has a thrust-enhancing effect.|$|R
50|$|Permanent {{four-wheel drive}} pickups {{featured}} a two-speed dual range New Process 203 transfer case with planetary center differential and lock. Five drive modes were provided: High, Low, Neutral, High Loc, and Low Loc. In High the center differential was unlocked {{and allowed the}} front and <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> shafts to slip as needed for full-time operation. The system could be manually shifted into High Loc which locked the center differential for a locked 50:50 torque split. Low and Low Loc applied reduction gearing with or without lock, depending on the mode selected. Neutral was also available {{for use of the}} PTO.|$|E
5000|$|The T40 concept {{originated}} at Allison in 1944, where {{design studies}} {{were carried out}} on a [...] turboprop engine. Taking advantage of this effort, the US Navy awarded Allison a contract for the design and development of a [...] turboprop engine. The resulting T40 combined two Allison T38-A-1 power sections side-by-side with a common reduction gearbox powering a contra-rotating propeller. Similar in layout to the Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba, the T40 differed in that each engine drove both the forward and the rear propellers, unlike the Double Mamba, where each Mamba power section drove either the front or the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> separately.|$|E
50|$|A {{contra-rotating}} propeller or contra-prop places two {{counter-rotating propellers}} on concentric drive shafts {{so that one}} sits immediately 'downstream' of the other propeller. This provides the benefits of counter-rotating propellers for a single powerplant. The forward propeller provides {{the majority of the}} thrust, while the <b>rear</b> <b>propeller</b> also recovers energy lost in the swirling motion of the air in the propeller slipstream. Contra-rotation also increases the ability of a propeller to absorb power from a given engine, without increasing propeller diameter. However the added cost, complexity, weight and noise of the system rarely make it worthwhile and it is only used on high-performance types where ultimate performance is more important than efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Loons tend to walk {{this way}} because their legs and pelvis are deeply {{specialized}} for swimming. They have a narrow pelvis, which moves the attachment point of the femur to the rear, and their tibiotarsus is much longer than the femur. This shifts the feet (toes) behind the center of mass of the loon body. They walk usually by pushing themselves on their breasts; larger loons cannot take off from land. This position, however, is highly suitable for swimming because their feet are located at the <b>rear</b> like the <b>propeller</b> on a motorboat.|$|R
50|$|The main {{armament}} of the PLL-05 is a 120mm gun-mortar in a turret {{capable of}} 360° traverse, this turret being {{mounted on a}} 6x6 WZ551 armored personnel carrier chassis. The mortar has an elevation range of -4 to +80 and is capable of both direct and indirect fire. It is fitted with a semi-automatic loader and can be fired in fully automatic, semi-automatic and fully manual modes, the maximum rate of fire being around 8-10 rounds per minute, with a sustained rate of fire being about 4-6 rounds per minute. Ammunition capacity is 36 rounds and include indirect fire mortar bombs and direct fire anti-tank rounds, maximum range with standard mortar bombs being about 9 km. Secondary armament is a QJC-88 12.7×108mm heavy machine gun mounted on the turret roof. The crew of four consists of the vehicle commander, gunner, loader and driver. Mobility of the PPL-05 {{is similar to that}} of that base WZ551 and the vehicle can swim by way of two <b>rear</b> mounted <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
50|$|On October 5, 1914, Sergent Joseph Franz and his {{mechanic}} Caporal Louis Quénault {{became the}} first to shoot down another aircraft when they downed a German Aviatik. However, air fighting was revolutionized when a reconnaissance pilot, Roland Garros, mounted a Hotchkiss machine gun on the cowling of his Morane-Saulnier L with a mechanical interrupter mechanism. The inconsistent firing rate of the Hotchkiss prevented the mechanism from working properly and he added deflector wedges to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>propeller</b> blades, so that the wooden propeller would not be shot to pieces whenever he opened fire on German aircraft. With this setup, Garros became the world's first fighter pilot, but he was captured shortly afterwards when his engine failed.|$|R
