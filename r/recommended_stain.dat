50|$|The {{majority}} of gastric lymphomas are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell origin. These tumors may range from well-differentiated, superficial involvements (MALT) to high-grade, large-cell lymphomas. Sometimes, it's hard to differentiate poorly differentiated high grade B-cell gastric lymphoma from gastric adenocarcinoma clinically or radiologically, yet histopathology with immunohistochemistry is <b>recommended</b> to <b>stain</b> specific markers on the malignant cell that favor {{the diagnosis of}} lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry stains specific clusters of differentiation that are present on B-cells like CD20. Cytokeratin is also a surface marker that is presented on epithelial cells, is stained histochemically and favors the diagnosis of epithelial tumors like adenocarcinoma.|$|R

Background: Evaluate, {{through a}} {{systematic}} review, {{the influence of}} staining food and beverages at the final outcome of the bleaching treatment in both techniques, In-home and In-office. Types of Studies Reviewes: This systematic review included in vivo, in situ and in vitro studies that evaluate the staining during or after tooth bleaching. The authors developed personalized search strategies at PubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, {{in addition to the}} grey literature. The methodological quality was also evaluated with different tools. Results: Of the 480 articles, only 12 were included in the review. Two of them were in vivo, one in situ and nine in vitro.

40|$|BBL ™ Methylene Blue Loeffler Stain Droppers {{are used}} for {{presumptive}} identification of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and {{as an adjunct to}} the Gram stain. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Methylene Blue is recognized as a simple stain {{that can be used for}} a variety of purposes, such as determining bacterial morphology and aiding in the interpretation of the Quellung test. 1 It is the stain of choice for the presumptive identification of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Upon staining, this species is characterized by a beaded or banded appearance of the cell, with deeply stained metachromatic granules contrasted with a lighter blue cytoplasm. 2, 3 Methylene Blue is used as an adjunct to the Gram stain, especially in the staining of gramnegative bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria species. 4, 5 The stain can reveal the morphology of fusiform bacteria and spirochetes (from oral infections such as Vincent’s angina) that may be difficult to see with the Gram stain. 5 The stain is also used to detect the presence of fecal white blood cells that may show the presence of invasive bowel disease. 5 BBL Methylene Blue Loeffler Stain Droppers can be used as a counterstain with BBL Flagella Stain Droppers, which are <b>recommended</b> for <b>staining</b> the flagella of bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidium is a coccidian {{protozoan}} parasite {{which causes}} considerable {{morbidity and mortality}} in young animals and in the immunocompromised host. Diagnosis of Cryptosporidiosis is generally done by means of detection of oocysts in faeces using different faecal concentration techniques and staining techniques. This study was carried out to compare staining techniques: MZN and Giemsa; faecal concentration techniques: MSSF and MSF, to identify the most sensitive faecal concentration and the staining technique to diagnose Cryptosporidial infection in buffalo. Out of twenty faecal samples tested, number of Cryptosporidium oocyst positivity and oocyst recovery rate were high in MZN method compared to Giemsa staining technique. Out of 65 buffalo faecal samples, cryptosporidial oocyst positivity for MSSF and MSF faecal concentration methods were 60 % and 50. 8 % respectively. However, the Cryptosporidium o ocyst recovery was high with the MSSF method compared to MSF method. This study concluded that MSSF and MSF faecal concentration methods are equally efficient in diagnosing severe cryptosporidial infection with high oocyst counts. Preferably, the diagnosis of mild cryptosporidial infection with low cryptoporidial oocyst counts can be efficiently detected by the MSSF method. The study <b>recommends</b> Giemsa <b>staining</b> for the screening and MZN for the conformation of cryptosporidial infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} and identification of intestinal helminths were studied retrospectively {{by comparing the}} Formalin concentration technique with the trichrome-stained smear technique. A total of 3, 997 stool samples from 1, 570 patients were examined by both methods. Of the 3, 997 samples, 31 % (1, 239 of 3, 997) contained helminths or protozoans or both. A total of 11 % (434 of 3, 997) of the samples representing 14 % (221 of 1, 570) of the patients were positive for one or more helminth species. A total of 570 separate identifications of helminth ova/larvae were made. Among the helminth ova/larvae identified. 14. 6 % (83 of 570) were detected only in the trichrome-stained smear, representing 6. 3 % (14 of 221) of the patients. From these data, {{it can be concluded}} that unless a diligent search of the stained smear for helminths is made, a significant number of helminth infections may be missed. It is, therefore, <b>recommended</b> that <b>stained</b> stool smears be used to aid the detection of helminth ova/larvae in conjunction with Formalin concentration. The appearance of the most common helminth ova/larvae in trichrome-stained smears is described, along with specific characteristics that may be used for their identification.

40|$|Twenty-nine {{patients}} with stage IB/IIA {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of the uterine cervix who had positive pelvic nodes were matched with 29 cases of node-negative squamous cell carcinoma by depth of invasion and lymphovascular space invasion. By multivariate analysis, these criteria independently predicted pelvic node metastases. Intracellular mucin, demonstrated by alcian-blue staining at pH 2. 5, was noted in 21 of the 58 patients (36 %). The frequency of mucin-positive tumors was not significantly different between the patients and their controls (38 versus 34 %, p = 0. 78), nor was the degree of positivity. These results suggest that, although a substantial proportion of squamous cell carcinomas exhibit mucin secretion, {{patients with}} these tumors are not {{at increased risk for}} pelvic node metastases.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The adenoma-carcinoma {{sequence}} in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is accelerated. It remains unknown whether the mismatch repair (MMR) defect also promotes {{the development of}} adenomas. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the risk of developing colorectal adenoma and carcinoma in HNPCC carriers and noncarriers (controls) and to compare the features of adenomas in both groups. METHODS: Eighty-six families with a known MMR gene mutation from the Dutch HNPCC Registry were analyzed. Subjects with known mutation status with colonoscopies performed for the purpose of surveillance were selected for this study. Information on the surveillance examinations was obtained from medical reports. The histology of all adenomas was confirmed. Immunohistochemistry was performed in a subgroup of adenomas. RESULTS: We identified 249 carriers and 247 controls. The proportion of subjects free of an adenoma at the age of 60 years was 29. 7 % for carriers and 70. 8 % for controls (P < 0. 05). The adenomas in carriers were larger, and a higher proportion had villous components and/or high-grade dysplasia (P < 0. 05, all analyses). The adenomas and carcinomas of the carriers were located predominantly in the proximal colon. Most adenomas showed absent staining of the MMR proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the MMR defect is involved in the early stages of development of adenomas. We <b>recommend</b> immunohistochemical <b>staining</b> of large adenomas with high-grade dysplasia in young patients (younger than 50 years) to identify patients with suspected HNPCC...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{long-term}} trials {{was established to}} monitor the effect of remedial surgery for the control of Eutypa dieback in commercial vineyards of South Australia. Removing infected cordons and trunks {{has been used as}} a strategy for managing Eutypa dieback in grapevines for many years and this study is the first to provide evidence of its effect in controlling the disease. Between 42 and 100 % of vines produced watershoots after removal of infected wood, depending on time after surgery and height of the trunk remaining. Remedial surgery reduced the incidence of vines with foliar symptoms of Eutypa dieback in vineyards, and the severity of those symptoms, but the efficacy varied with the presumed extent of pre-existing infection and the origin of the watershoot.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{estimates of}} bacterial abundance and of average bacterial cell size based on direct counts of bacterioplankton cells stained with acridine orange (AO) or 4 ’- 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylidole (DAPI). Estimates of numbers mll– 1 of bacteria stained with DAPI were on average 70 % (range 57 – 82 %) of bacterial counts made with AO as the stain. Cell volumes estimated from DAPI-stained cells were even less, on average 59 % (range 34 – 80 %) of those determined from measurement of AO-stained cells. The combination of lower DAPI values for both cell numbers and cell volumes resulted in overall underestimation of total bacterial biovolume liter– 1. DAPI-determined total biovolumes ranged from 25 to 61 % of biovolume values obtained via counts and measurements of AO-stained {{cells in the}} two data sets. These results can be ascribed to the differential staining of cell components by DAPI and AO.

However, this recommendation has not been tested prospectively. We evaluated the yield of microbiological studies in 259 patients with parapneumonic pleural effusion. Microbiological studies were positive on the pleural fluid of 50 patients (19. 3 %). In 48 of the 50 patients with positive microbiological results (96 %), the need for pleural drainage was correctly predicted by pleural fluid parameters. There were no differences in hospital stay (9. 5 ± 2. 5 days versus 9. 9 ± 3. 2 days, P= 0. 68) or in mortality (2 deaths in each group, P= 0. 58) between the group of patients in which antibiotic treatment was changed according to microbiological results and the group of patients {{in which it is}} not. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, at least in our institution, routine microbial investigation of pleural fluid adds very little to the standard management of parapneumonic effusions...|$|R

40|$|Classification of {{peripheral}} T-cell lymphomas {{based on}} morphological criteria can present problems due to overlap in histological features amongst the subtypes. An immunohistochemical {{study was designed}} to study the follicular dendritic cell patterns in 21 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma which had been classified using the updated Kiel classification. Three patterns of distribution were observed: 1 follicular dendritic cells not detected (3 cases); 2 follicular dendritic cells restricted to remnant follicle centres (7); 3 follicular dendritic cells present as an expanded network of cells exceeding the confines of germinal centres (11). Ten out of 11 angioimmunoblastic lymphomas showed an expanded network of follicular dendritic cells. The only negative case showed features which, on review, were in keeping with a pleomorphic, medium and large cell lymphoma showing an unusual proliferation of small venules. Other than angioimmunoblastic lymphomas, only one other case showed follicular dendritic cell hyperplasia. This was an unclassified peripheral T-cell lymphoma. We conclude that follicular dendritic cell hyperplasia may be used as an aid to diagnosis of the angioimmunoblastic type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and we <b>recommend</b> the routine <b>staining</b> of these cells in typing of T-cell lymphomas to facilitate comparison between centres. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Gram stains are regularly performed as part of the microbiological evaluation of suspected infected total knee arthroplasties. Recently, the utility of this test in diagnosing infections has been questioned. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Gram stains performed from surgical site samples by comparing their results to the final {{diagnosis of}} infection. MethodsThe results of 347 Gram stains performed at a single center at the time of revision total knee arthroplasty for both septic and aseptic reasons were compared to the final diagnosis based on intra-operative findings and histological evaluation. ResultsGram staining demonstrated a low sensitivity of 7 % (95 % confidence interval 4 – 12 %), a specificity of 99 % (95 % confidence interval 97 – 100 %), and positive and negative predictive values of 92 % and 57 %, respectively. ConclusionsThis study confirmed previous findings of the poor utility of this test for the diagnosis of periprosthetic knee infections.

40|$|International audienceHaematological {{methods are}} widely {{utilised}} among avian ecologists {{as a means}} for individual health assessment. However, the technical simplicity of some of the tests may easily lead to oversimplification of the evaluation. Here, we show in the Scarlet Rosefinch () that haematological parameters other than the widely used heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio may be important to investigate. We give the full description of seven basic haematological traits (leukocyte differential count, immature erythrocyte count, haematocrit, mean cell volume, total red and white blood cell count and blood parasite occurrence). Most remarkably, the examination of 178 adults and 155 nestlings has revealed that this species has an extraordinarily high proportion of basophils among the peripheral blood leukocytes (on average about 42 and 56 %, respectively). Although the high basophil count is a general trait even in healthy individuals of this species, the proportion of these cells is condition-dependent and is further increased by infection. Our results also suggest that the immature erythrocyte count in the peripheral blood is a good predictor of the nestlings' growth rate. We conclude that the Rosefinch haematology differs strikingly from other avian species with known values of basic haematological parameters. We therefore emphasise the importance of a general haematological examination, based on material obtained by an appropriate method (e. g. for smear preparation, we <b>recommend</b> using differential <b>staining</b> and avoiding prior methanol fixation) ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there have}} been several {{previous}} reports of immunohistochemical staining for MHC antigens in muscle biopsies, {{there appears to be a}} lack of consensus about its routine use in the diagnostic evaluation of biopsies from patients with suspected inflammatory myopathy. Positive MHC-I staining is nonspecific but is widely used as a marker for inflammatory myopathy, whilst the role of MHC-II staining is not clearly defined. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of MHC-I and MHC-II immunostaining for the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy in a large group of biopsies from a single reference laboratory. Positive staining for MHC-I was found to have a high sensitivity in biopsies from patients with inflammatory myopathy but a very low specificity, as it was also common in other non-inflammatory myopathies and neurogenic disorders. On the other hand, MHC-II positivity had a much higher specificity in all major subgroups of inflammatory myopathy, especially inclusion body myositis. The findings indicate that the combination of MHC-I and MHC-II staining results in a higher degree of specificity for the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy and that in biopsies with inflammation, positive MHC-II staining strongly supports the diagnosis of an immune-mediated myopathy. We <b>recommend</b> that immunohistochemical <b>staining</b> for both MHC-I and MHC-II should be included routinely in the diagnostic evaluation of muscle biopsies from patients with suspected inflammatory myopathy. However, as the sensitivity and interpretation of MHC staining may depend on the technique used, further studies are needed to compare procedures in different centres and develop standardised protocols...|$|R

40|$|The chromatographic {{separation}} and determination of tungsten {{has been considered}} in the cases in which it occurs alone in solution or accompanied by chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, and iron. Two different types of chromatographic tests have been studied: usual partition chromatography and tests according to conditions B (different solvents for saturation, development, and contamination). To achieve a precise determination of tungsten {{and the absence of}} all interference, the usual partition chromatography must be adopted. The reproducibility of the determination of tungsten in this case is of the order of ± 2 to 3 % for 10 μg of the separated element. Under the conditions of the test B, the reproducibility of the determination of separated tungsten may be just as good (± 3 to 4 %) if use is made of conventional references and corresponding diagrams such as we <b>recommend.</b> Otherwise, the <b>stains</b> determined in the usual manner yield a deficit of 14 % with respect to the deposited tungsten.

40|$|Tumor budding in {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) {{is recognized as}} a valuable prognostic factor but its translation into daily histopathology practice has been delayed by lack of agreement on the optimal method of assessment. Within {{the context of the}} Swiss Association of Gastrointestinal Pathology (SAGIP), we performed a multicenter interobserver study on tumor budding, comparing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) with pan-cytokeratin staining using a 10 high power field (10 HPF) and hotspot (1 HPF) method. Two serial sections of 50 TNM stage II-IV surgically treated CRC were stained for H&E and pan-cytokeratin. Tumor buds were scored by independent observers at six participating centers in Switzerland and Austria using the 10 HPF and 1 HPF method on a digital pathology platform. Pearson correlation (r) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) comparing scores between centers were calculated. Three to four times more tumor buds were detected in pan-cytokeratin compared to H&E slides. Correlation coefficients for tumor budding counts between centers ranged from r[*]=[*] 0. 46 to r[*]=[*] 0. 91 for H&E and from r[*]=[*] 0. 73 to r[*]=[*] 0. 95 for pan-cytokeratin slides. Interobserver agreement across all centers was excellent for pan-cytokeratin [10 HPF: ICC[*]=[*] 0. 83 and 1 HPF: ICC[*]=[*] 0. 8].

40|$|Staining of {{mast cells}} (MCs), {{including}} porcine ones, is critically {{dependent upon the}} fixation and staining technique. In the pig, mucosal and submucosal MCs do not stain or stain only faintly after formalin fixation. Some fixation methods are particularly <b>recommended</b> for MC <b>staining,</b> for example the fixation with Carnoy or lead salts. Zinc salt fixation (ZSF) {{has been reported to}} work excellently for the preservation of fixation-sensitive antigens. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a reliable histological method for counting of MCs in the porcine intestinum. For this purpose, different tissue fixation and staining methods that also allow potential subsequent immunohistochemical investigations were evaluated in the porcine mucosa, as well as submucosa of small and large intestine. Tissues were fixed in Carnoy, lead acetate, lead nitrate, Zamboni and ZSF and stained subsequently with either polychromatic methylene blue, alcian blue or toluidine blue. For the first time our study reveals that ZSF, a heavy metal fixative, preserves metachromatic staining of porcine MCs. Zamboni fixation was not suitable for histochemical visualization of MCs in the pig intestine. All other tested fixatives were suitable. Alcian blue and toluidine blue co-stained intestinal goblet cells which made a prima facie identification of MCs difficult. The polychromatic methylene blue proved to be the optimal staining. In order to compare MC counting results of the different fixation methods, tissue shrinkage was taken into account. As even the same fixation caused shrinkage-differences between tissue from small and large intestine, different factors for each single fixation and intestinal localization had to be calculated. Tissue shrinkage varied between 19 % and 57 %, the highest tissue shrinkage was found after fixation with ZSF in the large intestine, the lowest one in the small intestine after lead acetate fixation. Our study emphasizes that MC counting results from data using different fixation techniques can only be compared if the respective study-immanent shrinkage factor has been determined and quantification results are adjusted accordingly...|$|R

To engaged laboratories we asked how O&P was performed, if a specifical research for E. vermicularis and S. stercoralis was performed, if for the identification of D. fragilis, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar and Cryptosporidum spp were performed <b>recommended</b> specific permanent <b>stains.</b> 23 laboratories gave assent; but for an inferior number was possible to use the data for analysis and evaluation. Relating O&P only some laboratories performed permanent stains: Giemsa for D. fragilis, antigen and/or Trichrome stain for E. histolytica/dispar, antigen and/or acid fast stain for Cryptosporidium spp. Not all laboratories research specifically S. stercoralis. So the epidemiology is differentiated and related more to adequate or not adequate techniques than cohorts of examined populations. The overall positivity for parasites ranged from 0 % to 18. 7 %,for protozoa (pathogens or not) were from 0 % to 14. 7 %; for nematodes from 0 % to 3. 7 %; for cestodes from 0 % to 1. 0 %; for trematodes from 0 % to 1. 0 %. Among helminths, E. vermicularis, followed by S. stercoralis, also in O&P, is the most frequent. The specific research of S. stercoralis gave a positivity from 0 % to 33. 3 %; the cellophane tape test was positive for E. vermicularis from 0 % fo 21. 9 % of cases. Among pathogen protozoa, D. fragilis, when permanent stain were applied, prevailed from 0 % to 16. 6 %; G. duodenalis from 0. 8 % to 4. 3 %; E. histolytica/dispar, using a permanent stain or research of antigen, was identified from 0 % to 20. 6 %. Coccidia were very rare, with Cryptosporidium spp observed from 0 % to 5. 2 %. These are our conclusions: many laboratories need for a critical revision of own technical procedures and diagnostic methodologies...|$|R
40|$|Root {{length and}} {{diameter}} distribution are important characteristics {{to be considered}} when describing and comparing root systems. Root length and root-diameter distribution may be obtained in two ways: by microscopical measurements, which are laborious, or by computerised analysis, which is fast but sensitive to the scanning protocol. Although scanning protocols vary widely between laboratories, papers rarely report the details. Using two commercially available root analysis software packages (Delta-T Scan and WinRHIZO), we performed a sensitivity analysis of scanning protocols for estimating root length and diameter distribution. The results are shown graphically, rather than numerically, because the interactions between different parameters in the overall scanning protocol are most clearly illustrated by {{the shape of the}} curves. The present analysis clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of the two scanning methods with regard to staining period, maximum root density, scanning resolution and transformation threshold. For example, estimating the root-diameter distribution versus measuring root length, puts opposite constraints on the transformation threshold settings. We suggest the following settings for the most sensitive parameters: a staining period of 24 h, a root density of less than 0. 5 mm root per mm(2) surface, a resolution of 400 dpi and the automatic threshold for WinRHIZO and a brightness of 200 for Delta-T Scan. According to this protocol, comparison of computerised analyses with microscopic measurements showed good total root length and diameter distribution agreement for three contrasting root systems. We suggest to always start with the present protocol when studying other species. If validation indicates that the proposed scanning protocol needs to be modified for other species, the present sensitivity analysis may be used as a guideline for changing the most critical parameters. Similarly, the use of another stain than neutral red may also require modifications of the scanning protocol. In general, a long staining period (e. g., 24 h) is <b>recommended</b> for all <b>stains,</b> as small differences in staining period have the least effect when the root tissue is saturated. To enhance comparability of results in the literature, the staining period, stain, (maximum) root density, scanner resolution and threshold should always be listed when root data obtained by scanning are presented.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: With the {{improvement}} of CAD/CAM technology and translucency of zirconia material, the full contour zirconia crown was introduced to offer dentists a metal free, high strength, and acceptable esthetic prosthesis option. In addition, it is claimed {{that it is possible}} to make a full contour high translucent zirconia crown close to natural tooth color by using coloring liquid. However, there is little information in the literature regarding the effect of coloring techniques and cement color on the optical properties of high translucent zirconia. Objective : 1) To evaluate the effect of the coloring liquid technique on the resulting optical properties of a monolithic high translucent zirconia 2) To evaluate the cumulative effect of the cement color on the resulting optical properties of a monolithic high translucent zirconia. Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant difference in optical properties between the high translucent monolithic zirconia ceramics with different color staining technique. In addition, the use of shaded resin cement has an effect on the final optical properties of high translucent monolithic zirconia ceramics. Materials and methods: 35 specimens of high translucent zirconia (11 mm x 11 mm) with thickness 1 mm was divided into 5 groups according coloring technique, as follows: no color, submerge, two layers of painting, four layers of painting, and six layers of painting. All specimens were measured for the Δ E, transparent parameter (TP), and opalescence parameter(OP) by spectrophotometer (CM- 2600 D) after firing. Forty-two specimens of high translucent zirconia (11 mm x 11 mm) with thickness 1 mm were divided into three groups according to cement color, as follows: clear, opaque, and A 2. After firing and cementing with ND 4 resin Block. The Δ E, TP and OP will be measured by spectrophotometer. Statistics: The data were analyzed with significant level set at 0. 05 one way ANOVA followed by pair-wise group comparisons using Fisher’s Protected Least Significant Differences. Result: 1) The shade of cement significantly affected the mean value of ΔE of E-max CAD and BruxZir high translucent zirconia restoration. Using opaque cement combined with E-max CAD resulted in color difference that was above the clinically perceptible level (ΔE> 3. 7). 2) With more layers of staining liquid application, the ΔE and value decreased. The six-layered group showed lowest mean delta ΔE value of 22 (0. 78). ΔE was significantly different among groups (p< 0. 0001). The submerged group showed higher ΔE than the all painting groups. Conclusions: Based on the results of the study, the colors of BruxZir high translucent zirconia and E-max CAD restorations were affected by the shade of cement, whereas white opaque resin cement resulted in BruxZir high translucent zirconia more yellowish. The results of the study demonstrated that the staining technique has an influence on value and final color of Lava-Plus high translucent. Therefore, it is <b>recommended</b> to consider <b>staining</b> technique as one of the influential factors on the final color of zirconia crowns. 6 month...|$|R
