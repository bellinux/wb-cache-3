40|$|In his blueprint, Bruno van Pottelsberghe first {{looks at}} the {{performance}} of patent arrangements in Europe, especially their cost effectiveness and the consistency of rules and remedies across countries. He then looks at current attempts at global patent cooperation {{to see if they}} will help or hinder the emergence of innovation worldwide and in Europe. Using new and hard-hitting data, van Pottelsberghe paints a dark picture of today's patent landscape both in Europe and internationally. It is a tale of failed public cooperation at all levels and of a regime in danger of <b>rampant</b> patent <b>inflation</b> unless minds and resources are focused on tackling the root causes of the problem. This blueprint comes forward with a sequence of concrete, short-, medium- and long-term policy recommendations to this end. ...|$|R
25|$|The Panic of 1873 and the {{subsequent}} depression had several underlying causes, of which economic historians debate the relative importance. American post-Civil War <b>inflation,</b> <b>rampant</b> speculative investments (overwhelmingly in railroads), the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US, a large trade deficit, ripples from economic dislocation in Europe resulting from the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), property losses in the Chicago (1871) and Boston (1872) fires, and other factors put a massive strain on bank reserves, which plummeted in New York City during September and October 1873 from US$50 million to $17 million.|$|R

Using the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) methods (i. e., rates, weights and ICD- 9 -CM DRGs) for determining reimbursable amounts, this analysis examines the postulation that the typical U.

Data for three naval hospitals over a two-year period (FY 83 and FY 84) are used.

25|$|Gandhi {{inherited}} a weak economy when she again became Prime Minister in 1980. The preceding year in 1979–80 under the Janata Party government {{had led to}} the strongest recession (−5.2%) {{in the history of}} modern India with <b>inflation</b> <b>rampant</b> at 18.2%. Gandhi proceeded to abrogate the Janata Party government's Five Year Plan in 1980 and launched the Sixth Five Year Plan (1980–85). The government targeted an average growth of 5.2% over the period of the plan. Measures to check the inflation were also taken; by the early 1980s inflation was under control {{at an annual rate of}} about 5%.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} give all {{employees}} the same access to decision-making, the basic organisations of associated labor were also applied to public services, including health and education. The basic organizations were usually made up {{of no more than}} a few dozen people and had their own workers' councils, whose assent was needed for strategic decisions and appointment of managers in enterprises or public institutions. The results of these reforms however were not satisfactory. There have been <b>rampant</b> wage-price <b>inflations,</b> substantial rundown of capital plant and consumer shortages, while the income gap between the poorer southern and the relatively affluent northern regions was unchanged. The self-management system stimulated the inflationary economy that was needed to support it. Large state-owned enterprises operated as monopolists with unrestricted access to capital that was shared according to political criteria. Oil crisis of 1973 magnified the economic problems, which the government tried to solve with extensive foreign borrowing. Although such actions resulted in a reasonable rate of growth for a few years (GNP grew at 5.1% yearly), such growth was unsustainable since the rate of foreign borrowing grew at an annual rate of 20%.|$|R

5000|$|Finally, {{there is}} a human capital {{dimension}} {{to the failure of}} post-Soviet reforms in Russia. The former Soviet population was not necessarily uneducated. Literacy was nearly universal, and the educational level of the Soviet population was {{among the highest in the}} world with respect to science, engineering, and some technical disciplines, although the Soviets devoted little to what would be described as [...] "liberal arts" [...] in the West. With the move to a post-Communist system, the Russian university system collapsed. <b>Rampant</b> credential <b>inflation</b> in the Russian university system made it difficult for employers to determine who was really skilled and the problems of the higher education system more generally made it difficult to remedy other issues of human capital that came from the transition to a market-oriented system, such as upskilling and re-skilling. [...] For example, former state enterprise managers were highly skilled at coping with the demands on them under the Soviet system of planned production targets, but discouraged the risk-and-reward centered behavior of market capitalism. These managers were responsible for a broad array of social welfare functions for their employees, their families, and the population of the towns and regions where they were located. Profitability and efficiency, however, were generally not the most prominent priorities for Soviet enterprise managers. Thus, almost no Soviet employees or managers had firsthand experience with decision-making in the conditions of a market economy.|$|R
40|$|Although {{they were}} never {{confirmed}} conquerors, the total waiver for loss and damage caused by the Japanese in the Pacific war under Article 14 (b) of the Treaty of San Francisco conferred a blanket sovereign immunity on them in the jurisdictions they invaded including the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong. As occupiers under the Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War (the Hague Regulations) the evaluation of Japanese state practice and liability to pay compensation arising from misuse of civilian-owned private property rests entirely on the validity of Article 14 (b). This paper takes the prospects of the Hong Kong Chinese of winning individual-to-state reparations {{as an example of}} how a new reparations model could work. In particular, it surveys financial losses that were incurred by them during the Japanese Occupation (1941 – 1945). The misapplied sovereign immunity granted to the Japanese for wartime loss and damage under Article 14 (b) has allowed them to escape evaluation as occupiers. But recognizing Article 14 (b) as void would not necessarily open the flood gates if the moderating elements of military necessity and an occupant’s monetary policy prerogative were applied. Thus, rather than focus on the loss of value of money through confiscatory currency exchange rates, <b>rampant</b> price <b>inflation</b> or demonetization, a new reparations claim should focus on money taken by the Japanese of non-Kwomintang Hong Kong Chinese in house-to-house requisition drives and from bank deposit accounts...|$|R

The No Name line continued to grow and gourmet items were even added to the generic line-up. Then, in 1984, Loblaw launched President’s Choice, a premium line of private label items, with each product personally endorsed by Loblaws president Dave Nichol and promoted in the popular advertising supplement Dave Nichol's Insider's Report. No name and President’s Choice products would go on to account for 25 percent of the company's domestic grocery sales or double the industry average.|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} and middle Republican era, conscripted {{soldiers}} and their officers were expected to provide or pay for all their personal equipment. From the late republic onwards, they were salaried professionals, and bought their own clothing from legionary stores, quartermasters or civilian contractors. Military needs were prioritised. Clothing was expensive to start with, and the military demand was high; this inevitably pushed up prices, and a common soldier's clothing expenses could {{be more than a}} third of his annual pay.

40|$|Our study {{encompasses}} {{two main}} objectives. One, using the 2001 OECD National Account database we compute Total Factor Productivity growth (TFPG) for Finland {{for the years}} from 1960 until 1999 using a chained Fisher index. We report that over the 4 decades Finland’s TFPG has grown on a 2. 4 % annual basis. Additionally our results echo other studies in estimating a slow-down in productivity growth for the 1974 - 1991 period with TFPG registering a scant 0. 7 % average annual growth rate compared to a torrid 3. 35 % pace set in the previous period from 1960 - 1973. On a more positive note we document that TFPG growth accelerates quite dramatically for {{the decade of the}} 90 s with an average growth rate of some 4. 7 % for the period from 1993 until 1999 suggesting that the Finnish economy might reprise its high growth performance last seen in the pre- 1973 period. Second, we compute estimates of technical progress for Finland by specifying a Normalized Quadratic profit function analogous to the one used by Diewert & Fox (1999) in the producer context. We obtain as well estimates of producer (own and cross) supply price elasticities for the 1960 - 99 period. We estimate demand price elasticities in the consumer context by utilizing a Normalized Quadratic model once again for the same period and report finding rising trends in the annual producer and consumer price elasticities for Finland over the forty years period. It is alleged that these trends in elasticities in tandem with the high tax rates would lead to rising increasing deadweight losses over time which in combination with high <b>inflation</b> <b>rampant</b> in the decade of the 70 s and 80 s might possibly account for the productivity slump found in that period.

40|$|In 1973 the British {{academic}} Ronald Dore published {{what was}} {{to become one of the}} most influential books ever written in the fields of industrial sociology and Japanese studies. British Factory-Japanese Factory: The Origins of National Diversity in Industrial Relations (Dore, 1973) was a brilliantly conceived comparative investigation of two factories, English Electric in the UK and Hitachi in Japan. Coming as it did against the backdrop of a relative decline in Britain’s economic performance and international prestige, and at a time when western commentators and policy makers were becoming more aware of the seriousness of the Japanese industrial challenge, this book was as much a wake-up call for British industry as it was a presentation of a thorough and deep empirical study of the two factories. In this sense Dore’s book was to the UK what Ezra Vogel’s (1979) Japan as Number 1 : Lessons for America, was to the United States. Published six years after Dore’s work, Japan as Number 1 was aimed at goading American policy-makers and business leaders into taking decisive action to counter the emergence of Japan as the world’s pre-eminent industrial manufacturer and it can be said that Dore, when he wrote his book, was also as much aware of the climate of opinion in the UK as he was of Japan’s rise. For, around the time Dore’s book was published the British industrial system was under tremendous strain, not least because of the consequences of a disastrous macro-economic and industrial relations climate that included among its effects a collapse in the value of Britain’s currency and external trading position, <b>rampant</b> double-digit <b>inflation,</b> the introduction of a three day working week and, in a failed effort to assert the government’s authority over the trade unions, the first of two general elections in 1974 called and lost by the then Prime Minister Edward Heath, under the slogan: ‘Who governs Britain?’. Indeed, towards the end of that decade the term igirisu byō, or the British disease, had gained common currency in Japan to describe, with not a little irony, a relative and perhaps terminal decline in Britain’s international prestige and power as a consequence of class conflict and general social malaise, as well as indicating the rise of Japan to becoming a member of the top rank of the world’s industrialised countries. This chapter presents a historical analysis of some of the principal social science research on the Japanese firm produced in the United Kingdom since Dore published British Factory-Japanese Factory. Prominent within this research have been studies on foreign direct investment (FDI) by Japanese firms in the UK, industrial relations in Japan and in Japanese plants in the UK, the employment system in large Japanese enterprises and more theoretical and wide-ranging discussions on Japanese-style management and Japanese-style capitalism and their relationship to worldwide economic development and the possible convergence of industrial systems...|$|R
25|$|Bauhaus expressionist phase ends. Standard {{arguments}} {{for the reasons}} for this are 1. Expressionism was difficult to build. 2. <b>Rampant</b> <b>inflation</b> in Germany changed the climate of opinion to a more sober one. Jencks postulates that the standard arguments are too simplistic and instead argues that 1. Expressionism had become associated with extreme utopianism which in turn had been discredited by violence and bloodshed. Or 2. Architects had become convinced that the new (rationalist) style was equally expressive and more adequately captured the Zeitgeist. There is no large disagreements or public pronouncements to precipitate this change in direction. The only outwardly visible reaction was the forced resignation of the head of the basic Bauhaus course, Johannes Itten, to be replaced with the, then constructivist, László Moholy-Nagy.|$|E

25|$|As {{the genre}} of {{expressionism}} began to diminish, {{the genre of}} the New Objectivity (die neue Sachlichkeit) began to take its place. It was influenced by new issues which occupied the public in those years, as the <b>rampant</b> <b>inflation</b> caused deterioration in the economic status of the middle class. These films, often called “street films” or “asphalt films”, tried to reflect reality in all its complexity and ugliness. They focused on objects surrounding the characters and cynically symbolized the despair felt by the German people, whose lives were shattered after the war. The most prominent film maker who is associated with this genre is Georg Wilhelm Pabst in his films such as: Joyless Street (1925), Pandora's Box (1929), and The Loves of Jeanne Ney (1927). Pabst is also credited with innovations in film editing, such as reversing {{the angle of the}} camera or cutting between two camera angles, which enhanced film continuity and later became standards of the industry.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcing the {{relative}} decline in U.S. {{power and the}} dissatisfaction of Europe and Japan with the system was the continuing decline of the dollar—the foundation that had underpinned the post-1945 global trading system. The Vietnam War and the refusal of the administration of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson {{to pay for it}} and its Great Society programs through taxation resulted in an increased dollar outflow to pay for the military expenditures and <b>rampant</b> <b>inflation,</b> which led to the deterioration of the U.S. balance of trade position. In the late 1960s, the dollar was overvalued with its current trading position, while the German Mark and the yen were undervalued; and, naturally, the Germans and the Japanese had no desire to revalue and thereby make their exports more expensive, whereas the U.S. sought to maintain its international credibility by avoiding devaluation. Meanwhile, the pressure on government reserves was intensified by the new international currency markets, with their vast pools of speculative capital moving around in search of quick profits.|$|E
