5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at lower <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> attack or stroke—for instance, those without {{a history of}} these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested {{as a component of}} a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean.

5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, {{they are unable to}} synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may lower the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both {{the mother and the}} child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E

5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E
5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise {{in the weeks after}} the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) {{are believed to be}} due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect <b>of</b> using {{different}} <b>risk</b> calculation tools on how general practitioners and practice nurses evaluate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease with clinical data routinely available in patients' records. DESIGN: Subjective estimates <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease and results of four different methods <b>of</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> {{were compared with}} each other and a reference standard that had been calculated with the Framingham equation; calculations were based on a sample of patients' records, randomly selected from groups at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease. SETTING: General practices in central England. PARTICIPANTS: 18 general practitioners and 18 practice nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement <b>of</b> results <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> estimation and risk calculation with reference calculation; agreement of general practitioners with practice nurses; sensitivity and specificity of the different methods <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> calculation to detect patients at high or low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease. RESULTS: Only a minority of patients' records contained all <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> factors required for the formal calculation <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease (concentrations <b>of</b> high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were present in only 21 %). Agreement <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> calculations with the reference standard was moderate (kappa= 0. 33 - 0. 65 for practice nurses and 0. 33 to 0. 65 for general practitioners, depending on calculation tool), showing a trend for underestimation <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> Moderate agreement was seen between the risks calculated by general practitioners and practice nurses for the same patients (kappa= 0. 47 to 0. 58). The British charts gave the most sensitive results for <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease (practice nurses 79 %, general practitioners 80 %), and it also gave the most specific results for practice nurses (100 %), whereas the Sheffield table was the most specific method for general practitioners (89 %). CONCLUSIONS: Routine calculation <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease in primary care is hampered by poor availability <b>of</b> data on <b>risk</b> factors. General practitioners and practice nurses are able to evaluate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease with only moderate accuracy. Data about risk factors need to be collected systematically, to allow the use of the most appropriate calculation tools...|$|R

25|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of wine is alcohol, and therefore, {{the health effects}} of alcohol apply to wine. Drinking small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and early death. Drinking more than this amount however, increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke.

25|$|Several {{very large}} {{observational}} {{studies have also}} found elevated <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> attack from rofecoxib.

(Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant.
