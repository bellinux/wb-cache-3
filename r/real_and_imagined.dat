In 2017, the Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne commissioned playwright Tom Wright {{to write a}} play about Merrick's life. The <b>Real</b> <b>and</b> <b>Imagined</b> History of the Elephant Man premiered on August 4, and starred Daniel Monks in the title role. The cast also featured Paula Arundell, Julie Forsyth, Emma J Hawkins, and Sophie Ross.|$|E
5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many of the horror stories of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E
5|$|The New Kingdom pharaohs began a {{large-scale}} building {{campaign to promote}} the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined.</b> The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built. The pharaoh Hatshepsut used such hyperbole and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty-two years. Her reign was very successful, marked by {{an extended period of}} peace and wealth-building, trading expeditions to Punt, restoration of foreign trade networks, and great building projects, including an elegant mortuary temple that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later, a colossal pair of obelisks, and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Amenhotep II, the heir to Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III, sought to erase her legacy {{near the end of his}} father's reign and throughout his, touting many of her accomplishments as his. He also tried to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries, which some suggest was a futile attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Under {{the theme}} of the poetics of travel this chapter explores known and unknown worlds, <b>and</b> <b>real,</b> <b>imagined,</b> <b>and</b> virtual spaces through {{rethinking}} the experience of the traveller {{at the beginning of the}} twenty-first century. In this we explore the myths and realities of our lives as astronauts and avatars and reflect on the fragility of human existence in extreme spaces. The weaving of <b>real</b> stories <b>and</b> <b>imagined,</b> <b>and</b> the notion of the journey that extends beyond or breaks through cultural boundaries are themes that are explored, along with the insatiable nature of our desire to explore the unknown. In particular are the investigations of travel and new technologies; in this new digital age does the traveller even have to ‘leave’ to experience ‘travelling’ and the exploration of space and place...|$|R

5|$|The {{anonymous}} author {{tells us that}} Padarn's parents were nobly born Armoricans (Bretons), and that he sailed to Britain with 847 monks to settle and build a monastery. He established monasteries and churches throughout Ceredigion. The attempt of Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, to ruin Padarn rebounds on him through a miracle, and he compensates Padarn with the gift of lands between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. Saint Padarn is closely associated with Saint David and Saint Teilo in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in which the three are honoured by the Patriarch. Padarn was given a tunic – which later featured in the best known legend associated with him – and a staff. Most likely this account is fabricated, as are much {{of the details of}} the lives of the early saints, from a variety of sources, <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined.</b>|$|E

40|$|Under {{the theme}} of {{transformation}} through physical and non-physical travel, this article explores known and unknown worlds, <b>and</b> <b>real,</b> <b>imagined,</b> <b>and</b> virtual spaces, through collaborative art and performative writing practices. The weaving of <b>real</b> stories <b>and</b> aspirations, {{and the notion of}} the journey that extends beyond or breaks through cultural boundaries and stories of personal transformation are themes that are explored in particular. The article further explores virtual worlds as spaces of and for the imagination, where the entanglement of the physical with the virtual is exploited for its creative potential. In particular, there are opportunities to further explore our understanding of the transforming act of virtual <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> travel through an exploration of the experience of time, space and place...|$|R
50|$|In {{her later}} career, Browning created {{works in the}} style of magic realism that {{increasingly}} blurred the lines between the <b>real</b> <b>and</b> the <b>imagined.</b> In works such as Picture of a Painting of the Great Circus Parade (1988) and Black Umbrella (1970) the artist captures a real event but with a focus on the wonderful and a blurred sense of reality.|$|R
60|$|Eliphalet at Willesden {{had heard}} {{a great deal of}} Boston airs and graces and intellectuality, of the favored few of that city who lived in mysterious houses, and who crossed the sea in ships. He pictured Mrs. Brice asking for a spoon, and young Stephen {{sniffing}} at Mrs. Crane's boarding-house. And he resolved with democratic spirit that he would teach Stephen a lesson, if opportunity offered. His own discrepancy between the <b>real</b> <b>and</b> the <b>imagined</b> was no greater than that of the rest of his fellow-boarders.|$|R
25|$|Often grouped {{together}} with propaganda as agitprop, agitation {{is the use}} of agitators to stir up discontent both <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> with the regime and to propose a course of action to right these perceived wrongs. The traditional targets of agitators have been the shop floor, students' unions and the junior officer's mess halls of the military.|$|E
25|$|Motives also figured {{occasionally}} in purely instrumental {{music of the}} Romantic period. The related idea of the musical idée fixe was coined by Hector Berlioz in reference to his Symphonie fantastique (1830). This purely instrumental, programmatic work (subtitled Episode in the Life of an Artist) features a recurring melody representing {{the object of the}} artist's obsessive affection and depicting her presence in various <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> situations.|$|E
25|$|Hogarth {{also takes}} the {{opportunity}} to comment on artistic pretensions. Tied up together in a basket and destined for use as scrap at the trunk-maker are George Turnbull's On Ancient Painting, Hill on Royal Societies, Modern Tragedies, Polticks vol. 9999 and William Lauder's Essay on Milton's Use and Imitation of the Moderns in Paradise Lost, all examples, <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined,</b> {{of the type of}} literature that Hogarth thought fabricated connections between art and politics and sought out aesthetic connections that did not exist. Lauder's work was a hoax that painted Milton as a plagiarist.|$|E
50|$|Castañeda {{started from}} the fact that {{thoughts}} about real things in the world are of a fundamentally similar nature to thoughts about things in the imagination, it is still a thought, and from there he hypothesized an entire realm of abstract objects that included both the <b>real</b> <b>and</b> the <b>imagined.</b> He referred to these objects collectively as guises, and argued that they could be treated as sets of properties. He went on to analyse all of language and perception in terms of these guises, ultimately developing an entire metaphysics based on them.|$|R

25|$|The United States was {{particularly}} apprehensive about the roles (<b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined)</b> played by Imperial Germany in the Western hemisphere. Controlling Tortuga, it had intervened in Haiti (see Luders Affair) and other Caribbean nations at {{several times during}} the previous few decades to exert its influence as a rival power. Germany was increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under its claimed Monroe Doctrine. In the lead-up to the World War I, the strategic importance of the island of Hispaniola, with its manpower, material wealth, and port facilities, was understood by almost all navies operating in the Caribbean, including Germany and the still-neutral United States. Germany had invested in military and intelligence gathering across Hispaniola as part of a wider network of German interest in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1890s through the 1910s.|$|E
25|$|The First Red Scare's origins {{lie in the}} subversive actions (both <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined)</b> {{of foreign}} and leftist {{elements}} in the United States, especially militant followers of Luigi Galleani, and in the attempts of the U.S. government to quell protest and gain favorable public views of America's entering World War I. At {{the end of the}} 19th century and prior to the rise of the Galleanist anarchist movement, the Haymarket affair of 1886 had already heightened the American public's fear of foreign anarchist and radical socialist elements within the budding American workers' movement. In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson established the Committee on Public Information to circulate and distribute anti-German and pro-Allied propaganda and other news. To add to the effectiveness of the Committee, the Bureau of Investigation (the name for the Federal Bureau of Investigation until 1935) disrupted the work of German-American, union, and leftist organizations through the use of raids, arrests, agents provocateurs, and legal prosecution. Revolutionary and pacifist groups, such as the Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW; its members are known as Wobblies), strongly opposed the war. Many leaders of these groups, most notably Eugene V. Debs, were prosecuted for giving speeches urging resistance to the draft. Members of the Ghadar Party were also put on trial in the Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial.|$|E

40|$|The End of Her is a {{collection}} of poetry that centers on ideas of celebrity, nostalgia, pain and healing, and collective memory. The poems depict the lives and times of tragic women: from Eve to Amy Winehouse. The project touches on both the <b>real</b> <b>and</b> the <b>imagined</b> in examining {{what it means to be}} famously tragic, as well as what it means to be a spectator of demise. Interwoven autobiographical pieces reveal the relationship between individual memory and shared history, as the collection positions personal accounts of love and loss in conversation with some of the world’s best-known stories...|$|R

50|$|Philippe Calandre is {{particularly}} interested in architectural photography and still life. In all his series, reality serves as the foundation from which he creates his own worlds where an ambiguity, or perhaps even a confusion, between the <b>real</b> <b>and</b> the <b>imagined</b> settles in. His studies often were used as a springboard to highlight everyday architectural aspects, pulled from their daily lifelessness and given life. Gas stations, then his ‘silos’, which were presented at FIAC in 2001 by Anne Barrault, the Parisian gallery, with whom the artist collaborated from 1999 to 2007, were lifted {{to the realm of}} the supernatural.|$|R

500|$|Juan Manuel de Rosas's {{first term}} as {{governor}} lasted only three years. His rule, assisted by Juan Facundo Quiroga and Estanislao López, was respected {{and he was}} praised {{for his ability to}} maintain harmony between Buenos Aires and the rural areas. The country fell into disorder after Rosas's resignation in 1832, and in 1835 he was once again called to lead the country. He ruled the country not as he did during his first term as governor, but as a dictator, forcing all citizens to support his Federalist regime. According to Nicolas Shumway, Rosas [...] "forced the citizens to wear the red Federalist insignia, and his picture appeared in all public places... Rosas's enemies, <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined,</b> were increasingly imprisoned, tortured, murdered, or driven into exile by the mazorca, a band of spies and thugs supervised personally by Rosas. Publications were censored, and porteño newspapers became tedious apologizers for the regime".|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{said he was}} {{partially}} inspired by the generation of English writers who matured between the wars: [...] "I am fascinated by the life and work of that generation of English writers who were born {{at the beginning of}} the century and reached maturity by the time of World War II. People like Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene and Anthony Powell, obviously, but also less well known writers—Henry Green, Lawrence Durrell, Cyril Connolly and William Gerhardie. The last two in particular lurk closely behind Logan." [...] Both <b>real</b> <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> characters are blended [...] into this context, where historical personages are typically used to concentrate the historical significance of a novel's plot, Mountstuart's encounters with them are superficial, leaving only an impression of both parties' small-mindedness.

After losing his wife and young sons in a plane crash, Vermont professor David Zimmer spends his waking hours mired in grief. Then, watching television one night, he stumbles upon a lost film by silent comedian Hector Mann, and remembers how to laugh [...] . Mann was a comic genius, in trademark white suit and fluttering black moustache. But one morning in 1929 {{he walked out of}} his house and was never heard from again.

Concentrating on Laing’s time spent at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and his part {{in the development of the}} therapeutic communities of the Philadelphia Association (PA) during the 1960 s, this piece illuminates an underexplored dimension to his studies. Beginning with a discussion of Laing’s blueprint for a true asylum this chapter examines investigations of familial worlds. Finally, through exploring the therapeutic pursuits of the PA, including the Archway Community, this chapter demonstrates the importance of investigating alternative spaces of asylum in the deinstitutionalised landscape, from their very imagining to their physical foundations...|$|R
