50|$|RAF Digby {{received}} several German bomber raids during 1941 and extensive damage was suffered. It {{was decided to}} relocate the 12 Group Sector Operations Centre away from further danger and it moved to a luxurious setting {{in the west wing}} of Blankney Hall where it stayed {{for the remainder of the}} war. Several RAF squadrons arrived to serve alongside the Canadians during 1941; No. 92 Squadron RAF and No. 609 Squadron RAF both arrived from RAF Biggin Hill on rotational <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> <b>recuperation</b> <b>leave.</b> There were now so many airmen at RAF Digby that even the two officers' messes could not accommodate them all. Several squadrons commandeered the nearby Ashby Hall as their officers' mess and the hall remained in this role until the end of the war when it fell into disrepair and its estate was broken up.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Fisher, {{exhausted}} by the constant pressure, returned to Moscow for six months of <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> <b>recuperation,</b> <b>leaving</b> Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his return to New York in 1956, he found that his carefully constructed network had been left to disintegrate in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen's radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent on alcohol and prostitutes.|$|R

60|$|As I came {{sputtering}} to {{the surface}} I looked about for some tiny foot- or hand-hold where I might cling {{for a moment of}} <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> <b>recuperation.</b> The cliff itself offered me nothing, so I swam toward the mouth of the fiord.|$|R

2500|$|The Eastern Mandates {{are part}} of the Marshall Islands where Brostrom and the 17th Infantry Division invaded Kwajalein atoll after four months of {{training}} in Hawaii. Under their new leader Major General C. H. Corlett, the amphibious assaults on the 42 islands of the atoll went [...] "most nearly perfect".

50|$|The 25th Infantry Division {{then went}} into <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> <b>recuperation.</b> It had served in {{continuous}} combat longer than any division in the Sixth Army.

But with the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki the war ended, and soldiers of the 25th could land on Japanese soil without taking casualties.|$|R
50|$|After {{marching to}} the Taipale River, Kantola’s men help in {{building}} defenses {{in preparation for}} the anticipated Soviet attack.

The men of the 10th were escorting a wood chopping detail near the base when the Confederates attacked.|$|R
5000|$|Radio Clatterbridge began {{life as a}} {{group of}} boys from a local youth group. As an aid to {{providing}} some vital <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> <b>recuperation,</b> the boys decided to visit sick patients at Clatterbridge General Hospital.

The idea was so popular that it soon became possible to buy permanent gramophones and [...] "broadcast" [...] the songs back to the patients, via a simple land-line system.|$|R
5000|$|... 610 Squadron was {{attached}} to No. 13 Group RAF during the Battle of Britain.

During the Battle of Britain the squadron included Pilot Officer, later Squadron Leader, Constantine Pegge.|$|R
6000|$|A little later, when Nash {{came out}} to make report, she was not very gracious in her manner. [...] "He's pretty badly hurt," [...] he said.

Hovde returned to the squadron as its commander on 10 July. [...] On 19 July, Hovde downed a German Messerschmitt Bf 109 over Augsburg, becoming the group's eighth ace. On 27 July, he was awarded a second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster to his DFC, [...] "for heroism and extraordinary achievement", claiming three victories.|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} years Hart launched a world tour {{in support of the}} record. He performed sold-out concerts in Japan and made numerous promotional appearances in Europe from fall 1986 through mid-1987. However, Hart's tour had to be halted prematurely in July 1987 after the then 25-year-old singer collapsed backstage from exhaustion after a concert in Canada. The nearly four-year cycle of constant touring and recording had caught up with Hart, forcing him into a period of <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> <b>recuperation.</b>|$|R
