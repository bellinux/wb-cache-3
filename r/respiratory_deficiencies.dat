Both IM and DMG-n inhibit plasma membrane H +-ATPase activity while mitochondrial ATPase is relatively non-sensitive to glycinates. No crossresistance to IM and DMG-n was observed...|$|E
40|$|Background Most {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases are}} associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In humans mutations in mitochondrial genes result {{in a range of}} phenotypic outcomes which do not correlate well with the underlying genetic cause. Other neurodegenerative diseases are caused by mutations that affect the function and trafficking of lysosomes, endosomes and autophagosomes. Many of the complexities of these human diseases can be avoided by studying them in the simple eukaryotic model Dictyostelium discoideum. Scope of Review This review describes research using Dictyostelium to study cytopathological pathways underlying a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including mitochondrial, lysosomal and vesicle trafficking disorders. Major Conclusions Generalized mitochondrial <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in Dictyostelium produce a consistent pattern of defective phenotypes that are caused by chronic activation of a cellular energy senso...|$|E

40|$|SummaryAAA proteases {{comprise}} a conserved family of membrane bound ATP-dependent proteases that ensures the quality control of mitochondrial inner-membrane proteins. Inactivation of AAA proteases causes pleiotropic phenotypes in various organisms, including <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> mitochondrial morphology defects, and axonal degeneration in {{hereditary spastic paraplegia}} (HSP). The molecular basis of these defects, however, remained unclear. Here, we describe a regulatory role of an AAA protease for mitochondrial protein synthesis in yeast. The mitochondrial ribosomal protein MrpL 32 is processed by the m-AAA protease, allowing its association with preassembled ribosomal particles and completion of ribosome assembly {{in close proximity to}} the inner membrane. Maturation of MrpL 32 and mitochondrial protein synthesis are also impaired in a HSP mouse model lacking the m-AAA protease subunit paraplegin, demonstrating functional conservation. Our findings therefore rationalize mitochondrial defects associated with m-AAA protease mutants in yeast and shed new light on the mechanism of axonal degeneration in HSP...|$|E

None of them had neurological, cardiac and/or <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Assessments were made after the newborn had been left in an ordinary cot for 30 minutes and after 30 minutes of kangaroo mother care, on three consecutive days. For these evaluations, a heart monitor with a device for non-invasively measuring mean arterial pressure, a sensor for pulse oximetry, a thermometer and a chronometer were utilized. Results: There were no significant changes in mean arterial pressure (p> 0. 05) or heart rate (p> 0. 05) after applying kangaroo mother care.

40|$|Fusion and fission of {{mitochondria}} {{maintain the}} functional integrity of mitochondria and protect against neurodegen-eration, but how mitochondrial dysfunctions trigger neuronal loss remains ill-defined. Prohibitins form large ring complexes {{in the inner}} membrane that are composed of PHB 1 and PHB 2 subunits and are thought to function as membrane scaffolds. In Caenorhabditis elegans, prohibitin genes affect aging by moderating fat metabolism and energy production. Knockdown experiments in mammalian cells link the function of prohibitins to membrane fusion, as they were found to stabilize the dynamin-like GTPase OPA 1 (optic atrophy 1), which mediates mitochondrial inner membrane fusion and cristae morphogenesis. Mutations in OPA 1 are associated with dominant optic atrophy characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, highlighting the importance of OPA 1 function in neurons. Here, we show that neuron-specific inactivation of Phb 2 in the mouse forebrain causes extensive neurodegeneration associated with behavioral impairments and cognitive deficiencies. We observe early onset tau hyperphosphorylation and filament formation in the hippocampus, demonstrating a direct link between mitochondrial defects and tau pathology. Loss of PHB 2 impairs the stability of OPA 1, affects mitochondrial ultrastructure, and induces the perinuclear clustering of mitochondria in hippocampal neurons.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the {{incidence}} of infections due to Candida glabrata, a yeast with intrinsic low susceptibility to azole antifungals, has increased markedly. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) associated with esistance to azoles frequently occurs in vitro in this species. In order to specify the relationships between respiration and azole susceptibility, the effects of respiratory chain inhibitors on a wild-type isolate of C. glabrata were evaluated. Respiration of blastoconidia was immediately blocked after extemporaneous addition of potassium cyanide, whereas a 4 -h preincubation was required for sodium azide. Antifungal susceptibility determined by a disk diffusion method on Casitone agar containing sodium azide showed {{a significant decrease in}} the susceptibility to azoles. Biweekly subculturing on Casitone agar supplemented with sodium azide was therefore performed. This resulted after 40 passages in the isolation of a respiration-deficient mutant, as suggested by its lack of growth on glycerol-containing agar. This <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of blastoconidia stained with rhodamine 123 and by oxygraphy. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy and restriction endonuclease analysis of the mtDNA of mutant cells demonstrated the mitochondrial origin of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Finally, this mutant exhibited cross-resistance to all the azoles tested. In conclusion, blockage of respiration in C. glabrata induces decreased susceptibility to azoles, culminating in azole resistance due to the deletion of mtDNA. This mechanism could explain the induction of petite mutations by azole antifungals which have been demonstrated to act directly on the mitochondrial respiratory chain...|$|R

A human homologue of Mtg 1 p capable of partially rescuing the <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> of a yeast mtg 1 mutant {{has also been}} localized in mitochondria. Mtg 1 p {{is a member of}} a family of GTPases with largely unknown functions. The <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> of mtg 1 mutants stems from a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mutations in the 21 S rRNA locus are able to suppress the translation defect of mtg 1 null mutants. This points to the 21 S rRNA or the large ribosomal subunit as the most likely target of Mtg 1 p action. The presence of mature size 15 S and 21 S mitochondrial rRNAs in mtg 1 mutants excludes Mtg 1 p from being involved in transcription or processing of these RNAs. More likely, Mtg 1 p functions in assembly of the large ribosomal subunit.

Treatment of the patient with coenzyme Q 10 and succinate resulted in clinical improvement of respiratory function, consistent with the <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Restriction enzyme analysis of the muscle mtDNA revealed a 4. 9 -kilobase deletion in 50 % of the mtDNA molecules. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the deletion was present in the patient's muscle but not in her lymphocytes or platelets. Furthermore, the deletion was not present in the muscle or platelets of two sisters. Hence, the mutation probably occurred in the patient's somatic cells. Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA revealed a 4977 -base-pair deletion removing four genes for subunits of complex I, one gene for complex IV, two genes for complex V, and five genes for tRNAs, which paralleled the respiratory enzymes affected in the disease. A 13 -base-pair direct repeat was observed upstream from both breakpoints. Relative to the direction of heavy-strand replication, the first repeat was retained and the second repeat was deleted, suggesting a slip-replication mechanism. Sequence analysis of the human mtDNA revealed many direct repeats of 10 base pairs or greater, indicating that this mechanism could account for other reported deletions. We postulate that the prevalence of direct repeats in the mtDNA is a consequence of the guanine-cytosine bias of the heavy and light strands...|$|E

Traditional ex situ remediation processes (e. g., adsorption or ion exchange) are often limited by poor extraction efficiency, inhibition by competing ions and production of large volumes of produced waste. Microbial Tc(VII) reduction provides an attractive alternative in situ remediation strategy since the reduced end-product Tc(IV) precipitates as TcO 2, a highly insoluble hydrous oxide. Despite its potential benefits, the molecular mechanism of microbial Tc(VII) reduction remains poorly understood. The main goal of the proposed DOENABIR research project {{is to determine the}} molecular mechanism of microbial Tc(VII) reduction. Random mutagenesis studies in our lab have resulted in generation of a set of six Tc(VII) reduction-deficient mutants of Shewanella oneidensis.

To date, in-depth study of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following pulmonary {{exposure to}} toxins is hampered {{by the lack of}} an appropriate animal model. To this end, we established the pig as a large animal model for the comprehensive study of the multifarious clinical manifestations of pulmonary ricinosis. Here, we report for the first time, the monitoring of barometric whole body plethysmography for pulmonary function tests in non-anesthetized ricin-treated pigs. Up to 30  h post-exposure, as a result of progressing hypoxemia and to prevent carbon dioxide retention, animals exhibited a compensatory response of elevation in minute volume, attributed mainly to a large elevation in respiratory rate with minimal response in tidal volume. This response was followed by decompensation, manifested by a decrease in minute volume and severe hypoxemia, refractory to oxygen treatment. Radiological evaluation revealed evidence of early diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates while hemodynamic parameters remained unchanged, excluding cardiac failure as an explanation for respiratory insufficiency. Ricin-intoxicated pigs suffered from increased lung permeability accompanied by cytokine storming. Histological studies revealed lung tissue insults that accumulated over time and led to diffuse alveolar damage. Charting the decline in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in a mechanically ventilated pig confirmed that ricin-induced respiratory damage complies with the accepted diagnostic criteria for ARDS.

In this study, we investigated whether CHD-heterotaxy patients with CD may have worse postsurgical outcomes. MethodsWe examined postsurgical outcome in 13 heterotaxy-CHD patients with CD (25 surgeries), compared with 14 heterotaxy-CHD patients without CD (27 surgeries). Outcome data were collected for each surgery, including respiratory complications, tracheostomy, use of inhaled β-agonists or nitric oxide, length of hospital stay, days on ventilator, and death. ResultsThe CD versus the no-CD CHD cohorts had similar Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery- 1 risk categories, repair track, age at surgery, and follow-up evaluation times. Respiratory complications (76 % vs 37 %; P = . 006), need for tracheostomy (16 % vs 0 %; P = . 047), and use of inhaled β-agonists (64 % vs 11 %; P = . 0001) all were increased significantly in heterotaxy-CHD patients with CD. No significant differences were detected in postoperative hospital stay, days on mechanical ventilation, or surgical mortality. A trend toward increased mortality for the CD group beyond the postoperative period was observed (33 % vs 0 %; P = . 055) in patients younger than age 10 years. ConclusionsOur findings showed that heterotaxy-CHD patients with CD may have increased risks for <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Overall, there was a trend toward increased mortality in CD patients with intermediate follow-up evaluation. Because β-agonists are known to increase ciliary beat frequency, presurgical screening for CD and perioperative treatment of CD patients with inhaled β-agonists may improve postoperative outcomes and survival...|$|E
40|$|It was {{possible}} to quantitate the tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) oxidase reaction in Azotobacter vinelandii strain O using turbidimetrically standarized resting cell suspensions. The Q(O 2) value obtained for whole cell oxidation of ascorbate-TMPD appeared to reflect the full measure of the high respiratory oxidative capability usually exhibited by this genera of organisms. The Q(O 2) value for the TMPD oxidase reaction ranged from 1, 700 to 2, 000 and this value was equivalent to that obtained for the oxidation of the growth substrate, e. g., acetate. The kinetic analyses for TMPD oxidation by whole cells {{was similar to that}} obtained for the "particulate" A. vinelandii electron transport particle, that fraction which TMPD oxidase activity is exclusively associated with. Under the conditions used, there appeared to be no permeability problems; TMPD (reduced by ascorbate) readily penetrated the cell and oxidized at a rate comparable to that of the growth substrate. This, however, was not true for the oxidation of another electron donor, 2, 6 -dichloroindophenol, whose whole cell Q(O 2) values, under comparable conditions, were twofold lower. The TMPD oxidase activity in A. vinelandii whole cells was found to be affected by the physiological growth conditions, and resting cells obtained from cells grown on sucrose, either under nitrogen-fixing conditions or on nitrate as the combined nitrogen source, exhibited low TMPD oxidase rates. Such low TMPD oxidase rates were also noted for chemically induced pleomorphic A. vinelandii cells, which suggests that modified growth conditions can (i) alter the nature of the intracellular terminal oxidase formed (or induced), or (ii) alter surface permeability, depending upon the growth conditions used. Preliminary studies on the quantitative TMPD oxidation reaction in mutant whole cells of both Azotobacter and a well-known Mucor bacilliformis strain AY 1, deficient in cytochrome oxidase activity, showed this assay can be very useful for detecting <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in the metabolism of whole cells...|$|E

Mutant 2960 was Fix- and formed green nodules on soybean, whereas strain 2606 ::Tn 5 - 20 had ca. 4 % of wild-type Fix activity and formed white nodules. Cytochrome oxidase assays (Nadi tests) showed a negative reaction with both mutants, indicating a functional deficiency of cytochrome c or its terminal oxidase or both. However, the mutants grew well under aerobic conditions on minimal media with different carbon sources. Furthermore, mutant 2960 had a reduced activity in hydrogen uptake, was unable to grow anaerobically with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor and 2960 -infected soybean nodules contained little, if any, functional leghemoglobin. Southern blot analysis showed that a B. japonicum heme biosynthesis mutant [strain LO 505 : O'Brian MR, Kirshbom PM, Maier RJ (1987) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 84 : 8390 – 8393] had its mutation close to the Tn 5 insertion site of our mutant 2606 ::Tn 5 - 20.

No comprehensive studies have been reported on large cohorts of patients with combined <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> addressing the role of nuclear genes affecting mitochondrial protein synthesis to date. We investigated a cohort of 52 patients with combined <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> without causative mitochondrial DNA mutations, rearrangements or depletion, to determine whether a defect in mitochondrial translation defines the pathomechanism of their clinical disease. We followed a combined approach of sequencing known nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis (EFG 1, EFTu, EFTs, MRPS 16, TRMU), as well as performing in vitro functional studies in 22 patient cell lines. The majority of our patients were children...|$|R
40|$|Cells of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 grown aerobically {{with added}} {{thiamine}} (1 microgram. ml- 1) in a vitamin B 6 -free medium contained no detectable heme precursors, such as delta-aminolevulinate, coproporphyrin III, or protoporphyrin IX. The deficiency in heme precursors in the thiamine-grown cells {{was accompanied by}} previously reported phenomena, i. e., growth depression, vitamin B 6 <b>deficiency,</b> and <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> due to a marked decrease {{in the activities of}} heme-containing enzymes and cytochrome level (I. Nakamura et al., FEBS Lett. 62 : 354 - 358, 1976). It has been reported that all of the effects of thiamine are abolished by adding pyridoxine to the medium. delta-Aminolevulinate was found to have quite similar effects to those of pyridoxine, except that growth was partially improved by delta-aminolevulinate, whereas it was fully restored by pyridoxine. Incubation of the thiamine-grown cells with delta-aminolevulinate resulted in the appearance of the heme precursors and the heme-containing enzymes. Consistent with the lowered amount of vitamin B 6, the thiamine-grown cells had a lowered activity of delta-aminolevulinate synthase, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme. Not only the holoenzyme activity but also the apoenzyme activity was very low in these cells. These results indicate that the thiamine-induced vitamin B 6 deficiency brings about the decrease in delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity, which leads to heme deficiency and therefore to <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cells try to {{counteract}} mitochondrial <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiencies</b> via {{various kinds of}} largely unknown compensatory mechanisms, which {{play a central role}} in determining the extent of tissue-specific defects leading to disease phenotypes. In this study, we directly disrupted mitochondrial protein synthesis in mice by deleting the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (Dars 2) gene in a tissue- specific manner. We generated DARS 2 deficiency in three different tissues (heart, skeletal muscle and forebrain neurons) and followed the dynamics and extent of pathological changes that occurred. Deficiency of this essential protein leads to severe deregulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis in both heart and skeletal muscle. Yet, mitochondrial stress responses, like increased biogenesis, decreased autophagy, upregulation of mitochondrial unfolded protein response and mitokine FGF 21, are only observed in DARS 2 -deficient cardiomyocytes. Surprisingly, the initiation of these stress responses is stemming from perturbed mitochondrial proteostasis, rather than the <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Skeletal muscle, on the other hand, has intrinsic protective mechanisms that make it better equipped for folding and turnover of mitochondrial proteins, as well as slow turnover of mitochondrial transcripts that is coupled with possible upregulation of muscle regeneration. As a result, skeletal muscle is able to cope with increased levels of unassembled proteins better. Although DARS 2 depletion leads to very strong, deleterious <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> in heart and skeletal muscle, causing animals to die within 7 - 8 weeks, its deficiency in forebrain neurons seems to have a milder effect that takes much longer time to develop. Defective mitochondrial translation in forebrain neurons caused abnormal behavior, and severe forebrain atrophy, which is caused by neuronal cell apoptosis and accompanied by activation of inflammatory responses such as microgliosis and reactive astrogliosis. Surprisingly, neurodegeneration occurred in an age-dependent manner and affected cortex and hippocampal regions differently...|$|R
40|$|Heteroplasmic {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) mutations (mutations present only in {{a subset}} of cellular mtDNA copies) arise de novo during the normal ageing process or may be maternally inherited in pedigrees with mitochondrial disease syndromes. A pathogenic mtDNA mutation causes <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> only if the fraction of mutated mtDNA exceeds a certain threshold level. These mutations often undergo apparently random mitotic segregation and the levels of normal and mutated mtDNA can vary considerably between cells of the same tissue. In human ageing, segregation of somatic mtDNA mutations leads to mosaic <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> {{in a variety of}} tissues, such as brain, heart and skeletal muscle. A similar pattern of mutation segregation with mosaic <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> is seen in patients with mitochondrial disease syndromes caused by inherited pathogenic mtDNA mutations. We have experimentally addressed the role of mosaic <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> in ageing and mitochondrial disease by creating mouse chimeras with a mixture of normal and respiratory chain-deficient neurons in cerebral cortex. We report here that a low proportion (> 20 %) of respiratory chain-deficient neurons in the forebrain are sufficient to cause symptoms, whereas premature death of the animal occurs only if the proportion is high (> 60 – 80 %). The presence of neurons with normal respiratory chain function does not only prevent mortality but also delays the age at which onset of disease symptoms occur. Unexpectedly, respiratory chain-deficient neurons have adverse effect on normal adjacent neurons and induce trans-neuronal degeneration. In summary, our study defines the minimal threshold level of respiratory chain-deficient neurons needed to cause symptoms and also demonstrate that neurons with normal respiratory chain function ameliorate disease progression. Finally, we show that respiratory chain-deficient neurons induce death of normal neurons by a trans-neuronal degeneration mechanism. These findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of mosaic <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> in ageing and mitochondrial disease...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{isolation}} and characterization of a mutator mutant in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This mutator is of extrachromosomal, very likely mitochondrial, inheritance and acts exclusively on mitochondrial mtDNA. It greatly enhances {{the frequency of}} spontaneous mitochondrial drug-resistance mutants compared to the wild type, {{but it is not}} obligatory for their occurrence. In contrast, mitochondrial respiratory deficient mutants can only be isolated from mutator strains. It could be shown that this mutator induces point mutations as well as deletions in the mitochondrial genome which lead to <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency.</b> This mutator might prove to have a novel function encoded by the mtDNA...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} mtDNA {{variation in}} various cancer samples, comparing them with normal tissue controls, and identified mutations and polymorphisms, both known and novel, in mitochondrial tRNA, rRNA and protein genes. Most remarkably, in a colon cancer sample {{we have found}} the A 3243 G mutation in the homoplasmic state. This mutation is known to cause severe mitochondrial dysfunction and, until now, has not been found in cancer cells, nor in the homoplasmic state in living subjects. The mutation was absent from normal tissue, suggesting that mtDNA mutation and resulting <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{played a role in}} carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The core {{mitochondrial}} RNA polymerase is a single-subunit {{enzyme that}} in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is encoded by the nuclear RPO 41 gene. It is an evolutionary {{descendant of the}} bacteriophage RNA polymerases, but it includes an additional unconserved N-terminal extension (NTE) domain that is unique to the organellar enzymes. This domain mediates interactions between the polymerase and accessory regulatory factors, such as yeast Sls 1 p and Nam 1 p. Previous studies demonstrated that deletion of the entire NTE domain results only in a temperature-dependent <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Several sequences related to the pentatricopeptide (PPR) motifs were identified in silico in Rpo 41 p, three of which {{are located in the}} NTE domain. PPR repeat proteins are a large family of organellar RNA-binding factors, mostly involved in posttranscriptional gene expression mechanisms. To study their function, we analyzed the phenotype of strains bearing Rpo 41 p variants where each of these motifs was deleted. We found that deletion of any of the three PPR motifs in the NTE domain does not affect respiratory growth at normal temperature, and it results in a moderate decrease in mtDNA stability. Steady-state levels of COX 1 and COX 2 mRNAs are also moderately affected. Only the deletion of the second motif results in a partial <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency,</b> manifested only at elevated temperature. Our results thus indicate that the PPR motifs do not play an essential role in the function of the NTE domain of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase...|$|R
