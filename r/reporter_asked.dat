25|$|Bat Masterson {{became more}} widely {{known as a}} gunfighter {{as a result of}} a {{practical}} joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the <b>reporter</b> <b>asked</b> Dr. W.S. Cockrell about mankillers. Dr. Cockrell pointed to a young man nearby and said it was Bat and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with several lurid tales about Bat's exploits, and the reporter wrote them up for the New York Sun. The story was then widely reprinted in papers all over the country. Cockrell subsequently apologized to Bat, who insisted he was not even in Gunnison at the time.|$|E

[...] René Jalbert, the sergeant-at-arms who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that [...] "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror." [...] Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a [...] "culture of passivity" [...] prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: [...] "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Record {{shut down}} in 1947, The Inquirer {{announced}} that it was now an [...] independent newspaper and, frustrated with corruption in Philadelphia, supported Democratic candidates in the 1951 election. While Walter Annenberg had made The Inquirer independent he did use the paper to attack people he disliked. Sometimes when a person or group angered Annenberg, they were blacklisted and not mentioned anywhere within The Inquirer. People on the blacklist were even airbrushed out of images. People who were on the list at one point included Nicholas Katzenbach, Ralph Nader, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and the basketball team the Philadelphia Warriors, who were not mentioned for an entire season. In 1966, Walter Annenberg used The Inquirer to attack Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Milton Shapp. During a press conference, an Inquirer <b>reporter</b> <b>asked</b> Shapp if he had ever been a patient in a mental hospital; having never been a patient, Shapp said no. The next day's headline in The Inquirer read [...] "Shapp Denies Ever having been in a Mental Home." [...] Shapp attributed his loss of the election to Annenberg's attack campaign.|$|E

[...] He will probably continue a good subject for some time." [...] Hanna, having declined the position of Postmaster General, secured appointment to the Senate when McKinley made Ohio's aging senior senator, John Sherman, his Secretary of State. Until 1913, state legislatures, not the people, elected senators, and so Hanna had to seek election to a full term when the Ohio General Assembly met in January 1898. [...] Hanna campaigned in the 1897 legislative election, and was elected to the Senate in his own right the following January, in a very close vote. Davenport drew cartoons against Hanna in the senatorial race. [...] Nevertheless, when he attended the legislature's meeting in Columbus, he wore a Hanna button, and seemed happy after Hanna's triumph. [...] When asked why, he replied, [...] "that insures me six more years at him, and he's a good subject".|$|E

Ice branched out into the film industry with an appearance in the film , which he later called [...] "one of the coolest experiences" [...] of his career. Ice was very secretive about his personal life, {{with the intention of}} protecting his family. When a Dallas Morning News <b>reporter</b> <b>asked</b> Ice what his mother's profession was, he replied, [...] "None of your fucking business." [...] In an attempt to rectify this, his former label wrote a fake biography in his name and tried to pass it off as his official life story without his knowledge. While on tour in 1991, Ice found out that SBK had instigated the publication of the biography which detailed false biographical information, including claims that he had attended school with Luther Campbell and exaggerating his living conditions in Miami, which Ice later had to debunk by himself.|$|E
500|$|Presley and his wife, meanwhile, {{had become}} {{increasingly}} distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair {{he had with}} Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion. He often {{raised the possibility of}} her moving into Graceland, saying that he was likely to leave Priscilla. The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla relates that when she told him, Presley [...] "grabbed... and forcefully made love to" [...] her, declaring, [...] "This is how a real man makes love to his woman." [...] Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him. Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18. Presley became depressed after the break up of his marriage. According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage [...] "was a blow from which he never recovered." [...] During a press conference in 1972, a <b>reporter</b> <b>asked</b> Presley {{whether or not he was}} satisfied with his image, Presley replied [...] "Well, the human being is one thing. The image is another. It's very hard to live up to an image." ...|$|E
500|$|Trott's {{sense of}} humour was well known. [...] He {{originated}} a persistent myth that {{workers at the}} Sheffield steelworks generated extra plumes of smoke when the Australians were batting at nearby Bramall Lane, {{in order to reduce}} the quality of the light. [...] When Australia played the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in the United States, a local <b>reporter</b> <b>asked</b> Trott why Australians did not play baseball. He replied: [...] "Running around in circles makes us giddy." [...] When Trott, a humble postman, met the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) in 1896, his teammates admired his natural ease of manner in the presence of royalty. [...] Given a cigar by the Prince, Trott simply smoked it, to the surprise of those who thought a royal souvenir worth keeping. [...] With this in mind, Trott later played a practical joke when he returned home. Gathering cigar butts on board the ship before disembarking in Australia, he distributed them to his friends claiming it was the one given to him by the Prince of Wales; he asked the recipients not to tell others in case it provoked jealousy. [...] Trott was extremely fond of hats; a teammate described him as [...] "...the only man I have seen who, in the nude, had to have a hat on his head".|$|E
