25|$|On March 7, 1990, {{four people}} were killed and another 162 injured when the rear three cars of six-car train #61 derailed after leaving 30th Street Station {{westbound}} at 8:20a.m. It is believed that one of the traction motors dropped out of the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> on the third car (M3) somewhere between 15th and 30th street stations, and it became entangled in a switch immediately upon leaving 30th street station. The front truck of the fourth car (M3 #818) followed the third car, while the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> of the fourth car took the diverging track, causing the car to shear halfway upon striking the steel pillars separating the tracks beyond the switch.|$|E
25|$|Each power car had a 1,200hp V16 Winton 201-A engine, generator, {{and a pair}} of two-axle powered trucks. The <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> of {{the first}} power car and the lead truck of the second power car carried a span bolster to which both power cars were articulated, so they made one unified {{locomotive}} of B-B+B-B configuration and a total of 2,400hp (1,800kW).|$|E
25|$|All freight units, and the CLC-built Model CPA/B-16-4 were {{designed}} with a B-B wheel arrangement, while passenger units (in {{addition to having}} different gearing) featured an unusual B-A1A wheel configuration, as the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> required an extra unpowered axle to help distribute {{the weight of the}} steam generator. Most C-liners were fitted out with electrical generators and traction motors manufactured by Westinghouse Electric.|$|E

500|$|The Britannia Class {{was based}} on several {{previous}} LMS locomotive designs,and also significantly influenced by the Bulleid SR Pacifics, notably in the boiler and <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> design, incorporating the best practices in locomotive technology as regards labour-saving and lowering maintenance costs; various weight-saving measures also increased the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive on the British Railways network. [...] The Britannias received a positive reception from their crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving them favourable reports as regards performance. [...] However, trials {{in some areas of}} the British Railway network returned negative feedback, primarily due to indifferent operation of the locomotive, with its effects on adhering to timetables.|$|E
500|$|In late 1975 J. David Ingles {{called the}} SDP40Fs the [...] "stars of Amtrak's long-distance trains," [...] but {{operating}} crews {{reported that the}} locomotives rode poorly compared to the E-units they had replaced. Even as Amtrak and EMD investigated the ride quality, the SDP40F {{was involved in a}} series of derailments which would culminate in an abrupt end to its career as a passenger locomotive. Between 1974–1976 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) identified thirteen separate incidents for which the locomotive was responsible. While none of the incidents were serious, their frequency was a major concern. Most of the derailments occurred on trains with two SDP40Fs on the front and at least one trailing baggage car. While the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> of the second locomotive and the front truck of the baggage car were pinpointed as the source of the derailment, the actual cause of the derailments was unclear.|$|E
60|$|To {{those who}} were in the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> there was only a {{tremendous}} shock, a tremendous crash, and a sudden full stop. What happened to the trucks in front of the engine is more interesting. The first, which contained the materials and tools of the breakdown gang and the guard who was watching the line, was flung into the air and fell bottom upwards on the embankment. (I do not know what befell the guard, but it seems probable that he was killed.) The next, an armoured car crowded with the Durban Light Infantry, was carried on twenty yards and thrown over on its side, scattering its occupants in a shower on the ground. The third wedged itself across the track, half on and half off the rails. The rest of the train kept to the metals.|$|E

5000|$|The C1a Class were {{a type of}} 4-4-4 steam {{locomotive}} built for the Philadelphia and Reading Railway in 1915. Four locomotives were built, road numbers #110-113. They used front and <b>rear</b> <b>trucks</b> that were effectively identical. During a year of operation, they proved to be quite unstable; after that year, they were rebuilt to 4-4-2 [...] "Atlantic" [...] locomotives, reclassified as P7sa, and renumbered #350-353.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was all}} dark to Dick. He {{could only}} smell the camels, the hay-bales, the cooking, the smoky fires, and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood, where he had dropped from the train, {{shouting}} for George. There was a sound of light- hearted kicking on the iron skin of the <b>rear</b> <b>trucks,</b> with squealing and grunting. George was unloading the mules.|$|R
60|$|The Boers {{held their}} fire until the train reached {{that part of}} the track nearest to their position. Standing on a box in the rear {{armoured}} truck I had an excellent view-through my glasses. The long brown rattling serpent with the rifles bristling from its spotted sides crawled closer to the rocky hillock on which the scattered black figures of the enemy showed clearly. Suddenly three wheeled things appeared on the crest, and within a second a bright flash of light--like a heliograph, but much yellower--opened and shut ten or twelve times. Then two much larger flashes; no smoke nor yet any sound, and a bustle and stir among the little figures. So much for the hill. Immediately over the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> of the train a huge white ball of smoke sprang into being and tore out into a cone like a comet. Then came, the explosions of the near guns and the nearer shell. The iron sides of the truck tanged with a patter of bullets. There was a crash {{from the front of the}} train and half a dozen sharp reports. The Boers had opened fire on us at 600 yards with two large field guns, a Maxim firing small shells in a stream, and from riflemen lying on the ridge. I got down from my box into the cover of the armoured sides of the car without forming any clear thought. Equally involuntarily, it seems that the driver put on full steam, as the enemy had intended. The train leapt forward, ran the gauntlet of the guns, which now filled the air with explosions, swung round the curve of the hill, ran down a steep gradient, and dashed into a huge stone which awaited it on the line at a convenient spot.|$|E

50|$|One Burlington Northern Railroad SDP45 (photo of BN 6599) was {{retrofitted}} with an articulated four-axle truck by EMD, converting {{it to an}} A1A-B+B wheel arrangement. The middle {{traction motor}} in the lead truck was removed {{and placed in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>truck.</b> The <b>rear</b> <b>truck,</b> called the HT-BB, for High Traction B+B arrangement, was tested successfully (closeup of HT-BB truck) but advances in traction engines obviated the need for four axle trucks. This testing was not related {{to the development of the}} HTCR three-axle radial truck first seen under SD60 EMD 3 and SD60MACs, and made standard on the early SD70 series.|$|E

50|$|A classic Tuck is {{one that}} was {{primarily}} used in the 1980s and 90s. However some modern events, such as the MT Tabor Challenge in Portland Oregon, require this tuck to increase the difficulty on mellow hills. The tuck involves placing both feet {{at the front of}} the board, touching with one foot slightly behind the other. The rider then crouches down somewhat similar to a modern tuck. This tuck provides a severely reduced amount of control due to the rider having minimal control over the <b>rear</b> <b>trucks.</b> Further the stance has higher aerodynamic drag than other tucks.|$|R

50|$|The design largely {{overcame the}} {{problems}} the Meyer design had with poor sealing on the steam-pipe flexible joints {{by having the}} <b>rear</b> <b>truck,</b> bearing the high-pressure cylinders, mounted on a bearing that permitted only rotation and not any other axes of flexibility. The steam connection, mounted {{in the center of}} this, could seal much more easily since it did not have to allow so much freedom of movement. The front truck, with the low-pressure cylinders, allowed some degree of tilt as well as rotation, and had steam connections from the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> with swivelling and telescoping joints to allow freedom of movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was based}} on the EMD FP9, lengthened to accommodate additional equipment, including a larger train heating steam boiler. Due to the additional weight of the added equipment and the weight restriction on the Park Avenue 97th Street Portal Viaduct, the locomotive was equipped with a three-axle <b>rear</b> <b>truck,</b> giving it an uncommon B-A1A wheel arrangement. The middle axle of the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> was not powered. The Flexicoil type of truck was used at both front and rear, due to this type of truck having more room for fitting the third rail shoes and associated equipment.|$|E

50|$|To date, the {{principal}} {{source of funding}} for the locomotive restoration has been the Santa Clara County Historical Heritage Commission and volunteer fund raising efforts over the years. Approximately, $350,000 has been raised to date. Of this amount $230,000 represents {{the cost of the}} boiler repair done by a professional boiler contractor required by federal and state law. The work on the boiler was begun by Manley Boiler Repair in May 1998. Work continues to progress as 2479's pistons are removed from its cylinders. At the end of October 2008 the CTRC passed a major milestone as 2479's front and <b>rear</b> <b>trucks,</b> the 6 main drivers where reinstalled below the locomotive and the locomotive was lowered to the ground {{for the first time in}} 15 years.|$|R

50|$|On April 14, 2014, three {{locomotives}} and one flatcar were derailed {{likely due to}} collapsing infrastructure at mile 30 (about 3 km from Nairn Centre). There were {{no injuries}} however the spilled diesel from the locomotives required {{the issue of a}} drinking water advisory for the small community. The locomotives that derailed were QGRY 800, QGRY 3800, and HCRY 3011. QGRY 800 made it over the washout and sat upright with its <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> off the tracks, QGRY 3800 ended up off the track and rolled onto its side, while HCRY 3011 remained upright, but sitting on its fuel tank at a 90° to the track with its <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> hanging by the electrical cables.|$|E

5000|$|Shallow {{coiled tubing}} trucks, {{sometimes}} called bobtail units or body load units. These units are used on wells {{that are less}} than 5,000 feet deep and usually are mounted on traditional single steering axle and tandom <b>rear</b> axle semi <b>trucks.</b> Some larger shallow units are mounted on tandem steering and tridem <b>rear</b> axle <b>trucks.</b> These units traditionally use 1" [...] to 1.50" [...] tubing and have 660 CFM air compressors mounted on the truck for self-contained air to keep the well service as economic as possible. An example of a service provider {{of this would be}} Titan Oil and Gas Services.|$|R
5000|$|Komatsu and Dresser Industries {{established}} Komatsu Dresser to make mining {{tractors and}} related equipment in 1988. [...] This 50-50 ownership lasted from September 1988 to August 1994, when Komatsu bought out Dressers share. Komatsus mining products were consolidated {{under the name}} Komatsu Mining Systems in 1997. To prevent brand-name confusion during these corporate changes, the name [...] "Haulpak" [...] {{was used for the}} product line Komatsu began with Dresser. The name [...] "Haulpak" [...] dates back to 1957 when LeTourneau-Westinghouse introduced a range of <b>rear</b> dump <b>trucks</b> known as [...] "Haulpaks". LeTourneau-Westinghouse equipment later became known simply as WABCO equipment in 1967. The name Haulpak was an industry term that eventually became applied to any type of <b>rear</b> dump <b>truck.</b> A detailed history of the development of the Haulpak can be found in Wabco Australia.|$|R

50|$|A lapper is {{a plastic}} cover that is {{fastened}} to the <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> and serves to protect the kingpin when grinding. It also prevents hang-ups by providing a smoother transition for the truck when it hits an obstacle or a metal pipe or round bar.|$|E
50|$|The front {{truck is}} usually mounted on wedged risers to {{increase}} the quickness of the turn, and set up with soft bushings. The <b>rear</b> <b>truck</b> {{on the other hand}} is de-wedged, to reduce the turn, and set up to be stiff, with harder bushings.|$|E
50|$|Also {{unlike the}} Meyer, the front set of water tanks were mounted to the moving truck and moved {{relative}} to the boiler, somewhat reminiscent of a Garratt locomotive. The tanks above the <b>rear</b> <b>truck,</b> and the rear-mounted fuel bunker, were attached to the boiler and superstructure.|$|E

50|$|When used as {{a rolling}} mount, an {{extension}} of the carriage was fitted over the <b>rear</b> <b>trucks</b> to allow the ammunition car behind the mount to place ammunition on the shot truck which was then manually run up to the breech for loading. In an emplacement this extension was removed and ammunition hoisted up through a hatch {{on the floor of the}} mount, between the shot truck rails, from an ammunition car on the outer track and then lowered onto the shot truck. An estimated twelve men were required to ram the shell. It used the German naval system of ammunition where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first. The existence of a shell with 55 km range must be regarded as unconfirmed, the longest engagement recorded for any of these guns was 44 km during the bombardment of Dunkerque by Batterie Pommern in Flanders in 1917—8.|$|R
