5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand <b>running</b> <b>board</b> of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the class}} were fitted with cab signal equipment, the {{electronics}} for which were largely contained in a wood box affixed to the right-hand side <b>running</b> <b>board</b> {{in front of the}} reversing gear and aft of the smokebox.|$|E
25|$|From 2014, the Vale of Rheidol railway, {{with the}} help of an EU-funded grant, {{converted}} the old platofrm 1 of the Carmarthen branch to a reduced height. This now allows customers to board coaches from the level of the <b>running</b> <b>board,</b> as opposed to from ground level. The access is invaluable to passengers who have mobility issues. This does not allow wheelchairs to be wheeled onto coaches, but the company is working on a solution by adapting some of their rolling stock for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{car design}} was {{evolving}} rapidly {{to become more}} sleek and aerodynamic. It eliminated the need for <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> The first automobile designed without <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> was the 1936 Cord. It changed the attitude towards <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> for many years ahead.|$|R
50|$|Before the 2003 {{model year}} ended, Ford updated the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> on Expeditions {{equipped}} with the Eddie Bauer trim. Earlier in the model year, Eddie Bauer models had received standard black <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> Toward {{the end of the}} model year, Arizona beige <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> were re-introduced to complement the Arizona beige body work which came standard on Eddie Bauer. Body colored <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> had previously been offered on the first-generation Expedition from 2000 to 2002.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1930s, {{in order}} to ease maintenance, {{modifications}} {{were made to the}} <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> and brake gear of the CFB locomotives. The former involved mounting the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> higher, thereby getting rid of the driving wheel fairings. This gave the locomotives a much more American rather than British appearance.|$|R
25|$|The Kennedy {{assassination}} spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, {{an agent}} protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was {{riding in the}} car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> of the car he was riding on and jumped {{onto the back of}} the President's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.|$|E
25|$|The six-track EP was {{released}} in 1997, and set them off on a small club tour around northeast America. Shortly before their first tour as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Brantley left the group {{and was replaced by}} John Fulton. During this time period, The Dillinger Escape Plan gained notoriety in the hardcore punk scene for the intensity of their performances. Their performances were increasingly wild, and often violent. These elaborate performances, as well as the creative, technical approach of their music led a record executive of Relapse Records to offer the band a multi-record contract. The band agreed to the contract, and recorded their second EP with Relapse titled Under the <b>Running</b> <b>Board.</b> Shortly after its release, Fulton left the band over creative differences. The three-song EP release served to bolster anticipation for their 1999 full-length release, Calculating Infinity.|$|E
25|$|These small 0-4-0 tank engines {{were and}} are the {{standard}} shunter locomotives of the system, built between 1927 and 1937 by the firm of Breda in Milan. They have short side tanks, a rear coal bunker, and a unified, oval dome containing the steam dome inside a larger sand dome. This arrangement, popular worldwide in nations that favored the sand dome, helped both to insulate the steam dome {{and to keep the}} sand dry with the warmth. Large, prominent builder's plates adorn the domes. They utilise Walschaerts valve gear with piston valves and superheating, and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the <b>running</b> <b>board,</b> including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive's important running gear more obvious.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} film, The Love Bug, {{the original}} racing stripes {{differ from those}} in later movies; the stripes do not cover the valances or louvers {{of the car and}} the blue is a lighter shade. Also, Herbie features color-keyed <b>running</b> <b>boards,</b> while in later films the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> are standard black.|$|R

25|$|Having {{broken through}} the barrier, the truck, driving in a zigzag fashion, knocked down random {{members of the}} crowd milling about on the {{pavement}} and in the three traffic lanes on the seaward side of the Promenade. The driver tried {{to stay on the}} pavement—returning to the traffic lanes only when blocked by a bus shelter or pavilion—thus increasing the number of deaths. After reaching the Hotel Negresco, the progress of the truck, already travelling more slowly, was further slowed down by a passing cyclist, whose attempts to open the cabin door were abandoned after being threatened with a gun through the window; followed by a motorcyclist, in pursuit from the Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen, who threw his scooter under the front wheels of the truck at the intersection with rue Meyerbeer, striking blows at the driver from the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> before being struck with the butt of the driver's gun, suffering moderate injuries from falling off the truck's side. The driver fired several shots at police from his 7.65mm firearm, close to the Hotel Negresco, as police arrived; they returned fire with their 9mm Sig Sauer handguns, gave chase to the vehicle and attempted to disable it.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1915, Bob Ashley {{attempted}} {{to break his}} brother John out of jail. Entering the jailer's house, Bob Ashley shot Deputy Sheriff Wilber W. Hendrickson at point-blank range and left with his jail keys. He then ran from {{the house to the}} garage where gang members had left him a getaway car. When he found he was unable to drive the particular car left for him, he {{attempted to}} force several men at gunpoint to drive the car for him. Each of the men claimed to not know how to drive the car either so Bob Ashley jumped on the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> of a passing truck and forced the driver, T.H. Duckett, to take him out of town. A deputy, officer J.R. Riblet, spotted Ashley and gave chase. When the truck suddenly stalled {{in the middle of the}} street, a shootout occurred resulting in the deaths of both Bob Ashley and Riblet. Angered by Bob's killing spree, several thousand Miami residents threatened the jailhouse and talked of lynching John Ashley in his cell. It was only after police paraded the body of Bob Ashley though the streets that the mob dispersed.|$|E
500|$|On April 16, 2009, a Georgia Tech student {{riding on}} the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> of the Ramblin' Wreck fell and {{suffered}} severe head injuries hospitalizing the student for four days. [...] Almost a year later, the student filed suit against Georgia Tech and an auto shop responsible for installing handles {{on the roof of}} the car. [...] The lawsuit cites the failure of the auto shop's handles as the reason for the fall and claims the University promoted the unsafe use of a vehicle by students. In September 2013, the student injured in the April 2009 accident, won a settlement of $1.36 million from the Georgia Board of Regents and Eco-Clean, Inc.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourteen}} class F6 locomotives {{were not}} delivered from their builder, the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until 1929–1930. In 1931, eight sister locomotives of class F6-a were delivered; these differed in few aspects {{but can be}} distinguished by the straight <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> of the F6-a, {{in contrast to the}} stepped <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> of the F6.|$|R

2500|$|On 18 November 2007, after {{claiming}} {{the collection of}} more than 7 million signatures (including that of Umberto Bossi) demanding that the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano call a fresh election, Berlusconi announced from the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> of a car in a crowded Piazza San Babila in Milan that Forza Italia would soon merge or transform into The People of Freedom party, also known as the PdL (Il Popolo della Libertà). Berlusconi also stated that this new political movement could include the participation of other parties.

2500|$|In 1931 the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> {{was reduced}} {{and a new}} {{straight}} eight-cylinder [...] engine and 90bhp. Aesthetically, the Series 60 remained almost unchanged and the same fact occurred also in the following year. In 1931 and 1932 they were produced 55,135 examples.|$|E
2500|$|Originally the Series 60 had a six-cylinder [...] engine, {{developing}} 99bhp at 2,800 rpm. It had, at {{the beginning}} of the generation, a full length <b>running</b> <b>board</b> denoting the top model for Buick at the time. In 1930, GM built 38,180 cars. The bodystyles available were torpedo, sedan, coupe, and roadster convertible, using GM's [...] "B-body" [...] platform.|$|E

50|$|Like their {{predecessor}} condensing locomotives, these tender locomotives were {{equipped with}} sheet-metal casing {{above and below}} the <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> This was to protect the motion and bearings as well as working parts of the J. Hawthorn-Kitson valve gear above the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> from wind-blown sand. The bottom encasement was hinged to allow easy access to the motion. The engines all had copper boilers.|$|R
2500|$|A little-known {{example of}} Jones' heroic {{instincts}} in action {{is described by}} his biographer and friend Fred J. Lee in his book, Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad (1939). He recounts an incident in 1895 as Jones' train approached Michigan City, Mississippi. He had left the cab in charge of fellow Engineer Bob Stevenson, who had reduced speed sufficiently for Jones to walk safely out on the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> to oil the relief valves. He advanced from the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> to the steam chest {{and then to the}} pilot beam to adjust the spark screen. He had finished well before they arrived at the station, as planned, and was returning to the cab when he noticed a group of small children dart in front of the train some [...] ahead. All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear {{at the sight of the}} oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and yelled to the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or cowcatcher and braced himself on it, reaching out as far as he could to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in The Brave Engineer, in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulties}} of farming {{life in the}} hardscrabble, poor soil of the cave country influenced local owners of smaller nearby caves to see opportunities for commercial exploitation, particularly given the success of Mammoth Cave as a tourist attraction. The [...] "Kentucky Cave Wars" [...] were a period of bitter competition between local cave owners for tourist money. Broad tactics of deception were used to lure visitors away from their intended destination to other private show caves. Misleading signs were placed along the roads leading to the Mammoth Cave. A typical strategy during {{the early days of}} automobile travel involved representatives (known as [...] "cappers") of other private show caves hopping aboard a tourist's car's <b>running</b> <b>board,</b> and leading the passengers to believe that Mammoth Cave was closed, quarantined, caved in or otherwise inaccessible.|$|E
2500|$|The steam {{locomotive}} paint schemes are unique {{in their own}} way. Up until the mid-1940s, all {{steam locomotive}}s on UP were painted in a standard scheme: the smokebox and firebox were painted graphite and the rest was painted jet black; the lettering was usually aluminum. In the late 1940s, many passenger steam locomotives were repainted in a two-tone grey scheme to match the scheme applied to some coaching stock. These locomotives were painted light grey, with one dark gray strip running from front to rear alongside the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> {{and in the middle}} of the tender. This dark grey strip was outlined in yellow (originally aluminum), and all lettering inside the strip was yellow also. [...] After 1952, these locomotives were repainted in the same basic black color scheme as the earlier freight locomotives. [...] The grey passenger cars were repainted in the yellow scheme.|$|E
50|$|Visually obvious {{alterations}} {{were the}} smokebox saddle and the <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> The distinctive covered smokebox saddle of earlier 7th Class locomotives {{was replaced with}} an exposed one. The <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> were no longer straight {{all the way through}} from buffer beam to cab end, but dipped ahead of the smokebox and beneath the cab, giving it the appearance of a Hendrie-designed locomotive.|$|R
