40|$|<b>Ratiometric</b> <b>measurements</b> with FRET-based biosensors {{in living}} cells using a single {{fluorescence}} excitation wavelength are often {{affected by a}} significant ion sensitivity and the aggregation behavior of the FRET pair. This is an important problem for quantitative approaches. Here {{we report on the}} influence of physiological ion concentration changes on quantitative <b>ratiometric</b> <b>measurements</b> by comparing different FRET pairs for a cAMP-detecting biosensor. We exchanged the enhanced CFP/enhanced YFP FRET pair of an established Epac 1 -based biosensor by the fluorophores mCerulean/mCitrine. In the case of enhanced CFP/enhanced YFP, we showed that changes in proton, and (to a lesser extent) chloride ion concentrations result in incorrect ratiometric FRET signals, which may exceed the dynamic range of the biosensor. Calcium ions have no direct, but an indirect pH-driven effect by mobilizing protons. These ion dependences were greatly eliminated when mCerulean/mCitrine fluorophores were used. For such advanced FRET pairs the biosensor is less sensitive to changes in ion concentration and allows consistent cAMP concentration measurements under different physiological conditions, as occur in metabolically active cells. In addition, we verified that the described FRET pair exchange increased the dynamic range of the FRET efficiency response. The time window for stable experimental conditions was also prolonged by a faster biosensor expression rate in transfected cells and a greatly reduced tendency to aggregate, which reduces cytotoxicity. These properties were verified in functional tests in single cells co-expressing the biosensor and the 5 -HT 1 A receptor...|$|R

Neither diazo- 2 nor its photoproduct were found to be significantly fluorescent, and consequently concentrations of diazo- 2 up to 20 times that of indo- 1 did not distort the emission spectra of indo- 1. DM-nitrophen was scarcely fluorescent, but its fluorescence did increase upon photolysis. In contrast to diazo- 2 and DM-nitrophen, nitr- 5 itself was found to be quite fluorescent, and this fluorescence was significantly increased upon photolysis.

To correct for such inconsistencies, we developed and validated a method for choosing the most appropriate analysis settings, and for incorporating internal controls to ensure fidelity of polarity measurements.

In MVT, brief nutritional stimulation induces viable cells, but not non-viable cells, to produce abundant amounts of species-specific ribosomal RNA precursors (pre-rRNA). Quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} (qPCR) is used to quantify specific pre-rRNAs in a stimulated aliquot relative to a non-stimulated control. In addition to excluding background signal from non-viable cells and from free DNA, we report here that MVT increases the analytical sensitivity of qPCR when detecting viable cells. Side-by-side limit-of-detection comparisons showed that MVT is 5 -fold to > 10 -fold more sensitive than standard (static) DNA-targeted qPCR when detecting diverse bacterial pathogens (Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter baumannii, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium avium, and Staphylococcus aureus) in serum, milk, and tap water. Sensitivity enhancement may come from the elevated copy number of pre-rRNA relative to genomic DNA, and also from the <b>ratiometric</b> <b>measurement</b> which reduces ambiguity associated with weak or borderline signals. We also report that MVT eliminates false positive signals from bacteria that have been inactivated by moderately elevated temperatures (pasteurization), a condition that can confound widely-used cellular integrity tests that utilize membrane-impermeant compounds such as propidium iodide (PI) or propidium monoazide (PMA) to differentiate viable from inactivated bacteria.

Acidification of the lumen of organelles such as endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus plays {{a critical role in}} fundamental cellular processes. As such, measurement of the luminal pH of these organelles has relevance to both basic research and translational research. At the same time, accurate measurement of intraorganellar pH in living cells can be challenging and may be a limiting hurdle for research in some areas. Here, we describe three powerful methods to measure rigorously the luminal pH of different intracellular organelles, focusing on endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus.

Accurate and reproducible analysis of <b>ratiometric</b> <b>measurements</b> has thus become mandatory to interpret quantitative imaging. In order to fulfill this necessity, we have developed an open source toolset for Fiji—BRET-Analyzer—allowing a systematic analysis, from image processing to ratio quantification. We share this open source solution and a step-by-step tutorial at [URL] This toolset proposes (1) image background subtraction, (2) image alignment over time, (3) a composite thresholding method of the image used as the denominator of the ratio to refine the precise limits of the sample, (4) pixel by pixel division of the images and efficient distribution of the ratio intensity on a pseudocolor scale, and (5) quantification of the ratio mean intensity and standard variation among pixels in chosen areas.

40|$|Fluorescence {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET) -based biosensors {{have been designed}} to fluorometrically detect everything from proteolytic activity to receptor-ligand interactions and structural changes in proteins. While a wide variety of fluorophores have demonstrated effectiveness in FRET probes, several potential sensor components are particularly notable. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive FRET donors because they are rather bright, exhibit high quantum yields, and their nanoparticulate structure enables the attachment of multiple acceptor molecules. Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are also of particular interest for fluorescent biosensors because design elements necessary for signal transduction, probe assembly, and device delivery and localization for intracellular applications can all be genetically incorporated into the FP polypeptide. The studies described in this thesis elucidate the important parameters for concerted QD-FP FRET probe design. Experimental results clarify issues of FRET pair selection, probe assembly, and donor-acceptor distance for the multivalent systems. Various analysis approaches are compared and guidelines asserted based on the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the QD-FP FRET probe platform, a ratiometric pH sensor is presented.

Changes of [Ca 2 +]i in IMCD cells were measured with fluo- 4. A novel confocal imaging technique using a styryl dye, FM 1 - 43, was developed to monitor real-time exocytosis induced by arginine vasopressin. AVP (0. 1 nm) triggered a rapid increase of [Ca 2 +]i in IMCD cells, followed by sustained oscillations. <b>Ratiometric</b> <b>measurement</b> of [Ca 2 +]i confirmed that the observed [Ca 2 +]i oscillation was a primary event and was not secondary to changes in cell volume. The frequencies of [Ca 2 +]i oscillations in each IMCD cell were independent and time variant. 1 -Deamino- 8 -d-arginine vasopressin (a V 2 receptor agonist, 0. 1 nm) simulated the effects of AVP by triggering [Ca 2 +]i oscillations. In the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, ryanodine (0. 1 mm) inhibited AVP-induced Ca 2 + mobilization. AVP (0. 1 nm) triggered accumulative apical exocytosis in IMCD cells within 20 s after application. Pre-incubating the IMCD with an intracellular Ca 2 + chelator, BAPTA, prevented AVP-induced intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization, apical exocytosis, and increase of osmotic water permeability.

For these purposes {{the most promising}} are genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, which have become powerful tools for non-invasive intracellular monitoring of ions, molecules and enzymatic activity. A ratiometric CFP/YFP-based construct with a relatively good sensitivity to Cl− has been developed (Markova et al., 2008; Waseem et al., 2010). Recently, a combined Cl−/pH sensor (ClopHensor) {{opened the way for}} simultaneous <b>ratiometric</b> <b>measurement</b> of these two ions (Arosio et al., 2010). ClopHensor was obtained by fusion of a red-fluorescent protein (DsRed-monomer) to the E 2 GFP variant that contains a specific Cl−-binding site. This construct possesses pKa = 6. 8 for H+ and Kd in the 40 - 50 mM range for Cl− at physiological pH (~ 7. 3) As in the majority of cell types the intracellular Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) is about 10 mM, the development of sensors with higher sensitivity is highly desirable. Here we report the intracellular calibration and functional characterization of ClopHensor and its two derivatives: the membrane targeting PalmPalm-ClopHensor and the H 148 G/V 224 L mutant with improved Cl− affinity, reduced pH dependence and pKa shifted to more alkaline values. For functional analysis, constructs were expressed in CHO cells and [Cl−]i was changed by using pipettes with different Cl− concentrations during whole-cell recordings.

Preliminary results show that the reset noise is reduced by a factor of 1. 42 and the readout noise by a factor of 9. 20 when the pixel is operated in differential mode versus singleended mode. Spectral responsivity characteristics show that the photodiodes are most sensitive at 480 nm. Using a commercially available emission filter, the sensor was able to reliably detect a concentration of Fura- 2 as low as 39 nM. The sensor was used to perform <b>ratiometric</b> <b>measurements</b> and was able to reliably detect a free calcium concentration of 17 nM. I...|$|R
