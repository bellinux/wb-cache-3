It contains 26 usable floors, a double-height mechanical penthouse, and one floor below ground, reaching a height of 430 ft The lobby rises two stories from the base and is enclosed by glass panels framed in chrome. Accent panels have the same hexagonal design as the window frames on the upper stories. The lobby walls are recessed from the building facade to create a loggia on all four sides of the building. The floor of the loggia is covered with white marble cut in a hexagonal design and flows uninterrupted to the interior lobby floor and up {{the walls of the}} elevator banks. The ceiling of the main level consists of coffered square panels that have a <b>recessed</b> <b>light</b> <b>fixture.</b> Beneath each light bulb, a four-armed bracket holds a blue or green glass sphere that diffuses the light and casts color onto the white floor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Air leakage through <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as a common issue that causes extra energy consumption in residential buildings. However, few quantitative studies in this area were found. As such, a preliminary assessment of the magnitude of this type of energy loss was conducted by using three-dimensional (3 D) transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. A hypothetical layout of <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> was designed with boundary conditions of four different seasons, which were obtained from recorded roof/attic temperature data sets. The results of the study indicate that leakage of <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> could be a significant channel of energy loss in such attic-related residential buildings, especially in the summer and winter...|$|R

However, little quantitative study was found in this area. In this paper, a preliminary evaluation of the magnitude of such energy loss was conducted by numerical simulations using 3 dimensional transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. A typical layout of <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> was used in this case study with boundary conditions in four different seasons, which were obtained from past measured roof/attic temperature data sets. The results of the numerical simulations indicate that leakage of <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> could be a very significant channel of energy loss in attic related residential buildings, especially in summer and winter time...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} parts to a <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> fixture: housing, trim and bulb. The trim is the visible {{portion of the}} light. It is the insert that is seen when looking up into the fixture, and also {{includes}} the thin lining {{around the edge of}} the light. The housing is the fixture itself that is installed inside the ceiling and contains the lamp holder. There are many different types of bulbs that can be inserted into <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures,</b> with the amount of heat generated by the bulb being a unique consideration.|$|R
2500|$|Some CFLs {{are labeled}} {{not to be}} run base up, since heat will shorten the ballast's life. Such CFLs are {{unsuitable}} for use in pendant lamps and especially unsuitable for <b>recessed</b> <b>light</b> <b>fixtures.</b> CFLs designed for use in such fixtures are available. Current recommendations for fully enclosed, unventilated <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> (such as those recessed into insulated ceilings), are either to use [...] "reflector CFLs" [...] (R-CFL), cold-cathode CFLs or to replace such fixtures with those designed for CFLs. A CFL will thrive in areas that have good airflow, such as in a table lamp.|$|R
50|$|Konkovo (Конько́во) is {{a station}} on the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. It was {{designed}} by N. Shumakov, G. Mun, and N. Shurygina and opened on 6 November 1987 with the southward extension of the line. The station is of a single vault design, {{the only one on}} the radius. Its cross-section is meant to resemble two rows of sickles with the blades pointing inward, a design feature enhanced by the <b>recessed</b> <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> and metal accent strips in the spaces between the plaster ceiling panels. The bases of the vault is strongly recessed and faced with reddish ceramic tile.|$|R

50|$|Another type of device used is {{the light}} tube, also called a tubular {{daylighting}} device (TDD), which is placed into a roof and admits light to a focused {{area of the}} interior. These somewhat resemble <b>recessed</b> ceiling <b>light</b> <b>fixtures.</b> They do not allow as much heat transfer as skylights because they have less surface area.|$|R
40|$|The actual energy {{performance}} of buildings depends on {{not only the}} design criteria {{but also on the}} construction quality. Original design assumptions can become invalid with unexpected construction quality issues, which can lead to large variations between the designed performance and the constructed performance. Though important, very limited research, especially quantitative studies, is found on investigating the impact of construction quality issues on building {{energy performance}}. In this thesis, the air leakage issue related to the installation of <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> is investigated using numerical simulations and historical experimental data. The construction quality issues of residential buildings in the United States are reviewed, along with publications on building envelope related researches. One case study on air leakage in the <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting</b> is presented to illustrate how construction quality affects the energy performance of the building. The case study utilized 3 D computational fluid dynamics to simulate air leakage issues in four different seasons using boundary conditions using historical experimental data set. The results of the case study suggest that some seemingly insignificant construction quality issue can cause significant increase in energy consumption of residential buildings. The thesis provides scientific evidence to help residential construction industry to improve the construction quality of residential buildings in the United States. Advisor: Zhigang She...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 1940s {{waiting room}} furniture {{remains in the}} station, as are the original <b>recessed</b> fluorescent <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures.</b> The Eastbound Waiting Room, a small rectangular building of similar design, stood {{on the south side}} of the tracks until it was lost to redevelopment in 2008. Originally built along with the station in 1945, it was razed and rebuilt in 1976, to make way for tracks laid for the Washington Metro. An underground pedestrian tunnel connecting the two buildings beneath the track bed still exists, but is closed to the public. The station is owned by Montgomery Preservation, Inc., a non-profit organization, which opens the building for tours.|$|R
500|$|The General Assembly building, {{housing the}} United Nations General Assembly, holds the General Assembly Hall {{which has a}} seating {{capacity}} of 1,800. At [...] long by [...] wide, {{it is the largest}} room in the complex. The Hall has two murals by the French artist Fernand Léger. At the front of the chamber, is the rostrum containing the green marble desk for the President of the General Assembly, Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services and matching lectern for speakers. Behind the rostrum is the UN emblem on a gold background. Flanking the rostrum is a paneled semi-circular wall that tapers as it nears the ceiling and surrounds the front portion of the chamber. In front of the paneled walls are seating areas for guests and within the wall are windows which allow translators to watch the proceedings as they work. The ceiling of the hall is [...] high and surmounted by a shallow dome ringed by <b>recessed</b> <b>light</b> <b>fixtures.</b> The entrance to the hall bears an inscription from the Gulistan by Iranian poet Saadi. The General Assembly Hall was last altered in 1980 when capacity was increased to accommodate the increased membership. Each of the 192 delegations has six seats in the hall with three at a desk and three alternate seats behind them.|$|R
50|$|Track lighting, {{invented by}} Lightolier, was popular at one {{period of time}} because it was much easier to install than <b>recessed</b> <b>lighting,</b> and {{individual}} <b>fixtures</b> are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall. It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors {{because they do not}} have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each <b>light</b> <b>fixture</b> having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension.|$|R

40|$|LED {{retrofit}} kits and linear replacement lamps are {{now available}} to convert <b>recessed</b> fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> (or ‘troffers’) in commercial buildings such as offices and retail. These retrofits re-use the top portion of the existing troffer, so the space above the dropped ceiling is not disturbed. Compared to complete troffer replacement, LED retrofits can usually be installed more quickly, with less dust and disturbance of the occupants. Two types of retrofits are available. LED linear replacement lamps are shaped like fluorescent lamps. They reuse the existing lens, and often the existing lamp holders. Integrated-style LED retrofit kits are not shaped like fluorescent lamps. Some reuse the existing lens, while others provide a new customized lens, to enhance appearance and light distribution. Note that besides LED kits, energy efficient kits with new customized lenses are also available with new fluorescent HPT 8 ’s. A recently published report [1] found that, among 21 LED troffer products purchased in summer 2012, most dedicated LED troffers performed better than most LED retrofits. However, as new LED retrofit kits continue to enter the market, early adopters may find products suitable for various applications...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>recessed</b> <b>light</b> or {{downlight}} (also pot {{light in}} Canadian English, sometimes can light (for canister light) in American English) is a <b>light</b> <b>fixture</b> that is installed {{into a hollow}} opening in a ceiling. When installed {{it appears to have}} light shining from a hole in the ceiling, concentrating the light in a downward direction as a broad floodlight or narrow spotlight. [...] "Pot light" [...] or [...] "canister light" [...] implies the hole is circular and the <b>lighting</b> <b>fixture</b> is cylindrical, like a pot or canister.|$|R
