40|$|As {{part of the}} {{justification}} of their proposed framework for iterated belief <b>revision</b> Darwiche and Pearl advanced a convincing argument against Boutilier’s natural <b>revision,</b> and provided a prototypical <b>revision</b> operator which fits into their scheme. We show that the Darwiche-Pearl arguments lead naturally to the acceptance of a smaller class of operators which we refer to as admissible. These are characterised in terms of syntactic as well as semantic postulates. Admissible <b>revision</b> ensures that the penultimate input is not ignored completely, thereby eliminating natural <b>revision,</b> but includes the prototypical Darwiche-Pearl operator, Nayak’s well-known lexicographic <b>revision</b> operator, and a newly introduced operator called restrained <b>revision.</b> We give a syntactic and a semantic characterisation of restrained <b>revision,</b> and demonstrate that it satisfies desirable properties. In particular, we show {{that it is the}} most conservative of admissible <b>revision</b> operators, while lexicographic <b>revision</b> is the least conservative. This makes an interesting comparison with the Darwiche-Pearl framework in which lexicographic <b>revision</b> is also the least conservative, but natural <b>revision</b> is the most conservative. In a sense, then, restrained <b>revision</b> can be seen as an appropriate replacement for natural <b>revision.</b> Finally we show that restrained <b>revision</b> can also be viewed as a composite operator, consisting of natural <b>revision</b> preceded by an application of a “backwards <b>revision</b> ” operator previously studied by Papini. ...|$|R

Le Guin’s Lavinia as a <b>revision</b> of Vergil’s Aeneid. Through investigating the historical and literary contexts of each <b>revisioned</b> text, I identify the critical focus of the <b>revision</b> and analyse the textual effect produced by the <b>revision.</b> In each case, the feminist <b>revision</b> exposes the underlying ideological assumptions of the source text. By rewriting the canonical narrative from an alternative perspective, each <b>revision</b> extends beyond the source text, altering meaning and reinterpreting key symbols for feminist ends...|$|R

Though seemingly different, these <b>revision</b> rules follow {{from the same}} two principles: responsiveness, which requires that revised beliefs {{be consistent with the}} learning experience, and conservativeness, which requires that those beliefs of the agent on which the learning experience is `silent' (in a technical sense) do not change.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} I present {{the model of}} ‘bounded revision’ {{that is based on}} {{two-dimensional}} <b>revision</b> functions taking as arguments pairs consisting of an input sentence and a reference sentence. The key idea is similar to the model of ‘revision by comparison’ investigated by Fermé and Rott (Artificial Intelligence 157, 2004). In contrast to the latter, however, bounded <b>revision</b> satisfies the AGM axioms as well as the Darwiche-Pearl axioms. Two onedimensional special cases are obtained by setting one argument of the two-dimensional <b>revision</b> operation to certain extremal values. Bounded <b>revision</b> thus fills the space between conservative <b>revision</b> (also known as natural <b>revision)</b> and moderate <b>revision</b> (also known as lexicographic <b>revision).</b> I argue that two-dimensional <b>revision</b> operations add decisively to the expressive power of qualitative approaches that refrain from assuming numbers as measures of degrees of belief. 1...|$|R
