500|$|After {{passing on}} using Renault's new power {{unit in the}} United States and Mexico, Red Bull {{equipped}} Daniel Ricciardo's car with the new specification unit, which earned him a ten-place grid penalty in the process. Once he had tried the new unit during the free practice and qualifying sessions, Ricciardo lamented that the upgrade had not improved the performance. He said: [...] "In hindsight, it didn't give us any laptime, it's just for now a penalty {{for a little bit}} of knowledge." [...] During the first practice session on Friday, Mercedes tried out what was dubbed a [...] "S-duct", a vent to channel airflow through the nose of the car, a feature already seen at other cars {{over the course of the}} season. However, Mercedes decided not to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> over the whole weekend.|$|E

40|$|We present {{integrated}} multiwavelength transmitters for {{application in}} Fiber-to-the- Home systems. The transmitters are realized on a generic indium-phosphide-based integration platform and fabricated in a multi-project wafer <b>run.</b> <b>The</b> <b>devices</b> integrate DBR-lasers with electro-optical Mach-Zehnder modulators and AWGs as multiplexers of optical signals. We demonstrate {{the performance of}} integrated circuits that operate as 4 - and 8 -channel sources with an output power above 0 dBm and a modulation data rate of 12. 5 Gbps per transmission channel...|$|R
40|$|We present {{characterization}} {{results of}} monolithically integrated photonic transmitters fabricated in a multi-project wafer <b>run.</b> <b>The</b> <b>devices</b> were realized on an indiumphosphide (InP) platform and combine multiwavelength {{arrayed waveguide grating}} (AWG) -based lasers with electro-optical Mach-Zehnder modulators. The 4 - and 8 -channel sources were realized in two configurations using AWGs both as intra-cavity filter and multiplexers of optical signals. In this paper we present {{the design of the}} integrated circuits, the mounting on an aluminum-nitride submount, and the first optical measurements of the transmitters...|$|R
50|$|This {{is because}} when heating, the work used to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is {{converted}} to heat and adds to the desired effect, whereas if the desired effect is cooling the heat resulting from the input work is just an unwanted byproduct.|$|E
50|$|Inductive {{charging}} (also {{known as}} wireless charging or cordless charging) uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects through electromagnetic induction. This is usually {{done with a}} charging station. Energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device, which can then use that energy to charge batteries or <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{computers}} and other devices allow for underclocking. Manufacturers add underclocking options for many reasons. Underclocking can help with excessive heat buildup, because lower performance will not generate as much heat inside the device. It can also lower {{the amount of energy}} needed to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> Laptop {{computers and}} other battery-operated devices often have underclocking settings, so that batteries can last longer without being charged.|$|E
50|$|If {{a device}} only runs {{software}} {{approved by the}} hardware vendor, and only a certain version of a free software program is allowed to <b>run</b> on <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> <b>the</b> user cannot exercise the rights he theoretically has, {{because he or she}} cannot install modified versions.|$|R
5000|$|Some devices {{implement}} a feature called [...] "verified boot", [...] "trusted boot" [...] or [...] "secure boot", which will only allow signed software to <b>run</b> on <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> usually from <b>the</b> <b>device</b> manufacturer. This {{is considered a}} restriction unless users either {{have the ability to}} disable it or have the ability to sign the software.|$|R
50|$|Several hundred Peanut {{devices were}} {{distributed}} to early-access partners including university researchers in computer vision and robotics, as well as application developers and technology startups. Google stopped supporting <b>the</b> Peanut <b>device</b> in September 2015, as by then the Tango software stack had evolved beyond the versions of Android that <b>run</b> on <b>the</b> <b>device.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tristar 64 is an {{unlicensed}} add-on for the Nintendo 64 (N64) {{video game}} console. Produced in Hong Kong by Future Laboratory, the Tristar 64 features two additional cartridge ports which {{are designed to}} accept cartridges created for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, a.k.a. Famicom) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES, a.k.a. Super Famicom). The device then emulates the NES (via a NES-on-a-chip) or SNES hardware, and allows the cartridge to be <b>run.</b> <b>The</b> <b>device</b> also features built-in cheat cartridge functionality through a program called the X-Terminator, {{as well as the}} Memory Editor, which allows SRAM and EEPROM saved game data to be archived and edited.|$|E
50|$|An {{electrical}} load (e.g. a lamp, TV-set, or electric motor) has a rated power, {{which is usually}} measured in watts. This is its running power level, which equates to the instantaneous rate at which energy must be generated and consumed to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> The amount of energy that is consumed (at that rate) depends on how long the device is operated. However, its power requirement is constant while running. The unit of energy used for residential electrical billing, the kilowatt hour, shows the cumulative amount of electrical energy used during the billing period, regardless of the power drawn at any moment during the billing period.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} {{models of the}} Archos series this device comes with the full version of Microsoft Windows 7 Starter Edition. Which includes Windows Live Messenger, which can utilize the integrated 1.3MP webcam for portable video-conferencing, voice calling and instant messaging. The vTuner software is also included, which is the Web Radio & TV plugin for Gen 6 & Gen 7 devices. The Software also includes IBM Lotus Symphony office software. As the device is x86 compatible it is reported by people {{that it is possible}} to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> even with relatively stock Linux distribution even if not all hardware features are out of the box.|$|E
50|$|The watch uses two Lithium CR2025 {{button cells}} for power, {{which can be}} {{accessed}} {{from the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> batteries gave on the user an average 3 months of usage. Many users have found that the CR2032 cells fit, which give <b>the</b> <b>device</b> a longer <b>run</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>device's</b> screen is a 102x64 STN 4-greyscale LCD which uses a timed backlight to save power.|$|R

50|$|Ferrari {{announced}} that its team manager Luca Baldisserri {{was taken off}} the track operations to be replaced by race engineer Chris Dyer. The reshuffle was undertaken after Ferrari failed to score a point in the first two races of the season. Ferrari also {{announced that}} both its drivers, Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa, would not use the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) in the race, citing reliability and safety issues. BMW Sauber, on the other hand, declared that Robert Kubica would use KERS for the first time during the Friday practice session. Kubica had not used the system in the first two races as there were concerns that the additional weight would put him at a disadvantage. However, Kubica opted not to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> any further after Friday practice, as did the Renault team, reducing the number of KERS-equipped cars to three.|$|E
50|$|A small device, {{about the}} size of a home {{wireless}} router, contains the necessary electronics which allow plain old telephone service to be provided to one or two telephone jacks on the back of the unit, as well as having a small radio antenna and a transceiver for the wireless side of the connection. LED indicator lights on the front typically show signal strength and voicemail messages waiting. The devices usually cannot provide enough ringing current for more than one phone and one externally powered device, such as a telephone answering device or the base station for a cordless phone. For this reason, it is not recommended to connect these devices to a home's wiring (which also requires the disconnection of the wiring at the network interface device, just as when a cable telephone or other whole-home VoIP service is installed). A rechargeable battery backup is normally provided to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> during a power outage lasting no more than a few hours, significantly less standby time than a true mobile device.|$|E
50|$|The {{drafting}} of miners reduced the main energy source, coal. The textile factories produced Army uniforms, and warm clothing for civilians <b>ran</b> short. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> of using ersatz materials, such as {{paper and cardboard}} for cloth and leather proved unsatisfactory. Soap was in short supply, as was hot water. All the cities reduced tram services, cut back on street lighting, and close down theaters and cabarets.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} {{is intended to}} be installed on the Network Walkman itself.Although it can be <b>run</b> directly on <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> it is not truly a portable application because it requires that the driver be installed on the computer.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{apparatus}} is {{to better}} enable characterization of tissue samples both on a microscopic scale and across the visible spectrum. The set-up consists of a phase-contrast inverted Nikon microscope, a single-grating imaging spectrometer, a CCD camera, and a computer potentially controlling all three of <b>the</b> previous <b>devices,</b> <b>The</b> computer uses an object-oriented program development environment called LabVIEW to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> three <b>devices.</b> This apparatus will hopefully enable better, less invasive surgical procedures, as well as permitting higher-resolution, more up-close observation of cellular dynamics...|$|R
40|$|A ring {{geometry}} laser with a wavelength tunable intracavity filter is demonstrated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} an InP-based photonic multiwavelength transmitter realized by integrating {{an array of}} DBR lasers with modulators in Mach-Zehnder configuration. An arrayed waveguide grating was used to multiplex the generated signals into a common optical output. The device was designed according to a generic integration concept, using standardized building blocks, and was fabricated in a multi-project wafer <b>run.</b> <b>The</b> <b>device</b> delivers up to 4 dBm of optical power into the fiber with a modulation data rate of 12. 5 Gbps per transmission channel. The obtained performance makes it very promising for application {{in the next generation}} optical access networks as a key source in the central office part of the telecommunication systems...|$|E
40|$|In this letter, we {{demonstrate}} a novel monolithically integrated photonic multiwavelength transmitter that was realized by integrating an arrayed waveguide grating-based laser with selective distributed Bragg reflector mirrors and Mach-Zehnder modulators.

The linewidth of the generated signals is 275 kHz. We achieved error free 50 -km transmission at the modulation data rate of 10 Gb/s per channel, for a received power of - 26. 5 dBm...|$|E
50|$|YouTube {{also does}} not allow videos to <b>run</b> whilst <b>the</b> Android <b>device</b> is sleeping. This {{can be seen as}} an {{annoyance}} for some users. Particularly if the user is trying to use YouTube as a replacement music player.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>the</b> Xperia Play <b>runs</b> on Android, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> may install apps {{for playing}} homebrew games.

30|$|Apart from {{averaging}} {{the measured}} frequency, some additional processing {{of the raw}} data {{may be required to}} increase accuracy, namely a low-pass filter to reduce noise and interpolation between the zero-crossings [18]. After FMT has passed, a Processing and Response Time (PRT) is required where raw data is processed, a frequency value is calculated and <b>the</b> control algorithm <b>runs</b> in <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> All these various steps require some time to be executed and this time period is referred to as PRT.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} low-cost, {{high-resolution}} solution for automated laser-beam profiling with axial translation. The device {{is based on}} a Raspberry Pi, Pi Noir CMOS camera, stepper motor and commercial translation stage. We also provide software to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> The CMOS sensor is sensitive over a large wavelength range between 300 - 1100 nm, and can be translated over 25 mm along the beam axis. The sensor head can be reversed without changing its axial position, allowing for a quantitative estimate of beam overlap with counter-propagating laser beams. Although not limited to this application, the intended use for this device is the automated measurement of the focal position and spot-size of a Gaussian laser beam. We present example data of one such measurement to illustrate device performance...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempted to}} fabricate a gas-diverting valve using LTCC {{technology for the}} emerging field of meso-scale devices. A photolithographic process for patterning Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC) tapes utilizing DuPont Green Tape ™ tape coupled with DuPont Riston ® 9015, a dry photoresist, is described in detail. Based on the device design, calculations determining the theoretical resistance and magnetic flux were made. These numbers will determine the voltage necessary to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> once built. Although the device was not constructed since {{the resolution of the}} dry photoresist system was being pushed led to difficulty in etching the tape, lamination and development techniques of the Riston ® were perfected, and insights into the composition of the tape prior to and after etching were made. Suggestions for improvements in the process are given, as well as thoughts on what should be the next step in this research. 1...|$|E
