5|$|Defence from thermal {{weapons and}} fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and draped over {{vulnerable}} wooden hoardings and siege engines, and vats and barrels of liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers. Hides were hung in an overlapping manner {{so that any}} water would <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> whole structure to extinguish flames.|$|E
5|$|Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren had {{not even}} sat down when his team took the lead. Mendieta's pass let Zenden <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> left wing and cross for striker Joseph-Désiré Job to put Middlesbrough ahead in the second minute. It was the fastest goal scored in a final, a record broken the {{following}} year by Liverpool's John Arne Riise.|$|E

5|$|Mikawa's <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Slot was not {{detected}} by Allied forces. Turner had requested that U.S. Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., commander of Allied air forces for the South Pacific area, conduct extra reconnaissance missions over the Slot {{in the afternoon}} of August 8. But, for unexplained reasons, McCain did not order the missions, nor did he tell Turner {{that they were not}} carried out. Thus, Turner mistakenly believed that the Slot was under Allied observation throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|The flesh in the cap {{is made up}} of irregularly {{arranged}} cylindrical hyphae from 5 to 15μm wide. They stain a dark reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The flesh in {{the stem}} {{is made up of}} hyphae which <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stem and measure 4 to 11μm in thickness. The smooth cell walls are colorless, but again stain a dark reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The septa have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{the cane}} toad is dry and warty. It has {{distinct}} ridges above the eyes, which <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye. The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.|$|E
50|$|Australia {{could have}} scored 303, but 2 penalty runs were not awarded because <b>the</b> Australian batsmen <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch (as opposed to beside the pitch, {{which is the}} rule) again after being warned not to by the umpire.

5|$|Arsenal {{then made}} their second substitution, {{bringing}} on Van Persie {{in place of}} Cesc Fàbregas. As the match entered injury time {{at the end of}} the second half, Ronaldo made yet another <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> left wing, outpacing Lauren to Rooney's through-ball. The ball broke back to Rooney 30 yards from goal, but his shot went over the bar. The second half finished with a Wes Brown cross from the right wing that made its way across the penalty area to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese could only head the ball straight at Lehmann.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s the {{installation}} of overhead electrification commenced between London Euston and both Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly. Phase 1 comprised electrification between Crewe and Liverpool and Manchester. Phase 2 involved the extension southwards from Crewe to London. The massive proportions of the Coronation Class resulted in their prohibition from operating under those wires. Camden's allocation was now <b>run</b> <b>down</b> (<b>the</b> remaining locomotives being transferred to nearby Willesden (1A)), whilst Polmadie's was dispensed with entirely. The bulk of the class was situated at either Crewe North or Carlisle, the Kingmoor shed (12A, 68A from 1958) now being used in addition to Upperby.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius lignyotellus and L.lignyotus {{are similar}} to L.fallax, {{and they are all}} {{associated}} with Picea and Abies; examination of microscopic features cannot be used to distinguish between them. L.lignyotus is restricted in distribution to eastern North America and Europe. Lactarius pseudomucidus is another milk cap with a dark brown cap, but it has a smooth (not velvety) and slimy cap and stem. Another brown-capped eastern North American species is L.gerardii; it has distantly spaced white gills that <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stem. L.fuliginellus, which prefers to grow near hardwoods, has close gills.|$|E

5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|NC State, {{needing to}} score, {{drove down the}} field and kicked a go-ahead 33-yard field goal with 7:12 {{remaining}} in the game. After a failed possession, Tech was forced to punt the ball away, allowing NC State to <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> clock. The Virginia Tech defense eventually forced a stop, giving the Tech offense one final {{chance to win the}} game. With 1:53 on the clock and beginning from their own 20-yard line, the Hokies drove 57 yards to the NC State 23-yard line. There, kicker Chris Kinzer successfully kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired to give Virginia Tech a 25-24 win.|$|E
5|$|On defense, linebacker Vince Hall, in {{his second}} game after {{recovering}} from a broken forearm, led all defensive players with 11tackles. Hall also recorded an interception in the late stages of the fourth quarter that allowed Virginia Tech to <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> clock and force Boston College into a hasty offense. Tied for third overall was Tech's Xavier Adibi, who recorded nine tackles (one for loss) and caught the game-ending interception. Adibi returned the interception 40yards for a defensive touchdown that sealed the victory for the Hokies.|$|E

5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon to <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{continued}} to <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> clock by running the ball straight ahead for a four-yard gain. Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen then entered the game, {{and running back}} Andre Kendrick gained a first down with a run to the 33-yard line. Kendrick then gained a first down at the Alabama 39-yard line. Kendrick {{continued to}} advance the ball with short runs, draining the clock to secure the Tech lead. Tech's third backup quarterback, Dave Meyer, also entered the game as the final seconds ticked off the clock and Virginia Tech secured its 387 win.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} the kick to their 43-yard line, and the Hokies proceeded {{to run out}} the clock by executing running plays—which do not stop the clock at their conclusion. Tempers ran high among Texas players, and Texas defender Stoney Clark was ejected from the game after throwing the football at a Virginia Tech player following {{the conclusion of a}} play. Texas was assessed two personal-foul penalties, which advanced the ball to the Texas 31-yard line and gave Virginia Tech a first down. Tech continued to <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> clock with rushing plays, and the Hokies brought in freshman backup quarterback Al Clark to supervise the game's final plays. The clock rolled to zero, and Virginia Tech secured a 2810 victory.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{began work}} at its 30-yard line, again needing to just <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> clock to ensure victory. As before, however, Drew Weatherford {{took to the}} air, {{throwing}} a two-yard pass. Two rushing plays followed, but were stopped for little gain. Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two {{and a half minutes}} had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two previous drives, however, Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's offense {{began work}} from its 36-yard line, but ran four plays without gaining {{a first down}} and turned the ball over on downs. Virginia Tech, whose offense began at the Florida State 45-yard line, {{proceeded}} to <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> clock. In eight plays, Tech advanced 21 yards and drained 3:22, then turned the ball over on downs at the Seminole 26-yard line. Florida State's offense entered the game one final time and conducted a 12-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 20-yard pass from Manuel to running back Chris Thompson for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point made the score 44–33, but only seven seconds remained in the game. The Seminoles attempted an onside kick {{in an attempt to}} have another opportunity for offense, but the Hokies recovered the kick and proceeded to run out the final seconds, earning a 44–33 victory.|$|E
