5|$|During World War II, Allison became {{involved}} in defence-related work. He was {{a consultant to the}} National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC) from October 1940 to January 1941. In January 1941 the NDRC let him a contract to study the possibility of using beryllium as a neutron moderator. The team he assembled in Chicago would grow into the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Lansdale, now a captain, {{met with}} James B.

50|$|Farmer <b>Research</b> <b>Committees</b> do {{adaptive}} <b>research</b> {{experiments to}} help farmers manage {{the risk of}} trying something new that extension has not validated under local conditions. In Latin America, numerous Farmer <b>Research</b> <b>Committees</b> have been particularly effective in evaluating and selecting new varieties and multiplying seed, enabling large numbers of farmers to access a new variety at low cost, improve their food security, generate employment and increase their income. On a lesser scale, Farmer <b>Research</b> <b>Committees</b> have worked on small machinery, fertilisers or pest and disease control regimes, enabling the adoption of cost-effective strategies in which local farmers have confidence. Farmer <b>Research</b> <b>Committees</b> may {{have an important role}} to play in rural communities' adaptation of their agriculture to climate change and globalization because they increase community-level innovative and adaptive capacity by strengthening its human and social capital.|$|R

5|$|Cominco {{had been}} {{involved}} in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, the Canadian National Research Council inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July 1941 by letter from Taylor that offered a National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC) contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 a pound.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC) asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC), {{created a}} special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey.|$|E
5|$|The MAUD Committee reports {{urged the}} {{co-operation}} with the United States should be {{continued in the}} research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once {{he returned to the}} United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|The Uranium Committee was a {{committee}} of the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC) that succeeded the Advisory Committee on Uranium and later evolved into the S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), when that organization absorbed the NDRC in June 1941, and the S-1 Executive Committee in June 1942. It {{laid the groundwork for}} the Manhattan Project by initiating and coordinating the early research efforts in the United States, and liaising with the Tube Alloys Project in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Kistiakowsky was {{the head}} of the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC) section {{responsible}} for the development of explosives, and the technical director of the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the development of new explosives, including RDX and HMX. He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the development of shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, he watched as the first one was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later another Fat Man implosion-type weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Smyth was {{involved}} in helping the United States build the atomic bomb. From 1941–43 {{he was a member}} of the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC)'s Uranium Committee charged with producing fissile material for the bomb. Smyth proposed the electromagnetic methods that were used to enrich the first large U-235 samples for the project. He also oversaw a nuclear fission-related project for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). During 1943–45 he was a consultant to the Manhattan Project, which built and tested the weapon, and associate director of the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, which contributed to the Manhattan Project. At the Metallurgical Laboratory he headed research on heavy water. He remained chairman of Princeton's physics department throughout the war, and the attendant obligations forced him to participate less actively in the project's later stages.|$|E
40|$|Researching {{sensitive}} topics, such as {{the treatment}} of men with intellectual disabilities and sexually abusive behaviour, present a number of ethical issues for researchers. This paper describes our experiences in working with Multi-Centre <b>Research</b> Ethics <b>Committees</b> on a <b>research</b> proposal designed to assess the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy for men with intellectual disabilities {{who are at risk}} of sexual offending. After submitting to three Multi-Centre <b>Research</b> Ethics <b>Committees</b> and spending a year trying to get ethical approval, we questioned whether: •   the issue of study design {{should be part of the}} Multi-Centre <b>Research</b> Ethics <b>Committees</b> remit; •   Multi-Centre <b>Research</b> Ethics <b>Committees</b> were sufficiently responsive to concerns raised by researchers; •   Multi-Centre <b>Research</b> Ethics <b>Committees</b> always understood the research; and •   the Central Office for <b>Research</b> Ethics <b>Committees</b> should disallow re-submission after rejection by two Multi-Centre <b>Research</b> Ethics <b>Committees</b> (‘two strikes and you’re out') ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{report the}} outcome of {{applications}} to 43 <b>research</b> ethics <b>committees.</b> SETTING: Four regional health authorities in England. FINDINGS: The <b>research</b> ethics <b>committees</b> varied considerably in their practices. The time lapse until notification of {{the outcome of}} the approval ranged from just under one week to 23 weeks with a mean of 8. 6 weeks. Four <b>research</b> ethics <b>committees</b> failed to notify the research team of an outcome of their request for approval. CONCLUSION: A national <b>research</b> ethics <b>committee</b> is needed to review national and multi-location research studies {{in the light of the}} fragmented and variable practice of local <b>research</b> ethics <b>committees...</b>|$|R

5|$|From 1960 to 1965 Paton was a {{board member}} of the Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and from 1964 to 1975 he served on the council of the Construction Industry Research and Information Association. Paton was also the British {{representative}} on the committee of the International Commission on Large Dams between 1966 and 1973. From 1968 to 1970 he was chairman of the National Economic Development Council's working party on large industrial construction sites and from 1969 to 1974 was a member of the Natural Environment Research Council. Paton was vice-chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions from 1971 to 1972 and chairman for 1972 to 1973. From 1974 to 1979 he was chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food flood protection <b>research</b> <b>committee.</b> Paton was also a member emeritus of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers and served as their president in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Balch started {{investigating}} the Iron Age cave dwellers in Wookey Hole Caves, {{embarking on a}} four-year study of the caves along {{with other members of}} the Mendip Nature <b>Research</b> <b>Committee.</b> The group mapped the caves, drew illustrations of their finds and took photographs, collecting the information in the 1914 book Wookey Hole: its Caves and Cave-Dwellers. When giving lectures on the cave dwellers, he would compare them to Eskimos, drawing parallels in their art and hunting styles, and would show pictures of the tools used by the cave dwellers that he discovered in Wookey Hole Caves, as well as items such as brooches and child's play toys. He also told of a goat-herd he discovered in a cave who had died, leaving his goats tethered, subsequently perishing.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC), asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers, such as plutonium-239, were fissile. Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. While minute quantities of plutonium-239 could be created in cyclotrons, it was not feasible to produce a large quantity that way. Compton conferred with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University about how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber from the University of Illinois about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might then be chemically separated from uranium it was bred from.|$|E

5|$|In December 1942, during World War II, Charles Allen Thomas, {{a chemist}} and {{director}} of research at Monsanto in St. Louis, joined the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC) as the deputy chief of its Division 8, which was responsible for propellants, explosives and the like. Early in 1943, he traveled to the east with Richard C. Tolman, a member of the NDRC, and James B. Conant, the president of Harvard University {{and the chairman of the}} NDRC, to witness a demonstration of a new underwater explosive. Conant and Tolman took the opportunity to quietly investigate Thomas' background. He was then invited to a meeting in Washington D.C., with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the wartime Manhattan Project responsible for building an atomic bomb. When he got there, Thomas found Conant was also present.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{was posted}} back to Dahlgren in September 1939 as {{experimental}} officer. The atmosphere had changed considerably. In June 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved {{the creation of}} the National Defense <b>Research</b> <b>Committee</b> (NDRC), under the direction of Vannevar Bush. Richard C. Tolman, dean of the graduate school at Caltech, was given responsibility for the NDRC's Armor and Ordnance Division. Tolman met with Parsons and Thompson in July 1940, and discussed their needs. Within the Navy, too, there was a change of attitude, with Captain William H. P. (Spike) Blandy as the head of BuOrd's Research Desk. Blandy welcomed the assistance of NDRC scientists in improving and developing weapons.|$|E
