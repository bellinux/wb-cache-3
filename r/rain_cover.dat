40|$|The outdoor ultra-high voltage (UHV) {{dry-type}} air-core smoothing reactors (DASR) of High Voltage Direct Current {{systems are}} equipped with a <b>rain</b> <b>cover</b> and an acoustic enclosure. To study the convective heat transfer between the DASR and the surrounding air, this paper presents a coupled model of the temperature and fluid field based on the structural features and cooling manner. The resistive losses of encapsulations calculated by finite element method (FEM) were used as heat sources in the thermal analysis. The steady fluid and thermal field of the 3 -D reactor model were solved by the finite volume method (FVM), and the temperature distribution characteristics of the reactor were obtained. Subsequently, the axial and radial temperature distributions of encapsulation were investigated separately. Finally, an optical fiber temperature measurement scheme was used for an UHV DASR under natural convection conditions. Comparative analysis showed that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data, which verifies the rationality and accuracy of the numerical calculation. These results {{can serve as a}} reference for the optimal design and maintenance of UHV DASRs...|$|E
40|$|This Degree {{project for}} Degree of Bachelor of Science in Innovation and Design Engineering {{has been carried}} out by Emmelie Johansson and Johan Skarius at the Faculty of Technology and Science at Karlstad’s {{university}} during spring 2009. The Degree project extends 22, 5 ECTS credits.   The commissioning body for this project has been Posten messaging AB, production and processes. The orderer and supervisor was Arne Grentzelius. Supervisors and examiners at Karlstad’s university were Monica Jakobsson and Lennart Wihk. Posten is one of the Nordic regions largest messaging and logistics operators. They are serving 4. 5 million homes and 900   000 businesses daily.   Posten messaging AB is a daughter company to Posten AB. Posten messaging includes both post activities for private customers and companies. The service contains mail distribution and news distribution. Mail distribution gives Posten the largest incomes. Posten distributes both unaddressed and addressed direct mail. Their main country is Sweden. There are about 15000 mailmen in Sweden and 2750 of them are delivering mail by bicycle.   Posten has a problem with the front mailbag on the bicycle and want it to be improved. That is how the students got their assignment. The assignment is to find a better solution of the mailbag. Today’s mailbag has some problems, like its short lifetime, high price and its <b>rain</b> <b>cover</b> allows almost no resistance against rain.   To fulfil all the mailmen’s needs, an extensive analysis of the current market as interviews, inquiries and study visits were made. A several manufacturing companies were contacted by the students, about technical possibilities and estimates of price of the future product. These were followed by generating innovative ideas and identify those which are most likely to become successful concepts.   The final product is made of a plastic material or a composite material (such as glass fibre) which gives it a much longer lifetime together with, more stability and a very advantageous price. Most accessories have been integrated to the manufactoring, which makes it easier to deliver mail. The <b>rain</b> <b>cover</b> has been more resistant of the penetration of rain and designed to fit the mailbag.   The degree project resulted in a prototype in a 1 : 1 scale, 3 D-visualisations, an academic report, a final presentation and an exhibition...|$|E

40|$|The {{endangered}} American burying beetle, Nicrophorus americanus Olivier, presently {{occurs in}} small and widely scattered {{areas on the}} periphery of its former range. As part of the recovery plan for this insect implemented by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), we conducted surveys in Nebraska to ascertain its presence. Additionally, we examined various trapping methods and procedures in the course of our survey work. We compared the effectiveness of different trap designs, trap placement, timing of trapping, types and amounts of bait, and monitoring traps. We also developed methods to reduce beetle mortality in traps. Our work offers more effective sampling procedures for N. americanus and suggests the current USFWS sampling protocol should be modified. New procedures include larger traps, moist soil substrate, a soil berm {{to the edge of the}} trap, longer trapping season, and increased distances between traps. A moist soil substrate, in combination with a shade-giving <b>rain</b> <b>cover,</b> precludes the necessity of servicing all traps by 9 AM each day (as mandated in the current protocol), a task that is logistically difficult or impossible if there are many traps. The sampling procedures we have identified as most appropriate for N. americanus will also improve sampling for other silphid species...|$|E

TheronAutor no autoriza el acceso a texto completo de su documentoA {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of rain protective covers on the vegetative and reproductive development and fruit quality of sweet cherry trees. The trial was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 season in a commercial orchard in Collipulli, Chile, with gabled (Vöen®) crop covers on 10 rows. In half of each row, trees were protected with rain covers from bud-burst, {{and the other half}} was protected from first red colour development of the fruit onwards; a treatment without protective <b>rain</b> <b>cover</b> served as control. The following variables were assessed: temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, phenology, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), fruit development, foliar area, flower bud differentiation, fruit set, vegetative growth and fruit quality at harvest and after conventional cold storage were measured. The protective covering filtered approximately 40 % of incident PAR. Crop cover at budburst advanced tree phenology and increased shoot length. Fruits of cherry trees protected during the colour development phase showed less colour. Protective covering installed at bud-burst increased fruit size, weight and soluble solids concentration, but with more cracking at the style-end scar of the fruit and with reduced fruit firmness. Flower bud differentiation was advanced by both treatments...|$|E
