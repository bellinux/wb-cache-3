25|$|Ken's batsmanship {{displayed}} different qualities {{which were}} not so glamorous, perhaps, but no less essential: determination, courage, application and overwhelming dedication to the task in hand...How reassuring {{it would have been}} last summer to have seen that familiar figure once again – square-on stance, cap pulled down, sleeves rolled up, jutting jaw, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> that bowlers could unleash.|$|E
500|$|Ann {{decides to}} use {{exposure}} therapy on Leslie {{to help her}} deal with the worst-case date scenario. She acts very mean to Leslie, who is initially horrified, but she eventually stands up to Ann. When Ann tells her she is now <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>anything,</b> Leslie feels cheered up and very confident. They go to a bar later to celebrate, where Leslie gets very drunk. After leaving Ann, she visits Dave's house {{to tell him that}} she was nervous about their upcoming date, but now realizes he is lucky to have her because of how [...] "awesome" [...] she is. A seemingly annoyed Dave brings Leslie home. The next day, Leslie feels horrible for ruining her chances with Dave. He arrives at her office later and she starts to apologize, but he says she can make it up to them on their second date, thereby reassuring her the first date is already over. Leslie once again feels cheered up.|$|E

60|$|Lew Flapp was now {{reckless}} and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> almost <b>anything,</b> and he consented. They hired {{a room at}} the cross-roads hotel, {{and that}} night both went to the smoking room to look at what was going on.|$|R
60|$|The {{three boys}} moved forward once again, each {{with his gun}} <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> use, should <b>anything</b> worth {{shooting}} appear. They {{came up to the}} cedars and were then able to look beyond, where the mountain side was full of rocks, with numerous holes between.|$|R
50|$|The velcro star {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} such as gastropod molluscs and chitons. When alert to {{movement in the}} water nearby, the rings of pedicellariae are extended, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> action. If <b>anything</b> touches its aboral (upper) surface, the starfish reacts by snapping shut the pedicellariae {{in the vicinity of}} the stimulus. By this means it can catch prey items such as small fish. The victim is passed to the mouth by movements of the arms and by actions of the tube feet. The velcro star can also defend itself against attack by predators such as the voracious morning sun star (Solaster dawsoni). To fight back, it coils its arms around the attacker and inflicts thousands of nips with its pedicellariae. The attacker often retreats and the velcro star escapes.|$|R
2500|$|... “…Let the hours, {{the minutes}} and the seconds pass as they will, {{as long as}} they do so as quickly as {{possible}} so that I can slap that bocú... From today, it is only 18 days until the carnaval starts. How it torments me to think that there are still so many days to go; I wish it were tomorrow;... I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>anything.</b> And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E
2500|$|MacMillan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in August 1915. Due to him not being 19, he was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Argylls, a training unit, stationed near Edinburgh. In April 1916 {{he was sent to}} the Western Front where he joined the 2nd Battalion (the 93rd), a Regular Army unit which was then serving as part of the 98th Brigade of the 33rd Division, in Northeast France, and immediately became involved in fierce trench warfare at Brickstacks. This was followed by engagements, as part of the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, at Cuinchy, Bazentin-le-Petit, High Wood, Mametz Wood, Arras, Le Cateau and the Selle. While still only 19 years old and a second lieutenant, he was appointed acting adjutant of the battalion in November 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1917, and formally confirmed as Adjutant in June. He remained in this post {{for the rest of the}} war, serving seven different commanding officers (CO). The casualties were immense and, at one time, while a second lieutenant, he found himself by default commanding the battalion. MacMillan wrote [...] "I would say that I was fortunate to belong to the best battalion in the Army, with an unbreakable spirit. You can see this from the record of their operations – and then look at the casualty list: 63 officers and 1175 men killed, and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> at the end of it all".|$|E

60|$|They {{were near}} the town of Ancenis, and a portion of the Vendeans entered the place, which was wholly undefended. The {{inhabitants}} were in abject terror, thinking that the town would be sacked; and were surprised to find that the peasants did no one any harm, and were <b>ready</b> to pay <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> that they required. So long, indeed, as any money whatever remained, the Vendeans paid scrupulously. When it was all expended, the chiefs did the only thing in their power, issuing notes promising to pay; and although these had no value, save in the good faith of the Vendeans, they were received by the Bretons as readily as the assignats of the Republic--which, indeed, like the notes of the Vendeans, were never destined to be paid.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{a bit of}} cake?" [...] And Mrs Eames by {{her look}} implored him to do her so much honour. She implored Captain Dale, also, but they were both inexorable. I {{do not know that}} the two girls were at all more {{inclined}} to eat and drink than the two men; but they understood that Mrs Eames would be broken-hearted if no one partook of her delicacies. The little sacrifices of society are all made by women, as are also the great sacrifices of life. A man who is good <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> is always <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> his duty, and so is a good woman always <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a sacrifice.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{growing a}} bit bolder, the three lads walked slowly {{up to the}} cabin, Snap and Giant with their guns <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> use and the doctor's son with a stout stick he had cut. Thus they reached the doorway, which was wide open. Shep looked in, {{shielding}} his head with one arm, for {{he did not know}} but what he might become the target <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> the strange creature living there should have in hand.|$|R

"Locks and bars, plough graith and harrow teeth! {{and why not}} grates {{and fire}} prongs, and Culross girdles, and an ass to carry the {{merchandise}} through the country, and thou for another ass to lead it by the halter? Why, Catharine, girl, has sense altogether forsaken thee, or dost thou think that in these hard and iron days men will give <b>ready</b> silver <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> save that which can defend their own life, or enable them to take that of their enemy? We want swords to protect ourselves every moment now, thou silly wench, and not ploughs to dress the ground for the grain we may never see rise. As for the matter of our daily bread, those who are strong seize it, and live; those who are weak yield it, and die of hunger. Happy is the man who, like my worthy son, has means of obtaining his living otherwise than by {{the point of the}} sword which he makes. Preach peace to him as much as thou wilt, I will never be he will say thee nay; but as for bidding the first armourer in Scotland forego the forging of swords, curtal axes, and harness, it is enough to drive patience itself mad. Out from my sight! and next morning I prithee remember that, shouldst thou have the luck to see Henry the Smith, which is more than thy usage of him has deserved, you see a man who has not his match in Scotland at the use of broadsword and battle axe, and who can work for five hundred marks a year without breaking a holyday." ...|$|R

5000|$|Daniel Ruge, Ronald Reagan's first {{physician}} in the White House, resigned after the president's first term and called his job [...] "vastly overrated, boring and not medically challenging." [...] Ruge could not attend most state dinners {{due to lack}} of space. He nonetheless had to be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> emergencies, and usually waited alone in his office wearing a tuxedo. Ruge stated that an advantage, however, was that because of the position's prestige [...] "a president's physician can ask <b>for</b> <b>anything,</b> and he will get it. No doctor will refuse a request to consult." ...|$|R

60|$|Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume {{themselves}} on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually {{equal to the}} time of day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.|$|R
