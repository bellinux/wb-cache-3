5|$|An implant {{is tested}} between 8 and 24 weeks to {{determine}} if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the criteria used to determine implant success, the most commonly cited criteria at the implant level are the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, <b>radiographic</b> lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5mm.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{was first}} described by Northway in 1967, who outlined {{the conditions that}} would lead to the diagnosis. This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36weeks could predict long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, Palta et al. in 1998 concluded that <b>radiographic</b> evidence was the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{recommended}} to be temporarily discontinued before any <b>radiographic</b> study involving iodinated contrast agents, (such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan or angiogram), as the contrast dye may temporarily impair kidney function, indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of metformin in the body. Metformin can be resumed after two days, assuming kidney function is normal.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another <b>radiographic</b> sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

25|$|<b>Radiographic</b> {{density is}} the measure of overall darkening of the image. Density is a {{logarithmic}} unit that describes the ratio between light hitting the film and light being transmitted through the film. A higher <b>radiographic</b> density represents more opaque areas of the film, and lower density more transparent areas of the film.|$|E
25|$|Typical <b>radiographic</b> changes include spurs, new bone, bone {{destruction}} and/or joint narrowing or loss.|$|E

25|$|Lead is {{the main}} {{material}} used for <b>radiographic</b> shielding against scattered X-rays.|$|E
25|$|A bone {{fracture}} may be diagnosed {{based on the}} history given and the physical examination performed. <b>Radiographic</b> imaging often is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Under certain circumstances, <b>radiographic</b> examination of the nearby joints is indicated in order to exclude dislocations and fracture-dislocations. In situations where projectional radiography alone is insufficient, Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be indicated.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimated}} <b>radiographic</b> {{magnification factor}} (ERMF) is {{the ratio of}} the source-detector distance (SDD) over the source-object distance (SOD).|$|E
25|$|Additional <b>radiographic</b> {{findings}} include joint effusion and degenerative {{changes such as}} {{joint space}} narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation.|$|E
25|$|X-rays of the {{shoulder}} show loss of the normal space between the ball and socket. X-ray can provide <b>radiographic</b> staging of shoulder osteoarthritis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiographic</b> exams {{are usually}} {{performed}} by Radiographers. Qualifications for Radiographers vary by country, but many Radiographers now {{are required to}} hold a degree.|$|E
25|$|X-ray imaging {{of the hip}} is {{most often}} unremarkable. Subtle <b>radiographic</b> signs include an accentuated pericapsular shadow, {{widening}} of the medial joint space, lateral displacement of the femoral epiphyses with surface flattening (Waldenström sign), prominent obturator shadow, diminution of soft tissue planes around the hip joint or slight demineralisation of the proximal femur. The main reason for <b>radiographic</b> examination is to exclude bony lesions such as occult fractures, slipped upper femoral epiphysis or bone tumours (such as osteoid osteoma). An anteroposterior and frog lateral (Lauenstein) view of the pelvis and both hips is advisable.|$|E
25|$|The {{calcification}} deposits, {{after they}} have become sufficiently advanced, are partially visible on coronary artery computed tomography or electron beam tomography (EBT) as rings of increased <b>radiographic</b> density, forming halos around the outer edges of the atheromatous plaques, within the artery wall. On CT, >130 units on the Hounsfield scale (some argue for 90 units) has been the <b>radiographic</b> density usually accepted as clearly representing tissue calcification within arteries. These deposits demonstrate unequivocal evidence of the disease, relatively advanced, even though the lumen of the artery is often still normal by angiography.|$|E
25|$|A {{radiographer}} uses {{their expertise}} {{and knowledge of}} patient care, physics, human anatomy, physiology, pathology and radiology to assess patients, develop optimum radiological techniques and evaluate the resulting <b>radiographic</b> media.|$|E
25|$|Negative <b>radiographic</b> {{contrast}} {{agents are}} air {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO2). The latter is easily absorbed by the body and causes less spasm. It can also be injected into the blood, where air absolutely cannot.|$|E
25|$|The <b>radiographic</b> {{approach}} {{can sometimes be}} done during angiography, however usually only when an artery segment happens to be visualized on end so that the calcification within the outer edges of plaques can be sufficiently seen.|$|E
25|$|Metformin (Glucophage) may be {{the best}} choice for {{patients}} who also have heart failure, but it should be temporarily discontinued before any <b>radiographic</b> procedure involving intravenous iodinated contrast, as patients are at an increased risk of lactic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Geometric unsharpness {{is caused}} by the X-ray {{generator}} not creating X-rays from a single point but rather from an area, as can be measured as the focal spot size. Geometric unsharpness increases proportionally to the focal spot size, as well as the estimated <b>radiographic</b> magnification factor (ERMF).|$|E
25|$|Wisdom {{teeth that}} are fully erupted and in normal {{function}} need no special attention {{and should be}} treated {{just like any other}} tooth. It is more challenging, however to make treatment decisions with asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth, i.e. wisdom teeth that have no communication to the mouth and no evidence of clinical or <b>radiographic</b> disease (see Treatment controversy below).|$|E
25|$|Digital X-ray {{equipment}} {{mounted in}} the radiation treatment device {{is often used to}} picture the patient’s internal anatomy at time before or during treatment, which then can be compared to the original planning CT series. Usage of an orthogonal set-up of two <b>radiographic</b> axes is common, to provide means for highly accurate patient position verification.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} the chest X-Ray, abreugraphy (from the name of its inventor, Dr. Manuel Dias de Abreu) was a small <b>radiographic</b> image, also called {{miniature}} mass radiography (MMR) or miniature chest radiograph. Though its resolution is limited (it doesn't allow the diagnosis of lung cancer, for example) it is sufficiently accurate for diagnosis of tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the Greenhalghs had cleverly {{invested}} in some actual Roman silver coins, which they melted down {{to create the}} lanx. This complicated the matter of authenticity. <b>Radiographic</b> analysis also showed that different era solders had been used, suggesting it had been recast in the eighteenth or nineteenth century, perhaps using fragments of the original.|$|E
25|$|Projectional {{radiography}} {{is a form}} {{of medical}} imaging that produces two-dimensional images by x-ray radiation. <b>Radiographic</b> exams are typically performed by radiographers, who are trained, licensed medical professionals. However, radiographers generally perform other types of medical imaging as well, such as computed tomography, which also uses X-rays but generates axial sections of the body instead of projections.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{osteoarthritis}} affected 52.5 {{million people}} in the United States, approximately 50% of whom were 65 years and older. It is estimated that 80% of the population have <b>radiographic</b> evidence of osteoarthritis by age 65, although only 60% of those will have symptoms. The rate of osteoarthritis in the United States is forecast to be 78 million (26%) adults by 2040.|$|E
25|$|ARC is {{essentially}} a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (1015) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional <b>radiographic</b> techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world’s highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays {{in the range of}} 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments.|$|E
25|$|Contrast {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in <b>radiographic</b> density between adjacent portions of the image. The range between black and white on the final radiograph. High contrast, or short-scale contrast, means there is little gray on the radiograph, and there are fewer gray shades between black and white. Low contrast, or long-scale contrast, means there is much gray on the radiograph, and there are many gray shades between black and white.|$|E
25|$|NIC shots halted in February 2011, as {{the machine}} {{was turned over to}} SSMP {{materials}} experiments. As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced <b>Radiographic</b> Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence.|$|E
25|$|Two {{forms of}} <b>radiographic</b> images are {{in use in}} medical imaging. Projection {{radiography}} and fluoroscopy, with the latter being useful for catheter guidance. These 2D techniques are still in wide use despite the advance of 3D tomography due to the low cost, high resolution, and depending on application, lower radiation dosages. This imaging modality utilizes a wide beam of x rays for image acquisition and is the first imaging technique available in modern medicine.|$|E
25|$|By <b>radiographic,</b> i.e. X-Ray, methods, after arteries have {{developed}} advanced calcified atherosclerotic plaque, IMT {{can also be}} semi-estimated by {{the distance between the}} outer edges of calcification (actually this leaves out most of the media) and the outer edges of an angiographic dye column within the artery lumen. This is a far more complex technique; it is invasive to the body due to the use of X-Ray radiation, catheters and angiographic contrast agents.|$|E
25|$|Cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) based image guided {{systems have been}} integrated with medical linear accelerators to great success. With improvements in flat-panel technology, CBCT {{has been able to}} provide volumetric imaging, and allows for <b>radiographic</b> or fluoroscopic monitoring throughout the treatment process. Cone beam CT acquires many projections over the entire volume of interest in each projection. Using reconstruction strategies pioneered by Feldkamp, the 2D projections are reconstructed into a 3D volume analogous to the CT planning dataset.|$|E
25|$|During this infant {{commercial}} development, many incorrectly {{predicted that}} the moving images of fluoroscopy would completely replace roentgenographs (<b>radiographic</b> still image films), but the then superior diagnostic quality of the roentgenograph and their already alluded safety enhancement of lower radiation dose via shorter exposure prevented this from occurring. Another factor was that plain films inherently offered recording of the image in a simple and inexpensive way, whereas recording and playback of fluoroscopy remained a more complex and expensive proposition {{for decades to come}} (discussed in detail below).|$|E
