60|$|The invalid {{had kept}} her eyes sternly {{fastened}} upon her young niece ever {{since the beginning of}} the interview. Now she <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and touched her bell.|$|E

5000|$|We {{need not}} {{understand}} a criminal's troubled past or environmental influences. We need not <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{to help him}} along a pathway to redemption.

6000|$|... 'Yes.' The {{answer was}} given quickly, for a thought was {{floating}} through him: Why did this strong brave man, suddenly stricken blind, wish {{to know whether}} his windows were at a height? He was not surprised when his patient <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> rested it on his arm and said in an imploring tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|A sudden light {{sprang to}} the man's {{eyes as he}} <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and grasped the girl's fingers. [...] "Do you care a little now?" [...] he asked. [...] "Can't {{you tell me that}} you do--just a bit?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{satisfied}} {{that this was}} final and that there could now be no chance for Kirk {{to back out of}} the contract, he <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and gave a tug at the beard which had led to all the confusion.|$|E
6000|$|The car took {{a corner}} and purred down a lane. Billie <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and grabbed at the {{steering}} wheel. [...] "Of course, {{if you want to}} smash up in a ditch!" [...] said Sam, righting the car with a wrench.|$|E
60|$|When he woke {{it seemed}} even less {{attractive}} {{than it had}} done {{when he went to}} sleep. He had banged his head on the pillow six times over-night, and this silent alarm proved effective, as it always does. <b>Reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> for his watch, he found that it was five minutes past six.|$|R
60|$|But {{even as he}} {{was quickly}} <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> which shook with the {{intensity}} of his excitement, towards the letter on the table, Blakeney, with one loud and sudden shout, threw the heavy candlesticks onto the floor. They rattled down with a terrific crash, the lights were extinguished, and the whole room was immediately plunged in utter darkness.|$|R
60|$|Gulden <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>hand.</b> His instant {{acceptance}} evidently amazed Kells and the others.|$|R
60|$|Anne {{laid her}} fresh young cheek against Marilla's faded one, and <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to pat Matthew's shoulder. Marilla {{would have given}} much just then to have possessed Anne's power of putting her {{feelings}} into words; but nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her arms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing that she need never let her go.|$|E
60|$|Before {{long they}} came upon three caves, {{hollowed}} from the rocks, {{and in front}} of each cave squatted a queer little dwarf. Ozma and the Wizard paused to examine them and found them well-shaped, strong and lively. They had big round ears, flat noses and wide grinning mouths, and their jet-black hair came to points on top of their heads, much resembling horns. Their clothing fitted snugly to their bodies and limbs and the Imps were so small in size that at first Ozma did not consider them at all dangerous. But one of them suddenly <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and caught the dress of the Princess, jerking it so sharply that she nearly fell down, and a moment later another Imp pushed the little Wizard so hard that he bumped against Ozma and both unexpectedly sat down upon the ground.|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} late, {{after they}} had toiled up a white, winding wash of sand and gravel, they came upon a dry waterhole. Cameron dug deep into the sand, but without avail. He was turning to retrace weary steps back to the last water when his comrade asked him to wait. Cameron watched him search in his pack and bring forth {{what appeared to be}} a small, forked branch of a peach tree. He grasped the prongs of the fork and held them before him with the end standing straight out, and then he began to walk along the stream bed. Cameron, at first amused, then amazed, then pitying, and at last curious, kept pace with the prospector. He saw a strong tension of his comrade's wrists, as if he was holding hard against a considerable force. The end of the peach branch began to quiver and turn. Cameron <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to touch it, and was astounded at feeling a powerful vibrant force pulling the branch downward. He felt it as a magnetic shock. The branch kept turning, and at length pointed to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|The old man <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{trembling}} <b>hand</b> {{and helped}} {{himself to a}} cigarette. [...] "I am in your hands, Anna," [...] said he. [...] "You were always good to me." ...|$|R
60|$|The mountaineer's countenance {{was proof}} against emotion. But he <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> big <b>hand</b> and {{enclosed}} Ariela's thin brown one. Her soul peeped out once through her impassive face, hallowing it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor little Possums," [...] {{she hurried}} on, nodding {{her head and}} <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> caressing <b>hand</b> to where the fox terrier was ecstatically gnawing a deer-rib. A vicious snarl and a wicked snap that barely missed her fingers were her reward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you'd {{get along}} nicely--nicely--but you wouldn't forget {{the old man}} altogether, Mistress Blythe--no, I don't think you'll ever quite forget him. The race of Joseph always remembers one another. But it'll be a memory that won't hurt--I {{like to think that}} my memory won't hurt my friends--it'll always be kind of {{pleasant}} to them, I hope and believe. It won't be very long now before lost Margaret calls me, for the last time. I'll be all ready to answer. I jest spoke of this because there's a little favor I want to ask you. Here's this poor old Matey of mine"--Captain Jim <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and poked the big, warm, velvety, golden ball on the sofa. The First Mate uncoiled himself like a spring with a nice, throaty, comfortable sound, half purr, half meow, stretched his paws in air, turned over and coiled himself up again. [...] "HE'll miss me when I start on the V'yage. I can't bear to think of leaving the poor critter to starve, like he was left before. If anything happens to me will you give Matey a bite and a corner, Mistress Blythe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} {{when he was}} thirty-eight, {{for the first and}} only time in his life travelling on the Continent, with his twin-brother James and a man named Traquair. On the way from Germany to Venice, he had found himself at the Hotel Goldene Alp at Salzburg. It was late August, and weather for the gods: sunshine on the walls and the shadows of the vine-leaves, and at night, the moonlight, and again on the walls the shadows of the vine-leaves. Averse to the suggestions of other people, Swithin had refused to visit the Citadel; he had spent the day alone in the window of his bedroom, smoking a succession of cigars, and disparaging the appearance of the passers-by. After dinner he was driven by boredom into the streets. His chest puffed out like a pigeon's, and with something of a pigeon's cold and inquiring eye, he strutted, annoyed at the frequency of uniforms, which seemed to him both needless and offensive. His spleen rose at this crowd of foreigners, who spoke an unintelligible language, wore hair on their faces, and smoked bad tobacco. 'A queer lot!' he thought. The sound of music from a cafe attracted him; he walked in, vaguely moved by a wish for the distinction of adventure, without the trouble which adventure usually brought with it; spurred too, perhaps, by an after-dinner demon. The cafe was the bier-halle of the 'Fifties, with a door at either end, and lighted by a large wooden lantern. On a small dais three musicians were fiddling. Solitary men, or groups, sat at some dozen tables, and the waiters hurried about replenishing glasses; the air was thick with smoke. Swithin sat down. [...] "Wine!" [...] he said sternly. The astonished waiter brought him wine. Swithin pointed to a beer glass on the table. [...] "Here!" [...] he said, with the same ferocity. The waiter poured out the wine. 'Ah!' thought Swithin, 'they can understand if they like.' A group of officers close by were laughing; Swithin stared at them uneasily. A hollow cough sounded almost in his ear. To his left a man sat reading, with his elbows on the corners of a journal, and his gaunt shoulders raised almost to his eyes. He had a thin, long nose, broadening suddenly at the nostrils; a black-brown beard, spread in a savage fan over his chest; what was visible of the face was the colour of old parchment. A strange, wild, haughty-looking creature! Swithin observed his clothes with some displeasure--they were the clothes of a journalist or strolling actor. And yet he was impressed. This was singular. How could he be impressed by a fellow in such clothes! The man <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> covered with black hairs, and took up a tumbler that contained a dark-coloured fluid. 'Brandy!' thought Swithin. The crash of a falling chair startled him--his neighbour had risen. He was of immense height, and very thin; his great beard seemed to splash away from his mouth; he was glaring at the group of officers, and speaking. Swithin made out two words: [...] "Hunde! Deutsche Hunde!" [...] 'Hounds! Dutch hounds!' he thought: 'Rather strong!' One of the officers had jumped up, and now drew his sword. The tall man swung his chair up, and brought it down with a thud. Everybody round started up and closed on him. The tall man cried out, [...] "To me, Magyars!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Govind Nihalani {{said in an}} {{interview}} on Indian TV after winning the National Award that the [...] "moment" [...] had actually occurred just before filming, during the rehearsal, where actor Om Puri broke down and started weeping openly while reciting this poem; Nihalani <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to comfort him and then withdrew it feeling that [...] "his anguish was too monumental for a mere touch to provide any solace". He subsequently instructed Smita Patil to play the scene like this, giving her his futile gesture.|$|E
5000|$|With the Madonna in the Church in Berlin, this is {{generally}} {{thought to have}} been one of van Eyck's two paintings of the Madonna and Child from the final years before his death in about 1441. Both show a standing Virgin, in contrast to his earlier treatments of the subject, and the great majority of other painted Virgins. Models for standing Virgins existed in the icons of Byzantine art, and both paintings also represent modified version of the eleusa type, sometimes called the Virgin of Tenderness in English, where the Virgin and Child touch cheeks, and he <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] The Madonna in the Church wears a blue cloak over a red dress.|$|R
6000|$|The {{light of}} a strange {{excitement}} came in Herrick's face. [...] "Both of us," [...] said he, [...] "both of us together. It's not possible you can enjoy this business. Come," [...] and he <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> timid <b>hand,</b> [...] "a few strokes in the lagoon--and rest!" ...|$|R
60|$|Werper {{was upon}} his feet now, gazing, white and trembling, at the fate which had {{overtaken}} him {{even in the}} fastness of the labyrinthine jungle. Instinctively he turned to flee; but Tarzan of the Apes <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>hand</b> and grasped him by the shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|... "You okay, John?" [...] Curt <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{and touched}} his shoulder. Rebus shook his head slowly, eyes {{squeezed}} shut. Curt didn't make it out the first time, so Rebus had to repeat what he said next: [...] "I don't believe in heaven." [...] That was the horror of it. This life {{was the only one}} you got. No redemption afterwards, no chance of wiping the slate clean and starting over. Rebus said [...] "There is no justice in the world." [...] "You'd know more about that than I would", Curt replied.|$|E
5000|$|Gbowee {{told the}} EMU {{students}} {{that she went}} from being an angry, broke, virtually homeless, 25-year-old mother of four children with {{no idea of what}} her future might be, to listening to the voice of God in 1997. She said God spoke to her through a five-year-old boy, a son whom she had nicknamed Nuku. Comments made by Nuku made her realize that she had succumbed to [...] "crippling hopelessness", and that her low self-esteem and sense of helplessness were destroying her family, which was already under assault from Liberia's brutal warfare. Gbowee said she began taking one tiny step at a time, asking for God's help with each step. And that God sent her angels in the form of human beings who <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> at just the moment when she was most desperate.|$|E
5000|$|... "After {{several years}} of touring and quite a few album {{releases}} we have decided {{that it is time}} to go our separate ways. We have been a band for a very long time and feel good about everything we were able to accomplish. At this point in our lives and our careers we feel its time to move on to something fresh and new. Whether it be music, touring or just being at home to live and enjoy life. We would like to thank all of our fans, friends and families for all of the great support over the years. We would also like to thank all of the bands we have shared the stage with and everyone who has ever worked with the band, opened a door or <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand.</b> We will be playing our final two shows in April. One in San Diego and one in Orange County. Come rock with us one more time." ...|$|E
25|$|Scenes of TVXQ posing {{with women}} are {{interspersed}} throughout the video. The duo are seen seducing the women by touching their faces, brushing up their legs and fingering up their arms. Halfway into the song, the video cuts into an animated dance break, with a solo dance by each member. Bebop music is played. After the break, {{the band and}} dancers freeze. Yunho snaps his fingers and they are brought back to motion. When the song ends, the duo walk back into the marble hallway. They stop by the portrait of the muses and is enamored by the muse in the middle, who <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand.</b> They are then pulled into the painting. The video ends with TVXQ's tenth anniversary Tense logo.|$|R
60|$|Uiliami {{blew the}} whistle {{suspended}} on his broad bare chest by a cord of cocoanut sennit. Grief <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> angry <b>hand</b> for Cornelius, who titubated into safety behind Uiliami's massive bulk. A dozen strapping Polynesians, not one under six feet, ran down the palace walk and ranged behind their commander.|$|R
50|$|The demon {{commands}} {{the boy to}} surrender, but he refuses to give in, saying that he cannot be harmed while he stands within the pentagon. The demon reasons that he has already granted one of the boy's two wishes: his family is together again. He {{also points out that}} what the boy has drawn is not a pentagon, but a hexagon, which offers no magical protection whatsoever. The demon muses that the boy's other wish has also been granted: he will never fail geometry again. Francisco approaches his son from behind and takes hold of his head, tilting it backwards. The boy laments the unfairness of his situation. The demon agrees, and <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to take hold of his throat. The screen fades to black as ripping sounds are heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care if I sample one of Mis' Bumpus's doughnuts," [...] Mr. Wiley would reply politely, <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> large <b>hand</b> {{that gave}} evidence, {{in spite of}} Sapolio, of an {{intimacy}} with grease cups and splash pans. [...] "I guess there's nobody in this burg can make doughnuts to beat yours, Miss Bumpus." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can escape}} this fate," [...] {{continued}} the Arab; [...] "Mohammed Beyd will save you," [...] and he <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> brown <b>hand</b> and seized {{the fingers of}} her right <b>hand</b> in <b>a</b> grasp so sudden and so fierce that this brutal passion was revealed as clearly in the act as though his lips had confessed it in words. Jane Clayton wrenched herself from his grasp.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a pivotal}} scene, {{from which the}} movie derives its name, Jyotsna gives Anant a poem to read to him from a book that she is carrying, Ardh Satya (see below for transliteration). Anant begins to read the poem aloud; as the meaning sinks in, his smile vanishes; he {{continues}} reading in a more subdued and sombre tone. Filmed in a single long take, {{this is one of}} the finest moments world cinema has shown portraying the effect of art upon man in modern cinema (compare to Apres Nous). Later in the film, a cathartic moment occurs symbolising the poem, where Anant breaks down crying. Jyotsna <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to comfort him but then withdraws it without touching him, in one of the most poignant moments of cinema; it is as if she realised that he is [...] "within this Chakravyuh, or Circle of Deceit" [...] alone and needs to find his inner strength to break out.|$|R
60|$|The little by-path {{wound around}} the marsh and then struck {{up the long}} wooded hill {{on the top of}} which Rosemary lived. Beyond, through the trees, they could see the {{moonlight}} shining across the level summer fields. But the little path was shadowy and narrow. Trees crowded over it, and trees are never quite as friendly to human beings after nightfall as they are in daylight. They wrap themselves away from us. They whisper and plot furtively. If they <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to us it has a hostile, tentative touch. People walking amid trees after night always draw closer together instinctively and involuntarily, making an alliance, physical and mental, against certain alien powers around them. Rosemary's dress brushed against John Meredith as they walked. Not even an absent-minded minister, who was after all a young man still, though he firmly believed he had outlived romance, could be insensible to the charm of the night and the path and the companion.|$|R
5000|$|... “In this gentle, lucid, erudite and {{compassionate}} guide, Albert Flynn DeSilver offers {{the wisdom and}} warmth of a true friend who has walked the path. One who <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> capable <b>hand</b> and offers it to the new writer, to the struggling writer, and says here, here, {{let me show you}} not only how to write, but how to live.”—Dani Shapiro, Bestselling author of Still Writing and Devotion ...|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} answer that. Blindly he <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> with <b>a</b> shaking <b>hand,</b> to find hers, {{to hold it}} close. Lenore felt the tumult in him. She was shocked. A great tenderness, sweet and motherly, flooded over her.|$|R
