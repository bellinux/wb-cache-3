2500|$|Working {{to modify}} {{and improve the}} novice team's March 731 chassis, Postlethwaite {{elevated}} the team into serious contention and the following year designed the team's car from scratch. 'Doc' Postlethwaite's [...] Hesketh 308 secured a number of podium positions. The following year he further developed the car's unusual <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> suspension and saw his creation take victory at the Dutch Grand Prix {{in the hands of}} James Hunt.|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} of the Kabinenroller was by a transverse lower arm sprung by a torsional 3-element <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> at the inside end. Front suspension travel was limited by rubber buffers. Rear suspension was by a trailing arm similar to a single-sided motorcycle swingarm which also formed the enclosure for the chain drive to the rear wheel. The trailing arm was suspended by another torsional <b>rubber</b> <b>spring.</b> Hydraulic dampers {{were added to the}} design with the introduction of the KR200 in 1955; also the front track was increased at that time.|$|E
50|$|When fitted {{out as a}} {{floatplane}} {{the machine}} had one tail and two main floats. All three were of a plain non-stepped type and could move independently of each other using steel and <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> assemblies.|$|E
50|$|The Astra-Protopopescu had a conventional, fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage. A short V-form strut {{was attached}} to each lower fuselage longeron, joined by a cross-piece at their apexes, above which a single axle bearing the main wheels was <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung.</b> The wooden tailskid was also <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>springs</b> (linear) Each bogie {{has three}} <b>rubber</b> <b>springs</b> that the car-body rests on, with the inner spring being {{equivalent}} to both outer springs (twice the stiffness and vertical preload). Compressive stiffness must be high to support car-body weight, whilst low shear stiffness allows bogie (yaw) rotation in curves.|$|R
50|$|The IS-7 had a short, <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung</b> skid {{under the}} cockpit and a fixed, {{unsprung}} monowheel under the wing, fitted with a brake. There was also a small tail skid.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring-loaded}} mechanism adjusts {{the angle of}} attack of the flukes using the water pressure from swimming. The <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> can be set on three tension settings from flexible for slow relatively efficient swimming to more rigid for sprinting.|$|E
50|$|Aeon progressive-rate {{auxiliary}} <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> bumpers: These {{mounted on}} the spring rebound pad in the rear and on the shock absorber stem in the front. Improves the cars handling. Indicaps: Replaces valve stem caps. Preset to tire pressures 18, 20, 26, 28, or 30 lb.|$|E
5000|$|As {{all other}} types of the Einheitslokomotiven program the class E 40 had welded bogies with central pins. Instead the {{formerly}} used axle hung motors it used a quill drive with a circular <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> as a connecting element ("Gummiringfeder" [...] in German) reducing unsprung mass. The control unit had 28 power settings.|$|E
50|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} 1965, the three ABDeh 8/8 class vehicles generally operated successfully. However, in 1980 their <b>rubber</b> <b>springing,</b> {{which had been}} responsible for causing frequent derailments, was replaced by flexicoil suspensions.|$|R
50|$|Hall One, {{the main}} concert hall, is a {{separate}} structure within the building, it is a box that sits on <b>rubber</b> <b>springs</b> to give it complete acoustic separation {{from the rest of}} the building.|$|R
2500|$|The wooden {{fuselage}} of the Favorit is slender, with {{a maximum}} cross section of 0.38 m², and tapers rearwards only gently. [...] The tail surfaces are straight tapered, with marked sweep on the fin but none on the rudder, which extends to the keel. [...] The horizontal surfaces are mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, forward enough for the rudder hinge to be ahead of the elevator trailing edge. [...] Forward of the wing, the cockpit is under a long, low, single piece canopy. The Favorit lands on a fixed monowheel, partially enclosed in the fuselage, <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung</b> and fitted with brakes, assisted by a <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung</b> nose skid.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} thirties {{there had been}} several {{projects}} to improve the Renault R35 light infantry tank. One of these was directed to {{the improvement of the}} horizontal <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> suspension system that, apart from being less reliable than originally hoped for, caused an uncomfortable ride, high track and tread wear and an unfavourable weight distribution.|$|E

50|$|Maintenance of Montreal's subway cars is rigorous, as {{reliability}} levels (Mean Distance Between Failures/MDBF ratings) {{are more}} than double that of typical North American subway cars by North American standards (at 200,000 km in 2004). However, they suffer elevated levels of vandalism, they retain many obsolete components, parts availability is diminishing, and ride quality has deteriorated {{over the years as}} their suspension systems and <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> packs harden with old age. Poor ride quality has not been attributed to the tires or tracks.|$|E
50|$|Ramamrithram {{provided}} the Kartik with similar landing gear {{to that of}} his earlier Bharani: a fixed monowheel without a brake, a <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung,</b> steel shod forward skid and a tail skid with tennis balls as a spring.|$|R
50|$|The new Sōgakudō Concert Hall {{opened on}} the {{university}} campus in April 1998. The structure, by Okada Architect & Associates with acoustical design by Nagata Acoustics, is insulated from the vibrations of the subway below by <b>rubber</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The IS-5 had a short, <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung</b> skid {{under the}} cockpit and a fixed, {{unsprung}} monowheel under the wing, fitted with a brake. There was also a small extension of the fin {{to act as a}} tail bumper.|$|R
50|$|The Brompton uses a {{combined}} rear fold and suspension design. During riding, the rear triangle {{rests on a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> to provide suspension between the rear wheel and the main frame supporting the rider. The suspension block is kept in compression by the rider's weight. A factory-fitted firm suspension block is offered {{as an alternative to}} the standard block for heavier riders or those wanting a more responsive ride. There is no suspension for the front wheel, although the titanium forks of the Superlight versions provide a small amount of spring.|$|E
50|$|Each {{displacer}} unit {{contains a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>spring,</b> and damping {{is achieved by}} the displaced fluid passing through rubber valves. The displaced fluid passes to the displacer of the paired wheel, thus providing a dynamic interaction between front and rear wheels. When a front wheel encounters a bump fluid is transferred to the corresponding rear displacer then lowers the rear wheel, hence lifting the rear, minimising pitch associated with the bump. Naturally the reverse occurs when it is a rear wheel that encounters a bump. This effect is particularly good on small cars as their shorter wheelbases are more affected by pitching.|$|E
50|$|The oval {{cross-section}} fuselage of the Delfin tapers {{gently to}} the rear to an integral fin. All Delfins were built with a fin and rudder strongly swept on both {{leading and trailing edges}} and with an all-moving tailplane, fitted with servo tabs, mounted on the fuselage. Four Delfin 2s were later modified into Delfin 3s with a more upright vertical tail and a fin-mounted fixed tailplane with conventional elevators. The Delfin cockpit is long, with the pilot seated in a semi-reclining position. On Delfin 1s, it is covered by a long, forward sliding, single piece canopy reaching almost to the nose but later marks have a shorter, starboard hinged one piece canopy, with the upper nose surface plywood skinned {{like the rest of the}} fuselage. The undercarriage consists of a fixed, unsprung, semi-protruding monowheel and a small tail bumper. A <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> nose skid was added to the Delfin 2.|$|E
2500|$|The Feiro I had a {{tailskid}} undercarriage with mainwheels [...] {{apart and}} <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung</b> {{on a single}} axle, its ends supported by longitudinal V-struts and positioned laterally by a steel V-strut; all struts were from the lower fuselage longerons.|$|R
50|$|The main {{landing gear}} was a fixed, {{unsprung}} monowheel under mid-wing, {{at the point where}} the lower fuselage curved upwards toward its more slender rear. There was also a very short <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung</b> skid under the cockpit and a tail bumper.|$|R
50|$|The H.34 had fixed, {{tailskid}} landing gear, {{with its}} mainwheels 1.80 m apart on an axle {{articulated in the}} centre. The outer ends of the axle were <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung</b> on V-struts from the lower longerons and its centre supported from a false axle.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} aircraft, the HM.14 has no ailerons or elevators, and no foot-operated {{flight control}}s. The {{flight control system}} comprises a conventional control stick. Fore-and-aft movement of the stick is transmitted via cables to the rear underside of the main wing, that {{is supported by a}} single pivot at the front underside, mounted on a pylon on the fuselage. Rearward movement of the stick pulls the cables, and increases the pitch and therefore the lift of the main wing. The aircraft will then pitch up, due to the centre of pressure being forward of the center of gravity. Forward stick movement has the reverse effect. Resistance to stick movement is usually an aerodynamic force from the main wing, {{but there is also a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> (bungee) pulling down on the leading edge of the wing, and a telescopic strut behind the pilot's head limits the total wing movement. Side-to-side movement of the stick controls the all-moving rudder via cables. In flight, this produces a stable rolling motion, as required in a banked turn, because the wings both have dihedral. That rolling characteristic is not safely available during take-off or landing, so crosswinds are not easily tolerated.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{exercise}} {{they were sent}} back to Renault, who shortly afterwards submitted three types for evaluation to the Commission d'Expériences du Matériel Automobile at Vincennes: prototype 79758, still with the original suspension, 79759 with added internal hydraulic dampers and 79760 with a fully new suspension consisting of a central bogie with a leaf spring and wheels at the front and the back connected to two horizontal helical springs. In November and December 1932 the [...] "Commission de Vincennes" [...] tested them, using as reference changed specifications determined on 10 June 1932. They {{were found to have}} a sufficient speed (56.25 - 60 km/h), but an insufficient range of 166 - 188 kilometres and to be too heavy with a weight of 4.8 tons. On 8 December it was decided to abandon the unrealistic three ton weight limit and install larger fuel tanks and heavier armour; the vehicles were again sent back. In April 1933 Renault submitted two types, fitted with 0.5 ton weights simulating an up-armouring from nine to thirteen millimetres maximum: 79758 rebuilt with a horizontal <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> suspension and 79757 fitted with a suspension derived from that of 79760, but now with a central vertical spring and the casings of the horizontal springs filled with oil to make them act as dampers. They were tested until June 1933 and, against the strong advice of Renault favouring the rubber springs, on 6 June a production was ordered for prototype 79757 as the AMR Renault modèle 1933 or AMR 33. The Renault factory identifier was Renault VM.|$|E
50|$|The British Motor Corporation {{was also}} an early adopter of {{interconnected}} suspension. A system dubbed Hydrolastic was introduced in 1962 on the Morris 1100 {{and went on to}} be used on a variety of BMC models. Hydrolastic was developed by suspension engineer Alex Moulton and used rubber cones as the springing medium (these were first used on the 1959 Mini) with the suspension units on each side connected to each other by a fluid filled pipe. The fluid transmitted the force of road bumps from one wheel to the other (on the same principle as the Citroen 2CV's mechanical system described above) and because each suspension unit contained valves to restrict the flow of fluid also served as a shock absorber. Moulton went on to develop a replacement for Hydrolastic for BMC's successor, British Leyland. This system manufactured under licence by Dunlop in Coventry, called Hydragas worked on the same principle but instead of <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> units it used metal spheres divided internally by a rubber diaphragm. The top half contained pressurised gas and the lower half the same fluid as used on the Hydrolastic system. The fluid transmitted suspension forces between the units on each side whilst the gas acted as the springing medium via the diaphragm. This is the same principle as the Citroen hydropneumatic system and provides a similar ride quality but is self-contained and doesn't require an engine-driven pump to provide hydraulic pressure. The downside is that Hydragas is, unlike the Citroen system, not height adjustable or self-levelling. Hydragas was introduced in 1973 on the Austin Allegro and was used on several models, the last car to use it being the MG F in 2002. The system was changed in favour of coil springs over dampers, due to cost reasons, {{towards the end of the}} vehicle's life. When it was decommissioned in 2006 the Hydragas manufacturing line was over 40 years old.|$|E
25|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} had mainwheels on a rigid axle, <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung</b> {{from the}} crosspiece between two tall V-form legs {{mounted on the}} fuselage at the same points as the interplane struts. The axle and crosspiece were enclosed within an airfoil section fairing, which provided some additional lift.|$|R
50|$|The Basettino had a {{hexagonal}} section, plywood covered nacelle, with curved {{upper and}} lower surfaces. A deep, <b>rubber</b> <b>sprung,</b> wooden landing skid on most of its underside formed its undercarriage. The pilot's cockpit, comfortable though open and without a windscreen, was placed below the wing leading edge.|$|R
5000|$|Axle box {{suspensions}} absorb shocks {{between the}} axle bearings and the bogie frame. The axle box suspension usually {{consists of a}} spring between the bogie frame and axle bearings to permit up-and-down movement, and sliders to prevent lateral movement. A more modern design uses solid <b>rubber</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R

40|$|Dampening {{systems are}} {{important}} in heavy vehicles utilized in rough terrains, with purpose to reduce shocks and vibrations with negative influences on the vehicle and, more importantly, on the operator of the vehicle. During the years the heavy vehicles require sturdier construction parts, due to demands on higher load capacity, where the easy solution to scale up the construction parts is not always applicable for dampening systems with nonlinear behavior. Hence, the sturdiness {{in the design of}} these dampening systems requires improvement. In this thesis the design of the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> used as <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> in Volvo’s articulated hauler A 40 G is treated. The aim of this thesis is to find alternative design solutions on the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring,</b> improving its lifetime. The usual failure of these rubber springs is crack propagation in the rubber body. In the method of this thesis, alternative design solution are generated in concepts though brain storming, which are adjusted to achieve the desired behavior of the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> through calculations and tested in performance through simulations in Abaqus. From analyzing the generated data, it is concluded that among the tested design solutions, a combination of fewer plates and shaping the plates as thin bowls, results in highest potential increase in lifetime...|$|E
