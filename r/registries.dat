5|$|The modern {{practice}} of flagging ships {{in foreign countries}} began in the 1920s in the United States when shipowners, frustrated by increased regulations and rising labor costs, began to register their ships to Panama. The use of open <b>registries</b> steadily increased, and in 1968, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom as the world's largest shipping register. , {{more than half of}} the world’s merchant ships were registered with open <b>registries,</b> and the Panama, Liberia, and Marshall Islands flags accounted for almost 40% of the entire world fleet, in terms of deadweight tonnage. In 2006 up to 20% of high-seas fishing vessels were registered in states they were not connected to.|$|E

Each <b>Registry</b> value {{stored in a}} <b>Registry</b> key has a unique name whose letter case is not significant. The Windows API functions that query and manipulate <b>Registry</b> values take value names separately from the key path and/or handle that identifies the parent key. <b>Registry</b> values may contain backslashes in their names, but doing so makes them difficult to distinguish from their key paths when using some legacy Windows <b>Registry</b> API functions (whose usage is deprecated in Win32).|$|R

5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{choosing}} an open register are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed <b>registries</b> typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open <b>registries</b> frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.|$|E

5000|$|The {{terminology}} {{is somewhat}} misleading, as each <b>Registry</b> key {{is similar to}} an associative array, where standard terminology would refer to the name part of each <b>Registry</b> value as a [...] "key". The terms are a holdout from the 16-bit <b>Registry</b> in Windows 3, in which <b>Registry</b> keys could not contain arbitrary name/data pairs, but rather contained only one unnamed value (which {{had to be a}} string). In this sense, the entire <b>Registry</b> was like a single associative array where the <b>Registry</b> keys (in both the <b>Registry</b> sense and dictionary sense) formed a hierarchy, and the <b>Registry</b> values were all strings. When the 32-bit <b>Registry</b> was created, so was the additional capability of creating multiple named values per key, and the meanings of the names were somewhat distorted. For compatibility with the previous behavior, each <b>Registry</b> key may have a [...] "default" [...] value, whose name is the empty string.|$|R

5|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country. The country in which a ship is registered is its flag state, and the flag state gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign. A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. A ship operates under the laws of its flag state, and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case. The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry. <b>Registries</b> may be governmental or private agencies.|$|E

5|$|Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat. They also have {{proportionally}} shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses {{and also a}} high level of intelligence {{that may or may not}} be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony.

School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed <b>registries.</b>|$|E
5|$|The American Quarter Pony Association {{was begun}} in 1964 with {{the ideals of}} a {{registry}} which would register small horses and ponies of western type, whose breeding could be unknown but which were desirable for breeding purposes. Crossbred and purebred animals are eligible for registration, as are animals registered with other <b>registries</b> that meet the entry requirements. In 1975, the National Quarter Pony Association was begun to preserve the smaller, stockier type Quarter Horse when breeding trends were leaning towards taller, leaner animals. The AQPA now registers horses in several foreign countries, {{as well as all}} US states and Canadian provinces. The International Quarter Pony Association, begun in the 1970s, also registers Quarter Ponies, and is a worldwide association for ponies of Quarter Horse type. The Quarter Pony Association is an association affiliated with the International Quarter Pony Association, with the goal of promoting the Quarter Pony. In 2005, the IQPA and the QPA became one organization, with the IQPA acting as the registry and the QPA as the membership branch. As of 2005, there were an estimated 3,000 Quarter Ponies registered with all registering organizations. <b>Registries</b> say that registrations of adult animals outnumber those for foals every year, as many owners wait until the pony is old enough to be shown under saddle before registering them.|$|E
