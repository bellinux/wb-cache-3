40|$|This paper {{provides}} a legal-economic {{analysis of the}} Appellate Body decision in Brazil – <b>Retreaded</b> <b>Tyres.</b> We develop a simple economic model that we use to analyze the market structure and environmental externalities that were most relevant to this case. We start by analyzing Brazil's policies in a model in which tyre retreading generates a positive production externality through the delay it provides society before a used tyre becomes a waste product {{with the potential to}} harm society through its adverse impact on human health and the environment. We examine the different welfare implications of (i) a production subsidy for retreading of once-used Brazilian tyres, (ii) a tariff on imports of <b>retreaded</b> <b>tyres,</b> and (iii) a ban on imports of <b>retreaded</b> <b>tyres.</b> While a production subsidy is the first-best instrument to address this type of externality, there are reasons to believe that it might be infeasible. The welfare implications of the other measures depend importantly on the magnitude of the positive production externality. From the lens provided by this economic analysis, we draw three primary insights. First, we identify the critical piece of empirical information that the Panel and Appellate Body require to make a rational judgment of the utility of the Brazilia...|$|E

A total of 179 rubber companies were visited and data were obtained from 52 general rubber goods, 29 <b>retread</b> <b>tyre</b> and 7 new tyre manufacturers. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire and included a walk-through inspection of the workplace to assess the extent of use of control measures {{and the nature of}} work practices being employed. The most recent (predominantly 1995 – 97) exposure monitoring data for rubber fume and rubber process dust were obtained from these companies; no additional sampling was conducted {{for the purpose of this}} study. In addition to the assessment of exposure data, evaluation of occupational hygiene reports for the quality of information and advice was also carried out. A comparison of the median exposures for processes showed that the order of exposure to rubber fume (E, in mg mÿ 3) is: Emoulding (0. 40) 1 Eextrusion (0. 33) > Emilling (0. 18) for GRG; Epress (0. 32) > Eextrusion (0. 19) > Eautoclave (0. 10) for RT; and Epress (0. 22) 1 Eall other (0. 22) for NT.

40|$|The recent {{decisions}} of the panel and Appellate Body in Brazil - Measures Affecting Imports of <b>Retreaded</b> <b>Tyres</b> touched upon {{a number of issues}} of ongoing significance to the application of necessity tests, such as those in Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This article argues that the dispute represents a mixed outcome for the application of necessity tests. The express recognition that some regulatory measures are complementary to one another rather than reasonably available alternatives constitutes a welcome step forward. On the other hand, the panel's characterization of Brazil's regulatory goal highlights an approach common to a number of panel reports that could justify a perception of arbitrariness in application of necessity tests. Similarly, comments made by the Appellate Body to the effect that a panel is obliged to consider the importance of a state's regulatory goal extend the role of a panel in an unjustifiable manner., Oxford University Press. ...|$|E

This paper presents the research undertaken {{in the development of a}} web-based decision-support tool (the used tyres resource efficiency tool) to compare three processing routes for used tyres compared to their existing primary alternatives. Primary data on the energy and material flows for the three routes, and their alternatives were collected and analysed. The methodology used was a streamlined life-cycle assessment (sLCA) approach. Processes included were: car tyre baling against aggregate gabions; car <b>tyre</b> <b>retreading</b> against new car tyres; and car tyre shred used in landfill engineering against primary aggregates. The outputs of the assessment, and web-based tool, were estimates of raw materials used, carbon dioxide emissions and costs.

The strengths and weakness of this approach are discussed and future research priorities identified which could facilitate the use of life cycle approaches by designers and practitioners...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{carried out}} on commission by New Industries, Iceland, comprised comparative tests {{with a total of}} 10 new <b>retreaded</b> passenger car <b>tyres</b> classified M+S with the same tread pattern with and without special aggregates mixed into the tread rubber compound. The tests were carried out in the VTI tyre testing facility on smooth and roughened water covered ice at a speed of 30 km/h. Water covered ice can be {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous road conditions. Both braking tests and steering tests were performed. The braking tests measured maximum braking friction corresponding to ideal ABS braking performance and friction with a locked wheel. The steering tests measured maximum lateral friction and friction at a 20 -degree side slip angle (skid angle). The latter value represents conditions in skidding of the whole vehicle or excessive steering angle when entering a curve. The results on water covered smooth ice show that a new non studded winter tyre can get about 30 % improved braking friction and about 40 % improved steering friction by means of mixing the special aggregate composition into the tread rubber compound. Testing this improved tyre on water covered stud roughened ice showed that the friction for normal driving is practically the same as on smooth ice. If the vehicle gets in a 20 degree broadslide, rough ice gave up to 40 per cent improvement compared to smooth ice. Repeated tests however quickly reduced this improvement to 10 per cent. The values obtained on smooth flooded ice with the best tyre aggregate tread compound allows cautious driving while the reference tyre friction is insufficient for keeping a vehicle on the road even for a skilled driver under these very severe conditions...|$|R
