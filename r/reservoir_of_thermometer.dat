As a result, during the measurement <b>of</b> <b>thermometer</b> resistance on direct and alternating current the error appears which is the function of measurable temperature and current frequency. Theoretical investigations of frequency error <b>of</b> <b>thermometers</b> {{in the range of}} temperatures from 0 to 1100 °C are conducted.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Answers to questions covering a variety of aspects concerning the use <b>of</b> <b>thermometers</b> in general practice. RESULTS [...] 116 (80 %) doctors replied. Seven doctors {{did not have any}} method of taking a patient's temperature; up to 12 more doctors did not use their thermometers and 56 doctors used them infrequently, less than once a fortnight. Mercury glass thermometers were most commonly used (80 doctors; 69 %), but only 8 % of doctors used them correctly. Six doctors failed to clean their thermometers between patients.

40|$|The method {{recommended}} by Eurachem {{did not mention}} the effect of adequateness of calibration equations on the measurement uncertainty. In this work, the sources of measurement uncertainty for two types <b>of</b> <b>thermometer</b> were evaluated. Three calibration equations were adopted to compare its predictive performance.

5000|$|Somewhat more {{abstract}} is the design stance, {{the domain of}} biology and engineering, which requires {{no knowledge of the}} physical constitution or the physical laws that govern a system's operation. Based on an implicit assumption that there is no malfunction in the system, predictions are made from knowledge of the purpose of the system's design (this could also be called the [...] "teleological stance"). At this level, we are concerned with such things as purpose, function and design. When we predict that a bird will fly when it flaps its wings on the basis that wings are made for flying, we are taking the design stance. Likewise, we can understand the bimetallic strip as a particular type <b>of</b> <b>thermometer,</b> not concerning ourselves with the details of how this type <b>of</b> <b>thermometer</b> happens to work. We can also recognize the purpose that this thermometer serves inside a thermostat and even generalize to other kinds of thermostats that might use a different sort <b>of</b> <b>thermometer.</b> We can even explain the thermostat in terms of what it's good for, saying that it keeps track of the temperature and turns on the heater whenever it gets below a minimum, turning it off once it reaches a maximum.|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in resistance of high purity semi-conducting germanium with decreasing temperature in the superfluid helium range of temperatures makes this material highly adaptable as a very sensitive thermometer. Also, a germanium thermometer exhibits a highly reproducible resistance versus temperature characteristic curve upon cycling between liquid helium temperatures and room temperature. These two factors combine to make germanium thermometers ideally suited for measuring temperatures in many cryogenic studies at superfluid helium temperatures. One disadvantage, however, is the relatively high cost <b>of</b> calibrated germanium <b>thermometers.</b> In space helium cryogenic systems, many such thermometers are often required, leading to a high cost for calibrated <b>thermometers.</b> The construction <b>of</b> a <b>thermometer</b> calibration cryostat and probe which will allow for calibrating six germanium thermometers at one time, thus effecting substantial savings in the purchase <b>of</b> <b>thermometers</b> is considered...|$|R
