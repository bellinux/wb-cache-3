50|$|<b>Pitot</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> is {{the pressure}} that is measured by a Pitot tube, an open-ended tube connected to a pressure-measuring device. For subsonic flow, <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is equal to the}} stagnation pressure (or total pressure) of the flow, and hence the term <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> is often used interchangeably with these other terms.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study into the development of bar gauges for the measurement of <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressures</b> in low density expansion tube flows. The bar gauges developed here are modified from the conventional designs for bar gauges. A steel disc of 9 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness is attached to the front of a shielded sensing bar. Semiconductor strain gauges are used as the strain sensing elements. A PCB impact hammer was used to calibrate the bar gauges. Experiments in flows at 9 km/s, with <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressures</b> close to 750 kPa, were done in the X 1 expansion tube at The University of Queensland. Tests were also performed by changing the operation mode of the X 1 facility to run it as a non-reflected shock tunnel. For those tests the flow speed was around 1. 3 km/s and the <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> was close to 650 kPa. This test flow was used to check the calibration of the bar gauges. The results indicate that the bar gauges developed here can be used to measure <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressures</b> in flows with a test period of up to 100 µs. The quality of the signals can be enhanced by ensuring good contact between the front disk and the sensing bar. Moreover, by isolating the sensing bar electrically from the tunnel the effects of ionisation on noise levels on the strain signal is reduced. In order to obtain the true <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements, the average disc pressures measured using the presented bar gauges have to be multiplied by a factor of 1. 08 (1 / 0. 93). The overall uncertainty of the <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> measured is estimated to be ± 7 %, for <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressures</b> of order 600 kPa...|$|R

The use of an electromagnetic device to preopen the secondary diaphragm {{before the arrival of}} the primary shock wave resulted in an improvement in the agreement between the measured <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> and the value inferred from measured density and interface velocity.

40|$|A <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> {{survey of}} the {{contoured}} nozzle of the T 5 shock tunnel was performed {{over a wide range}} of reservoir conditions and in the region of the exit plane of the nozzle. A rake of thirteen pitot probes was used for this purpose. The survey includes an investigation of the repeatability of the facility and an analysis of the accuracy of the measurements. The features of the <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution across the exit plane are a pronounced minimum near but not exactly on the centerline, and a pronounced drop near the nozzle wall. The concave profile may be quantified in terms of the curvature of the <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution, which increases markedly as the enthalpy is decreased and as the area ratio is increased. The normalized value of the minimum <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> is found to be independent of the reservoir enthalpy, in contrast to the behavior obtained by numerical computation of inviscid flows. The results of this survey show clearly, that the use of a contoured nozzle should be restricted to conditions very close to the design condition. Since flexibility in the reservoir enthalpy and pressure, as well as area ratio, is an important feature of a shock tunnel, the results of this survey strongly suggest the use of a conical nozzle...|$|R

The X 1 expansion tube at the University of Queensland {{has been used}} to produce nitrogen flows at 8. 9 and 9. 5 km/s with test flow durations of 50 and 40 microsecondÂ­s respectively. Rarefied flow is indicated by values of the freestream breakdown parameter > 0. 1 (Cheng 2 ̆ 7 s rarefaction parameter < 10) and freestream Knudsen numbers up to 0. 038, based on a model size of 9 mm. To achieve this, the test gas is expanded {{from the end of the}} acceleration tube into a dump tank. Nominal conditions in the expansion are derived from CFD predictions. Measured bar gauge (<b>Pitot)</b> <b>pressures</b> show that the flow is radially uniform when the <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> has decreased by a factor ten.

40|$|Results of a <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> {{investigation}} of the flow field on the lee side of a delta wing shuttle orbiter are presented. The results delineate {{the extent of the}} lee side separated flow and give a tentative cross sectional definition to the shock wave structure for angles of attack of 15 deg and 30 deg. It is shown that while, in general, the effects of Reynolds number on the flow field are not large, detailed effects are observed that may have significant bearing on the heating estimate. Two examples are cited for an angle of attack of 15 deg; these are: (1) The scope of the vertical tail exposed to the unseparated flow increases with increasing Reynolds number and (2) the depth of the separated flow adjacent ot where the bow wave crosses the wing appears to decrease with increasing Reynolds number. In addition, it is shown that at a spanwise station outboard of the wing-fuselage juncture, increasing Reynolds number decreased the <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> in the unseparated flow. This defect of <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> appears associated with the flow over the wing-fillet-fuselage juncture...|$|R

This modular design allows for a variety of probe tips to be used for a specific application. Here, the focus is on flow-field pressure measurements in supersonic flows, so we developed a cone-cylinder static pressure tip and a <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> tip. Alternatively, probe tips optimized for subsonic and transonic flows could be used with this design.
