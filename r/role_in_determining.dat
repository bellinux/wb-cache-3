5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E

5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played an important <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E

5|$|Multifactorial sex {{determination}} occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems. Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes. For example, the darter characine has a ZW multifactorial system where the female {{is determined by}} ZW1W2 and the male by ZZ. The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as zebrafish, have a polyfactorial system, where there are several genes which play a <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> sex. Environment-dependent {{sex determination}} has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost. Temperature is the main factor, but PH levels, growth rate, density and social environment may also play a role. For the Atlantic silverside, spawning in colder waters creates more females, while warmer waters create more males.|$|E
5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|The Andes play {{a crucial}} <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> the climate of Patagonia because their north–south {{orientation}} creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean. Since the predominant wind is from the west and most air masses come from the Pacific Ocean, the Andes cause these air masses to ascend, cooling adiabatically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, resulting in abundant precipitation, while {{in much of the}} Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically and becomes drier as it descends. As a result, the Andes create an extensive rain-shadow in much of Argentine Patagonia, causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52oS, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province, allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the drug begin 10–40minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6hours {{depending}} on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The half life of psilocybin is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> a person's response to psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|The genome of the {{nematode}} worm C. elegans contains 9 serpins, all {{of which}} lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular. However, only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors. One, SRP-6, performs a protective function and guards against stress-induced calpain-associated lysosomal disruption. Further, SRP-6 inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases released after lysosomal rupture. Accordingly, worms lacking SRP-6 are sensitive to stress. Most notably, SRP-6 knockout worms die when placed in water (the hypo-osmotic stress lethal phenotype or Osl). It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and controllable <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> cell fate.|$|E
5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E

5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation plays a major <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> {{the composition of the}} soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, {{there is some evidence that}} wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
