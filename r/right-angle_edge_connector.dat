50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{commonly}} used in personal computers for connecting expansion cards and computer memory to the system bus. Example expansion peripheral technologies which use <b>edge</b> <b>connectors</b> include PCI, PCI Express, and AGP.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [79]- 80). Printed wiring boards (PWBs) are extensively used {{in electronic}} systems. In many instances they {{are subjected to}} dynamic loads, for e. g., in aerospace and automotive applications. The behavior of PWBs to vibration and shock depends on {{the way they are}} mounted in electronic boxes. Hence, accurate modeling of the mounting is necessary to predict the dynamic behavior of PWBs. PWBs are typically supported using wedge locks, screws, bolts or <b>edge</b> <b>connectors.</b> Each mount type offers different boundary conditions. During analysis, the mounts are modeled appropriately to simulate the boundary conditions they offer. <b>Edge</b> <b>connectors</b> are usually modeled as simple supports. This thesis investigates the representation of an <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> as a combination of linear and torsional spring (LTS) to better simulate the boundary condition. The stiffnesses of linear and torsional spring are calculated based on the geometry of the contact of the <b>edge</b> <b>connector.</b> The LTS model was tested on aluminum and fiberglass epoxy beams and plates mounted between two identical <b>edge</b> <b>connectors.</b> The validity of the model was checked by comparing the analytical behavior of the systems with their experimental behavior. These results were also compared with the behavior predicted by representing the <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> as simple support to ascertain the gains achieved by modeling the <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> as a combination of linear and torsional spring rather than as a simple support. Results show that the LTS model predicts the behavior of systems better than the simply supported model. It is also shown that the gains accrued by the use of LTS model depend on the width of the PWB used in the system. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

50|$|An <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> is {{the portion}} of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) {{consisting}} of traces leading {{to the edge of the}} board that are intended to plug into a matching socket. The <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> is a money-saving device because it only requires a single discrete female connector (the male connector is formed out of the edge of the PCB), and they also tend to be fairly robust and durable. They are commonly used in computers for expansion slots for peripheral cards, such as PCI, PCI Express, and AGP cards.|$|R
