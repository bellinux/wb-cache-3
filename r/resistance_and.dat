40|$|For a switched-capacitor {{converter}} (SCC) {{built by}} discrete components, its performance is inevitably influenced by parasitic <b>resistances</b> <b>and</b> stray inductances. A basic SCC unit including parasitic <b>resistances</b> <b>and</b> stray inductances behaves as an RLC series circuit operated in charging and discharging states alternatively. Hard-switching SCC with small Q factor, {{due to the}} small stray inductance, is analyzed based on overdamping RLC circuit theory. And the underdamping RLC series network is used to analyze soft-switching SCC whose Q factor is greater than 0. 5. New mathematical equations are derived to evaluate the impact of parasitic <b>resistances</b> <b>and</b> inductances {{on the performance of}} SCCs. Following that, the corresponding design methodologies are proposed for both hard- and soft-switching SCCs. The effectiveness of the proposed analysis and design methods are experimentally demonstrated by a 300 -W double-mode SCC prototype. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{nonlinear}} multicompartment lung mechanics model {{that accounts for}} nonlinearities in both the airway <b>resistances</b> <b>and</b> the lung compliances. Many models assume that the airway resistances for a lung mechanics system are constant over {{the entire range of}} air flows, and hence, pressure losses due to the airway resistances are assumed to be linear functions of the air flows. In the development of our nonlinear multicompartment lung model, we assume that the resistive losses are characterized by a Rohrer-type model, which can more accurately capture resistive losses {{as a function of the}} flows. Several illustrative numerical examples for a two-compartment lung model are presented and the response of the multicompartment lung model with nonlinear <b>resistances</b> <b>and</b> nonlinear compliances is compared to that of a multicompartment lung model with linear <b>resistances</b> <b>and</b> nonlinear compliances.
