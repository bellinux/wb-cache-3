40|$|The {{production}} {{and interpretation of}} pronouns involves the identification of a mental referent and, in connected speech or text, a discourse antecedent. One of the few overt signals {{of the relationship between}} a pronoun and its antecedent is agreement in features such as number and grammatical gender. To examine how speakers create these signals, two experiments tested conceptual, lexical. and morphophonological accounts of pronoun production in Dutch. The experiments employed sentence completion and continuation tasks with materials containing noun phrases that conflicted or agreed in grammatical gender. The noun phrases served as the antecedents for demonstrative pronouns tin Experiment 1) and relative pronouns tin Experiment 2) that <b>required</b> <b>gender</b> <b>marking.</b> <b>Gender</b> errors were used to assess the nature of the processes that established the link between pronouns and antecedents. There were more gender errors when candidate antecedents conflicted in grammatical gender, counter to the predictions of a pure conceptual hypothesis. <b>Gender</b> <b>marking</b> on candidate antecedents did not change the magnitude of this interference effect, counter to the predictions of an overt-morphology hypothesis. Mirroring previous findings about pronoun comprehension, the results suggest that speakers of gender-marking languages call on specific linguistic information about antecedents in order to select pronouns and that the information consists of specifications of grammatical gender associated with the lemmas of words...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to observe both children's and adults' knowledge of grammatical gender in Welsh, and assess the role of exposure, structure complexity and form-function mapping in acquisition. Four different elements of the gender system were examined: local <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> via SM of nouns and adjectives, local <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> via production of gendered numeral forms, and distant <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> via production of gendered prepositions and their pronominal objects. Participants' knowledge was assessed with various controlled elicitation tasks. One additional task tested the productivity of one gender construct by assessing <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> in relation to novel nouns. Participants (aged four, five, seven, nine and adult) came from one of three home language backgrounds, based on level of exposure to Welsh and English in the home: only Welsh at Home, Welsh and English at home or only English at home. Patterns of responding for individual tasks revealed piecemeal acquisition that seemed to be influenced by frequency effects, resulting in higher levels of productivity in relation to more frequent nouns and lower productivity for less frequent ones. Further probing of the productivity of <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> across the different gender constructs also revealed piecemeal acquisition patterns, as shown by a lack of uniformity in <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> in relation to the same lexical items (nouns). The results suggest effects of the varied complexity of the different gender constructs, and the role of semantic or natural gender information in relation to grammatical gender assignment. Overall, a role of relative language exposure seemed evident, as marked differences were observed across home language groups, with OWH children showing the most productive 2 command ofthe gender system. The adult data revealed incomplete acquisition of some aspects of the system, suggesting that there are limits to bilinguals' acquisition of highly complex grammatical features.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact of}} the linguistic <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> gap on expatriate female staffing decisions in a multinational company. Transaction cost theory postulates that due to cultural differences, integration between parent and subsidiary companies becomes complex and costly. However, staffing from parent organisations could be helpful to minimise the cultural conflict by establishing better control and hence reducing the transaction cost. Language {{is considered one of the}} major components that shapes culture, and linguistic <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> gap could cause a difference in attitude towards male and female staff members from parent companies. Due to the nature of linguistic structures, which are embedded in ancestral culture and have a cognitive effect on speakers, the gap has two levels. The first is the gap between home and host countries’ languages. The second is between the official and informal languages used by the headquarters and the subsidiary. The analytical model, using an innovative gender gap variable, supports two carefully developed propositions, that the success of expatriate staffing at managerial level depends on the linguistic <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> gap between home and host country, and that use of organisational language in subsidiaries reduces the linguistic <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> gap between them...|$|R

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the effect of {{syntactic}} complexity on written language production. This study investigated the effect of syntactic complexity on the accuracy of <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> in written L 1 and L 2 French. We conducted two experiments in which L 1 learners (n = 28) and L 2 learners (n = 26) of French were asked to complete a fill-in-the-gap task. The test items were controlled for three types of gender agreement configurations with different syntactic complexity. The results show that the syntactic complexity of the agreement configuration has an effect on the accuracy of both L 1 and L 2 written <b>gender</b> <b>marking.</b> We conclude that, similarly to spoken L 1 production, the accuracy of <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> is influenced by syntactic complexity. Furthermore, we conclude that the observed effect of syntactic complexity does not only hold for L 2 learners at the beginners level, but is still present in advanced L 2 learners of French...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLinguistic antisexism is {{different}} from the institutional feminization of language. It involves practices of double <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> which work to avoid the gender dichotomy. Working on a French written corpus, this paper will examine the forms of double <b>gender</b> <b>marking,</b> looking at typographic, morphosyntactical and rhetorical levels; then, it will analyse this gender-related practice as a use of language as a political tool. Those who use double gender are not driven by the desire to standardize linguistic practice, but rather to use practices for particular political purposes. The focus of this use is not to be prescriptive about language but rather to critique social realities. They do not do this work through institutions and the usual mechanisms of language planning, but rather deploy individual practices for ideological purposes. Although nonetheless, they still achieve a certain commonality of practice. Linguistic antisexism and double <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> are phenomena of micro-language planning achieved by individuals...|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{acquisition}} of grammatical gender has shown that for many languages, children gain an early command of gender. However, often in these languages <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> is quite overt and provides a clear one-to-one correspondence between a marker and the gender encoded. In Welsh, <b>gender</b> <b>marking</b> is more complex. <b>Gender</b> is <b>marked</b> by mutations, a set of morphophonological changes that affect the initial consonants of words, and the mapping between mutation and gender is quite opaque. Two mutation types are used in part to mark feminine gender: both feminine nouns modified by the definite article and adjectives following feminine nouns undergo Soft Mutation, and the feminine gender of the possessive adjective ei is marked by Aspirate Mutation on the modified noun. The four studied in this thesis examined children's productive command of gender as expressed in the mutation of nouns modified by the definite article, of adjectives modifying nouns, and of nouns modified by the homonymic feminine and masculine possessive adjective. Mutation in non-gendered contexts was also examined. Subjects were 4 - to 9 1 I 2 -year-old children from North Wales. First, a seminaturalistic {{study was conducted to}} obtain knowledge about children's ability with <b>gender</b> <b>marking.</b> A Cloze procedure was also used to elicit children's production of masculine and feminine forms, both real words and nonsense forms, in a variety of linguistic contexts. Some of these contexts provided cues to gender status, some did not. The data obtained indicated that {{the acquisition}} of the Welsh gender system is a drawn-out process, and children have not mastered the system even by 9 112 years of age. In addition, children become proficient in marking feminine nouns modified by the definite article and adjectives modifying feminine nouns before they do so on nouns modified by feminine ei. Results suggest that when a language has a complex gender system that is marked by opaque morpho-phonological processes the course of development is protracted and variable...|$|R

In addition, Experiment 3 showed that while picture naming induces a cumulative semantic cost for subsequently named words, word naming does not induce a cumulative semantic cost for subsequently named pictures. These findings suggest that the cumulative semantic cost arises prior to lexical selection and that the effect arises due to incremental changes to the connection weights between semantic and lexical representations...|$|R
