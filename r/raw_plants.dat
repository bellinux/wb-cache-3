Most alkaloids {{are present in the}} <b>raw</b> <b>plants</b> in the form of salts of organic acids. The extracted alkaloids may remain salts or change into bases. Base extraction is achieved by processing the raw material with alkaline solutions and extracting the alkaloid bases with organic solvents, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, diethyl ether or benzene. Then, the impurities are dissolved by weak acids; this converts alkaloid bases into salts that are washed away with water. If necessary, an aqueous solution of alkaloid salts is again made alkaline and treated with an organic solvent. The process is repeated until the desired purity is achieved.|$|E

We studied the qualitative composition and quantitative contents of organic acids in the aboveground part of some unofficial medicinal plants from families Lamiaceae, Asteraceae, Apiaceae and Chenopodiaceae is relevant. Objective. The objects of the research are the aboveground part of unofficial medicinal plants from families Lamiaceae, Asteraceae, Apiaceae and Chenopodiaceae. Methods. Identification of organic acids was performed by means of thin-layer and paper chromatography, their content was determined by means of gas chromatography, the quantitative amount of organic acids was defined by titrimetric analysis. Results. In the studied <b>raw</b> <b>plants</b> the quality of organic acids and their total contents were determined (in terms of malic acid). It is established that the maximum content of organic acids is accumulated in the grass Hyssopus officinalis L.

A comprehensive and up-to-date technical review of using both edible and non-edible plant oils (either pure or as blends with fossil diesel) in CI engines, based on comparisons with standard diesel fuel, has been carried out.

30|$|In general, plant-based SiC {{ceramics}} can {{be prepared}} from different Si sources via two main routes, which are direct carbonization of Si [11 – 13] and carbothermal reduction of silica (SiO 2) [14, 15]. The direct carbonization of Si contains liquid Si infiltration (LSI) and vapor Si infiltration [16, 17] {{according to the state}} of Si. Liquid Si or vapor Si spontaneously infiltrates the pore structure of <b>raw</b> <b>plants</b> or their carbon templates. The Si source involved in carbothermal reduction of SiO 2 mainly refers to SiO 2 sol [18 – 20]. First, the raw biomass or carbon template is generally impregnated with SiO 2 sol once or several times. They are then placed in a high-temperature condition to allow for the formation of SiC. Many previous studies have reported that the two main existing routes can produce SiC ceramics from plant biomasses that have multiple and special properties, such as low density, high surface area to volume, high permeability, and high specific strength [21, 22]. However, the differences between SiC ceramics derived from two main routes have not been recognized clearly. To compensate for this problem, researchers are expected to carry out a study to compare these two different SiC ceramics and to find and determine the effects of different preparation routes or different Si sources on the SiC ceramics.|$|E

The methods of healing of cave people were undeveloped. The methods of Chinese medicine were focused on balancing the internal and external energies. Holistic and sophisticated system of healing represents Ayurveda. Egyptian medicinal texts show a close relationship between the supernatural and empirical healing. Illyrians applied hydrotherapy and physiotherapy. Experiences in the field of religious medicine and initial medicinal institution had Thracians. Healing in Ancient Greece was based on the law of similarity. Greek physicians favored diet and life adaptations in relation to the use of drugs. With the Roman sanitary legislation were regulated public hygiene and sanitation facilities. Galen made efforts to balance the fluids in the sick person using drugs with opposite nature. Rational drug therapy in Middle Ages decreased and was replaced with Church knowledge.

40|$|Classically, {{sinusoidal}} oscillations are imposed to enhance mixing and mass transfer between two phases contacted.

The problem is particularly met {{for the treatment of}} <b>raw</b> <b>plants</b> or polydispersed populations with complex physical properties. The objective {{of this study is to}} demonstrate the viability of using a non-sinusoidal pulsation in a continuous contactor to replace a traditional batch sinusoidal mode. A review of the different pulsation techniques is firstly presented. The example of solid-liquid extraction of Andrographolide from plants has then been choosen to bring out the advantages of the new pulsation mode. The development of this application as a continuous process in a column has indeed encountered difficulties due to the important heterogeneity of the matter : one of these classes tends to float and the other to sink, which always leads to a definitive flooding in classical operations. Typically, the proposed signal is composed of two different periods : in one hand, a classical sinusoidal pulsation step used to mix the liquid and solid phases in the active part of the column and allow an optimal mass transfer and, in a second hand, an impulsion phase, used generally for the transport of solid. The extraction is carried out in a disc and doughnut column of 54 mm in diameter, and 3. 5 m in height. Liquid and solid are flowing cocurrently and downwardly. Experiments have been performed to know the global characteristics of the process in steady state and to suggest some elements for industrial design. The results showed that an optimal tuning of the geometric characteristics of the column, the level of interface and the parameters of the pulsation, could increase the operated domain where flooding is avoided...|$|E
