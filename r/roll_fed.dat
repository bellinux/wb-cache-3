In Pina, there was a pilgrimage on 22 May, which is Santa Quiteria day, to the hermitage of Santa Bárbara who is well known for her protection against lightning and storms. The bread rolls, which had been kneaded and baked by the dignitaries of the festivities, were blessed on that day. The rolls were shared out amongst those present, and some were even kept for those who were not able to attend. Everyone kept at least one roll at home which they put out on the balconies when there was thunder, evidently to dispel destructive storms.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} of the independent effects of plant physical and chemical characteristics on foraging, but little {{has been done to}} determine how these traits interact to affect food selection. We determined if the nutritional state of lambs (Ovis aries) affected intake behavior and preference for foods with different ratios of protein/energy (alfalfa: high proportion protein/energy; barley: high proportion energy/protein), presented in different physical forms (whole or ground). Changes in nutritional state were induced by altering the nutritional composition of the basal diet (high [Ep] or low [eP] proportion of energy/protein). We determined preference for barley and alfalfa (whole or ground) when lambs were fed (1) a nutritionally balanced diet with a 15 -h (overnight) fast (Period 1), (2) an unbalanced diet (Ep or eP) with a 15 -h (overnight) fast (Period 2), and (3) an unbalanced diet without a fast (Period 3). Averaged across the three periods, all lambs preferred barley to alfalfa (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), and they spent more time feeding on barley than alfalfa (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Lambs also preferred whole to ground foods (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Nevertheless, the basal diet strongly affected preference for barley and alfalfa. During Period 2, lambs fed basal diet Ep ate less barley (142 vs. 232 g) and more alfalfa (71 vs. 9 g) than lambs fed basal diet eP (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), especially when alfalfa was pelleted and barley was ground or <b>rolled.</b> Lambs <b>fed</b> basal diet eP strongly preferred barley to alfalfa, even if barley was ground and alfalfa was pelleted. These differences were even more pronounced after a meal of basal diet Ep or basal diet eP in Period 3. Lambs fed basal diet Ep consumed less energy during preference tests than lambs fed basal diet eP (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Lambs fed the two unbalanced basal diets consumed similar amounts of protein during preference tests (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). These differences in intake of energy and protein by lambs fed the unbalanced diets led to a steady increase in the ratio of protein/energy selected by lambs fed the balanced basal diet and diet Ep during Periods 1, 2, and 3 (7. 9, 11. 7, 13. 9 g CP/MJ), and a constant ratio of protein/energy selected by lambs fed the balanced basal diet and diet eP during Periods 1, 2, and 3 (7. 6, 8. 1, 8. 1 g CP/MJ; P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Thus, lambs fed basal diet Ep selected barley and alfalfa in a way that achieved a higher ratio of protein/energy in their diet than lambs fed basal diet eP (12. 7 vs. 8. 2 g CP/MJ DE, P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Collectively, these results suggest that food structure and biochemical composition interacted with a lamb 2 ̆ 7 s nutritional state to determine preference. When a lamb 2 ̆ 7 s need for a particular macronutrient was high, a food 2 ̆ 7 s biochemical composition was more important than its structure in determining preference...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the following study were to compare a recently developed low lignin- high fat oat with regular oat as an energy source for use in diets fed to growing-finishing pigs and to compare hammer milling and roller milling as methods of processing oats. A total of 40 crossbred grower pigs (20 barrows and 20 gilts) were {{assigned to one of}} five dietary treatments in a factorial design experiment. The control diet was formulated using barley and soybean meal while four experimental diets were formulated in which 40 % of either normal or low lignin-high fat oat was substituted for barley. The oats were either ground or rolled. Particle size analysis indicated that the average particle size of the grower diets was 884, 1037, 1420, 1031 and 1501 m while for the finisher diets, the average particle size was 800, 869, 1250, 854 and 1098 m for the barley, ground normal oat, rolled normal oat, ground low lignin-high fat oat and rolled low lignin-high fat oat diets respectively. Digestibility coefficients for pigs fed ground oats were significantly (p 0. 05) in nutrient digestibility between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat. During the growing period (35. 1 to 71. 4 kg) as well as over the entire experiment (35. 1 to 112. 5 kg), there were no differences (p> 0. 05) in daily gain, feed intake or feed conversion between pigs fed normal or low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs <b>fed</b> ground or <b>rolled</b> oat diets. During the finishing period (71. 4 to 112. 5 kg), feed intake and feed conversion were poorer (p< 0. 05) for pigs fed the low lignin-high fat oat compared with the barley diet. There were no differences in carcass traits between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs <b>fed</b> <b>rolled</b> and ground oats. The overall results of this experiment indicate that both normal and low lignin-high fat oat can substitute for barley at levels as high as 40 % of the diet without hindering pig performance. Since the average yield of oat can be equal or higher than barley with lower input costs, a re-examination of feeding recommendations regarding oat in swine rations seems warranted. In addition, since pig performance and carcass traits were not affected by processing method and roller mills have been shown to have lower-energy requirements, lower maintenance costs, quieter operation, and more exact control of particle size than hammer mills, there may be some advantage for pig producers to consider roller mills rather than hammer mills for use in processing pig feeds...|$|R
40|$|Roll {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} process {{commonly used in}} the pharmaceutical industry for dry granulation of moisture and heat sensitive powder blends. It is intended to increase bulk density and improve flowability. Roll compaction is a complex process that depends on many factors, such as feed powder properties, processing conditions and system layout. Some of the variability in the process remains unexplained. Accordingly, modeling tools are needed to understand the properties and the interrelations between raw materials, process parameters {{and the quality of}} the product. It is important to look at the whole manufacturing chain from raw materials to tablet properties. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the impact of raw materials, process parameters and system design variations on the quality of intermediate and final roll compaction products, as well as their interrelations. In order to do so, we have conducted a series of systematic experimental studies and utilized chemometric tools, such as design of experiments, latent variable models (i. e. PCA, OPLS and O 2 PLS) as well as mechanistic models based on the rolling theory of granular solids developed by Johanson (1965). More specifically, we have developed a modeling approach to elucidate the influence of different brittle filler qualities of mannitol and dicalcium phosphate and their physical properties (i. e. flowability, particle size and compactability) on intermediate and final product quality. This approach allows the possibility of introducing new fillers without additional experiments, provided that they are within the previously mapped design space. Additionally, this approach is generic and could be extended beyond fillers. Furthermore, in contrast to many other materials, the results revealed that some qualities of the investigated fillers demonstrated improved compactability following roll compaction. In one study, we identified the design space for a roll compaction process using a risk-based approach. The influence of process parameters (i. e. roll force, roll speed, roll gap and milling screen size) on different ribbon, granule and tablet properties was evaluated. In another study, we demonstrated the significant added value of the combination of near-infrared chemical imaging, texture analysis and multivariate methods in the quality assessment of the intermediate and final roll compaction products. Finally, we have also studied the roll compaction of an intermediate drug load formulation at different scales and using roll compactors with different feed screw mechanisms (i. e. horizontal and vertical). The horizontal feed screw roll compactor was also equipped with an instrumented roll technology allowing the measurement of normal stress on ribbon. Ribbon porosity was primarily found to be a function of normal stress, exhibiting a quadratic relationship. A similar quadratic relationship was also observed between roll force and ribbon porosity of the vertically <b>fed</b> <b>roll</b> compactor. A combination of design of experiments, latent variable and mechanistic models led to a better understanding of the critical process parameters and showed that scale up/transfer between equipment is feasible...|$|R
50|$|The German {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia {{began with the}} annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938, and the subsequent establishment of Bohemia and Moravia as German protectorates in March 1939. Capek describes these early years of German occupation as 'gradual, and systematic'. Her persecution developed {{over the course of}} a three year period, beginning with her removal from school, and progressing to her banishment from work and subsequent placement in a Jewish Youth Hostel. The situation changed dramatically with the assassination of German Nazi Officer Reinhard Heydrich in 1942. Heydrich’s death saw a marked increase in transportations from Prague to Czechoslovakia’s Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. By September 1942, Capek herself was bound for the camp. Capek remembered Theresienstadt 'in mixed terms'. She recalled the horror of finding her father malnourished and emaciated on her arrival there, and watched him die from pleurisy two days later. She recalled the inhumanity she felt in knowing that the old and sick were dying at the camp, and the scenes she witnessed in the early days as a cleaner in the camp’s infirmary. By September 1944, she had met and become engaged to marry one of the camp’s inhabitants, Igor ‘Sisi’ Eisenberg. Upon learning that he and hundreds of the camp’s other men were bound for Auschwitz, Capek and five hundred of the camp’s women volunteered to join them. At the time, Capek recalled that the men and women of the camp thought they were being moved to 'assist with the war efforts'. Capek arrived at Auschwitz on 1 October 1944. Upon arrival, the leader of her group was shot and killed as she exited the train. The group were then gathered outside the gates of the camp, where they were separated into two groups by ‘a man in a white coat’. After entering the camp, Capek and her group were shaved, showered and dressed in dog collars and rags. Over the ensuing four weeks, Capek was woken every morning at 5:00 am for <b>roll</b> call and <b>fed</b> red beetroot in water. Amongst the horrors, she recalled witnessing German guards murder two Polish women, and people throwing themselves at the electrical fence. By her own account, she was 'lucky' to have arrived at Auschwitz as late in the war as she did. By 28 October 1944, Capek was being transported again, this time to the Kudowa-Sackisch concentration camp, where she remained for the duration of the war. She stated that the camp was run largely by 'female Gestapo officers', and was required to work as a machinist, grave digger and railway worker during her time there. At the end of the war, on 8 May 1945, Capek was marched by the Gestapo to the border of Czechoslovakia with the remainder of the camp’s inhabitants. She was met by the townsfolk of Nachod, who took her and the remainder of the camp into their care as they recovered.|$|R
