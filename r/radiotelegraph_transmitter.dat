Titanic only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly {{more than half of the}} number on board, and one third of her total capacity. [...] In total the ship carried lifeboat davits would could lower three lifeboats each, for a total of 48 boats. [...] However, Titanic carried only a total of 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved to be hard to launch during the sinking.|$|E

In order to utilize the conventional <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>transmitter</b> presently installed in ships at sea the binary numbers 0 and 1 were converted to dots and dashes. The circuit described in this report distinguishes the received dots from dashes and produces pulses at two separate outputs. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
