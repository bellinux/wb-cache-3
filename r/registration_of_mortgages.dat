5000|$|Real {{estate is}} one field where {{the chain of}} title has {{considerable}} significance. Various registration systems, such as the Torrens title system, {{have been developed to}} track the ownership of individual pieces of real property. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the chain of title is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some holders <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> liabilities without <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> changes of ownership with local governments. [...] US states have objected and even sued over this practice.|$|R
