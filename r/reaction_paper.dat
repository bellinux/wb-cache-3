50|$|In this <b>reaction</b> <b>paper</b> to William E. Cross, Jr.’s Nigrescence Model of African American {{identity}} development, Akbar reviews some of {{the limitations}} that he sees in the model and others articles that have expanded upon Cross’ model. Akbar notes that Cross’ theory was drafted {{as a reaction to}} the sociopolitical environment at the time, specifically his observations that African Americans in the 1960s began changing their self-perceptions and social behaviors. As such, Akbar relates that Cross’ theory must be understood as a reaction to this phenomenon. Akbar’s two major qualms with Cross’ theory, and the related papers by Parham and Helms, is that 1) the model fails to account for the view that the Black identity is the core context of the self, and 2) the model fails to account for the centrality of spirituality in conceptualization of the Black personality, a crucial element in the Afro-centric perspective.|$|E

40|$|Implementing {{a talent}} {{management}} program is like walking a tightrope, {{one needs to}} find a balance in striving for positive reactions among the élite group of 'high potentials' (i. e. employees identified as making extraordinary organization-level contributions) {{while at the same}} time avoiding negative reactions among the rest of the workforce. This is not an easy task as employees who are not poart of the 'lucky few' might not perceive the talent management practices as fair and therefore show negative attitudes and behaviors. Using seven empirical studies (e. g. surveys, experiment, and vignette study), this dissertation focuses on high potentials' and non-high potnetials' differential justice perceptions and reactions. In doing so, we deal with the reoccuring guestions: 'Do talent management practices generate desired employee outcomes?' and 'How should we implement talent management practices to increase fairness and create overall beneficial outcomes?'. In particular, via in-depth and focus group interviews with HR practitioners, we noticed that talent management procedures are often not well-thought through and that organizations withhold information and are afraid to openly communicate about their talent management practices. This dissertation amplifies the importance of implementing fair procedures that are, for instance, consistent and free of bias (i. e. procedural justice) and the importance of providing adequate and open communication (i. e. informational justice) in the context of talent management.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{synthesis of}} new chiral N,P ligands and their evaluation in {{two types of}} asymmetric transition-metal catalyzed reactions. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes studies in iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. A new class of chiral N,P ligands, imidazole-phosphines, was synthesized and evaluated in the Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins (Paper I). The new ligands proved to be highly efficient and enantioselective in the reaction. Because the substrate scope of Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation is still limited to certain types of test substrates, new substrate classes with importance in medicinal and materials chemistry were investigated. Vinyl fluorides were efficiently hydrogenated to fluorine-containing chiral centers by the iridium catalysts with imidazole-phosphine ligands (Paper I). To obtain CF 3 -bearing chiral centers, we hydrogenated CF 3 -substituted olefins (Paper II). Ir-catalyzed asymmetric  hydrogenation was highly enantioselective for the functionalized CF 3 -substituted olefins and the resulting chiral products can be valuable in design of materials such as LCD screens. Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation was also evaluated as a route to diarylmethine chiral centers (Paper III). A wide range of new chiral compounds possessing a diarylmethine chiral center was obtained. The second part of the thesis deals with asymmetric intermolecular Heck reaction utilizing N,P ligands. The N,P ligand class of thiazole-phosphines was evaluated in the Heck <b>reaction</b> (<b>Paper</b> IV) and gave high enantioselectivity.

40|$|Recently, due to {{the unique}} {{properties}} and structures such as large geometric surface area, electrical conductivity and light weight, 3 D structured carbon materials have been attracting extensive attention from scientists. Moreover, the materials, which can provide well-defined pathways for reactants to easily access active sites, are extremely useful for energy conversion as well as environmental and catalysis applications. To date, many precursors {{have been used for}} fabrication of 3 D structured carbon materials including pitch, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and polymer foams. This thesis, as shown in the thesis title, focus on two main aspects: the study of the characteristics of melamine based carbon foam synthesized at different conditions and their applications. In paper I, it was revealed that through a simple, one-step pyrolysis process, flexible carbon foam synthesized from melamine foam (BasotectÒ, BASF) was obtained. Additionally, through a pyrolysis-activation process, activated carbon foam which possesses hydrophilic nature and high surface area was successfully synthesized. The characteristics of carbon foam such as the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature, electrical conductivity, mechanical properties and surface chemistry were studied. It was shown that carbon foam could be successfully used as an absorbent in environmental applications e. g. removing of spill oil from water (paper I) or as support for heterogeneous catalysts, which in turn was used not only in gas phase reactions (paper I and IV) but also in an aqueous phase <b>reaction</b> (<b>paper</b> II). Importantly, when combined with a SpinChem® rotating bed reactor (SRBR) (paper II), the monolithic carbon foam/SRBR system brought more advantages than using the foam alone. Additionally, the work in paper III showed the potential of carbon foam in an energy conversion application as anode electrode substrate in alkaline water electrolysis. In summary, the versatility of the carbon foam has been proven through abovementioned lab scale studies and {{due to the}} simple, scalable and cost effective pyrolysis and activation processes used for the production, it has potential to be used in large-scale applications. ...|$|E

The progression of the CF lung disease is correlated to inflection with {{a limited number of}} colonising bacterial species. An inflammatory reaction in the lung occurs early. The general aim of this thesis was to study the bacterial colonisation in the lower airways of CF patients, and the concomitant inflammatory <b>reaction.</b> <b>Paper</b> I is a retrospective study of the chronic bacterial colonisation with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in 12 CF patients during 1983 - 1992. No background factors for chronic colonisation could be verified in our material. An epidemiologic outbreak was not seen. The patients were older at the time of first isolation of S. maltophilia compared to that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chronic colonisation implied a deterioration of the lung function during follow-up. The lung function of the patients was significantly worse at first isolation of S. maltophilia compared to controls colonised with P. aeruginosa at similar ages. Chronic colonisation and repeated antibiotic treatments resulted in rapid development of antimicrobial resistance. Thus, S. maltophilia is a pathogenic bacterium in patients with CF and a marker of lung disease. Paper II evaluates multiplex PCR-based detection of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia in 90 sputum specimens compared to culture. Our data indicate high sensitivity (93 %) regarding the detection of P. aeruginosa and high specificity regarding all three genera examined. The greatest gains with this method could be made when used for the early detection of P. aeruginosa in sputum-producing CF patients. Paper III describes typing of 39 clinical isolates of B. cepacia, which is an important pathogen, often associated with deterioration of the CF lung status. It exhibits a considerable phenotypic polymorphism. Typing by arbitrarily primed (AP) -PCR. using ERIC primer was performed for epidemiologic subtyping. Genetic changes were detected by analysis of shifts in the band patterns that were individual. Partial species identification could effectively be obtained by sequencing the V 3 region of the 16 S RNA gene. Heterogeneity of the bases was revealed in the same region in 10 of 37 strains, indicating at least two different types of 16 S rRNA in the same cell. Most of the 14 CF patients, to whom 33 of the isolates belonged, developed severe lung disease after colonisation with Burkholderia, irrespective of the typing results. Paper IV investigates TN 17 -oc and IL- 8 levels of sputum in 10 CF patients during exacerbation and the baseline levels of IL- 8 in 48 sputum-producing CF patients. High IL- 8 and TNF-[alpha] values in sputum seemed to correlate with clinical symptoms of deterioration and could be valuable diagnostic parameters. Our data also indicated a correlation between current bacterial colonisation with either P. aeruginosa or S. aureus in the lower airways and IL- 8 concentrations in sputum. IL- 8 in the sputum of CF patients seems to be a useful marker of both current bacterial colonisation and the degree of lung damage. Paper V evaluates the effect of 14 -day ibuprofen therapy with special regard to IL- 8 levels in sputum of 19 CF patients in clinically stable condition. The study was performed double-blinded, placebo-controlled in a crossover manner. Ibuprofen therapy did not result in significantly decreased IL- 8 concentrations in the sputum of these CF patients with relatively advanced pulmonary disease. Slightly lower levels during day 8 - 14 of ibuprofen therapy were seen. Prescribing ibuprofen for this group of CF patients may need individual evaluation and will probably not be a general alternative...|$|E
