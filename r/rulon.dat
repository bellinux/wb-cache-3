5|$|In 2001, FLDS leader <b>Rulon</b> Jeffs {{arranged}} for a then 14-year-old Wall to marry her 19-year-old cousin, Allen Steed. Wall stated that she despised her cousin and asked that she be given more time or another possible husband. Her stepfather, mother, and older sister, Rebecca Musser, were supportive of the marriage and encouraged her {{to go through with}} it, with the latter two sewing her wedding dress and organizing her honeymoon. She and Steed were married at the Hotsprings Motel in Caliente, Nevada. Warren Jeffs, who had previously insisted that the wedding move forward, performed the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Cameron Morrah {{decided to}} forgo {{his senior season}} and {{declared}} for the NFL draft. He was invited to the NFL Combine alongside <b>Rulon</b> Davis, Anthony Felder, Zack Follett, Alex Mack, and Worrell Williams.|$|E
25|$|Cal {{defensive}} end Tyson Alualu {{scored on a}} fumble recovery during the first-quarter blitz, and the Bears defense fared well against Arizona's spread attack despite missing three injured starters - linebacker Zack Follett and defensive linemen Matt Malele and <b>Rulon</b> Davis.|$|E
50|$|The series {{focuses on}} the battle between the good Valorians and the evil <b>Rulons</b> on prehistoric Earth. The Valorians were a superhuman race, while the <b>Rulons</b> were a mixture of {{humanoid}} creatures. Both races came from the future but were transported {{back in time to}} the age of dinosaurs. Once on Earth, the Valorians befriended dinosaurs, while the <b>Rulons</b> brainwashed them.|$|R
50|$|After {{successfully}} {{landing on}} prehistoric Earth, the Valorians, led by Questar, used their AMP necklaces to telepathically {{communicate with the}} dinosaurs they encountered and eventually befriended them. On the other hand, the <b>Rulons,</b> led by their leader Emperor Krulos, used brainwashing devices known as brain-boxes to control dinosaurs for their own needs. The <b>Rulons</b> then launched {{an attack on the}} Valorians, who called upon their dinosaur friends to assist them in fighting back. After successfully defeating the <b>Rulons,</b> the Valorians declared themselves to be the Dino-Riders.|$|R

25|$|New England {{had four}} {{possessions}} {{in the fourth}} quarter, but the first three ended in punts, while Broncos defensive end <b>Rulon</b> Jones ended the last one by sacking Eason {{in the end zone}} for a safety with 1:32 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the struggles on offense, Cal's Jahvid Best walked off the field after dislocating his elbow following a tackle. X-rays showed {{that there were no}} fractures and an MRI revealed no ligament damage. Cal's <b>Rulon</b> Davis left after half-time with an undisclosed foot injury.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rulon</b> Gardner, never a NCAA {{champion}} or a world medalist, beat Alexander Karelin of Russia to win gold in {{the super}} heavyweight class, Greco-Roman wrestling. Karelin had won gold in Seoul, Barcelona and Atlanta. Before this fight he had never lost in international competition, had been unbeaten in all competitions in 13 years, and had not surrendered a point in a decade.|$|E

5000|$|The Valorians were a {{peaceful}} race that lived on Valoria {{until they were}} attacked by the <b>Rulons.</b> The Valorians attempted {{to escape from the}} Rulons' assault using their [...] "Space Time Energy Projector" [...] (S.T.E.P.); however, something went wrong. They were sent back in time, 65 million years to the age of the dinosaurs. Unknown to them, the <b>Rulons</b> in the spaceship Dreadlock were also sent back through time when the S.T.E.P. was activated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Rulons</b> are a race {{of aliens}} that are the enemies of the Valorians and the main antagonists of the series.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, church leader <b>Rulon</b> Jeffs was {{confirmed}} to have married 22 women and fathered more than 60 children. Current estimates state that Warren Jeffs may have upwards of 60 wives. As the type of polygamy practiced is polygyny, critics of this lifestyle claim that its practice inevitably leads to bride shortages and likely to child marriages, incest, and child abuse.|$|E
25|$|Lubricants {{can also}} clog heat exchangers, {{especially}} the regenerator. For these reasons, designers prefer non-lubricated, low-coefficient of friction materials (such as <b>rulon</b> or graphite), with low normal {{forces on the}} moving parts, especially for sliding seals. Some designs avoid sliding surfaces altogether by using diaphragms for sealed pistons. These {{are some of the}} factors that allow Stirling engines to have lower maintenance requirements and longer life than internal-combustion engines.|$|E
25|$|Several {{key players}} {{departed}} after 2008, including Alex Mack, Nate Longshore, Zack Follett, Will Ta'ufo'ou and Cameron Morrah offensively, and Zack Follett, <b>Rulon</b> Davis, and Anthony Felder defensively. The Bears also lost offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti to Pittsburgh, but gained Andy Ludwig, who helped guide the Utah Utes {{to a perfect}} 13–0 season as offensive coordinator. Ludwig had previously worked alongside Cal head coach Jeff Tedford at Oregon and Fresno State, becoming the fifth offensive coordinator at Cal in five years.|$|E

25|$|Musser led the {{community}} until a contentious appointment of <b>Rulon</b> Allred {{to a high}} position of authority in 1951 angered {{some members of the}} Short Creek community. Musser had appointed Allred to be his successor, but Allred was not accepted as his successor by the Short Creek community. This led to a schism, with many followers breaking off and joining Allred; this offshoot became known as the Apostolic United Brethren. The core group in the Short Creek area instead followed Charles Zitting as its leader.|$|E
25|$|As Jessop relates, a rift in her {{religious}} community {{at about the}} time she completed middle school led to the leaders pulling children out of the local high school. She {{graduated from high school}} at the age of 17. Jessop intended to attend college and then go to medical school to study pediatric medicine; instead, she was forced into an arranged marriage to Merril Jessop at age 18. Merril Jessop was 32 years her senior and already had three wives and more than 30 children, several of them older than his new wife. Once married, Carolyn Jessop did get to attend college, but her husband decided that she would study elementary education, not medicine. Just months into the marriage, the FLDS's new leader, <b>Rulon</b> Jeffs, gave Merril two new wives.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Kosar {{completed}} a 25-yard pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome and a 19-yarder to Clarence Weathers on third down and 17 {{on the way}} to a 29-yard field goal by Matt Bahr two minutes into the second quarter. But Denver stormed right back on an 80-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Lang, making the score 21–3. A sack by Denver's <b>Rulon</b> Jones helped force the Browns to a three and out. This time all the Broncos could manage was a missed field goal by Rich Karlis. But once again Cleveland could not move the ball and turned it over with a fumble from receiver Brian Brennan that was recovered by cornerback Randy Robbins. This time the Browns defense stepped up, sacking Elway twice and forcing Denver's first punt of the game. After that, Kosar's 24-yard completion to Slaughter set up a 45-yard field goal attempt by Bahr, but he sent it wide right as time expired in the half.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{series of}} Dino-Rider toys {{consisted}} of 7 new Valorian toys and 3 new <b>Rulons,</b> along with eight more 2-figure packs {{as well as}} 6 [...] "Commandos". The Commandos consisted of a human figure with unique weapons and accessories.|$|R
2500|$|This Pac-10 {{match up}} was an {{opportunity}} for Cal to end its two-game slide.

[...] The school's alumni include two-time Olympic gold medalist in Greco-Roman wrestling (2000) <b>Rulon</b> Gardner and MLB pitcher for the Chicago White Sox, Matt Lindstrom. Another alumnus is Marion G. Romney, a former counselor in the LDS Church's First Presidency, who was valedictorian of the Ricks Academy class of 1918.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, a schism formed {{within the}} FLDS Church {{just before the}} death of Leroy S. Johnson. A small group of FLDS (known as the Centennial Park group) took issue with the [...] "one-man rule" [...] {{doctrine}} that altered the leadership structure {{of the church and}} that was implemented fully when <b>Rulon</b> Jeffs assumed his position as sole leader of the organization. These followers took up residence just south of Colorado City, in Centennial Park, Arizona, calling themselves [...] "The Work of Jesus Christ," [...] or [...] "The Work" [...] for short.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to November 20, 2007, {{the church}} was being led by Jeffs, who succeeded his father, <b>Rulon</b> Jeffs, in 2002. For nearly two years, Warren Jeffs had been wanted on sex-crimes charges. From May 2006 until his arrest in August 2006, {{he was on the}} FBI's Ten Most-Wanted List. [...] On September 25, 2007, Jeffs was found guilty of two counts of being an {{accomplice}} to rape and was sentenced to ten years to life in prison. This conviction was later overturned. On January 28, 2011, Jeffs again asserted his leadership of the denomination. Warren Jeffs has since been {{sentenced to life in prison}} plus 20 years along with a $10,000 fine after his conviction on aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault charges. The FLDS Church has appeared on Escaping Evil: My Life in a Cult on the Crime & Investigation Network.|$|E
2500|$|Zitting died in 1954 and Leroy S. Johnson {{was chosen}} to lead the church in Short Creek. Johnson led the FLDS Church {{until his death in}} 1986. He was succeeded by <b>Rulon</b> Jeffs, who assumed the {{position}} of prophet, a title his predecessor refused to use. In Jeffs' later years, his poor health led to his son Warren Jeffs serving as leader of the church in his stead, and upon Rulon's death in September 2002, Warren Jeffs became leader of the FLDS Church. However, immediately after the state of Utah convicted him of being an accomplice to rape, it was widely reported in the press that Warren Jeffs resigned his leadership of the FLDS Church, though the statement made by his attorneys only addresses Jeffs' resignation from his fiduciary post as [...] "President of the Corporation of the President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc." ...|$|E
