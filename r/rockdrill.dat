40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) have {{developed}} a number of coring and drilling systems for use in science projects in the UK and internationally. These include 3 m, 4 m and 6 m vibrocoring systems; a 5 m combined <b>rockdrill</b> and vibrocorer system (RD 1); an oriented drill designed specifically to recover samples for use in palaeomagnetic studies; and a 55 m <b>rockdrill</b> (<b>RockDrill</b> 2). The BGS has recently completed a series of modifications to increase the flexibility and performance of its vibrocoring and rock-drilling capability to meet the ever increasing needs of the scientific community. The latest generation vibrocorers can be operated without an umbilical power cable. The new system not only allows vibrocoring in greater water depths, but {{can also be used}} on a wider range of vessels including those with limited deck space. The BGS <b>RockDrill</b> 2 can core up to 55 m sub-seabed by focussing on reducing the overall weight therefore extending operational water depth to 4000 m...|$|E

These include 3 m and 6 m vibrocoring systems; a 5 m combined <b>rockdrill</b> and vibrocorer system; an oriented drill designed specifically to recover samples for use in palaeomagnetic studies; and a 55 m <b>rockdrill</b> (<b>RockDrill</b> 2). Recently, BGS {{have developed}} an autonomous, battery-operated vibrocoring system compatible with both the 3 m and 6 m vibrocorers, {{which can be used}} in water depths up to 6000 m. Use of a battery system negates the use of an umbilical power cable to operate the vibrocorer, which instead can be deployed using the vessels A-frame and winch. The autonomous battery system comprises six 48 V 19 Ah batteries connected in series to give a 288 V power source, a microprocessor and real-time clock. Data from the sensors are recorded with a time-stamp, giving diagnostic information that can be downloaded once the system is returned to the deck. The vibrocorer is operated via a pre-set program which is set up before deployment. The new system not only allows vibrocoring in greater water depths, but can also be used on smaller vessels where deck space is limited as a separate winch and umbilical is not required. The autonomous system was used {{for the first time in}} June 2014 on-board the R Belgica to acquire samples from 20 sites in the Dangeard and Explorer canyon heads, off the southwest of England in 430 m water depth. Another development is the BGS 55 m <b>rockdrill</b> (<b>RockDrill</b> 2), a remotely operated sampling system capable of coring up to 55 m below sea floor in water depths up to 4000 m. The <b>rockdrill</b> can be operated via its own launch and recovery system and can be outfitted with additional sensors such as gas flow meters, which have been designed by the BGS for assessing volume of gas hydrate, and down-hole logging tools. The 55 m <b>rockdrill</b> has recently been used to sample hydrate-entrained sediments in the Sea of Japan. The maximum coring depth achieved was 32 m below sea floor and the system can operate for more than 50 hours on a single deployment. The BGS system will be used in conjunction with the Bremen University (MARUM) MeBo sea-floor <b>rockdrill</b> on future International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions. ...|$|E
40|$|From September to October 2002, shallow drilling, {{using the}} {{submersible}} (5 m) <b>Rockdrill</b> of the British Geological Survey and the German R=V Sonne revealed critical {{information on the}} subsurface nature of two distinct hydrothermal systems in the New Ireland fore-arc and the Manus Basin of Papua New Guinea. Drilling at Conical Seamount significantly extends the known surface extent of the previously discovered vein-style gold mineralization (up to 230 g=t Au) at this site. Drilling the conventional PACMANUS volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposit recovered complexly textured massive sulfide with spectacular concentrations of gold in several core sections including 0. 5 m@ 28 g=t Au, 0. 35 m@ 30 g=t Au, and 0. 20 m@ 57 g=t Au. Shallow drilling is a fast and cost efficient method that bridges the gap between surface sampling and deep (ODP) drilling and will become a standard practice in the future study of seafloor hydrothermal systems and massive sulfide deposits...|$|E
40|$|This thesis work {{sought to}} find a {{tribological}} testing method suitable for cementedcarbide drill bit inserts used when drilling rock. A {{review of the literature}} publishedon the matter showed that {{there are quite a few}} test methods developed for wearstudies with cemented carbides, but most of them were not designed for the <b>rockdrilling</b> industry. Published studies performed with the found methods and articleswith analyzed field tests have been studied. It is generally agreed upon that the stepsof wear is that the binder disappears first, followed by removal of carbide grains. Themechanisms of binder phase and carbide grain removal is somewhat debated, butalmost every study observes fracture of the carbide grains. The wear test created inthis thesis was shown to give wear linear with time, but not with load. The newmethod was shown to be capable of distinguishing between different cementedcarbides worn in three body abrasion against different rocks. Analysis of the wornsamples shows that there are similarities with bit inserts worn in field testing. Many ofthe observations made during the analysis are also similar to observations inliterature...|$|R
40|$|The {{repetitive}} impacting {{of solid}} components in industry {{can result in}} wear damage which may significantly limit service life. Impact wear problems have been encountered in hydro-powered stoping equipment (eg <b>rockdrills</b> and impact rockbreakers) developed for deep level gold mining in South Africa. This research project was {{a study of the}} repetitive impact wear of reciprocating valve components (eg poppet valves within the impact rockbreaker) under simulated conditions. A laboratory apparatus, capable of producing impacts varying in energy from 2 - 5 J and varying in frequency from 5 - 50 Hz in an aqueous environment (distilled water), was designed and built for this purpose. Impact tests were conducted in order to: a) rank materials according to impact wear resistance, b) to determine modes and mechanisms of wear, c) to determine material, microstructural, design and operating parameters of importance in minimising wear, d) to make recommendations concerning the above, to facilitate productivity and longlife of poppet valves within impact rockbreakers. The materials selected for testing (817 M 40, 1210 and AISI 304, AISI 431 and AISI 440 C) are steels currently used by the gold mining industry in different applications and known to perform satisfactorily in service. These materials are not all ideally suited to application in valves. They were chosen in order to illustrate how different steel compositions, microstructures and heat treatments influence the rate and mode of wear...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 93 - 94. The elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} of polymeric piston {{seals in}} a water powered <b>rockdrill</b> has been modelled in this thesis. Current seal designs, consist of an Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) ring, energised to remain {{in contact with the}} reciprocating piston, using a nitrile rubber o-ring. The design of the seals is such that they do not facilitate the formation of a lubricating film, and the high contact stresses at the seal face due to the seal pressure cause excessive wear of the seals. The elastohydrodynamic model is based on a numerical algorithm in which the elasticity equations for the seal deflection and the one dimensional lubrication equation have been solved simultaneously. The polymeric ring has been simplified due to its axisymmetry, and modelled in cross section as an elastic beam resting on a spring base, while the deformation of the o-ring has been considered independently since the moduli of the two materials differs by nearly two orders of magnitude. The o-ring was modelled using the non-linear Mooney-Rivlin constitutive equation implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS. With this model, the contact stresses existing between the o-ring and the back of the polymer seal have been determined for a range of o-ring squeezes and rubber hardnesses. The resultant lubrication and o-ring forces acting on the rectangular polymer seal have been used in a finite difference formulation of the seal (or beam on a spring base) to determine the seal deflection above the piston...|$|E
40|$|This Master Thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB, Örebro and at Linköping University, Sweden from February 2010 through August 2010. The project deals with performance improvement of hydraulic rock drill machine manufactured by Atlas Copco Rock Drills. Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB {{is a world}} leading supplier of percussive rock drilling equipment for surface and underground applications. HOPSAN, a software developed at Linkoping University, provides an integrated simulation environment for simulation of fluid power systems. During the work, a HOPSAN model of a piston accumulator has been developed and its performance with a rock drill has been studied. Furthermore, the fatigue strength calculations of a piston accumulator has been {{made on the basis}} of stress analysis performed using the ANSYS software. One of the rock drills of valveless type, developed at Atlas Copco Rocktec Division works at higher efficiency than the conventionally used rock drills. But the problem with this type of drill is that the piston swings between two large and highly pressurized oil volume which causes strength problems in the housing of the rock drill. The aim of this work is to achieve the higher efficiency of the rock drill without having any strength problems. Therefore, some study and research is proposed to replace the large oil volume by one or two piston accumulators. This thesis work involves modelling, simulation, design and fatigue strength calculations of a piston accumulator and its implementation to the rock drill. Optimization of the piston accumulator has also been conducted while working with the rock drill so that highest possible eciency could be achieved. The performance of the <b>rockdrill</b> with piston accumulator has been analyzed and results are studied. In the end, a short fatigue life calculations are performed and results are discussed. Prior to fatigue life calculations, a transient dynamic stress analysis has been performed and stress amplitudes are identified which contributes to the accumulated damage to piston in accumulator...|$|E
