50|$|The ensuing {{parliamentary}} elections {{resulted in a}} complete victory of the Progressives. This was also the last election which based on the parliamental system of the old feudal estates. All efforts to bring about an understanding {{between the government and}} the opposition were fruitless. Kossuth demanded not merely the redress of actual grievances, but a liberal reform which would make grievances impossible in the future. In the highest circles a dissolution of the diet now seemed to be the sole remedy; but, before it could be carried out, tidings of the February revolution in Paris reached Pressburg on the 1st of March, and on the 3rd of March Kossuth's motion for the appointment of an independent, <b>responsible</b> <b>ministry</b> was accepted by the Lower House. The moderates, alarmed not so much by the motion itself as by its tone, again tried to intervene; but on the 13th of March the Vienna revolution broke out, and the Emperor, yielding to pressure or panic, appointed Count Louis Batthyány premier of the first Hungarian <b>responsible</b> <b>ministry,</b> which included Kossuth, Széchenyi and Deák.|$|E

[...] "Responsible Government" [...] marked the country's democratic independence, without a revolution, although not without violence.

The young female killer whale had stranded on the Dutch coast in June 2010.

5000|$|The Empire, {{taken by}} surprise, sought to curb both {{the middle classes}} and the labouring classes, and forced them both into revolutionary actions. There were {{multiple}} strikes. The elections of May 1869, which took place during these disturbances, inflicted upon the Empire a serious moral defeat. In spite of the revival {{by the government of}} the cry of the [...] "red terror", Ollivier, the advocate of conciliation, was rejected by Paris, while 40 irreconcilables and 116 members of the Third Party were elected. Concessions had to be made to these, so by the senatus-consulte of September 8, 1869 a parliamentary monarchy was substituted for personal government. On January 2, 1870 Ollivier was placed {{at the head of the}} first homogeneous, united and <b>responsible</b> <b>ministry.</b>|$|E

By 1856 Campbell and Brown decided that their enterprises and properties, now worth £110,000, could be entrusted to a salaried manager, while they lived on the dividends as expatriates. Brown and his family left early in the year, but Campbell's departure was delayed. Much against his inclinations he became caught up in politics, serving as provincial superintendent, then {{as a member of}} the House of Representatives for the City of Auckland, and briefly (June to November 1856) {{as a member of the}} colony's first stable, <b>responsible</b> <b>ministry</b> under E.
