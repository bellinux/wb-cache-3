40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of AC motors {{is a subject}} area that has received extensive research. Whether this monitoring is carried out on a scheduled basis by engineer intervention, or continuously using an on-line unit, {{the results of this}} testing enable preventative maintenance work to be a carried out earlier, before any major failure occurs. Monitoring using vibration analysis is the most common and depending on the plant, can be done once or twice a year. This is usually limited to the condition of motor bearings and is not commonly used to detect failures in the motor electromagnetic systems. Monitoring units that use motor current measurements are also available, but these are less widely-used and usually on major plant motors (> 250 kW for example) that have a large capital outlay to replace. The industry drivers – as always – are maximum plant and machinery uptime, with the minimal amount of scheduled maintenance. If maintenance is carried out too regularly, costs rise significantly not only due to the maintenance activity itself, but disruption to production schedules. Maintenance schedules that are too infrequent can result in an unacceptable rise in total failures of plant that are unexpected and may cause a significant amount of production disruption and downtime, especially if this occurs during out-of-hours working time. However, industry now faces another big challenge and one that has had a good share of exposure over the last few years. It is of course, the drive to reduce carbon emissions and with it the amount of energy that a plant itself consumes. What has brought this more to the fore recently is the significant rise in energy costs. Whilst product margins have to remain the same, many companies energy costs have seen a two to three-fold increase in energy budgets {{in the last few years}} alone. For industry processes that have a significant amount of fan and pump applications, the manufacturers of low-cost AC inverters have saturated the lower-performance market of inverter drives such that any drive can control these type of fan and pump applications, where accurate speed control is not a major driver. Unfortunately, this can be a step backwards for end-users of plant that use equipment to monitor motor condition via motor current signals. Additionally, vibration analysis that relies upon ‘base-lining’ motor data when the AC motor is running at base speed may not give accurate readings when the motor is under inverter control and running at a different speed. For manufacturers of AC inverter drives in this low-end market, it can be difficult to sell a product from one manufacturer over another without the unit having a “USP”, or Unique Selling Proposition. Most decisions taken on inverter equipment purchase at this level are usually in favour of the equipment that costs the least to purchase. Credibility of manufacturers based on product history and perceived reliability cuts little ground with an ever cost-conscious industry. This is where the research into diagnosis of faults on inverter driven motor systems can provide just this USP for manufacturers. If the incorporation of on-line diagnosis for simple inverter applications can be brought to a typical inverter unit at a reasonable cost, the manufacturer who can offer this gains a unique foothold in the marketplace – a drive that can monitor and signal that the motor it is driving is showing signs of early failure. It will be sensible to limit this research to simple inverter applications as high-end inverter drives that operate equipment such as high-speed printing presses, <b>rotary</b> <b>shears</b> will be more difficult to model and simulate than a fan or pump application. It is hoped that a typical inverter drive can relay enough detailed information about the load which it is driving to allow this to be used for abnormal motor load conditions as this will provide a platform on which to extend the research beyond this MSc and into the realms of incorporating such technology into a drive manufacturers equipment. If this can be done without major modification to an inverter, then it may be easier to implement in equipment offered by different manufacturers. It is quite possible that this technology could be licensed under a name that guarantees the performance of the condition monitoring algorithms and reliability from one drive manufacturer to another...|$|E

A pair of digitalized surfaces of a 250 x 250 mm concrete rough fracture replica were numerically manipulated to simulate the translational and <b>rotary</b> <b>shearing</b> processes of the sample, using Finite Element Method (FEM). Different fluid flow situations were cosidered. For the translational shear three different flow patterns-unidirectional, bi-directional and radial-have been taken into account.

Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} fracture surface roughness on the aperture and transmissivity fields was evaluated using semi-variograms. The results of flow and particle transport simulations show that translational shear yields a channelling effect in the direction perpendicular to shear direction, creating high transmissivity channels through which the particles travelling in this direction can travel fast and without being delayed by bypassing low transmissivity areas. Bi-directional flow patterns show clearly the shortcomings of the conventional shear-flow tests in the laboratory with a unidirectional flow.

40|$|International audienceSpherical {{aggregates}} named clay-clast aggregates (CCAs) {{have been}} reported from recent investigations on retrieved clay-bearing fault gouges from shallow depth seismogenic faults and <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments conducted on clay-bearing gouge at seismic slip rates. The formation of CCAs appears {{to be related to}} the shearing of a smectite-rich granular material that expands and becomes fluidized. We have conducted additional high-velocity <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments and low-velocity double-shear experiments. We demonstrate that a critical temperature depending on dynamic pressure-temperature conditions is needed for the formation of CCAs. This temperature corresponds to the phase transition of pore water from liquid to vapor or to critical, which induced gouge pore fluid expansion and therefore a thermal pressurization of the fault. A detailed examination by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX-SEM) element mapping, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows strong similar characteristics of experimental and natural CCAs with a concentric well-organized fabric of the cortex and reveals that their development may result from the combination of electrostatic and capillary forces in a critical reactive medium during the dynamic slip weakening. Accordingly, the occurrence of CCAs in natural clay-rich fault gouges constitutes new unequivocal textural evidence for shallow depth thermal pressurization and consequently for past seismic faulting...|$|R

40|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> {{apparatus}} {{has been}} newly {{set up in}} Chiba University which can control the temperature near a sliding surface, T_meas, up to 1000 °C independently from slip rate, V. Frictional experiments at 0. 010 m/s, 1 MPa normal stress, and variable T_meas for dolerite have revealed a remarkable effect of temperature on the friction coefficient, f. With increasing T_meas, f starts from 0. 7 to 0. 8 at room temperature (RT), decreases down to 0. 5 – 0. 6 at 400 °C, increases until 800 °C, and then decreases again. We have also conducted XRD analyses of the wear materials (mainly submicron particles) and investigated microstructures of the sliding surfaces developed at different temperatures T_meas, {{and we found that}} there is a negative correlation between f and the amount of amorphous material except at RT and 1000 °C. The generation of the amorphous phase probably causes the weakening. There is no amorphous phase recognized for a sample at 1000 °C which is an aggregate of rounded crystals. EBSD analyses show that the material on the sliding surface at 1000 °C contains randomly oriented hematite grains, which together with the observed microstructural features suggests that granular flow was taking place. We have also demonstrated that f depends not only on the instantaneous value of temperature, but also on its history.

The gouges were slid under 1 MPa normal stress, for displacements up to 30 m and a slip rate of 1. 31 m s- 1 under room-humidity and water-saturated conditions. Sample dilatancy was observed in room-humidity runs after similar to 3 - 4 m of slip, concomitant with an increase in normal stress and a decrease in shear stress. Mineralogical and microstructural investigations suggest that dilatancy resulted from expansion of the H(2) O released by the collapse of the smectite structure due to frictional heating of the slipping zone at T > 200 degrees C.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{elucidate}} {{the effects of}} pressure solution and phyllosilicates on the compaction and shear behaviour of granular materials chosen to simulate fault gouge deforming under hydrothermal conditions. I implemented three different experimental programs. The first program consists of compaction experiments on quartz sand and phyllosilicate-bearing quartz sand. Clear evidence was found for compaction by IPS. The main conclusion is that IPS compaction under the conditions studied, {{is controlled by the}} rate of dissolution of quartz within the grain contacts. The presence of muscovite hinders compaction, through a chemical retardation effect, on the dissolution rate, of aluminium ions dissolved in the fluid from the muscovite. The second program consists of high strain <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments performed on simulated fault gouges consisting of halite-muscovite mixtures. I observed velocity-strengthening behaviour up to a sliding velocity of 0. 3 - 1 μm/s, along with the development of a mylonitic microstructure consisting of an anastomosing foliation enveloping elongate halite clasts. The deformation mechanism was slip on the phyllosilicate foliation with accommodation by pressure solution of the intervening halite. At higher velocities, I observed a velocity weakening effect in the mixtures of halite and muscovite. This was accompanied by a cataclastic microstructure with no foliation but with significant porosity development. I explain this behaviour in terms of a granular flow mechanism involving competition between dilatation and pressure solution controlled compaction. The time-dependence of compaction leads to higher porosities at higher sliding velocities. Higher porosity implies a lower dilatancy angle for granular flow and thus faster shear produces a lower macroscopic shear strength. Slide-hold-slide experiments show that samples deformed in the low-velocity regime do not restrengthen on re-shear, while those deformed in the high velocity regime regain high strength. Healing rates, recorded for the latter samples, increase with sliding velocity. This is explained by a higher steady state porosity being maintained during steady state sliding, so that compaction is increased during hold periods. The increased compaction leads to an increased granular dilatancy angle, hence higher healing rates following rapid slip. The third program consists of <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments on simulated quartz gouges under hydrothermal conditions. They show strain hardening up to a shear strain γ of 0. 6 - 1. 8, followed by weakening of up to 30...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{materials}} {{reinforced with}} nanoparticles {{have an enormous}} range of applications owing to their superb mechanical and physical properties. More specifically, recent progress has shown that using inorganic nanomaterials as fillers in polymer/inorganic composites has tremendous application potential in automotive, aerospace, construction and electronics industries. If properly incorporated into a polymeric matrix, conductive nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene can be assembled into a three-dimensional electrical network. ^ A series of dynamic compressive experiments were performed to experimentally investigate the electrical response of multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) reinforced epoxy nanocomposites subjected to split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) loading. Low-resistance CNT/epoxy specimens were fabricated {{using a combination of}} shear mixing and ultrasonication. Utilizing the carbon nanotube network within, the electrical resistance of the nanocomposites was monitored using a high-resolution four-point probe method during each compressive loading event. In addition, real-time deformation images were captured using high-speed photography. The percent change in resistance was correlated to both strain and real-time damage. The results were then compared to previous work conducted by the authors (quasi-static and drop-weight impact) in order to elucidate the strain rate sensitivity on the electrical behavior of the material. In addition, the percent change in conductivity was determined using a Taylor expansion model to investigate the electrical response based upon both dimensional change as well as resistivity change during mechanical loading within the elastic regime. Experimental findings indicate that the electrical resistance is a function of both the strain and deformation mechanisms induced by the loading. The bulk electrical resistance of the nanocomposites exhibited an overall decrease of 40 – 65 % for quasi-static and drop-weight experiments and 65 – 85 % for SHPB experiments. ^ An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the electro-mechanical response of graphene reinforced polystyrene composites under static and dynamic loading. Graphene-polystyrene composites were fabricated using a solution mixing approach followed by hot-pressing. Absolute resistance values were measured with a high-resolution four-point probe method for both quasi-static and dynamic loading. A modified split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar apparatus, capable of simultaneous mechanical and electrical characterization, was developed and implemented to investigate the dynamic electro-mechanical response of the composites. In addition to measuring the change in electrical resistance as well as the dynamic constitutive behavior, real-time surface damage and global deformation was captured using high-speed photography. The real-time damage was correlated to both stress-strain and percent change in resistance profiles. The experimental findings indicate that the bulk electrical resistance of the composite increased significantly due to the brittle nature of the polystyrene matrix and the presence of relative agglomerations of graphene platelets which resulted in micro-crack formations. ^ The novel capillary-driven particle-level templating technique was then extended to allow for distribution of conductive sheet-like particles, such as graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) into specially constructed architectures throughout a polystyrene matrix to form multi-functional composites with tailored electro-mechanical properties. By precisely controlling the temperature and pressure during a melt compression process, highly conductive segregated composites were formed using very low loadings of graphene particles. Since the graphene flakes form a honeycomb percolating network along the boundaries between the polymer matrix particles, the composites show very high electrical conductivity but poor mechanical strength. To improve the mechanical properties, a new processing technique was developed that uses <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> through fixed angles to gradually evolve the honeycomb graphene network into a concentric band structure over the dimensions of the sample. An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the effect of GNP loading as well as the <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> angle on the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the composites. The experimental results show that both the electrical and mechanical properties of the composites are significantly altered using this very simple technique, which allows rational co-optimization of competing mechanical and electrical performance as appropriate for a given target application. ^ Flexible multi-functional composites with tailored electro-mechanical properties were produced using a modified capillary-driven particle-level templating technique. A fixed-angle <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> technique was utilized during the melt compression process to distribute GNPs into specially constructed architectures throughout a styrene-butadiene matrix. An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the effect of GNP loading as well as <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> angle on the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the composites. The experimental results show that this technique can be used to produce flexible composites that possess exceptional conductivity while still maintaining the salient mechanical characteristics the copolymer has to offer.

Seismic slip propagation is {{facilitated by}} along-fault low dynamic frictional resistance, which is controlled {{by a number of}} physico-chemical lubrication mechanisms. In particular, <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments conducted at seismic slip rates (1 [*]ms(- 1)) show that phyllosilicates can facilitate co-seismic slip along faults during earthquakes. This evidence is crucial for hazard assessment along oceanic subduction zones, where pelagic clays participate in seismic slip propagation.

We document the occurrence of micrometer-thick phyllosilicate-bearing layers along a carbonate-hosted seismogenic extensional fault in the central Apennines, Italy. Using friction experiments, we demonstrate that, at seismic slip rates (1 [*]ms(- 1)), similar calcite gouges with pre-existing phyllosilicate-bearing (clay content ≤ 3 [*]wt. %) micro-layers weaken faster than calcite gouges or mixed calcite-phyllosilicate gouges.

30|$|Friction {{coefficients}} were measured {{by using a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> apparatus (described in Mizoguchi et al. 2009). Approximately 500  mg of water-saturated powdered host rock was placed between the ends of two cylinders of sandstone (25  mm diameter) and sealed in a polytetrafluoroethylene sleeve to prevent leaks. The experiments were performed at ambient humidity under normal stresses that were increased in 0.5  MPa increments from 0.5 to 2.5  MPa. The friction coefficient {{has been shown to}} be generally velocity dependent and to have its peak value at velocities around 0.01  m s− 1, independent of rock type (e.g., Di Toro et al. 2011; Niemeijer et al. 2012). In addition, values at high slip velocities of 0.1 – 1.0  m s− 1 reflect the effects of weakening mechanisms such as powder lubrication (Reches and Lockner 2010) and thermal decomposition (Han et al. 2007). We thus adopted a velocity of 0.01  m s− 1 to represent peak friction during earthquakes. The shear stress was measured with a slip displacement after a correction for friction between the rock cylinders and the sleeve (approximately 0.01), which was determined from the shear stress at zero normal stress.|$|R

During the vibration, the blade root was simultaneously subjected to bending and <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> stresses. A method for indirect testing and determination of the dynamic frequencies of the typical vibrations of the wind wheel was developed, based on the frequency-holding characteristic of each subsignal during the transmission of the multiple mixed-vibration signals.

The dynamic vibration stress of the roundabout swing was found to be significantly stronger than those of the first- and second-order flexural vibrations of the blades. By a combination of numerical simulations and tests, it was determined that the pneumatic circumferential force was the primary determinant of the roundabout swing vibration frequencies, the relationship being quadratic.

40|$|The {{determination}} of rock friction under {{the conditions of}} seismic slip in the Earth crust (slip rates {{of the order of}} 1 m/s or more and normal stress of hundreds of MPa) is of paramount importance in earthquake mechanics. Fault friction controls the stress drop, the mechanical work and the frictional heat generated during the slip. However the essential engine of earthquakes is buried at several kilometers depth and only remote, indirect measurements, which are not sufficient to fully characterize fault dynamics, are available. Elucidating constraints are derived from experimental studies performed in powerful apparatuses applying <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> motion to rock samples.

40|$|Rupture fronts {{can cause}} fault displacement, {{reaching}} {{speeds up to}} several ms- 1 within a few milliseconds, at any distance away from the earthquake nucleation area. In the case of silicate-bearing rocks the abrupt slip acceleration results in melting at asperity contacts causing a large reduction in fault frictional strength (i. e., flash weakening). Flash weakening is also observed in experiments performed in carbonate-bearing rocks but evidence for melting is lacking. To unravel the micro-physical mechanisms associated with flash weakening in carbonates, experiments were conducted on pre-cut Carrara marble cylinders using a <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> apparatus at conditions relevant to earthquakes propagation. In the first 5 mm of slip the shear stress was reduced up to 30 % and CO 2 was released. Focused ion beam, scanning and transmission electron microscopy investigations of the slipping zones reveal the presence of calcite nanograins and amorphous carbon. We interpret the CO 2 release, the formation of nanograins and amorphous carbon {{to be the result}} of a shock-like stress release associated with the migration of fast-moving dislocations. Amorphous carbon, given its low friction coefficient, is responsible for flash weakening and promotes the propagation of the seismic rupture in carbonate-bearing fault patches...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of nanotechnology {{in the world}} has dramatically increased in the recent years as miniaturization has become more important in areas such as computing, sensing, biomedicine and many others. Advancements in these disciplines depend largely on the ability to synthesize nanoparticles of various shapes and sizes, as well as to assemble them efficiently into complex architectures. Currently, materials reinforced with nanoparticles have an enormous range of applications owing to their superb mechanical and physical properties. More specifically, recent progress has shown that using inorganic nanomaterials as fillers in polymer/inorganic composites has tremendous application potential in automotive, aerospace, construction and electronics industries. If properly incorporated into a polymeric matrix, conductive nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene can be assembled into a three-dimensional electrical network. Furthermore, these highly intricate networks can be utilized as an internal sensory mechanism capable of detecting information such as material deformation and various forms of damage. Fundamental investigation into the mechanical and electrical properties of nanomaterial-based polymer composites when subjected to loading is paramount before they can be incorporated into high performance applications. For this purpose, a comprehensive study was conducted to understand the electro-mechanical behavior of both CNT-based and graphene-based composites under static and dynamic loading conditions. Moreover, novel strategies were developed to produce designer graphene-based composites that possess tailored transport and mechanical properties. A series of dynamic compressive experiments were performed to experimentally investigate the electrical response of multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) reinforced epoxy nanocomposites subjected to split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) loading. Low-resistance CNT/epoxy specimens were fabricated using a combination of shear mixing and ultrasonication. Utilizing the carbon nanotube network within, the electrical resistance of the nanocomposites was monitored using a high-resolution four-point probe method during each compressive loading event. In addition, real-time deformation images were captured using high-speed photography. The percent change in resistance was correlated to both strain and real-time damage. The results were then compared to previous work conducted by the authors (quasi-static and drop-weight impact) in order to elucidate the strain rate sensitivity on the electrical behavior of the material. In addition, the percent change in conductivity was determined using a Taylor expansion model to investigate the electrical response based upon both dimensional change as well as resistivity change during mechanical loading within the elastic regime. Experimental findings indicate that the electrical resistance is a function of both the strain and deformation mechanisms induced by the loading. The bulk electrical resistance of the nanocomposites exhibited an overall decrease of 40 - 65 % for quasi-static and drop-weight experiments and 65 - 85 % for SHPB experiments. An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the electromechanical response of graphene reinforced polystyrene composites under static and dynamic loading. Graphene-polystyrene composites were fabricated using a solution mixing approach followed by hot-pressing. Absolute resistance values were measured with a high-resolution four-point probe method for both quasi-static and dynamic loading. A modified split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar apparatus, capable of simultaneous mechanical and electrical characterization, was developed and implemented to investigate the dynamic electro-mechanical response of the composites. In addition to measuring the change in electrical resistance as well as the dynamic constitutive behavior, real-time surface damage and global deformation was captured using high-speed photography. The real-time damage was correlated to both stress-strain and percent change in resistance profiles. The experimental findings indicate that the bulk electrical resistance of the composite increased significantly due to the brittle nature of the polystyrene matrix and the presence of relative agglomerations of graphene platelets which resulted in micro-crack formations. A novel capillary-driven particle-level templating technique along with hot melt pressing was developed and utilized to disperse few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes within a polystyrene matrix to enhance the electrical conductivity of the polymer. The conducting pathways provided by the graphene located at the particle surfaces through contact of the bounding surfaces allow percolation at a loading of less than 0. 01 % by volume. This method of distributing graphene within a matrix overcomes the need to disperse the sheet-like conducting fillers isotropically within the polymer, and can be scaled up easily. The novel capillary-driven particle-level templating technique was then extended to allow for distribution of conductive sheet-like particles, such as graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) into specially constructed architectures throughout a polystyrene matrix to form multi-functional composites with tailored electro-mechanical properties. By precisely controlling the temperature and pressure during a melt compression process, highly conductive segregated composites were formed using very low loadings of graphene particles. Since the graphene flakes form a honeycomb percolating network along the boundaries between the polymer matrix particles, the composites show very high electrical conductivity but poor mechanical strength. To improve the mechanical properties, a new processing technique was developed that uses <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> through fixed angles to gradually evolve the honeycomb graphene network into a concentric band structure over the dimensions of the sample. An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the effect of GNP loading as well as the <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> angle on the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the composites. The experimental results show that both the electrical and mechanical properties of the composites are significantly altered using this very simple technique, which allows rational co-optimization of competing mechanical and electrical performance as appropriate for a given target application. Flexible multi-functional composites with tailored electro-mechanical properties were produced using a modified capillary-driven particle-level templating technique. A fixed-angle <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> technique was utilized during the melt compression process to distribute GNPs into specially constructed architectures throughout a styrenebutadiene matrix. An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the effect of GNP loading as well as <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> angle on the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the composites.

40|$|Under extreme {{conditions}} like those encountered during earthquake slip, frictional melt {{is likely to}} occur. It has been observed on ancient faults that the melt is mostly extruded toward local extensional jogs or lateral tension cracks. In the case of laboratory experiments with a <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> apparatus, melt is extruded from the sample borders. When this happens, a thin and irregular melt layer is formed whereby the normal load is still in part supported by contact asperities under an incipient yield condition (as in dry friction models), but also, in the interstices between asperities, by {{the pressure of the}} viscous fluid wetting the interface. In addition, roughness of the surface is dynamically reshaped by the melting process of an inhomogeneous material (polymineralic rock). In particular, we argue that the roughness of the melting surface decreases with melting rate and temperature gradient perpendicular to the fault. Taking into account the above conditions, we obtain an expression for the average melt layer thickness and viscous pressure that may be used in estimates of friction in the presence of melt. We argue that the ratio of melt thickness to roughness depends on sliding velocity; such a ratio may be used as a gauge of slip-rate during fossil earthquakes on faults bearing pseudotachylite (solidified melt). Finally, we derive an improved analytical solution for friction in the presence of melt including the effect of roughness evolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite {{the fact}} that phyllosilicates are {{ubiquitous}} in mature fault and shear zones, {{little is known about}} the strength of phyllosilicate-bearing fault rocks under brittle-ductile transitional conditions where cataclasis and solution-transfer processes are active. In this study we explored steady-state strength be aviour of a simulated fault rock, consisting of muscovite and halite, using brine as pore fluid. Samples were deformed in a <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> apparatus under conditions where cataclasis and solution transfer areknown to dominate the deformation behaviour of the halite. It was found that the steady-state strength of these mixtures is dependent on normal stress and sliding velocity. At low velocities ( 1 fxm s-]), velocity-weakening frictional behaviour occurs along with the development of a structureless cata-clastic microstructure. Revision of previous models for the low-velocity behaviour results in a physically realistic description that fits our data well. This is extended to include the possibility of plastic flow in the phyllosilicates and applied to predict steady-state strength profiles for continental f ult zones containing foliated quartz-mica f ult rocks. The results predict a significant reduction of strength at mid-crustal depths and may have important implications for crustal dynamics and seismogenesis. Classical models for the steady-state strength of the crust consist of a two-mechanism brittle-ductile strength profile, based on Byerlee's law plus a dislocation creep law for quartz (e. g...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the relation between the}} bulk plastic compression behavior and the evolution of grain size distribution (GSD) due to grain crushing under high-pressure compression and shear, we performed three types of loading experiments; single grain crushing (SGC) test, one-dimensional compression (ODC) test and <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> (RS) tests. The materials used are an angular mountain silica sand and a round river silica sand. The major findings are summarized as follows: (1) The SGC tests reveal that the Weibull model is successfully applied with the modulus m= 2 for single grain crushing stress. (2) In the ODC tests, the relation between the applied pressure, p, and the resulting porosity, n, fits better on a bi-linear model in a log n - log p plot than in the classical e-log p plot, where e is the void ratio. (3) Both in the ODC and the RS tests, the GSD converges into a power-law (fractal) distribution with the exponent (fractal dimension) of about - 2. 5, which is close to the one for Apollonian sphere packing, - 2. 47 (Borkovec et al., 1994). (4) The proposed recursive pore filling model successfully describes the log n - log p relation in the ODC test and log n - log relation, where is the shear strain, in the RS test in a consistent manner.

40|$|Issue: Used rubber articles, {{especially}} tires, require {{size reduction}} {{for use in}} recycled products. This is commonly done using a process called shredding. This best practice will review the major issues concerning shredding of tires. Best Practice: A paper, # 82, presented by Mr. Charles Astafan at the ACS Rubber Division Meeting in Cleveland, Ohio in October 1995, presented an excellent overview of tire shredding.

40|$|Lava dome eruptions {{subjected}} to high extrusion rates commonly evolve from endogenous to exogenous growth and limits to their structural stability hold catastrophic potential as explosive eruption triggers. In the conduit, strain localisation in magma, accompanied by seismogenic failure, marks {{the onset of}} brittle magma ascent dynamics. The rock record of exogenous dome structures preserves vestiges of cataclastic processes and thermal anomalies, key to unravelling subsurface processes. Here, a combined structural, thermal and magnetic investigation of a shear band crosscutting a large block erupted in 2010 at Soufrière Hills volcano (SHV) reveals evidence of faulting and frictional melting within the magmatic column. The mineralogy of this pseudotachylyte vein offers confirmation of complete recrystallisation, altering the structure, porosity and permeability of the material, and the magnetic signature typifies local electric currents in faults. Such melting events {{may be linked to}} the step-wise extrusion of magma accompanied by repetitive long-period (LP) drumbeat seismicity at SHV. Frictional melting of Soufrière Hills andesite in a high velocity <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> apparatus highlights the small slip distances (< 15 cm) thought to be required to bring 800 °C magma to melting point at upper conduit stress conditions (10 MPa).

40|$|The {{determination}} of rock friction at seismic slip rates (about 1 [*]m[*]s− 1) is {{of paramount importance}} in earthquake mechanics, as fault friction controls the stress drop, the mechanical work and the frictional heat generated during slip. Given the difficulty in determining friction by seismological methods, elucidating constraints are derived from experimental studies. Here we review a large set of published and unpublished experiments (300) performed in <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> apparatus at slip rates of 0. 1 – 2. 6 [*]m[*]s− 1. The experiments indicate a significant decrease in friction (of up to one order of magnitude), which we term fault lubrication, both for cohesive (silicate-built, quartz-built and carbonate-built) rocks and non-cohesive rocks (clay-rich, anhydrite, gypsum and dolomite gouges) typical of crustal seismogenic sources. The available mechanical work and the associated temperature rise in the slipping zone trigger a number of physicochemical processes (gelification, decarbonation and dehydration reactions, melting and so on) whose products are responsible for fault lubrication. The similarity between (1) experimental and natural fault products and (2) mechanical work measures resulting from these laboratory experiments and seismological estimates suggests that it is reasonable to extrapolate experimental data to conditions typical of earthquake nucleation depths (7 – 15 [*]km). It seems that faults are lubricated during earthquakes, irrespective of the fault rock composition and of the specific weakening mechanism involved. ...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{strength}} (tau_f) of faults during coseismic slip {{is a major}} {{unknown in}} earthquake mechanics, though it has crucial influence on rupture properties, dynamic stress drop, radiated energy and heat produced during slip. In order to provide constraints on tau_f, High-Velocity Rock Friction Experiments (HVRFE) are conducted on natural rocks with <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> apparatuses, reproducing slip (several meters) and slip rate (0. 1 – 3 m s- 1) typical of large earthquakes. Among the various weakening mechanisms possibly activated during seismic slip, we focus on melt lubrication. Solidified, friction-induced melts (pseudotachylytes) decorate some exhumed seismic faults, showing that melt can occur on natural faults, though its frequency is still a matter of debate. In the presence of melt, tau_f undergoes an initial strengthening stage, followed by a dramatic weakening stage (thermal runaway). Field estimates based on pseudotachylyte thickness and experimental measures of tau_f suggest large stress drops once thermal runaway is achieved. These estimates of tau_f are compatible with large dynamic stress drops and high radiation efficiency, as observed for some earthquakes. Moreover, the threshold for the onset of thermal runaway might explain differences between the mechanics of small (M < 4) and large earthquakes. A simple mathematical model coupling melting, extrusion and thermal diffusion reproduces some observed experimental features such as {{the duration of the}} weakening stage and the convergence to a steady-state...|$|R
