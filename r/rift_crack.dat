60|$|He {{turned around}} to find the boy had disappeared. Moreover, the passage had disappeared.

5000|$|... 1.1 {{billion years}} ago the Midcontinent <b>Rift</b> System <b>cracked</b> the Thomson Formation, {{creating}} southwest-to-northeast trending fractures. Volcanic eruptions sent magma through these gaps, forming the distinctive flood basalts of Minnesota's North Shore. [...] Magma remaining in the underground fractures cooled more slowly into gabbro. [...] Several of these dikes are exposed around the swinging bridge and also just outside the park where Highway 210 crosses the river below the Thomson Dam. They are nearly {{the same color as}} the Thomson slate, but can be distinguished by their horizontal columnar joints and lack of slaty cleavage.|$|R
5000|$|A {{series of}} {{satellite}} images from 2002 through 2009 illustrate that the terminus of the glacier has advanced towards the ocean, however, several lateral rifts have developed also. The distance of this <b>rifts</b> or <b>cracks</b> {{back from the}} terminus has diminished for this time period also and {{may serve as a}} precursor to natural ice calving from Petermann Glacier. A large chunk estimated to be 100 sq mi calved off the glacier in August, 2010. The Danish Meteorological Institutes maintains an archive of imagery of Petermann Glacier and adjacent coastal areas of Greenland [...] from both European and US satellites and sensors such as Envisat, MODIS, and AVHRR.|$|R
25|$|The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province (sometimes {{called the}} Stikine Volcanic Belt) {{is the most}} active {{volcanic}} region in Canada, containing more than 100 volcanoes. Several eruptions {{are known to have}} occurred within this region in the past 400 years and contains Canada's largest volcanoes. It formed as a result of faulting, <b>cracking,</b> <b>rifting</b> and the interaction between the Pacific and the North American plates.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnimation of topological transformations, such as fractures, cracks, tears, {{crumbles}} or fragmentations, is a {{new challenge}} in Computer Graphics and Animation. We propose {{a new way to}} model and animate topological changes, allowing the programmer to design any type of topological changes and animation mapping. This model is based on organizing the complex modeling activity into three clearly defined simpler sub-activities: 1) point-based animation, which enables a wide variety of possible temporal phenomena; 2) topological-based modeling, which makes it possible to manage a wide variety of shapeindependent topologies and topological transformations; 3) free, non predetermined, association between both, and 4) final output of an animated geometrical model exhibiting any complex behavior. We experimented the proposed method by modeling tearing effects on deformable garments, on <b>rifts</b> and <b>crack</b> effects on 3 D objects, and finally by modeling imaginary and paradoxical topological transformations associated with realistic Physics-based animation. Besides improving the consistency and the robustness of the modeling process of such complex phenomena, our aim is also to offer a user-centered programming environment to the Computer Graphics and Animation programmers and designers, to enlarge their modeling and experimentation abilities, and to stimulate their creativity...|$|R
60|$|To their {{disappointment}} {{there was}} within this mountain no regular flight of steps {{by means of}} which they could mount to the earth's surface. A sort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way, and they found the floor of it both rough and steep. Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrow gallery where the buggy could not pass. This delayed and bothered them for a while, {{because they did not}} wish to leave the buggy behind them. It carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there were good roads, and since it had accompanied them so far in their travels they felt it their duty to preserve it. So Zeb and the Wizard set to work and took off the wheels and the top, and then they put the buggy edgewise, so it would take up the smallest space. In this position they managed, with the aid of the patient cab-horse, to drag the vehicle through the narrow part of the passage. It was not a great distance, fortunately, and when the path grew broader they put the buggy together again and proceeded more comfortably. But the road {{was nothing more than a}} series of <b>rifts</b> or <b>cracks</b> in the mountain, and it went zig-zag in every direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled as to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when they had started, hours before.|$|R
25|$|Western Canada {{has many}} volcanoes and {{is part of}} the Pacific Ring of Fire, a system of volcanoes found around the margins of the Pacific Ocean. There are over 200 young {{volcanic}} centres that stretch northward from the Cascade Range to Yukon. They are grouped into five volcanic belts with different volcano types and tectonic settings. The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province was formed by faulting, <b>cracking,</b> <b>rifting,</b> and the interaction between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt was formed by subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate beneath the North American Plate. The Anahim Volcanic Belt was formed {{as a result of the}} North American Plate sliding westward over the Anahim hotspot. The Chilcotin Group is believed to have formed as a result of back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone. The Wrangell Volcanic Field formed as a result of subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate at the easternmost end of the Aleutian Trench.|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} rift {{propagation}} which treats the <b>rift</b> as a <b>crack</b> in an elastic plate which is filled from beneath by upwelling viscous asthenosphere as it lengthens and opens. Growth of the crack {{is driven by}} either remotely applied forces or the pressure of buoyant asthenosphere in the crack and is resisted by viscous stresses associated with filling the crack. The model predicts a time for a rift to form which depends primarily on the driving stress and asthenosphere viscosity. For a driving stress {{on the order of}} 10 MPa, as expected from the topography of rifted swells, the development of rifts over times of a few Myr requires an asthenosphere viscosity of 10 to the 16 th Pa s (10 to the 17 th poise). This viscosity, which is several orders of magnitude less than values determined by postglacial rebound and at least one order of magnitude less than that inferred for spreading center propagation, may reflect a high temperature or large amount of partial melting in the mantle beneath a rifted swell...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{represents}} {{a summary of}} the state of our knowledge concerning the chief physical characteristics of Mars as deduced from existing observational and theoretical evidence. Two main geological provinces are distinguished on Mars: areas of rough terrain and dense cratering, and smooth areas comparable to lunar maria. A thermal model for the Martian poles which takes into account convective transport would indicate that the CO 2 frost over the north pole is not permanent, lasting about 420 days with the water frost lasting the remaining 267 days of the Martian year. The meandering appearance of Martian <b>rift</b> valleys are <b>cracks</b> probably produced, as also in the case of lunar rilles, by stresses, perhaps in solidifying lava of impact origin, and not by erosional river beds. Data indicate a strong absorption in the thin Martian atmosphere. The atmospheric blue and violet cap around a Martian pole in winter is interpreted as a 'blue clearing' of the atmosphere increasing transparency so that surface detail of higher albedo shines through in the blue...|$|R
6000|$|Somewhere about 1450, though {{later in}} some parts of Europe by a hundred years or so, and in some earlier, men {{attained}} to personality in great numbers, [...] "Unity of Being," [...] and became like a [...] "perfectly proportioned human body," [...] and as men so fashioned held places of power, their nations had it too, prince and ploughman sharing that thought and feeling. What afterwards showed for <b>rifts</b> and <b>cracks</b> were there already, but imperious impulse held all together. Then the scattering came, the seeding of the poppy, bursting of pea-pod, and for a time personality seemed but the stronger for it. Shakespeare's people make all things serve their passion, and that passion is for the moment the whole energy of their being--birds, beasts, men, women, landscape, society, are but symbols and metaphors, nothing is studied in itself, the mind is a dark well, no surface, depth only. The men that Titian painted, the men that Jongsen painted, even the men of Van Dyck, seemed at moments like great hawks at rest. In the Dublin National Gallery there hung, perhaps there still hangs, upon the same wall, a portrait of some Venetian gentleman by Strozzi, and Mr. Sargent's painting of President Wilson. Whatever thought broods in the dark eyes of that Venetian gentleman, has drawn its life from his whole body; it feeds upon it as the flame feeds upon the candle--and should that thought be changed, his pose would change, his very cloak would rustle for his whole body thinks. President Wilson lives only in the eyes, which are steady and intent; the flesh about the mouth is dead, and the hands are dead, and the clothes suggest no movement of his body, nor any movement but that of the valet, who has brushed and folded in mechanical routine. There, all was an energy flowing outward from the nature itself; here, all is the anxious study and slight deflection of external force; there man's mind and body were predominantly subjective; here all is objective, using those words not as philosophy uses them, but as we use them in conversation.|$|R
