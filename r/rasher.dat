Assuming that Bouncer has been using the room in his absence, he takes the bacon off the gridiron, replaces it with a mutton chop, and heads off to his dressing room to retrieve his breakfast utensils.|$|E
25|$|King Stephen was {{extremely}} wealthy, well-mannered, modest and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable of firm action. His personal qualities as a military leader focused on his skill in personal combat, his capabilities in siege warfare and a remarkable ability to move military forces quickly over relatively long distances. Rumours of his father's cowardice during the First Crusade, however, continued to circulate, {{and a desire to}} avoid the same reputation may have influenced some of Stephen's <b>rasher</b> military actions. Stephen drew heavily on his wife, Queen Matilda, during the conflict, both for leading negotiations and maintaining his cause and army while imprisoned in 1141; Matilda led the royal household during this period in partnership with Stephen's mercenary leader William of Ypres.|$|E

40|$|Immunofluorescence {{studies have}} been carried out on <b>rashes</b> from 36 {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis receiving gold therapy. 24 of the <b>rashes</b> were clinically attributed to gold and 12 were diagnosed as coincidental <b>rashes.</b> IgE was found in 6 of the gold <b>rashes</b> and in 4 of the coincidental <b>rashes.</b> Immunofluorescence changes of immune complex vasculitis, lichen planus, or pemphigoid were found in 9 gold <b>rashes</b> while 2 coincidental <b>rashes</b> showed vascular fluorescence for immunoglobulins but nor for complement. Two definite gold <b>rashes</b> showing no changes on immunofluorescence showed perivascular infiltration with lymphocytes on light microscopy.

500|$|An {{anonymous}} humorous piece {{appeared in}} Joseph Addison's Spectator in 1714 purporting {{to explain the}} rarity of the flitch being awarded {{in terms of the}} poor quality of the applicants.

[...] Another couple failed when the husband, who had only reluctantly attended, had his ears boxed by his wife during the questioning. [...] A couple who applied after only their honeymoon had finished passed the questioning but since insufficient time had elapsed were awarded just one <b>rasher.</b> [...] One of only two couples to be successful in the first century of the tradition was a ship's captain and his wife who had not actually seen one another for over a year since their marriage.|$|E
