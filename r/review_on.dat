5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a <b>review</b> <b>on</b> grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E

5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial <b>review.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|Otranto {{had made}} two round-trips to Australia by January 1910, {{and then made}} a 17-day cruise in the Mediterranean before {{resuming}} her London–Australia runs into early 1911. That year, the company was awarded a contract to carry mail and she was redesignated as RMS Otranto, the RMS standing for Royal Mail Ship. She was present at King George V's Coronation Naval <b>Review</b> <b>on</b> 26 June and made several voyages to the Norwegian fjords before mid-September {{when she returned to}} the Australia run, on which she remained until war was declared on Germany on 4 August 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial <b>review.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E

5|$|The {{test for}} {{judicial}} <b>review</b> <b>on</b> matters not {{relating to the}} ISA remains the objective test. In Kamal Jit Singh v.

Rather, the Minister must be objectively satisfied that the person was associated with criminal activities.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet and Hercules became the flagship of the division. The 2nd Division was renamed the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The sisters participated in the Parliamentary Naval <b>Review</b> <b>on</b> 9 July at Spithead. Around the end of the year, Colossus was transferred to the 1st BS. Hercules became a private ship in early 1913 and joined her sister in the 1st BS two months later.|$|E

5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} <b>review</b> <b>on</b> 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Bohr and Wheeler {{set to work}} {{applying}} the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on fission. Their first paper appeared in Physical <b>Review</b> <b>on</b> September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|By 1908, Piemonte {{had been}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet, which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats. In August that year, Piemonte participated in the annual summer maneuvers of the Italian fleet. She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, {{and the fact that}} the relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies was not lost on analysts in Vienna. The Maneuvers concluded with a fleet <b>review</b> <b>on</b> 18 October. Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.|$|E

5|$|Colossus, {{named after}} the Colossus of Rhodes, was the fifth ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy (RN). The ship was ordered on 1 June 1909 and laid down at Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering at their {{shipyard}} in Greenock on 8 July. She was launched on 9 April 1910 and completed in July 1911 at the cost of £1,672,102, including her armament. The ship began trials on 28 February that lasted until July. Colossus commissioned at Devonport on 8 August and was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet. This was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval <b>Review</b> <b>on</b> 9 July at Spithead and became the temporary flagship of the squadron while her sister ship, , was being refitted in November–December.

5|$|Delaware {{remained}} at York River until 12 November 1918, {{the day after}} the Armistice with Germany was signed, effectively ending World War I.

5|$|During {{her return}} from Korea, Sydney ferried Spitfires and Vampires between several British bases in Southeast Asia.

The carrier visited Manus Island, was present {{off the coast}} of the Montebello Islands for the first British atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, on 3 October, and arrived back in her namesake city in November. On 25 March 1953, Sydney departed for England with representatives from each of the three branches of the Australian and New Zealand militaries for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The carrier and her aircraft participated in the Coronation Fleet <b>Review</b> <b>on</b> 15 June, and visited Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, Panama, Hawaii, and New Zealand on the return voyage, before reaching Sydney on 15 August. The carrier's 10,000th deck landing occurred during this voyage: a Firefly completed the landing on 17 July, while Sydney was en route to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
