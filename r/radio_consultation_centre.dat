In this form, the institution operated until 1917, when it became an independent entity called “Kropla Mleka” Society in Łódź. Its goal was to provide hygienic and medical care for babies and children from poor families of workers. The institution distributed cow milk, which was examined bacteriologically, pasteurized, and prepared in proportions suitable for children; however, most of all, physicians in “Kropla Mleka” encouraged mothers to breast-feed their babies. In each distribution centre, there was a clinic <b>consultation</b> <b>centre</b> where medical help was provided to ill children. “Kropla Mleka” in Łódź was the first and 56 Sprawozdanie „Kropli Mleka”… [za 1916], s. 8. 57 Już od 1919 r., w ramach działalności Polsko-Amerykańskiego Komitetu Pomocy Dzieciom, instruktorki Amerykańskiego Czerwonego Krzyża organizowały w Polsce Stacje Opieki nad Matką i Dzieckiem, nadając tym placówkom przede wszystkim charakter profilaktyczny.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] report {{is based on an}} analysis of 6411 consultations processed by the Tygerberg Pharmacology and Toxicology <b>Consultation</b> <b>Centre.</b> Seventy-five per cent of the consultations were of a toxicological nature: 47 % related to non-drug chemicals, 37 % to drugs and 16 % to plants and animals. Pesticides utilised in the home environment featured most prominently in the non-drug chemical group, while queries about paracetamol overdose topped the list in the drug group. The most frequent queries in the biological category concerned potentially poisonous plants. Twenty-five per cent of the consultations related to pharmacotherapeutics. Most potentially toxic exposures to non-drug chemicals occurred in the household setting. Contrary to popular belief, few acute pesticide poisonings were encountered as a result of exposures during farming activities. Another important finding was that there is a frustrating lack of reliable and readily available information in respect of potentially toxic ingredients contained in household and industrial preparations. The large number of household exposures highlights the need for education in the safe storage and usage of non-drug chemicals. Legislation on the inclusion of basic toxicological information and warnings on labels of household and industrial non-drug chemical products should be considered. In addition, the Government should take responsibility for centralising information on all potentially toxic non-drug chemicals and make this information available to poison centres at all times. It is also imperative that more attention be given to the training of health care professionals in applied pharmacokinetics and toxicology. Publisher’s versio...|$|R

Technology and Systems Contemporary {{with the development}} of fast electronic communication lines (Integrated digital network services (ISDN), broad band connections, and fibre optics, as well as the digital imaging technology (digital camera), telecommunication in tissue - based diagnosis (telepathology) has matured. Open access (internet) and server - based communication have induced the development of specific medical information platforms, such as iPATH, UICC-TPCC (telepathology <b>consultation</b> <b>centre</b> of the Union International against Cancer), or the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) teleconsultation system. They have been closed, and are subject to be replaced by specific open access forums (Medical Electronic Expert Communication System (MECES) with embedded virtual slide (VS) technology). MECES uses php language, data base driven mySqL architecture, X/L-AMPP infrastructure, and browser friendly W 3 C conform standards. Experiences The server - based medical communication systems (AFIP, iPATH, UICC-TPCC) have been reported to be a useful and easy to handle tool for expert consultation. Correct sampling and evaluation of transmitted still images by experts reported revealed no or only minor differences to the original images and good practice of the involved experts. β tests with the new generation medical expert consultation systems (MECES) revealed superior results in terms of performance, still image viewing, and system handling, especially as this is closely related to the use of so - called social forums (facebook, youtube, etc.). Benefits and Expectations In addition to the acknowledged advantages of the former established systems (assistance of pathologists working in developing countries, diagnosis confirmation, international information exchange, etc.), the new generation offers additional benefits such as acoustic information transfer, assistance in image screening, VS technology, and teaching in diagnostic sampling, judgement, and verification. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective The French {{national}} {{occupational disease}} surveillance and prevention network (RNV 3 P) includes the 30 occupational disease <b>consultation</b> <b>centres</b> in university hospitals to which patients are referred for potentially work-related diseases, and an occupational health service. The {{aim of this}} work is to demonstrate the contribution of RNV 3 P to national health surveillance. Methods Data from consultations are recorded in standardised occupational health reports and coded using international or national classifications. Programmed health surveillance is carried out through annual follow-up of annual referrals to experts for pre-selected disease–exposure associations, as well as incidence estimations for the well characterised working population followed by the occupational health service. Hypotheses on new emerging diseases are generated using statistical methods employed in pharmacosurveillance and by modelling as an exposome to analyse multiple exposures. Results 58 777 occupational health reports were collected and analysed from 2001 to 2007. Referrals to the 30 university hospital centres increased significantly for asbestos-related diseases, mood disorders and adjustment disorders related to psychological and organisational demands, and for elbow and shoulder disorders related to manual handling. Referrals significantly decreased for asthma and for rhinitis related to exposure to organic dusts (vegetable or animal) or chemicals, except for cosmetics and cleaning products. Estimation of incidences by the occupational health services showed different patterns in different sectors of activity. The methods for detecting emerging diseases are presented and illustrated using the example of systemic sclerosis, identifying new exposures and new sectors of activity to be investigated. Conclusion The RNV 3 P collects data from two complementary samples: 30 university hospital centres (workers or former workers) and an occupational health service (current workers). This dual approach is useful for surveillance and for hypothesis generation on new emerging disease–exposure associations...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{use of the}} {{telephone}} to deliver health care advice has increased considerably in recent years. Little research {{has been carried out}} to explore the experience of patients who receive such advice and its acceptability. Objectives. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the expectations of patients, or third party callers, who had contacted a GP out-of-hours co-operative and their satisfaction with telephone advice received. Methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone 7 - 10 days after contact with one inner city GP co-operative. Results. A total of 47 telephone consultations were followed up with an interview. Of these, 23 (48. 9 %) callers had expected to be offered a home visit when they called. Reasons for wanting a home visit were either to do with the nature of the condition and its perceived severity, problems in being able to attend the primary care centre and the risks of travel, or because of problems in communicating over {{the telephone}}. Satisfaction with telephone <b>consultations</b> <b>centred</b> mostly on the doctor being able to provide reassurance and give adequate time to allay concerns. The most common reasons given for dissatisfaction were the caller feeling that the doctor could not make a correct diagnosis without having seen the patient, or the caller being made to feel that they were wasting the doctor's time. Many patients were anxious about their ability to describe symptoms over the telephone, or understand and follow the advice that they received. Conclusions. There appears to be a need for patients to be better informed about the service they can expect to receive from GP co-operatives.
