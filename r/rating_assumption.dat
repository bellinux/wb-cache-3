40|$|In {{performing}} a Discounted Cash Flow Analysis for an income-producing property, a traditional rule-of-thumb {{indicates that the}} going-out capitalization rate should be one-half to one {{percent higher than the}} going-in capitalization rate. So far, there has been no theoretical model or empirical evidence to support or to dispute this assertion. This paper develops a model to examine the determinants of the going-out capitalization rate, as well as the relationship between going-in and going-out capitalization rates in a complete market setting. The proposed model indicates that the rule-of-thumb can be challenged, and the selection of an appropriate going-out capitalization rate requires a careful examination of the changes in the assumed income-growth rates, changes in the assumed required rates of return, and changes in the assumed property-appreciation rates during and after the projected holding period.

Secondly, even if the constant failure <b>rate</b> <b>assumption</b> is applicable, the disparity may still exist in the presence of design and quality related problems in new systems.

In view of the importance of RGT in minimizing the disparity, this thesis provides a detailed application of the AMSAA Extended Reliability Growth Models to the reliability growth analysis of a combat system. It shows how program managers can analyze test data using commercial software to estimate the system demonstrated reliability and the increased in reliability due to delayed fixes...|$|R
