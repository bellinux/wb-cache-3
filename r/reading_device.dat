Two offers were available, combining a one-year subscription and a <b>reading</b> <b>device.</b> The offer included either a light (176g) <b>reading</b> <b>device</b> (adapted for Les Echos by Ganaxa) or the iRex iLiad.

Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the <b>reading</b> <b>device</b> cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending {{on the quality of the}} discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions. This failure is known as disc rot, for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.|$|E

Due to some Kindle devices being limited to use as <b>reading</b> <b>device</b> and the hassle of reselling Kindles, some people choose to donate their Kindle to schools, developing countries, literacy organizations, or charities. [...] "The Kindle Classroom Project" [...] promotes reading by distributing donated Kindles to schools in need. Worldreader and 'Develop Africa' ships donated e-readers to schools in developing countries in Africa for educational use. 'Project Hart', a non-profit created in the legacy of Michael S. Hart, will take donations of e-readers that can be refurbished to give to people in need.|$|E

2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} brought some new {{technological}} {{changes to the}} publishing industry. These changes include e-books, print on demand, and accessible publishing. E-books have been quickly growing in availability in major publishing markets such as the USA and the UK since 2005. Google, Amazon.com, and Sony have been leaders in working with publishers and libraries to digitize books. As of early 2011, Amazon's Kindle <b>reading</b> <b>device</b> is a significant force in the market, along with the Apple iPad and the Nook from Barnes & Noble.

40|$|E-book <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> {{open new}} {{possibilities}} {{in the field}} of reading. More activities than just reading a book can be performed with a single electronic device. For a long time, electronic <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> have not been favored because their active LCD displays used to have a relatively low contrast. The new generation of electronic <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> differs from earlier ones {{in the nature of the}} display: active LCD displays have been replaced with displays based on e-ink technology, which has display properties closer to that of printed paper. Moreover, e-ink technology has higher power efficiency, thereby increasing battery life and reducing weight. At first sight, the display looks similar to paper print, but the question remains whether the reading behavior also is equal to that of reading a printed book. In the present study, we analyzed and compared reading behavior on e-reader displays and on printed paper. The results suggest that the reading behavior on e-readers is indeed very similar to the reading behavior on print. Participants shared similar proportions of regressive saccades while reading on e-readers and print. Significant differences in fixation duration suggest that e-readers, in some situations, may even provide better legibility...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} a selection of second-generation ebook readers {{in order to determine}} which devices deliver the best experience for the user, in terms of functionality and overall experience. The technical and physical elements of the devices are also compared. This paper starts with a brief discussion of the current ebook marketplace, and previous studies that evaluate ebook readers. It then reports on a study in which 33 Master's students from an Information and Library Studies course were each given an ebook reader and asked to complete a task designed to engage them with the device. The participants then evaluated the devices by completing a questionnaire. A discussion {{of the results of the}} study and implications for the development of ebook <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> follows. Although some issues, specifically size, weight, and screen quality, have been addressed in the new generation of ebook readers, some residual dissatisfaction remains. The participants in the study preferred to use devices with which they were familiar. This study provides guidance on the usability of ebook readers and provides insights into the future of ebook <b>reading</b> <b>devices.</b> It will be of benefit to information professionals seeking to utilise ebook <b>reading</b> <b>devices,</b> and to designers of ebook readers...|$|R

40|$|Although {{reading is}} the main {{function}} of electronic <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> (e-readers), previous studies demonstrated that a critical factor for perceived legibility is the usability of the device. If users have problems with the handling of a device, they will not like using the <b>device</b> for <b>reading.</b> Therefore, easy handling is a critical factor for a user’s reading experience. One important device feature {{seems to be a}} touch screen. A touch screen tends to be very intuitive and saves space as no keyboard or mouse is required, which also tends to make for easier hand-eye coordination than a mouse or keyboard.
