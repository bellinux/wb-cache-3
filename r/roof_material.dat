500|$|The larger north {{building}} was built without deep foundation trenches, but was nevertheless a solid, well-built flint and mortar construction. The building had [...] "substantial {{time and money}} spent on it" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the principal archaeologist. The flints were selected to decrease in size as the walls rose, and the internal corners were decorated with limestone blocks set as quoins. Seashells were recovered, with a distribution suggesting that they were once {{part of the fabric of}} the building as galleting (strengthening for the mortar). [...] There were entrances in the west and northeast walls, and some evidence that there were once windows in the northwest and south walls. The floor was compacted soil, and the original <b>roof</b> <b>material</b> is unknown, but the presence of a few glazed floor tiles and Flemish pantiles of a somewhat later date is consistent with a higher-status appearance. There was no internal wall at this date, but there may have been an external wooden extension to the southwest corner.|$|E

40|$|Cooling {{energy savings}} and {{improved}} thermal comfort in hot climates {{can be achieved}} using cool <b>roofing</b> <b>materials.</b> High solar reflectance and infrared emittance values {{reduce the amount of}} absorbed solar radiation and the surface temperature of a material exposed to sun radiation, consequently the heat transfer into the building is lowered. A reduction of the urban heat island effect, caused by the presence of high absorption surfaces and the lack of vegetation, may be obtained using cool <b>roofing</b> <b>materials.</b> Computer energy simulations have been used to assess the energy savings and temperature profiles consequent to the application of a cool <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> when applied to industrial premises in three Mediterranean cities: Genoa, Madrid and Cairo. In particular, the related influence on cooling energy demand and maximum temperature at the outside face of the roof are analyzed, varying the <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> and the insulation thickness. The results of this study showed that using a cool <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> in the Mediterranean area for industrial premises leads to significant sensible cooling energy savings, up to 42 %. Moreover, it was obtained that the maximum roof outside surface temperatures decrease of 40 ÷ 50 °C when cool <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> are applied...|$|R

50|$|The dark fibrous bark (known as doh in India) is {{manufactured}} into cordage. In Indonesia {{the black}} fibres surrounding the trunk, called ijuk fibres, {{are used as}} the organic <b>roof</b> <b>material</b> common in Indonesian vernacular architecture. According to the study on bas-reliefs of Javanese ancient temples such as Borobudur, this type of roof are known in ancient Java vernacular architecture. It can be found today in Balinese temple roof architecture and Minangkabau Rumah Gadang gonjong horn-like curved roof architecture, such as those found in Pagaruyung Palace. The ijuk fibres can also be made into rope, used in brooms, or used as filters to clear the water.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a series}} of tubes horizontal/ {{vertical}} hairpin type connected at ends (with 180° bends) or helical in construction. The radiant coil absorbs heat through radiation. They can be single pass or multi pass depending upon the process-side pressure drop allowed. The radiant coils and bends are housed in the radiant box. Radiant coil materials vary from carbon steel for low temperature services to high alloy steels for high temperature services. These are supported from the radiant side walls or hanging from the radiant <b>roof.</b> <b>Material</b> of these supports is generally high alloy steel. While designing the radiant coil, care is taken so that provision for expansion (in hot conditions) is kept.|$|E

50|$|Three {{years after}} the {{completion}} of the Dome, the integrity of its roof became an issue. During a Falcons pre-season game in August 1995, a severe rainstorm caused water to pool on the fabric, tearing part of the material, and causing a section of the roof to fall into the stadium. The storm was intense enough that the roof panels could be seen moving during the game, and the water and <b>roof</b> <b>material</b> later fell with enough force to smash seats in the upper decks and knock holes in concrete floors. The collapse occurred after fans left the stadium, and no one was injured during the incident. The roof was eventually repaired in a way that prevented similar incidents from occurring in the future.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of {{construction}} of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals, and hotels, many states and cities have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical analysis, {{in order to protect}} building occupants. With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment {{in order to determine the}} performance standard required for exterior building skin design. The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 dBA). The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: glazing (glass thickness, double pane design etc.), perforated metal (used internally or externally), [...] <b>roof</b> <b>material,</b> caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports, and mounting of through-the-wall air conditioners.|$|E
50|$|The Kingdome's roof {{had been}} {{problematic}} from the beginning. Leaks {{were discovered in}} the roof {{two months before the}} stadium opened, and several attempts at repairs made the situation worse and/or had to be undone. In 1993, the county decided to strip off the outer roof coating {{and replace it with a}} special coating. Sandblasting failed to strip the old <b>roof</b> <b>material</b> off, and the contractor changed its method to pressure washing. This pressure-washing resulted in water seepage through the roof, and on July 19, 1994, four 26 lb, waterlogged acoustic ceiling tiles fell into the seating area. The tiles fell while the Mariners were on the field preparing for a scheduled game against the Baltimore Orioles, a half-hour before the gates were to open for fans to enter the stadium. As a result, the Kingdome was closed.|$|E

5000|$|In some {{equatorial}} countries, thatch is {{the prevalent}} local material for roofs, and often walls. There are diverse building techniques {{from the ancient}} Hawaiian hale shelter made from the local ti leaves (Cordyline fruticosa), lauhala (Pandanus tectorius) [...] or pili grass (Heteropogon contortus).Palm leaves are also often used. For example, in Na Bure, Fiji, thatchers combine fan palm leave roofs with layered reed walls. Feathered palm leaf roofs are used in Dominica. Alang-alang (Imperata cylindrica) thatched roofs are used in Hawaii and Bali. In Southeast Asia, mangrove nipa palm leaves are used as thatched <b>roof</b> <b>material</b> known as attap dwelling. In Bali, Indonesia, the black fibres of Arenga pinnata called ijuk is also used as thatched roof materials, usually used in Balinese temple roof and meru towers.

5000|$|This {{is a kind}} of <b>roof</b> <b>material</b> used {{usually in}} {{mountain}} villages. The oak bark is over 20 years old. At first, the oak bark is peeled at the time of Chuseo (one of the 24 seasonal divisions, about August 23). Next it is put into water. After that, it is dried and a heavy stone is placed on it to flatten it. Bark made this way is commonly about 1.3 meters wide. If the air gets dry, the bark shrinks and obtains many holes. However, if it rains or its humidity is increased, holes get smaller and smaller. At last they disappear quickly. The stone between the joint is not to blow the bark. The life of the oak bark is so long that there is a saying, [...] "Giwa exists for ten thousand years, and the Oak Bark for one thousand years." ...|$|E
