40|$|Trimodal composites, {{consisting}} of ultrafine grains, coarse grains, and particles, {{are known to}} possess desirable combinations of physical and mechanical properties. In this paper, we report the fabrication of a sheet of trimodal material using roll bonding and annealing of an Al/Ti/Al laminate at 873 K for durations ranging from 6 h to 168 h. The Al/Ti/Al laminate was roll bonded from 625 μm (Al sheet thickness 300 μm, Ti foil thickness 25 μm) to 130 μm. The Ti layer was seen to break up and disperse in the aluminium matrix after rolling. It was found that when the annealing time was less than 12 h, there were <b>residual</b> <b>voids</b> at the interface between the TiAl 3 and Al layers, resulting in reduced ductility and strength of the composite sheet. When the annealing time was increased to 24 h, there were no <b>residual</b> <b>voids</b> and the laminate {{became a kind of}} trimodal material, {{consisting of}} a combination of coarse-grained Al, ultrafine-grained Ti and TiAl 3 particles. This kind of laminate shows the highest yield strength and good ductility. With a further increase in the annealing time to 168 h, no residual pure Ti was seen in the laminate and the TiAl 3 particles were found to be distributed in the Al matrix close to the laminate surface, leading to lower strength and ductility.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{of the effects of}} structural imperfections in MgB 2 superconducting wire has been conducted. As the sintering temperature becomes lower, the structural imperfections of the MgB 2 material are increased, as reflected by detailed X-ray refinement and the normal state resistivity. The crystalline imperfections, caused by lattice disorder, directly affect the impurity scattering between the π and σ bands of MgB 2, resulting in a larger upper critical field. In addition, low sintering temperature keeps the grain size small, which leads to a strong enhancement of pinning, and thereby, enhanced critical current density. Owing to both the impurity scattering and the grain boundary pinning, the critical current density, irreversibility field, and upper critical field are enhanced. <b>Residual</b> <b>voids</b> or porosities obviously remain in the MgB 2, however, even at low sintering temperature, and thus block current transport paths...|$|E
40|$|Silicone resin has {{recently}} attracted great attention as a high-power Light Emitting Diode (LED) encapsulant material {{due to its}} good thermal stability and optical properties. In general, the abrupt curing reaction of the silicone resin for the LED encapsulant during the curing process induces reduction in the mechanical and optical properties of the LED product due to the generation of <b>residual</b> <b>void</b> and moisture, birefringence, and residual stress in the final formation. In order to prevent such an abrupt curing reaction, the reduction of <b>residual</b> <b>void</b> and birefringence of the silicone resin was observed through experimentation by introducing the multi-step cure processes, while the residual stress was calculated by conducting finite element analysis that coupled the heat of cure reaction and cure shrinkage.

40|$|Aas~or: The opal mining {{areas of}} inland Australia have {{exposures}} {{in which a}} systematic association between ear-surface silcrete and one or more silicified horizons at depth is displayed. In the Stuart Creek opal field, the deepest horizons are opalite and glassy quartzites in which all primary sedimentary structures are conserved. Higher in the section, lenses and nodules of quartzite occur in bleached, unconsolidated sands. Near {{the top of the}} section, a nodular and columnar silcrcte displays numerous illuviation features. At the base of the section, the earliest phase of silicification is the pseudomorphic replacement of sedimentary clay minerals by opal. Subsequently, void linings of micro-laminated opal were formed, and fibrous silica was precipitated in residual cavities. In the middle part of the section, sedimentary clay minerals were replaced by microcrystalline quartz, while silicifieation of clay-free sands was achieved by overgrowth ofdetrital quartz grains. In both cases, <b>residual</b> <b>voids</b> were filled with chalcedony and euhedral quartz. In {{the upper part of the}} section, silicifieation produced microcrystalline quartz in the matrix of the host sediment and in titania-rich illuviation laminae at the base of voids and channels.

A previous study carried out in situ in the argillite formation of Tournemire (France) has suggested that oxic conditions could have lasted several years. In this study, a multiphase reactive transport model is performed with the code HYTEC to analyze the balance between the kinetics of pyrite oxidative dissolution, the kinetics of carbon steel corrosion and oxygen gas diffusion when carbon steel components are emplaced in the geological medium. Two cases were modeled: firstly, the observations made in situ have been reproduced, and the model established was then applied to a disposal cell for high-level waste (HLW) in an argillaceous formation, taking into account carbon steel components and excavated damaged zones (EDZ). In a closed system, modeling leads to a complete and fast consumption of oxygen in both cases. Modeling results are more consistent with the in situ test while considering <b>residual</b> <b>voids</b> between materials and/or a water unsaturated state allowing for oxygen gas diffusion (open conditions). Under similar open conditions and considering ventilation of the handling drifts, a redox contrast occurs between reducing conditions {{at the back of the}} disposal cell (with anoxic corrosion of steel and H 2 production) and oxidizing conditions at the front of the cell (with oxic corrosion of steel).

30|$|Evidently, {{based on}} these outcomes, mining {{disturbances}} resulting in novel/non-natural landform elements and rehabilitation practices incorporating exotic and/or novel assemblages of native species appear to have contributed to novel ecosystems, i.e. systems that are irreversibly different to any natural/pre-disturbance conditions {{both in terms of}} biotic and abiotic composition. In special cases where hybrid sites may bear some semblance of natural systems, genuine restoration could be achieved if further rehabilitation inputs are allocated commensurate to changing divergent landforms or mitigating exotic species. This can only be addressed if the coal mining industry shifts its basic rehabilitation expectations and associated practices, particularly in regards to recontouring spoils (Carroll and Tucker 2000) and filling pits, which happen to represent expensive and extensive ground-works. However, there is no apparent desire to change from a large-scale, low-cost production model (Mudd 2010). This model allows coal mines in the Bowen Basin to leave <b>residual</b> <b>voids</b> and these voids, in turn, contribute to steeper landforms that require ongoing maintenance. Risk aversion of regulators and increasing awareness of environmental liabilities mean that compelling evidence will be required to demonstrate that these post-mine landforms represent minimal liability to subsequent land users before formal relinquishment will be possible. One alternative to substantial spoil recontouring (predominantly levelling the newly mounded landscape) would be to rock armour slopes, but this has not been widely used in coal mines {{due to the lack of}} knowledge about rock resources and an absence of selective handling of material removed to access coal seams (George et al. 1986). The approach of restraining dispersive spoil with rock reinforced slopes, combined with the application of native species adapted to scree slopes or drought tolerant species from more arid areas (Ensol and Emmerton 2006; Shackelford et al. 2013) would provide alternative landscape and ecosystem scenarios that would be more stable in the longer term.|$|E
40|$|The present {{project is}} devoted to {{developing}} hydrogen permselective silica membranes supported on composite supports to achieve high flux and selectivity. The supports consist of a thin zeolite silicalite layer coated on {alpha}-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } tubes of mean pore size 1 {micro}m. The zeolite layer is grown by reaction in a suitable silicate solution at 95 C. After two or three reaction periods a layer of silicalite crystals about 20 {micro}m thick grows inside the pores of alumina. In addition to the zeolitic pores, this layer contains voids of a few nanometer diameter that remain between the crystals or between the crystals and the pore walls. The quality of the silicalite/alumina composites was evaluated by gas permeation measurements and by nitrogen adsorption and {{it was found that}} the <b>residual</b> <b>voids</b> were below 5 nm in diameter. Three techniques were investigated for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of the silica layer on the silicalite/alumina composite support. The first was TEOS pyrolysis at approximately one millibar partial pressure and 650 C. After 8 h reaction the fluxes of hydrogen and nitrogen at ambient temperature had declined by a factor of approximately 100 indicating sealing of defects and zeolitic pores alike. The second CVD technique investigated was SiCl{sub 4 } hydrolysis at 90 C. Deposition in this case was conducted in a series of cycles, each cycle comprising two half reactions, i. e. exposure to SiCl{sub 4 } followed by exposure to water vapor. The deposition was interrupted every five cycles to measure the permeation properties of the nascent membrane at 120 C. After a few cycles the membrane pores were sealed, but the silica layer was not thermally stable when the temperature was raised to 400 C.

40|$|Background: Reduction of tibial plateau {{fractures}} {{and maintain}} a level of well aligned congruent joint is key to a satisfactory clinical outcome and {{is important for the}} return to pre-trauma level of activity. Stable internal fixation support early mobility and weight bearing. The augmentation with bone graft substitute is often required to support the fixation to mantain reduction. For these reasons there has been development of novel bone graft substitutes for trauma applications and in particular synthetic materials based on calcium phosphates and/or apatite combined with calcium sulfates. Injectable bone substitutes can optimize the filling of irregular bone defects. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the potential of a novel injectable bone substitute CERAMENTTM|BONE VOID FILLER in supporting the initial reduction and preserving alignment of the joint surface until fracture healing. Methods: From June 2010 through May 2011 adult patients presenting with acute, closed and unstable tibial plateau fractures which required both grafting and internal fixation, were included in a prospective study with percutaneous or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) augmented with an injectable ceramic biphasic bone substitute CERAMENTTM|BONE VOID FILLER (BONESUPPORTTM, Lund, Sweden) to fill <b>residual</b> <b>voids.</b> Clinical follow up was performed at 1, 3, 9 and 12 months and any subsequent year; including radiographic analysis and Rasmussen system for knee functional grading. Results: Twenty four patients, balanced male-to-female, with a mean age of 47 years, were included and followed with an average of 44 months (range 41 – 52 months). Both Schatzker and Müller classifications were used and was type II or 41 -B 3 in 7 patients, type III or 41 -B 2 in 12 patients, type IV or 41 -C 1 in 2 patients and type VI or 41 -C 3 in 3 patients, respectively.

40|$|In {{composite}} processing, a compressible dry fiber preform is in {{many cases}} impregnated by a molten polymeric matrix. The impregnated part is sometimes used as produced, but most often it requires a reheating step before stamping, flow molding or even painting of the part. This latter step {{may lead to the}} release of locked-in stresses, a phenomenon often called lofting or deconsolidation. The aim of the present thesis is to analyze the mechanisms and provide tools for predicting the kinetics of consolidation and deconsolidation in order to produce cost-effective and sound composite materials. To achieve this, the two fundamental stages of composite processing, consolidation and deconsolidation, have been studied. The influence of both processing parameters and materials systems have been quantified. A Glass Mat reinforced Thermoplastic (GMT) was selected and characterized for the case study. The first part of this work concerns the consolidation stage, emphasizing the influence of processing parameters such as applied pressure or processing temperature on the final microstructure of the composite products. Experimental impregnation processes were carried out and were completed by parallel theoretical simulations. A model accounting for the saturated infiltration of compressible preform was used to predict the residual fiber content gradient in a part, and its influence on the mechanical properties. It was observed that a gradient of the reinforcement in a GMT part, if controlled by impregnation times, can improve the bending modulus by 50 %. Furthermore, a new infiltration model accounting for multi-phase flow in compressible preforms showing a dual-scale porosity was elaborated. The aim was {{to take into account the}} porosity by considering not only the solid and liquid phases, but also air as a third phase. The local fiber and void content can then be precisely predicted as a function of the infiltration time and position. The radial micro-impregnation of the fiber bundles was also taken into account by adding a sink term of micro-impregnation to the macro-impregnation. The predictions have shown that the time required to provide full micro-infiltration is about four times longer than the time to provide full macro-infiltration. Special care therefore has to be taken when infiltrating a dual-scale porosity system: <b>residual</b> <b>voids</b> may remain even if time to provide macro-infiltration is attained. Once the consolidation state of the part was well defined in terms of void content, fiber content profile and stress state, a study of the post-processing steps was carried out. To achieve this, model experiments of compression and unloading of a stack of mats embedded in a model matrix were carried out. This springback experiment enabled the unloading behavior of the fiber preform to be studied; for instance, the influence of the matrix viscosity on the kinetics of the process. Deconsolidation experiments were also carried out for GMT parts: the consolidated samples were reheated at processing temperatures for different times. Comparing these different experimental results with theory has shown that the deconsolidation phenomenon is mainly governed by the stress/strain behavior of the preform upon unloading. However, the kinetics of deconsolidation are also influenced by the void formation and growth that appear during reheating. Moreover, it was found that the springback effect of the preform leads to tensile forces in the matrix, which enhance void growth. A correlation between the elastic behavior of the fiber and the growth of air bubbles in the matrix was then demonstrated. Since it was observed that the mechanical behavior of the preform plays a major role in the deconsolidation phenomenon, the study on the springback effect was completed by a comparison between two different glass fiber and polypropylene systems. The classic GMT studied previously was compared with a new type of commingled glass and polypropylene fibers. Compressive tests on both dry preforms, as well as consolidation and deconsolidation experiments showed that the commingled system presents a higher void content after deconsolidation than the classic GMT. A porosity of respectively 72 % and 55 % was measured. It was demonstrated that differences in glass fiber arrangement are at the origin of the result. Finally, the deconsolidation of a GMT part in the solid sate was investigated. The role of the matrix which often exhibits a viscoelastic behavior and which may lead to distorsion of the part, was emphasized. After, for instance, 3 months at 100 °C, the part showed no significant void content increase whereas, it was observed that thermal effects may affect the adhesion between the matrix and the fibers, thereby leading to decohesion of the part. This study demonstrated that a combination of numerical approach and experimental observations leads to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms governing consolidation and deconsolidation and then opens the path for an optimization of processing parameters and choice of materials...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of the two projects:"Deformations in winter {{compacted}} soils" and "Permeability changes in a fine-grained till due to freeze/thaw". The aim of the first project was to study whether it is possible to compact frozen soils, in road embankments etc., to a satisfying result as well as to identify the most important factors influencing the compaction result. Different types of soil (fine-grained till and sand) were compacted in the laboratory at the temperatures + 20, - 2 and - 10 °C using compaction cylinders of two different sizes (1 dm³). Frozen soil cubes, having a side-length of 5 to 100 mm, were manufactured at different water contents and compacted in frozen state. The tests show that the compaction result decreases with decreasing temperature and increasing water content. However, the influence of the size of the soil cubes was of minor importance and the influence of the testing temperature was significantly smaller than what has been reported in the literature. In addition, compression tests on frozen, compacted soil samples were carried out to measure the thaw settlement. A relation (a-value), based on the dry density of the frozen and unfrozen soil, was established from which it is possible to estimate the maximum compression taking place when the frozen soil thaws and is loaded. The aim of the second project was to investigate whether structural changes take place in a fine-grained till exposed to cyclic freezing and thawing. It was believed that freeze/thaw cycles could have a negative impact on fine-grained till, e. g. on its function as a hydraulic barrier. The permeability was chosen to be the key parameter to study whether the structure was affected of freezing and thawing or not. In addition, tests were directed to measure possible movements of small particles and stones due to freezing and thawing. In the laboratory, unfrozen soil was compacted to different void ratios into a rigid wall opermeameter and the permeability was measured. Thereafter, the sample was frozen and thawed a number of cycles. The samples were frozen one dimensionally in a closed pore water system and the permeability was measured in the thawed soil after a certain number of cycles. In addition, the particle movements were measured by granulometric tests and the stone movements by a specially developed X-ray technique. The investigations showed that the permeability in a fine-grained till is influenced by the freeze/thaw cycles. Typically, the permeability increased by 1 to 10 times in an initially dense till and decreased between 1 to 50 times in an initially loose till. The soil exhibited volume changes due to the freeze/thaw cycles and the volume typically decreased for an initially loose soil and increased for a dense soil. A <b>residual</b> <b>void</b> ratio was reached after 1 - 3 freeze/thaw cycles, independent of the state of the soil structure prior to freezing.

BoNT-A- related adverse events were also reported. ResultsA successful outcome was reported by 138 (79. 3 %) patients at 3 months.

Patients with a baseline postvoid residual (PVR) > 100 mL, had higher rates of acute urinary retention and need to strain to void. However, long-term success rates up to 24 months showed no significant differences between patients with different urodynamic parameters. ConclusionsExcept for patients with phasic DO, the baseline urodynamic parameters did not affect the treatment outcome of intravesical {{injection of}} 100 U BoNT-A for IDO. However, acute urinary retention and difficult urination occurred more often in patients with a baseline PVR of > 100 mL...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} Bixa Orellana (BO) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) presenting moderate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study. One thousand four hundred and seventy eight patients presenting moderate LUTS associated to BPH were interviewed, from whom we selected 136 to fulfill the criteria of inclusion and exclusion. Assignation was performed at random in blocks of four to receive B 0 at a dose of 250 mg 3 times a day or placebo (Pbo) for 12 months, 68 patients were assigned to each group. From the patients in the study we obtained data of demographic, epidemiologic, symptom score, uroflowmetry and post <b>void</b> <b>residual</b> urine variables. RESULTS: Basically both groups were compared clinically, demographically and biochemically. Throughout the study variations of symptom score, mean delta symptom score during each visit and the final average delta were similar for both groups (BO - 0. 79 ± 1. 87 and Pbo - 1. 07 ± 1. 49) (p = 0. 33). Similarly variations of Qmax mean, Qmax average delta and final average delta were similar (BO 0. 44 ± 1. 07 and Pbo 0. 47 ± 1. 32) (p = 0. 88). Variations of post <b>void</b> <b>residual</b> urine mean, post <b>void</b> <b>residual</b> urine average delta in each visit and the final average delta were similar for both groups (BO 4. 24 ± 11. 69 and Pbo 9. 01 ± 18. 66) (p = 0. 07). No {{differences were found in}} the answers of clinically significant improvement assessed with relative risk and risk differences, even though the proportion of adverse effects was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with BPH that present moderate LUTS did not show any benefit receiving BO when compared to placebo...|$|R
40|$|During the {{diffusion}} bond process, parts are heated to about one half the absolute melting point, pressed {{together at a}} stress below the macroscopic yield stress, and conditions maintained for a specified time. Bonding proceeds through three steps: local yielding of contact points upon initial application of stress; creep deformation on the bonding plane to yield discontinuous voids; and closure of voids by vacancy diffusion.

Four {{patients had}} persistently high residual urine volumes (> 200  ml). Two were commenced on distigmine bromide. Two required recatheterization {{for a further}} 24  h. One had a proven UTI treated with antibiotics. The other had extremely high residual volumes > 1, 000  ml, so had the tape loosened prior to discharge with subsequent normal residual volumes.

40|$|Objective. The {{object of}} this study is to {{systematically}} review the literature regarding the efficacy of sacral neuromodulation (InterStim®) for treatment of non-obstructive urinary retention. Methods. Eligible studies were selected through an electronic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus databases from January 1980 to August 2008. Two investigators independently reviewed all studies to assess methodological quality and inclusion criteria. Eligible studies evaluated sacral neuromodulation using implanted generators with permanent lead placement for treating non-obstructive urinary retention. The primary outcomes assessed were the change in pre- and postoperative post-void <b>residual</b> and <b>voided</b> volume. Exclusion criteria were neurogenic etiology (i. e. spinal cord injury) for urinary retention and non-English studies. The lead authors of all selected studies were contacted to identify ongoing or unpublished research, as was Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Data were extracted from the selected studies and analyzed using RevMan 5 (Review Manager, Cochrane Collaboration, 2008). The mean difference with a 95...|$|R
40|$|Background: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is {{the most}} common {{condition}} in ageing men, associated with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). Being a cause of significant morbidity in ageing man, various observational studies were conducted by the Council with a positive outcome. This protocol has been prepared to further ascertain the usefulness of constitutional/organ remedies in LUTS for men with BPH in a randomized control setting. Objectives: The primary objective is to compare the changes in IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) within the three groups enrolled for the study (Constitutional remedy/Constitutional + Organ remedy/Placebo). The secondary objectives are to compare the changes in Prostate volume, Post <b>Void</b> <b>Residual</b> Urine (PVRU), Uroflowmetry and in WHOQOL-BREF. Material and Methods: It is an open randomized placebo controlled clinical trial. The prescription of the constitutional remedies/organ remedies/placebo is done as per the randomization chart and the selection of these remedies is done as per the guidelines laid in the Organon of Medicine. The outcome measures including IPSS (monthly), prostate volume, post <b>void</b> <b>residual</b> urine, uroflowmetry and the WHOQOL-BREF are assessed at baseline, three and six months interval. Discussion: Results from this trial will help in constructing treatment strategy for BPH patients with lower urinary tract symptoms in improving their quality of life.

50|$|Alpha {{blockers}} {{have been}} studied when treating people with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). Terazosin has shown no reduction in voiding pressures {{with people who have}} suffered from spinal cord injuries, while Tamsulosin was given to patients with MS and resulted in improvement of post <b>void</b> <b>residual</b> measurements. However, it is not advised to use alpha blockers {{due to the lack of}} data supporting their success.Anti-spasmodic medications have also been tested on people with DSD. Baclofen does not have a great effect on people with DSD when taken orally because it is not permeable enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.|$|R
