40|$|In this dissertation, the {{machinability}} of elastomers is investigated. The {{main objective}} of the research {{is to determine the}} machining conditions for which an elastomer can be <b>machined</b> with a <b>smooth</b> surface finish. Both machining experiments and numerical simulations were carried out to achieve this goal. For the experimental studies, a series of orthogonal machining tests were conducted to investigate the effects of various machining parameters on chip morphology, machined surface condition, and resulting machining forces. Feed speed and rake angle were found to {{have a significant effect on}} the type of chip generated during orthogonal machining. High feed speed conditions and large rake angle tools produced long and continuous ribbon-like chips and a corresponding <b>smooth</b> <b>machined</b> surface. The design of the workpiece fixture in the lathe was also found to be critical for <b>machining</b> <b>smooth</b> surfaces. In the numerical investigation, half-wedge indentation and orthogonal cutting models were developed to simulate incipient separation of elastomers. It was found that high tensile normal stress and maximum principal stresses, as well as a large concentrated strain energy density near the separation point lead to favorable conditions for the formation of continuous chips and a good surface finish. The indentation simulations correlated well with the cutting tests in which tools with a large rake angle and large feed produced continuous chips and a smooth surface finish. The models offer potential for identifying the cutting conditions and tools that produce a <b>smooth</b> <b>machined</b> surface finish of elastomers...|$|R

Methods: Surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. Bacterial adhesion on machined, Osseotite®, and Nanotite® discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: Streptococcus mutans CCUG 35176, Streptococcus sanguis CCUG 17826, Streptococcus salivarius CCUG 11878, Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans CCUG 37002, Porphyromonas gingivalis CCUG 2521.

Implant topography appears to modulate cell growth and differentiation of osteoblasts affecting the bone healing around the titanium implant. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effects of 1 cm diameter and 1 mm thick titanium disks on cellular morphology, adhesion and bone phenotypic expression of human osteoblast-like cells, SaOS- 2. SaOS- 2 cells were cultured on commercially 1 cm pure titanium disks with three different surface roughness: smooth (S), sandblasted (SB) and titanium plasma sprayed (TPS). Differences in the cellular morphology were found when they were grown on the three different surfaces. An uniform monolayer of cells recovered the S surface, while clusters of multilayered irregularly shaped cells were distributed on the rough SB and TPS surfaces. The adhesion of SaOS- 2 cells, as measured after 3 h of culture, was not affected by surface roughness. ECM components such as Collagen I (CoI), Fibronectin (FN), Vitronectin (VN) and Tenascin (TN) were secreted and organized only on the SB and TPS surfaces while they remained into the cytoplasm on the S surfaces. Osteopontin and BSP-II were largely detected on the SB and TPS surfaces, while only minimal production was observed on the S ones.
