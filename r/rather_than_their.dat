5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene {{is defined as a}} union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special {{supportive}} clothing and shoes are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> muscles.|$|E
5|$|Fischer heavily disparaged chess {{as it was}} {{currently}} being played (at the highest levels). As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> roots.|$|E
5|$|After Edmund Halley {{demonstrated}} that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759 by calculating its orbit, that comet became known as Halley's Comet. Similarly, {{the second and third}} known periodic comets, Encke's Comet and Biela's Comet, were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their appearance.|$|E
5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} applications of rhodium compounds and their derivatives in medicine and reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of catalysis. The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> applications.|$|E

5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> freedom.|$|E
5|$|IGN {{said that}} the {{difference}} between character classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal, offering little variety or incentive to replay as another class. IGN also said some missions and side quests were tedious, and were elevated by their setting <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> quality, while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and were rare enough to be enjoyable when available. However, GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple. Reviewers said that many of the gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Nestlé Purina Petcare {{became the}} {{official}} {{sponsor of the}} Westminster show hosted by the American Kennel Club. The company introduced a competition for pet owners to win a part-time job earning $50,000 annually to travel with their cat, interview other pet owners and write for the Purina website. Nestle Purina also produced television advertisements intended for Austria that had audio effects only pets could hear. It was {{the first set of}} advertisements targeting pets directly, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> owners.|$|E

Matthias patronized art and science; his royal library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was one of the largest collections of books in Europe. With his patronage, Hungary became the first country to embrace the Renaissance from Italy. As Matthias the Just, the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise, he remains a popular hero of Hungarian folk tales.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April the Joint Chiefs persuaded McNamara and Johnson {{to launch}} a four-week attack on North Vietnam's lines of communications, which would isolate that nation from its {{overland}} sources of supply in the PRC and the Soviet Union. About one-third of the North's imports came down the northeast railroad from the PRC, while the remaining two-thirds came by sea through Haiphong and other ports. For {{the first time in}} the campaign, targets were to be chosen for their military, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> psychological, significance. During the four weeks, 26 bridges and seven ferries were destroyed. Other targets included the extensive North Vietnamese radar system, barracks, and ammunition depots.|$|E

To be inducted into the Hall of Fame, inductees must have held a title belt or {{played an important role in}} or around the Missouri area between 1959 and 1983, when the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) had a strong presence in St. Louis.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{interest}} in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas {{to the south and}} the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.|$|E
5|$|After the Acts of Union in 1707 {{the royal}} family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles {{followed}} the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> estates in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of George II at the newly founded Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh in 1753 or {{the figure of the}} judge Duncan Forbes for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century statuary were preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.|$|E
