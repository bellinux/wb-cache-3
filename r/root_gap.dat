In this process proper selection of input welding parameters is {{necessary in order to}} obtain a good quality weld with good tensile strength and subsequently increase the productivity of the process. In order to obtain a good quality weld of high tensile strength, it is therefore, necessary to control the input welding parameters. In this research work, experiments were carried out on AISI 1016 mild steel plates using gas {{metal arc welding}} (GMAW) process. Taguchi method is used to formulate the experimental design. The exhaustive survey suggests that some control factors viz. arc voltage, welding speed, Welding Position Gap, gas pressure and <b>root</b> <b>gap,</b> wire feed rate etc. predominantly influence the Tensile Strength weld.

40|$|Several fatigue {{failures}} are initiating {{from the}} root of non-penetrating welds, which are widely applied in several industrial sectors. The structural optimization and reduction of weld material increase the danger of root cracking. The fatigue assessment during design is mainly based on the nominal, structural hot-spot or notch stress approach. These approaches are only partly applicable to weld roots, give rough estimates such as the nominal stress approach or over-conservative life estimation such as occasionally the notch stress approach when keyhole notches are modelled. An alternative assessment is possible with the crack propagation approach assuming the non-welded <b>root</b> <b>gap</b> and a short crack at the weld toe as initial cracks. A new approach is the notch stress intensity approach (N-SIF approach) which is able to assess the fatigue life of V-shaped notches at weld toes as well as crack-like notches at weld roots using the strain energy density around the notch. Both approaches are applied to different joints where toe and root failures are probable. The results are compared with a previous analysis using the notch stress approach.

The {{fact that no}} fire adapted savanna trees occur in these grasslands confounds the suggestion that fires maintain these ecosystems. This study addresses {{the question of what}} prevents savanna trees from surviving. It was hypothesized that grass root competition for space eliminates the availability of suitable 'gaps' for tree establishment under high rainfall conditions. Demographic bottlenecks on Acacia species populations were determined by examining the ratio of juvenile plants to adult carrying capacity. Below-ground root biomass was quantified in 10 cm layers to a depth of 40 cm at six sites along an elevation and rainfall gradient. The δ¹²C/δ¹³C ratio was determined for roots collected. High rainfall sites were limited at the tree seedling establishment phase. Fine root biomass to 40 cm depth increased with rainfall from 613 g/m³ (Standard deviation = 235. 1) to about 1326 g/m³ (Standard deviation = 573. 1). The surface layer had significantly higher fine root biomass than other layers, with site mean biomass in the surface layer increasing with rainfall (p< 0. 00001, F₃. ₄₂₃= 18. 621). Available gaps for tree establishment decreased with increasing rainfall/elevation; no gaps were found at the Highveld grassland site.

40|$|Literature {{relevant}} to the weldability of steel by {{manual metal arc welding}} has been reviewed. In particular, the process of manual metal arc welding has been examined and current theoretical models that have been developed to predict the structure of the weldment are discussed. Weld defects, particularly hydrogen assisted cold cracking of the heat affected zone (HAZ) are discussed and a review of weldability tests relevent to HAZ cracking has been made. The Japanese developed Tekken Test has been examined in detail and the relevance of Cracking Index measurements has been analysed. The effects that variations to the extrinsic welding parameters of voltage, current, and speed on Cracking Index as determined by the Tekken Test have been examined. Intrinsic welding variables of microstructure and restraint stress have been examined using optical and electron microscopy and a restraint stress measuring technique. Cracking Index results have been related to the extrinsic welding parameters by variations caused to the intrinsic variables of microstructure and restraint stress. It was found that increases in welding speed and voltage increased the value of the Cracking Index and increases in welding current decreased the Cracking Index value. The interaction of these effects produced a variation of results for welding at constant heat input. All three extrinsic parameters were found, independently and collectively to affect the microstructures of both the HAZ and the weldmetal. It was found that increases in welding voltage and current and decreases in welding speed increased the volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the HAZ with an associated decrease in HAZ cracking. Cracking of the weldmetal was found {{to be related to the}} ferrite morphology; fine lath (acicular) ferrite was found to be the microstructure least susceptible to cracking. Formation of fine lath ferrite microstrucures was enhanced by low welding speeds. From the various combinations of weldmetal and HAZ microstructures that could be achieved a range of Cracking Index values could be produced. The influence that <b>root</b> <b>gap</b> of the test piece, the composition (carbon equivalent) of the steel plate, and the classification and manufacturing source of the electrodes had on Cracking Index has also been studied. Increasing <b>root</b> <b>gap</b> and carbon equivalent increased the value of Cracking Index although in the latter case the relationship varied with welding conditions. Cracking Index was also found to vary with electrodes of different classifications and from different manufacturing sources. It is proposed that these Cracking Index variations are attributable to strength incompatibilities and differences in electrode flux compositions respectively. It is concluded that because of the variation of results, often with considerable scatter, produced by the interaction of all the variables, the Tekken Test is not valid as a general method for determining weldability, but rather provides a useful comparative test of the responses of different steels and electrodes to welding under strictly specified welding conditions...|$|E

Mathematical models have been devised expressing the levels of controllable welding factors {{as a function of}} the joint geometry, such that acceptable weld beads are produced.

The equations are intended to form part of an adaptively controlled robotic arc welding system. Simulation was used to develop the adaptive expressions.

The self shielding flux cored electrode arc welding process was used to weld single J preparations orientated in the horizontal-vertical position. Single sided full penetration welds with underbeads were required. The weld bead geometry was defined in terms of ten responses. Mathematical models derived from factorially designed experiments were used to relate the weld bead geometry, incidence of porosity and the occurrence of electrode stubbing to a function of upto seven factors.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Weld quality features are difficult or impossible to directly measure and control during welding, therefore indirect methods are necessary. Penetration {{is the most important}} geometric feature since in most applications it is the most significant factor affecting joint strength. Observation of penetration is only possible from the back face of the full penetration weld. In all other cases, since direct measurement of depth of penetration is not possible, real time control of penetration in the Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process by sensing conditions at the top surface of the joint is necessary. This continues to be a major area of interest for automation of the process. The objective of this research has been to develop an on-line intelligent process control model for GMAW, which can monitor and control the welding process. The model uses measurement of the temperature at a point {{on the surface of the}} workpiece to predict the depth of penetration being achieved, and to provide feedback for corrective adjustment of welding variables. Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic technologies have been used to achieve a reliable Neuro-Fuzzy control model for GMAW of a typical closed butt joint having 60 ° Vee edge preparation. The neural network model predicts the surface temperature expected for a set of fixed and adjustable welding variables when a prescribed level of penetration is achieved. This predicted temperature is compared with the actual surface temperature occurring during welding, as measured by an infrared sensor. If there is a difference between the measured temperature and the temperature predicted by the neural network, a fuzzy logic model will recommend changes to the adjustable welding variables necessary to achieve the desired weld penetration. Large scale experiments to obtain data for modelling and for model validation, and various other modelling studies are described. The results are used to establish the relationships between the output surface temperature measurement, welding variables and the corresponding achieved weld quality criteria. The effectiveness of the modelling methodology in dealing with fixed or variable <b>root</b> <b>gap</b> has also been tested. The result shows that the Neuro-fuzzy models are capable of providing control of penetration to an acceptable degree of accuracy, and a potential control response time, using modestly powerful computing hardware, of the order of one hundred milliseconds. This is more than adequate for real time control of GMAW. The application potential for control using these models is significant since, unlike many other top surface monitoring methods, it does not require sensing of the highly transient weld pool shape or surface...|$|E

However, the rotation of a vehicle must start and end at the depot and its total duration (the sum of the travel, service and recharge times associated with the visited arcs, clients, and facilities, respectively) must not exceed a given shift duration. VRPIRF is the particular case with only one depot of the Multiple Depot VRP with Inter-depot routes, a generalization of the Multi-Depot VRP problem in which each depot acts both as the base for the vehicles of its own fleet, and as a facility for vehicles based at other depots. To solve the VRPIRF, we propose two Branch&Cut algorithms, and a third one that integrates the first two. The aim is to give a contribution to the literature on this problem, which in our opinion is still very poor for what concerns exact methods. Both the B&C methods are based on a MILP compact formulation and ensure the respect of capacity constraints by separating Capacity Cuts. The first method separates the so-called Non-Reachable Facility (NRF) Cuts to ensure that the routes of a vehicle form a non-discontinuous rotation. The method finds near-optimal solutions in reasonable times. The second one makes use of replenishment arcs to model a stop at a facility between two clients. This allows to represent a rotation as an elementary path with both its endpoints on the depot, and thus ensure connectivity by the separation of SECs on a transformation of the graph. As a consequence, this second method shows both a tighter <b>root</b> <b>gap</b> and a stronger lower bound. The last method integrates in one framework the first two algorithms, and has been designed with the aim {{to take advantage of the}} strong points of both. Tests have been conducted on medium-sized benchmark instances, leading to very promising results. </p...|$|E

A decentralized approach has been taken in this study to understand the prevalent demand-supply gap {{in electricity}} in the Indian market. The <b>roots</b> of this <b>gap</b> have been thoroughly viewed from every possible angle. Circumnavigating the entire electricity market readily brings out the flaws and drawbacks in it resulting in a very bleak scenario. Quality control factors are also considered to the minutest detail. So, a new method of supply chain marketing in the electricity sector is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proves that}} a family of number field lattice codes {{simultaneously}} achieves a constant gap to capacity in Rayleigh fast fading and Gaussian channels. The key property in the proof is the existence of infinite towers of Hilbert class fields with bounded <b>root</b> discriminant. The <b>gap</b> to capacity of the proposed families {{is determined by the}} root discriminant. The comparison between the Gaussian and fading case reveals that in Rayleigh fading channels the normalized minimum product distance plays an analogous role to the Hermite invariant in Gaussian channels.

40|$|The {{quadratic}} traveling salesman problem (QTSP) is {{an extension}} of the (classical) Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where the costs depend on each two nodes that are traversed in succession, i. e., on the edges in the symmetric (STSP) and on the arcs in the asymmetric case (ATSP). The QTSP is motivated by an application in bioinformatics. It can be used in the solution of certain Permuted Markov models that are set up for the recognition of transcription factor binding sites and of splice sites in gene regulation. Important special cases are the Angular-Metric TSP used in robotics and the TSP with Reload Costs used in the planning of telecommunication and transport networks. The SQTSP and the AQTSP can be formulated as integer optimization problems over the polytope associated with the STSP resp. ATSP together with a quadratic cost function. We study the polytopes arising from a linearization of the respective quadratic integer programming formulations. Based on the proof of the dimension of the polytopes using the so called direct method we can prove the facetness of several valid inequalities. These facets and valid inequalities can be divided into three large groups. Some are related to the Boolean quadric polytope. Furthermore we introduce the conflicting edges/arc inequalities that forbid certain configurations of edges and 2 -edges resp. of arcs and 2 -arcs. Finally, we strengthen valid inequalities of STSP and ATSP in order to get stronger inequalities in the quadratic case. We present two general lifting approaches. One is applicable to all inequalities with nonnegative coefficients and the second allows to strengthen clique tree inequalities. Applying these approaches to the subtour elimination constraints leads to facets in most cases, but in general facetness is not preserved. In addition, the complexity of the separation problems for some of the facet classes is studied. Finally, we present some computational results using a branch-and-cut framework, which is improved by some of the newly derived cutting planes. The tested instances from biology could be solved surprisingly well. Instances with up to 100 nodes could be solved in less than 700 seconds improving the results in the literature by several orders of magnitude. For most of the randomly generated instances using some additional separators allowed to reduce the <b>root</b> <b>gaps</b> and the numbers of nodes in the branch-and-cut tree significantly, often even the running times...|$|R
