2500|$|Recurrent {{humor is}} {{generated}} {{on the show}} by contrasting the 'squeaky-clean' habits of June and Ward with the 'grubby' ones of Wally and Beaver. While Ward and June stress cleanliness, bathing, and good grooming (ordering both boys to wash their faces, hands, and fingernails before dinner), both boys generally prefer being unwashed and dressed in dirty clothes. In the premiere episode, Wally and Beaver fake bathing by <b>rumpling</b> towels and tossing [...] "turtle dirt" [...] in the bathtub. In [...] "Cleaning Up Beaver", June and Ward commend Wally on his neat appearance and chide Beaver for his untidiness. When Wally calls Beaver a [...] "pig", Beaver moves into the guest room where he can be his own dirty, messy self without comment or criticism from others. Frightening shadows in the room force {{him back to his}} old bedroom and the safety of being with his brother. The two boys strike a middle ground: Beaver will be a bit tidier than he usually is and Wally will be a bit sloppier.|$|E

50|$|Belle is {{relieved}} when <b>Rumple</b> visits her, revealing that he's still alive, but their happiness doesn't last as Regina instills a new persona for Belle - a party girl with loose morals {{by the name}} of Lacey - who <b>Rumple</b> soon finds at the local bar, after being discharged from the hospital. The two don't initially click, but <b>Rumple</b> is soon able to make it work when he finds that Lacey is attracted to his dark side. They continue to pursue a relationship, with Hook learning that <b>Rumple</b> is still alive when seeing the couple out walking the streets. Lacey serves as a bad influence for <b>Rumple,</b> which goes noticed by Baelfire, now known as Neal (Michael Raymond-James), who <b>Rumple</b> has found and brought back to Storybrooke. Lacey soon learns <b>Rumple</b> has magic, as well as the ability to grant her eternal youth. She reacts positively and suggests <b>Rumple</b> do what he must to preserve their future, oblivious {{to the fact that it}} means killing his grandson, Henry Mills (Jared S. Gilmore). Belle's memories are eventually restored, however, in the midst of the destruction of Storybrooke. She embraces <b>Rumple</b> as they're prepared to die, but the town is soon saved, and <b>Rumple</b> must leave on a new quest to save Henry from Neverland. He leaves Belle behind, as he's fated to die on this mission, but Belle vows that she'll see him again.|$|R

However, <b>Rumple</b> cannot bring himself to kill the healer, but instead bargains {{with him for the}} antidote. <b>Rumple</b> agrees to hand over his second-born child to Fendrake in return for Baelfire's cure. While this is going on, Milah encounters Hook {{for the first time at}} a tavern. Milah and <b>Rumple</b> meet and cure Baelfire, but Milah is furious at her husband upon learning of the deal he made. Years later, after <b>Rumple</b> has become the Dark One, he visits and kills Fendrake in order to void the contract.|$|R

5000|$|The {{two later}} track the thief to Sherwood Forest, where the Sheriff of Nottingham (Wil Traval) reveals, after <b>Rumple</b> magically takes his tongue {{when the man}} asks to have his way with Belle in {{exchange}} for information, that the thief is his own nemesis, Robin Hood, who stole his love. When <b>Rumple</b> and Belle finally see Robin Hood from a distance, <b>Rumple</b> magically imprisons Belle in the ground to force her to watch as he kills him. But after Robin Hood uses the wand to heal his pregnant and apparently deathly ill lover, Marian (Christie Laing), Belle begs <b>Rumple</b> not to leave the child fatherless. <b>Rumple</b> [...] "misses" [...] with his arrow and lets the couple escape. Receiving a warm hug from Belle for his change of heart, <b>Rumple</b> later delights her with access to his vast library, flippantly calling it just another room for her to clean.|$|R

6000|$|... 'We used {{to believe}} in fairies, you remember, and plan what we'd ask for {{if we could have}} three wishes. Doesn't it seem as if mine had been really granted at last?

6000|$|... "Very flattering, very flattering, I am sure, {{especially}} in these hard times," [...] said Mr. Granger apologetically, shaking his thin hair {{down over his}} forehead, and then <b>rumpling</b> it up again.

5000|$|The <b>Rumpler</b> C.X, {{given the}} company {{designation}} <b>Rumpler</b> 8C 14, was a German two-seater, {{developed from the}} earlier <b>Rumpler</b> 8C 13 prototype by <b>Rumpler</b> in early 1918. The prototype had a similar wing cellule to the C.VII, and was initially powered by a [...] Mercedes D.IVa engine, later powered by a [...] Maybach Mb.IVa engines). The C.X had the highest top speed and service ceiling of all German C-type aircraft and an order was placed for the aircraft in August 1918. However, only a few were built and tested before the war ended.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Belle and <b>Rumple</b> grow closer, as they {{continue}} to go out on dates such as lunch at Granny's Diner and a picnic at <b>Rumple's</b> pawnshop. However, interruptions do occur as the town is in a frenzy due to the arrival of Regina's mother, Cora (Barbara Hershey), who has become a new threat to them all. Belle supports <b>Rumple</b> in his mission to find a loophole around the town line barrier in hopes of going out in search of his long lost son, but ventures out on her own when it is revealed that Captain Hook has made it to Storybrooke and attacks her in the library. She ends up rescuing Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge) from being held hostage on the Jolly Roger, facing off against Hook. <b>Rumple</b> appears and beats Hook to Belle's horror, as she begs him to show her that her faith in him is justified. After <b>Rumple</b> lets Hook live and prepares to leave town, Hook shoots Belle as revenge. This sends her tumbling across the town line, causing her to lose her memory, just as an outsider crosses into Storybrooke. Though <b>Rumple</b> is able to heal Belle's gunshot wound immediately, she's escorted to the hospital in order to be kept under intensive care while suffering from amnesia. <b>Rumple</b> attempts to get through to Belle by showing her the chipped teacup, a remnant of their life together, but a scared and confused Belle throws and smashes the cup. Heartbroken, <b>Rumple</b> leaves.|$|R
50|$|In the Enchanted Forest, {{soon after}} Belle {{has gone to}} live with Rumplestiltstkin, she cries at night and he gives her a pillownot for comfort, but to stifle her sobs. They are {{interrupted}} {{by the sound of}} an intruder. <b>Rumple</b> captures a thief (Tom Ellis) who is trying to steal a magic wand, after being unharmed by the thief's magically unerring bow and arrow. <b>Rumple</b> locks him up and plans to torture him to death as an example to others. Belle fails to persuade him to let the thief go, so she releases him herself. He invites her to run away with him, but she stands by her pledge to serve <b>Rumple.</b> <b>Rumple</b> is enraged, and then shows Belle that the thief took the wand when he left. Belle still has faith in the possibility that the thief is a good person, saying that <b>Rumple</b> can't know a person's heart without truly knowing the person. <b>Rumple</b> demands Belle accompany him in hunting down the thief with his own bow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{is it not}} {{a horrible}} reflection," [...] said my guardian, to whom I had hastily {{explained}} the unavailing efforts of the two women, [...] "{{is it not a}} horrible reflection," [...] walking up and down and <b>rumpling</b> his hair, [...] "that if this wretched creature were a convicted prisoner, his hospital would be wide open to him, and he would be as well taken care of as any sick boy in the kingdom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're the cubs--we've got {{to pitch}} in tooth and claw {{if it comes to}} a family row," [...] Jem went on cheerfully, <b>rumpling</b> up his red curls with a strong, lean, {{sensitive}} brown hand--the hand of the born surgeon, his father often thought. [...] "What an adventure it would be! But I suppose Grey or some of those wary old chaps will patch matters up at the eleventh hour. It'll be a rotten shame if they leave France in the lurch, though. If they don't, we'll see some fun. Well, I suppose it's time {{to get ready for the}} spree at the light." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{everyone}} exclaimed, and Beth {{hugged the}} cropped head tenderly, Jo assumed an indifferent air, {{which did not}} deceive anyone a particle, and said, <b>rumpling</b> up the brown bush and trying {{to look as if}} she liked it, [...] "It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth. It will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig. It will do my brains good to have that mop taken off. My head feels deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order. I'm satisfied, so please take the money and let's have supper." ...|$|E
50|$|Ruby visits Belle in the {{hospital}} but is disappointed that she doesn't remember who she is. When Belle recalls <b>Rumple</b> healing her wound with magic, as well as making a fireball to throw at Hook, Ruby acts as though Belle isn't making any sense. Belle knows what she saw though, sending her into a frenzy, thus forcing the need {{for her to be}} sedated. She later finds that she isn't alone in her beliefs, for she is approached by Greg Mendell (Ethan Embry) who reveals that he saw the same thing. With Regina and Cora now conspiring together, Regina visits Belle in {{the hospital}} in order to find details on where <b>Rumple's</b> Dark One dagger is located. <b>Rumple</b> is later poisoned with Dreamshade by Hook, and on his deathbed <b>Rumple</b> calls Belle at the hospital in order to speak to her one last time, telling her that although she cannot remember it, she is a hero. Their call ends, but <b>Rumple</b> is cured when Mary Margaret sacrifices Cora's life for <b>Rumple's.</b>|$|R
5000|$|With {{the other}} residents, Belle {{transports}} to the Enchanted Forest, taking Emma to Camelot {{in order to}} find Merlin and remove her darkness. However, weeks later, they return to Storybrooke with missing memories as to how they failed. During her time in Camelot, Belle's growing knowledge of spells helped to free Lancelot and Merida from King Arthur's prison. Belle subsequently helped Merida of Dunbroch win back her kingdom and save her three brothers from the other clans. In Storybrooke, Dark Emma awakens <b>Rumple</b> from his coma. Emma then steals Merida's heart and commands her to kill Belle in hopes that it will inspire <b>Rumple</b> to be a hero. <b>Rumple</b> insists that he and Belle leave town, but she refuses to run away from her life and the people she cares about. Dark Emma then transforms Merida into a bear that chases Belle through the woods until the bear is stopped by <b>Rumple,</b> who feeds it anti-transformation powder in order to revert Merida to human form. Belle witnesses <b>Rumple</b> embrace his newfound sense of heroism and remove Excalibur from its stone. After everyone's memory is restored and <b>Rumple</b> heroically faces Dark Hook, <b>Rumple</b> tells Belle that he is ready to finally be the man she deserves. Belle declines his offer to rekindle their relationship, stating that she has spent too long trying to heal his heart that she has lost track of her own. Upon the arrival of all previous Dark Ones in Storybrooke, <b>Rumple</b> sends Belle out of town so that she may escape the immediate threat and see the world as she has always wanted to. Belle accepts the offer and leaves, but returns once the threat is vanquished and tells <b>Rumple</b> that she wants to be with him because he has proven to be truly selfless, though she is unaware that <b>Rumple</b> has now reclaimed the powers of the Dark One.|$|R
5000|$|Belle {{remains in}} the {{sleeping}} curse she put herself in to protect her child. <b>Rumple</b> enters her dreamworld to try and wake her, but fails in doing so. Her son wakes her instead, and she once again rejects <b>Rumple.</b> As she seeks a new place to stay, Hook offers for Belle {{to stay on the}} Jolly Roger in repentance for attacking her in the past. Belle forgives him and accepts, realizing Hook is a changed man. <b>Rumple</b> casts a spell forbidding her to leave the boat due to a serious threat from Mr. Hyde. However, the spell puts her in danger when she cannot flee from the true threat, Dr. Jekyll. This further deteriorates <b>Rumple</b> and Belle's relationship. Belle briefly forges an alliance with Zelena in order to escape Storybrooke, but <b>Rumple</b> stops them before she can. In the episode [...] "Changelings", the Evil Queen speeds up Belle's pregnancy and Belle gives birth to Gideon. She gives her son to the Blue Fairy, fearing <b>Rumple</b> will try to take the child as he previously threatened. But the Blue Fairy is ambushed by <b>Rumple's</b> mother, the Black Fairy. Gideon is taken to the Dark Realm where he grows up very quickly and develops a terrifying darkness. <b>Rumple</b> apologizes for his villainous actions and tells Belle that they need to start trusting each other in order to rescue their son. In the mid season finale, an adult Gideon arrives in Storybrooke and is shown confronting his mother and father in Gold's shop.|$|R
