5|$|Heathenry, also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism, is {{a modern}} Pagan religion. Scholars of <b>religious</b> <b>studies</b> {{classify}} Heathenry as a new religious movement. Its practitioners model their faith on the pre-Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of Iron Age and Early Medieval Europe. To reconstruct these past belief systems, Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably.|$|E

5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the <b>religious</b> <b>studies</b> scholar Graham Harvey stated {{that it was impossible to}} develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally.

5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of <b>religious</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coolsma left Cianjur in 1869 {{and went}} to Bogor, also a majority-Sundanese city. He found little success in preaching to the European {{citizens}} of the city or converting the Sundanese. On 31 May 1869, he opened a school at his home, which provided a free education in both secular and <b>religious</b> <b>studies.</b> The first class had ten students, a total which grew quickly; at its peak, the school had 111 students. After a government-funded school was opened in 1872, most of the Sundanese students moved there to avoid the Christian teachings. The remaining students were mostly ethnic Chinese, few of whom converted.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He gave up his <b>religious</b> <b>studies</b> to study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, {{so there was no}} defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation.|$|E
