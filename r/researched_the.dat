5|$|According to Professor Picotti, who {{extensively}} <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> conclave {{and came}} to the conclusion that simony had occurred, no accounts of papal income and expenditure exist in the registers of Introitus et Exitus for August 1492, and debts from the Apostolic Camera to Cardinals Campofregoso, Domenico della Rovere, Sanseverino, and Orsini appeared soon afterwards. The Spannocchi bank, which housed much of Borja's wealth, was said to have nearly crashed after the conclave due to the velocity of transactions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1938, McClelland <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> {{technical}} and logistical aspects of long-range air communications, an effort {{which resulted in}} the establishment of the Army Airways Communications System.

5|$|In 1991, at the {{earliest}} possible date, Moser retired from his teaching position to avoid the administrative burden and to focus on his research into Cortinarius and related genera. After his retirement, he continued to work heavily, typically beginning at 5 am. In 1992, he <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> presence of Agaricales in the Crimean Mountains, identifying 70 previously undocumented species, including some new to science. In 1995, in celebration of Moser's 70th birthday, a supplement of Sydowia was published in his honour.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>research</b> was {{to offer the}} simplistic model that can be {{implemented}} to provide customer satisfaction. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> implemented <b>the</b> descriptive qualitative methodology. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> design was Meta-analysis. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> finding indicated that product quality, customer services and trust positively affected the customer’s satisfaction. The product price affected the customer satisfaction in both negative and positive ways. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> relies on <b>the</b> analysis of quantitative and qualitative journals. The lack of quantitative <b>research</b> undermines <b>the</b> generalization level for <b>the</b> <b>research</b> findings. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> allows <b>the</b> provision of a customer satisfaction model that can be implemented in <b>the</b> <b>research</b> of <b>the</b> organization’s position. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> allows <b>the</b> provision of a customer satisfaction model that can be implemented is <b>the</b> <b>research</b> of <b>the</b> organization’s position...|$|R

5|$|In 2003, the Beachfields Park {{project was}} {{organised}} to publicise Beachfields' heritage and {{to preserve it}} for future generations. Students of Cheyne Middle School and Minster College, with assistance from local organisations, <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> funfair, bandstands, Prisoner of the War hut, boating lake and bowling green. As part of the project, students wrote a book, Tales of Beachfields Park, which won the Historical Association Young Historian Primary School Award for Local History.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln hired John Kirby to {{represent}} Nintendo in court. Kirby had won other big cases {{for the likes}} of PepsiCo., General Foods, and Warner-Lambert. Kirby <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> game's development, taking depositions from designer Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi in Japan. Miyamoto claimed that he had in fact called his ape character King Kong at first, as that was a generic term in Japan for any large ape.|$|E
5|$|Nothhelm was a {{contemporary}} of Boniface and Bede, whom he supplied with correspondence from the papal library following {{a trip to}} Rome.

5|$|The {{events of}} the Fishing Creek Confederacy were widely covered in both Democratic and Republican newspapers.

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in {{imitation}} of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E

5|$|Bhandarkar, who {{is known}} for {{studying}} his subject matter to make his films as realistic as possible, <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> fashion industry for nearly eight months, attending fashion events and shows. He spoke with designers, buyers, choreographers and models. Several media publications reported that the film was inspired by the lives of fashion models such as Shivani Kapur, Geetanjali Nagpal, Kate Moss and Alicia Raut; however, Bhandarkar stated that the story is fictional and does not resemble anyone's life. The media also reported that the film revolved around two homosexual fashion designers; Bhandarkar denied these rumours, saying the film did not revolve around male characters but had female protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Chemists at the Los Alamos Laboratory {{developed}} {{methods of}} purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E
5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E

5|$|Grossman and Schafer brainstormed {{regularly}} to devise the time travel puzzles, and collaborated {{with members of}} the development team as well as other LucasArts employees. They would identify puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays. Most issues were addressed prior to programming, but some details were left unfinished to work on later. The staff conceived puzzles involving the U.S.'s early history based on their memory of their compulsory education, and using the more legendary aspects of history, such as George Washington cutting down a cherry tree to appeal to international audiences. To complete the elements, Grossman <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> period to maintain historical accuracy, visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians. The studio, however, took creative license towards facts to fit them into the game's design.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Norgrove {{received}} a Ph.D. from the University of Manchester in development policy and management.

At {{the time of her}} death, in addition to her aid work, Norgrove was working towards an MBA from the University of Warwick through distance learning. She worked in Afghanistan for the United Nations from 2005 to 2008, and as regional director of an international development company based in Jalalabad beginning in February 2010. She also worked in Laos as an environmental specialist for the U.N. in 2008–09, Mexico, and Uganda where Norgrove <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> effects of national park management on the indigenous population near Mount Elgon National Park.|$|E
5|$|Morrissey {{returned}} to television in 2002 playing Franny Rothwell, a factory canteen worker {{who wants to}} adopt his dead sister's son, in an episode of Paul Abbott's Clocking Off. His performance was described as characteristically powerful in The Independent. He also played tabloid journalist Dave Dewston in the four-part BBC serial Murder, and prison officer Mike in the part-improvised single drama Out of Control. He <b>researched</b> <b>the</b> latter part by shadowing prison officers in a young offenders' institution for a week. At the beginning of 2003, he {{played the role of}} Richie MacGregor in This Little Life, a television drama about a mother who has to cope with her 16-week-premature baby.
