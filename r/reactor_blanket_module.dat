40|$|In the {{framework}} of research activities on fusion reactors a great effort is dedicated by the scientific community {{to the development of}} tritium breeding blankets. One of the main goals is to assess the neutronic behaviour of such devices to analyse their tritium breeding performance and to evaluate the required data for their thermal-mechanic and thermal-hydraulic design. Many papers have been published on this topic considering some stationary condition to calculate such important quantities as heating power, gas production and dpa rates, tritium breeding ratio, etc., but not much attention has been focussed to neutronic transport analyses in transient conditions. The present paper proposes a simple model based on the point kinetics approximation, which has been set up deriving an alternative formulation of the time-dependent neutron transport equation. This approach allows to define some physical characteristics that can be interpreted in a statistical way, making possible to calculate these quantities numerically by the Monte Carlo method. The adoption of the aforementioned numerical method has the great advantage that complex geometries (as the fusion <b>reactor's</b> <b>blankets</b> are) can be analysed with acceptable computational times. Some simple cases have been investigated to implement the theoretical model proposed with MCNP 5 code and to show its potentiality. Then, applications to fusion <b>reactor</b> ITER <b>blanket</b> <b>module</b> and to the Helium Cooled Test <b>Blanket</b> <b>Module,</b> to be tested in ITER, have been taken into account in order to assess their neutronic time-dependent behaviour and the results obtained have been critically discussed...|$|R

40|$|An {{uncertainty}} {{analysis was}} performed for the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of a fusion power plant of the European DEMO type using the MCSEN patch to the MCNP Monte Carlo code. The breeding blanket was of the type Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB), currently under development in the European Power Plant Physics and Technology (PPPT) programme for a fusion power demonstration reactor (DEMO). A suitable 3 D model of the DEMO <b>reactor</b> with HCPB <b>blanket</b> <b>modules,</b> as routinely used for blanket design calculations, was employed. The nuclear cross-section data {{were taken from the}} JEFF- 3. 2 data library. For the uncertainty analysis, the isotopes H- 1, Li- 6, Li- 7, Be- 9, O- 16, Si- 28, Si- 29, Si- 30, Cr- 52, Fe- 54, Fe- 56, Ni- 58, W- 182, W- 183, W- 184 and W- 186 were considered. The covariance data were taken from JEFF- 3. 2 where available. Otherwise a combination of FENDL- 2. 1 for Li- 7, EFF- 3 for Be- 9 and JENDL- 3. 2 for O- 16 were compared with data from TENDL- 2014. Another comparison was performed with covariance data from JEFF- 3. 3 T 1. The analyses show an overall uncertainty of ± 3. 2 % for the TBR when using JEFF- 3. 2 covariance data with the mentioned additions. When using TENDL- 2014 covariance data as replacement, the uncertainty increases to ± 8. 6 %. For JEFF- 3. 3 T 1 the uncertainty result is ± 5. 6 %.

40|$|The Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) cavity flood system (CFS) is {{designed}} to be the primary safeguard for the integrity of the <b>blanket</b> <b>modules</b> during loss of coolant accidents (LOCAs). For certain large break LOCAs the CFS also provides backup for the residual heat removal systems (RHRs) in cooling the target assemblies. In the unlikely event that the internal flow passages in a <b>blanket</b> <b>module</b> or target assembly dryout, decay heat in the metal structures will be dissipated to the CFS through the module or assembly walls (i. e., rung outer walls). The target assemblies consist of tungsten targets encased in steel conduits, and they can safely sustain high metal temperatures. Under internally dry conditions, the cavity flood fluid will cool the target assemblies with vigorous nucleate boiling on the external surfaces. However, the metal structures in the <b>blanket</b> <b>modules</b> consist of lead cladded in aluminum, and they have a long-term exposure temperature limit currently set to 150 degrees C. Simultaneous LOCAs in both the target and blanket heat removal systems (HRS) could result in dryout of the target ladders, as well as the horizontal <b>blanket</b> <b>modules</b> above the target. The cavity flood coolant would boil on the outside surfaces of the target ladder rungs, and the resultant steam could reduce the effectiveness of convection heat transfer from the <b>blanket</b> <b>modules</b> to the cavity flood coolant. A two-part analysis was conducted to ascertain if the cavity flood system can adequately cool the <b>blanket</b> <b>modules</b> above the targets, even when boiling is occurring on the outer surfaces of the target ladder rungs. The first part of the analysis was to model transient thermal conduction in the front top horizontal row 1 module (i. e. top horizontal modules nearest the incoming beam), while varying parametrically the convection heat transfer coefficient (htc) for the external surfaces exposed to the cavity flood flow. This part of the analysis demonstrated that the module could adequately conduct heat to the outer module surfaces, given reasonable values for the convection heat transfer coefficients. The second part of the analysis consisted of two-phase flow modeling of the natural circulation of the cavity flood fluid past the top modules. Slots in the top shield allow the cavity flood fluid to circulate. The required width for these slots, to prevent steam from backing up and blanketing the outer surfaces of the top modules, was determined...|$|R

An MFC {{to prevent any}} leakage of Argon gas, which the MFC contains, into the vacuum vessel has been designed. A stainless steel case encloses the MFC, and an exhaust tube detects any leaked Argon gas out of the vacuum vessel. MFCs will be installed behind <b>blanket</b> <b>modules</b> at upper and lower outboard position due to interface considerations with other equipment and the vacuum vessel. MFCs at the lower outboard position are located the center and {{to the rear of}} a <b>blanket</b> <b>module,</b> while MFCs at the upper outboard position are near the gap between <b>blanket</b> <b>modules</b> because of the narrow gap at that location between the modules and the vacuum vessel. The disparate effect of streaming neutrons on the response of MFCs at each installation location is analyzed through neutron transport calculation using MCNP version 5. Results indicate the linear combination of total responses of MFCs at the lower and upper outboard positions is insensitive to the changes in the position of the plasma while the ratio of streaming neutrons at the upper outboard position (~ 70 %) is higher than that detected at the lower outboard position (~ 20 %) ...|$|R

40|$|To {{address a}} concern about a {{potential}} maldistribution of coolant flow through an APT <b>blanket</b> <b>module</b> under low flow near RHR conditions, a scoping study of downflow mixed convection in parallel channels was conducted. Buoyancy will adversely effect the flow distribution in module bins with downflow and non-uniform power distributions. This study consists of two parts: a simple analytical model of flow in a two channel network, and a lumped eleven channel FLOWTRAN-TF model of a front lateral Row- 1 <b>blanket</b> <b>module</b> bin. Results from both models indicate that the concern about coolant flow in a vertical model being diverted away from high power regions by buoyancy is warranted.

The measurement accuracy depends on the position and profile of the plasma and the material in front of the irradiation end. It is required to minimize the amount of material and its density variation across the field of view between the plasma and the irradiation end.
