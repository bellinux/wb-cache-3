50|$|On 19 July 2010 <b>Réver</b> was {{announced}} as an Atlético Mineiro player for the 2010 Série A on club president Alexandre Kalil's personal Twitter account. <b>Réver</b> debuted for Atlético Mineiro a month later, being called {{up for the}} national time in the meantime, and became team captain {{in the second half}} of the season. The following season was difficult for the club in the Série A, struggling against relegation, but <b>Réver</b> won the Prêmio Craque do Brasileirão for best centre-back in the competition. In 2012, <b>Réver</b> captained the team in its undefeated Campeonato Minero victory, and through its Série A title contest with Fluminense. Despite the club finishing as runner-up, <b>Réver</b> again was selected for the team of the year, in both the Craque do Brasileirão and the Bola de Prata awards, together with teammate Leonardo Silva. <b>Réver</b> remained as club captain in the following season, in which he won the Campeonato Mineiro and the Copa Libertadores with the club. In 2014, he became Atlético Mineiro's top goalscoring centre-back in history with 22 goals, a record later surpassed by Leonardo Silva, who replaced <b>Réver</b> as captain in the middle of the season as he struggled with injury. After winning the 2014 Recopa Sudamericana with the club, another injury made <b>Réver</b> eventually lose his first-squad status to Jemerson in the later half of the season, and in 2015 he was allowed to leave by the club's board.|$|R

25|$|Standard fibres {{used for}} the frock coat {{included}} wool and vicuña. The most common weave was known as broadcloth. The standard colour of a frock coat was solid black, but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the <b>revers</b> was lined with black silk facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black frock coats without self-faced <b>revers</b> were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 15th century, a new style of overgown appeared; this was of various lengths, {{generally}} worn unbelted, and featured wide turned back <b>revers</b> and collar.|$|E
25|$|Early in this period, men's {{silhouette}} {{was long}} and narrow, but gradually it grew wider until by the later reign of Henry the VIII the silhouette was almost square, with shoulder emphasis achieved through wide <b>revers</b> and collars and large sleeves.|$|E

25|$|The {{buttons on}} a frock coat were always covered in cloth, often {{to match the}} silk on the <b>revers,</b> showing in the {{triangle}} of lining wrapped over {{the inside of the}} lapels. Another common feature was the use of fancy buttons with a snow-flake or check pattern woven over it.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} to the traditional habit was a coat-dress called a joseph or riding coat (borrowed in French as redingote), usually of unadorned or simply trimmed woolen fabric, with full-length, tight sleeves and a broad collar with lapels or <b>revers.</b> The redingote was later worn as an overcoat with the light-weight chemise dress.|$|E

25|$|Through {{most of the}} Victorian era until {{towards the}} end, the lapels were cut {{separately}} and sewn on later, apparently because it made the lapel roll more elegantly. The <b>revers</b> {{from the inside of}} the coat wrapped over to the front, creating a small triangle of silk, while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This was a feature of double-breasted frock coats used on all such coats, but morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice, began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) around the end of the Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button holes was created down the lapel edge, but by Edwardian period these were reduced down to just the one lapel boutonnière button hole.|$|E
25|$|Once double breasted frock coats were established, lapels were sharply creased {{and their}} form was more static, varying only in {{details such as}} height, since they were buttoned nearly to the neck by the Edwardians, then {{lengthened}} to the classic three-button shape, the two-button jacket being a further American innovation. The other significant change over that period {{was the use of}} the <b>revers</b> {{in the construction of the}} lapel, as the Victorians used elaborate three-part patterns to cut a fold of cloth from the lining into the front of the lapel, a universal consideration of frock coats and dress coats of the period, but abandoned in favor of the current single-piece lapels at the same time as the switch to morning coats and lounge suits. Modern lapels are largely identical in form to their 1930s counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{military}} officers {{involved in the}} <b>Revers</b> Report scandal (Rapport <b>Revers)</b> such as Salan were pessimistic {{about the way the}} war was being conducted, with multiple political-military scandals all happening during the war, starting with the Generals' Affair (Affaire des Généraux) from September 1949 to November 1950. As a result, General Georges <b>Revers</b> was dismissed in December 1949 and socialist Defense Ministry Jules Moch (SFIO) was brought on court by the National Assembly on November 28, 1950. Emerging media played their role. The scandal started the commercial success of the first French news magazine, L'Express, created in 1953. The third scandal was financial-political, concerning military corruption, money and arms trading involving both the French Union army and the Viet Minh, known as the Piastres affair. The war ended in 1954 but its sequel started in French Algeria where the French Communist Party played an even stronger role by supplying the National Liberation Front (FLN) rebels with intelligence documents and financial aid.
