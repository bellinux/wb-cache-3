2500|$|TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors (often {{referred}} to as TALEs, but {{not to be confused}} with the three amino acid loop extension homeobox sub-family of proteins) are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria via their type III secretion system when they infect various plant species. [...] These proteins can bind promoter sequences in the host plant and activate the expression of plant genes that aid bacterial infection. [...] They recognize plant DNA sequences through a central repeat domain consisting of a variable number of ~34 amino acid repeats. [...] There appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between the identity of two critical amino acids in each repeat and each DNA base in the target sequence. [...] These proteins are interesting to researchers both for their role in disease of important crop species and the relative ease of <b>retargeting</b> them to bind new DNA sequences. [...] Similar proteins can be found in the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and Burkholderia rhizoxinica., as well as yet unidentified marine microorganisms. The term TALE-likes is used to refer to the putative protein family encompassing the TALEs and these related proteins.|$|E

Our <b>retargetting</b> consists of two steps: base mesh and detail mesh <b>retargetting.</b> For base mesh <b>retargetting,</b> we use an example-based technique {{to take advantage of the}} intuition of the user in specifying the similarity between source and target expressions.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for motion <b>retargetting</b> i. e. adjusting motion-capture data to different characters and scenes. In chaise of achieving universality, the existing <b>retargetting</b> techniques often become absolutely impractical for most of real-life applications. In contrast, we {{did not try to}} create a technique that can deal with practically any motion, but concentrated on creating a practical solution that is able to produce realistic results for a some subset of all motions. So, the corner-stone idea of our approach is that realistic <b>retargetting</b> can only be achieved if the algorithm is aware about the structure and specific features of the processed motion. We applied this idea to animation of human locomotion and developed a motion-analysis algorithm that can identify type/ structure of the motion and extract a lot of useful information, such as gait phases, foot-ground constraints, important features that should be preserved during <b>retargetting,</b> etc. Also, we developed an IK-based <b>retargetting</b> solver that can take advantage of using this information and can produce accurate and realistic animations of human locomotion...|$|R

40|$|A {{method has}} {{previously}} been developed to satisfy terminal rendezvous and intermediate timing constraints for planetary missions involving orbital operations. The method uses impulse factoring in which a two-impulse transfer {{is divided into three}} or four impulses which add one or two intermediate orbits. The periods of the intermediate orbits and the number of revolutions in each orbit are varied to satisfy timing constraints. Techniques are developed to <b>retarget</b> the orbital transfer in the presence of orbit-determination and maneuver-execution errors. Sample results indicate that the nominal transfer can be <b>retargeted</b> with little change in either the magnitude (Delta V) or location of the individual impulses. Additonally, the total Delta V required for the <b>retargeted</b> transfer is little different from that required for the nominal transfer.

Here, we <b>retargeted</b> adenovirus serotype 5 vectors, ablated for FX interaction, by replacing amino acids in hexon HVR 7 with RGD- 4 C or inserting the peptide into the fibre HI loop. These genetic modifications in the capsid were compatible with virus assembly, and could efficiently <b>retarget</b> transduction of the vector via the αvβ 3 / 5 integrin-mediated pathway, but did not alter immune recognition by pre-existing human neutralizing anti-HAdV- 5 antibodies or by natural antibodies in mouse serum. Thus, FX-binding-ablated HAdV- 5 can be <b>retargeted</b> but remain sensitive to immune-mediated attack.

40|$|AbstractThe {{measles virus}} (MV) vaccine lineage is a {{promising}} oncolytic but prior {{exposure to the}} measles vaccine or wild-type MV strains limits treatment utility due {{to the presence of}} anti-measles antibodies. MV entry can be redirected by displaying a polypeptide ligand on the Hemagglutinin (H) C-terminus. We hypothesized that <b>retargeted</b> MV would escape neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the H receptor-binding surface and be less susceptible to neutralization by human antisera. Using chimeric H proteins, with and without mutations that ablate MV receptor binding, we show that <b>retargeted</b> MVs escape mAbs that target the H receptor-binding surface by virtue of mutations that ablate infection via SLAM and CD 46. However, C-terminally displayed domains do not mediate virus entry in the presence of human antibodies that bind to the underlying H domain. In conclusion, utility of <b>retargeted</b> oncolytic measles viruses does not extend to evasion of human serum neutralization...|$|R

40|$|Modified {{measles virus}} (MV) has {{effective}} oncolytic activity preclinically {{and is currently}} being investigated in clinical trials for various types of cancer. We investigated the use of cystine knot proteins (CKPs) to direct MV activity. CKPs are short polypeptides that bind their targets with high affinity. We used a CKP that binds αvβ 3, αvβ 5, and α 5 β 1 integrins with single-digit nanomolar affinity to <b>retarget</b> MV to the integrins (MV-CKPint). MV-CKPint infected, replicated in, and killed human glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), and melanoma cancer cells in vitro, all of which express the target integrins. MV-CKPint activity was competitively blocked by echistatin, an integrin binding peptide. When the CKP was cleaved from the viral H protein at an included protease site, virus activity was abrogated. When delivered intravenously (i. v.), the <b>retargeted</b> virus reached a subcutaneous glioblastoma tumor bed and produced cytopathic effects similar to that shown by intratumoral injection of the virus. Because these target integrins are overexpressed by tumor vascular endothelium, MV-CKPint may allow for effective therapy with i. v. injection. These results indicate {{for the first time}} that CKPs can be used to <b>retarget</b> MV for a receptor of choice. In addition, MV-CKPint provides proof of principle for the use of a CKP of interest to <b>retarget</b> any enveloped virus for both oncolytic and gene therapy purposes...|$|R
