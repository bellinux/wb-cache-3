2500|$|For 1964 {{significant}} engineering changes occurred, {{while the}} model lineup and styling remained relatively unchanged. The engine displacement was increased from [...] {{by an increase}} in stroke. The base engine power increased from , and the high performance engine increased from [...] The Spyder engine rating remained at [...] despite the displacement increase of the engine. 1964 saw an improvement in the car's swing axle rear suspension {{with the addition of a}} transverse leaf spring along with softer rear coil springs designed to diminish rear <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> and foster more neutral handling. Spring rates could now be softer at both ends of the car compared to previous models. The heavy duty suspension was no longer optional, although all models now had a front anti-roll bar as standard. Brakes were improved with finned rear drums. The remaining pickup, the Rampside, was discontinued at the end of the model year.|$|E
50|$|The other {{function}} of anti-roll bars is to tune the handling balance of a car. Understeer or oversteer {{behavior can be}} tuned out by changing {{the proportion of the}} total <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> that comes from the front and rear axles. Increasing the proportion of <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> at the front increases the proportion of the total load transfer that the front axle reacts to—and decreases the proportion that the rear axle reacts to. In general, this makes the outer front wheel run at a comparatively higher slip angle, and the outer rear wheel to run at a comparatively lower slip angle, which is an understeer effect. Increasing the proportion of <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> at the rear axle has the opposite effect and decreases understeer.|$|E

40|$|The {{addition}} of a cosmetic glove to an upper limb prosthesis has a distinct effect on the cosmetic value, but its viscoelastic behaviour adds {{a substantial amount of}} stiffness and hysteresis to the system. As a result, the overall usability of the prosthesis is degraded. A novel negative stiffness element is designed to compensate for the cosmetic glove’s stiffness. A combination of linear helical springs and the concept of rolling link mechanisms has resulted in a <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stiffness</b> Compensation Mechanism (RSCM). Results show that the RSCM is capable of exerting a progressive negative stiffness characteristic and can be built small enough to fit inside a 33 mm diameter wrist. Using the RSCM, an otherwise voluntary opening toddler-sized prosthesis is converted into a voluntary closing device, reducing maximum operation forces down to 40 N with a combined efficiency of 52 %. Further adjustments to the design are possible to further improve the efficiency of the mechanism. Moreover, changes in geometric relations of the mechanism offers possibilities {{for a wide range of}} prostheses and other applications. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{stiffness}} of a bicycle wheel {{can be measured}} in three primary directions: radial, lateral, and torsional. The radial stiffness is primarily a measure of how well the wheel absorbs bumps from the surface on which it <b>rolls.</b> Lateral <b>stiffness,</b> especially of the front wheel influences the handling of the bicycle. Torsional, or tangential stiffness is a measure of how well the wheel transmits propulsive and braking forces, if applied at the hub, {{as in the case of}} hub or disk brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Early Porsche 911s - {{suffered}} from treacherous lift off oversteer (where {{the rear of}} the car loses grip as the driver lifts off the accelerator); also the inside front wheel leaves the road during hard cornering on dry pavement, causing increasing understeer. The <b>roll</b> bar <b>stiffness</b> at the front is set to compensate for the rear-heaviness and gives neutral handling in ordinary driving. This compensation starts to give out when the wheel lifts. A skilled driver can use the 911's other features to his/her advantage, making the 911 an extremely capable sports car in expert hands. Later 911s have had increasingly sophisticated rear suspensions and larger rear tires, eliminating these problems.|$|R
50|$|Anti-roll bars provide {{two main}} {{function}}s. The first function is {{the reduction of}} body lean. The reduction of body lean {{is dependent on the}} total <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the vehicle. Increasing the total <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> of a vehicle does not change the steady state total load (weight) transfer from the inside wheels to the outside wheels, it only reduces body lean. The total lateral load transfer is determined by the CG height and track width.|$|E
50|$|Roll {{center height}} {{is a product}} of {{suspension}} instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> distribution. Conventionally, <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than roll center height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.|$|E
50|$|Hydropneumatic {{suspension}} {{offers no}} natural <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness.</b> There {{have been many}} improvements to the system over the years, including steel anti-roll bars, variable ride firmness (Hydractive), and active control of body roll (Citroën Activa).|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of the railway system in terms of dynamic loading is depending mainly on the track support conditions. Usually, the track stiffness is used as the main parameter to describe the support conditions and {{is defined as the}} ratio of the load applied to the rail over the vertical rail deflection. Ideally that parameter is constant, but in reality this condition is very unlikely to happen. Therefore, there is non-uniform track loading and non-uniform track deterioration, generally known as differential settlement, leading to a general increment of maintenance and renewal costs. Even if it {{plays a major role in}} the system dynamics, it is very difficult to derive a measure of the actual variability of the track stiffness along the railway. There are many techniques to experimentally acquire those values, for example using the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) equipment or the Swedish <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stiffness</b> Measurement Vehicle (RSDV) measuring train. However, these measures are usually very costly and limited in extension. The measuring data may not be long enough to be statistically representative, and thus it is not possible to have a clear correlation between the physical properties of the railway system and its long-term behaviour without running simulations with extended track data. The main aim of the present study is to assess the role of longitudinal variability of the vertical track stiffness in the long-term behaviour of the track degradation. In particular, new sets of track stiffness data which can appropriately reproduce the statistical properties of the real ones will be simulated. Then, the variability of the outputs of the vehicle dynamic model depending on the variability in the inputs will be statistically analysed. This is inspired in past research that highlighted the role of vertical stiffness in track deterioration, but not looking at the actual longitudinal variability of vertical stiffness as a contributing factor...|$|R

The mouth roll forming process requires good elongation properties {{of the board and}} the plastic coating. A well formed mouth <b>roll</b> provides good <b>stiffness</b> and handling properties in the cup. The basis weights of the cup boards are 170-350 g/m2.|$|R
40|$|So-called "cluster mills" {{for cold}} rolling are {{currently}} preferred to prevent strip faults, as the back-up rolls {{present on the}} work <b>rolls</b> assure the <b>stiffness</b> required to avoid bending. An effective prediction of dynamic behaviour using an analytical approach is more difficult than for 2 and 4 -high mills. The aim {{of this paper is}} to find models to simulate operating conditions in cluster mills. Two typical test cases such as Sendzimir and Z-mill are used to detect relevant aspects of dynamics on the experimental signatures, acquired in service. A multi-level approach, based on a core mill model and on some additional models, is proposed to investigate second order approximation problems. Co-simulation with the core model is avoided, as it takes too long. Phenomena, models, available tools and implementation issues are systematically analysed, while a preliminary experimental validation of results, based on available industrial mills, is discusse...|$|R
50|$|Fluid {{from the}} two outside wheel {{hydraulic}} cylinders flows to the accumulator to raise the suspension's <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness.</b> This counteracts centrifugal force, reducing the degree of sinking on the vehicle's outer side and helps to minimize passenger fluctuation of view.|$|E
50|$|A dog-trailer (also {{called a}} pup) is any trailer that is hooked to a {{converter}} dolly, {{with a single}} A-frame drawbar that fits into the Ringfeder or pintle hook on {{the rear of the}} trailer in front, giving the whole unit three to five articulation points and very little <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness.</b>|$|E
50|$|Excessive <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness,</b> {{typically}} {{achieved by}} configuring an anti-roll bar too aggressively, {{can make the}} inside wheels lift off the ground during hard cornering. This {{can be used to}} advantage: many front wheel drive production cars lift a rear wheel when cornering hard in order to overload the opposite wheel, limiting understeer.|$|E
30|$|A vector {{evaluation}} method for overall {{control of the}} whole crown and center crown was proposed by Peng, et al. [59]. The method {{can be used to}} analyze {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} 6 -high HC, 6 -high CVC, 4 -high CVC, and ordinary 4 -high mills and thus serves as an analytical tool and an important reference for rolling mill type selection. Xv[60] proposed a set of complete evaluation indexs system for shape control performance. The seven specific indexes are the adjustment range of the roll gap crown, <b>roll</b> gap transverse <b>stiffness,</b> uniformity of contact pressure among rolls, crown control performance of roll bending, edge drop control performance, shape controlling actuator efficiency, and the basic crown of loaded roll gap. This set of index system provides the measure for the comprehensive performance evaluation of various rolling mills. Liu [61] introduced two new indexes including the adjustment range of shape and shape control performance of roll bending, which make the indexs system more scientific and practical.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the design of}} a newly developed 2 DoF robotic arm with a novel statically balanced and bi-stable compliant grasper as the end effector for laparoscopic surgery application. The arm is based on internal motors actuating 2 rotational DoFs: pitch and <b>roll.</b> The positive <b>stiffness</b> of the monolithic grasper has been compensated using pre-curved straight guided beams that are preloaded collinear with the direction of actuation of the grasper. The result is a fully compliant statically balanced laparoscopic grasper. The grasper has been successfully adapted to a robotic arm. The maximum force and stiffness compensations were measured to be 94 % and 97 % (i. e. near zero stiffness) respectively. Furthermore, the feasibility of adjusting for bi-stable behavior has been shown. This research can be a preliminary step towards {{the design of a}} statically balanced fully compliant robotic arm for laparoscopic surgery and similar areas.

40|$|Abstract: Cold ring rolling {{is a kind}} of {{advanced}} manufacturing technology. During rolling process the ring may be collapsed or deformed unexpectedly under the pressure of guide <b>roll</b> because the <b>stiffness</b> condition is not met. The force of guide roll to ring was obtained by analyzing the forces to ring. The stiffness condition expressions of ring during rolling were shown after constructing the mechanical model. According to the expressions, the effects of several parameters on the stiffness condition were discussed and analyzed in detail, such as position angle of guide roll, friction coefficient and feed rate, etc, which revealed essential reasons of some cases occurring in cold ring rolling. Then the ring blank dimension was deduced based on the ring stiffness condition. The dimensions of ring blank should meet a relationship to ensure the ring stiffness condition to be satisfied during rolling, which can conduct the practical manufacturing effectively. Finally the analysis and effect laws were proved by finite element simulation experiments. The researches could be helpful to control parameter in cold ring rolling effectively for high quality products...|$|R
50|$|In a {{magazine}} interview for 'CAR' {{magazine in the}} late 1980s, Dr Moulton stated that he and Issigonis had also studied the Citroën 2CV in the 1950s, which featured fore/aft interconnected steel springs. They particularly wished to address the comical lack of <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> of that car with the system that they were designing.|$|E

50|$|Roll {{couple is}} {{resisted}} by the suspension <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness,</b> {{which is a}} function of the spring rate of the vehicle's springs and of the anti-roll bars, if any. The use of anti-roll bars allows designers to reduce roll without making the suspension's springs stiffer in the vertical plane, which allows improved body control with less compromise of ride quality.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} two {{attitude control}} laws suitable for atmospheric flight vehicles {{with a steady}} angular momentum bias in the vehicle yaw axis. This bias {{is assumed to be}} provided by an internal flywheel, and is introduced to enhance <b>roll</b> and pitch <b>stiffness.</b> The first control law is based on Lyapunov stability theory, and stability proofs are given. The second control law, which assumes that the angular momentum bias is large, is based on a classical PID control. It is shown that the large yaw-axis bias requires that the PI feedback component on the roll and pitch angle errors be cross-fed. Both control laws are applied to a vehicle simulation in the presence of disturbances for several values of yaw-axis angular momentum bias. It is seen that both control laws provide a significant improvement in attitude performance when the bias is sufficiently large, but the nonlinear control law is also able to provide improved performance for a small value of bias. This is important because the smaller bias corresponds to a smaller requirement for mass to be dedicated to the flywheel...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program is {{developed for the}} dynamic analysis of a spar platform coupled with mooring lines and risers in waves, winds, and currents. The new multi-contact analysis program is developed for the nonlinear multi-contact coupling between vertical risers and guide frames inside of the spar moon-pool. The program extends capability of the current coupled dynamic analysis program, WINPOST, by adding the capability of analyzing riser effects caused by the contact forces and moments from buoyancy-cans inside the spar moon-pool on the global spar motions. The gap between the buoyancy can and riser guide frames are modeled using three different types of nonlinear gap springs. The new riser model also considers the Coulomb damping between the buoyancy-cans and riser guide frames, and it also calculates the impact force on risers for use in fatigue analysis. The spar platform generally uses vertical risers with dry trees. However, as the water depth increases, {{the size of the}} buoyancy-can increases, and it makes installation more difficult. The pneumatic riser support system does not use buoyancy-cans and is an alternative solution to the buoyancy-can approach. The dynamic characteristics of pneumatic riser support system are studied by using the newly developed numerical analysis program. The damped Mathieu instability diagram for the damped Mathieu's equation is developed. Due to spar heave and pitch coupling, Mathieu's instability may become excited in long period waves. In the numerical analysis program, pitch and <b>roll</b> hydrostatic <b>stiffness</b> are recalculated for heave motion in every time step to check Mathieu's instability for the spar platform. Simplified vortex-induced vibration effects on the spar platform are considered in newly developed numerical analysis program, and the results are systematically compared with those of the original program WINPOST. The results in this paper show that the buoyancy-can effect significantly reduces the spar pitch motion, and the Coulomb damping effect also significantly reduces the spar heave motion. The buoyancy-can effect also {{plays an important role in}} Mathieu instability. The results also show that a pneumatic riser support system increases the spar heave motion and payload...|$|R
30|$|The {{identified}} natural frequencies, damping ratios, {{and corresponding}} mode shapes of VCS-EP and VHIS {{are presented in}} Table  5. As shown in Table  5, vehicle body–wheel motion-modes referring to the relative motion between body and wheels can be classified into seven modes {{in terms of the}} modal shapes. The normalized factor of the state vectors is used to distinguish seven modes. The motion corresponding to the maximum absolute value of the normalized factor in each modal shape represents one mode of the body-wheel motions. The values in the black bold font reveal that the first three mode shapes are called the body-dominated motion-modes, namely roll (1 st), bounce (2 nd), and pitch (3 rd) motions of the sprung mass, and the following four mode shapes are called the wheel-dominated motion-modes, namely, the pitch (4 th), bounce (5 th), roll (6 th), and warp (7 th) motions of the unsprung mass. For the VCS-EP, the equivalent stiffness kpsj (j[*]=[*]fl, fr, rl, rr) is 265  N/mm. For the VHIS, the equivalent stiffness kbsi (i[*]=[*]fl, fr) and kbsj (j[*]=[*]rl, rr) are 129.2 N/mm and 167.4 N/mm, respectively. In Table  5, the HIS system can effectively increase the pitch mode (the 3 rd mode) frequency (from 2.539 Hz/VCS-EP to 2.747 Hz/VHIS) of the sprung mass vibration, and reduce the bounce mode (the 2 nd mode) frequency (from 2.351 Hz/VCS-EP to 1.906 Hz/VHIS). The result illustrates that the proposed HIS system can provide a higher pitch mode stiffness owing to the large fluids rapidly flowing into the accumulator in the pitch mode, and the lower bounce mode stiffness owing to the large fluids freely flowing in the hydraulic circuits. Owing to the soft mechanical suspensions, the body roll mode (the 1 st mode) frequencies (1.286 Hz/VHIS) of the VHIS are lower than that of the VCS-EP. It is also observed that the proposed HIS system is unable to provide the extra <b>roll</b> mode <b>stiffness.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{handling}} pack used in {{this car}} was Computer Active Technology Suspension (CATS) which was also used on the Jaguar XK-R. These enhancements include revised electronic control unit settings and revised damper settings for taut, dynamic handling as well as uprated springs and anti-roll bars for increased <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness.</b> The pack also includes a retuned variable ratio, speed-sensitive steering system.|$|E
50|$|Automakers often {{perceive}} {{providing an}} adequate degree of ride quality as a compromise with car handling, because cars with firm suspension offer more <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness,</b> keeping the tires more {{perpendicular to the}} road. Similarly, a lower center of gravity is more ideal for handling, but low bodywork forces the driver's and passengers' legs more forward and less down, and low ground clearance limits suspension travel, requiring stiffer springs.|$|E
5000|$|The final major {{facelift}} for the GT6 came in 1970 in {{the form}} of the Mk III. This time the entire bodyshell was revised to match the changes made to the Spitfire Mk IV: modifications included a cut-off rear end, recessed door handles and a smoother front end. Only detail changes were made to the mechanics, but in 1973 - close to the end of the car's production life - the rear suspension was changed again, this time for the cheaper (but still effective) [...] "swing-spring" [...] layout fitted to the Spitfire Mk IV. This was a modification of the swing axle rear suspension used on the Herald-derived models, with the transverse leaf spring mounted on a pivot, eliminating <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> at the rear, and thus greatly reducing the jacking effect under cornering loads. To compensate for this loss of <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness,</b> a larger front anti-roll bar was fitted. A brake servo was also added in 1973, and seats were changed from vinyl to cloth. There was still a fairly comprehensive options list, but the knock-on wire wheels were no longer available. The unladen weight increased slightly to 2030 lb.|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of fluidic X-coupling of hydro-pneumatic suspension struts {{on the various}} suspension properties are investigated for a sport utility vehicle (SUV). The stiffness and damping properties in the bounce, pitch, roll and warp modes are particularly addressed together with the couplings between the roll, pitch, bounce and warp modes of the vehicle. The proposed X-coupled suspension configuration involves diagonal hydraulic couplings among the different chambers of the four hydro-pneumatic struts. The static and dynamic forces developed by the struts of the unconnected and X-coupled suspensions are formulated using a simple generalized model, which are subsequently used to derive the stiffness and damping properties. The properties of the X-coupled suspension are {{compared with those of}} the unconnected suspension configuration, in terms of four fundamental vibration modes, namely bounce, roll, pitch and warp, to illustrate the significant effects of fluidic couplings. The results suggest that the X-coupling could help achieve greater <b>roll</b> and pitch <b>stiffness</b> and damping, with negligible effects on the bounce and warp mode properties. It is further shown that the X-coupled struts offer greater design flexibility to achieve better compromise among different conflicting measures. From the results, it was concluded that the proposed X-coupling of the suspension struts could help achieve improved roll stability, handling and pitch control, without sacrificing the bounce ride quality and road-holding performance of SUVs during both the on- and off-road driving conditions...|$|R
50|$|The twist-beam rear {{suspension}} (also torsion-beam axle or deformable torsion beam) {{is a type}} of automobile suspension based on a large H or C shaped member. The front of the H attaches to the body via rubber bushings, and the rear of the H carries each stub-axle assembly, {{on each side of the}} car. The cross beam of the H holds the two trailing arms together, and provides the <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the suspension, by twisting as the two trailing arms move vertically, relative to each other.|$|E
50|$|Some {{anti-roll}} bars, {{particularly those}} {{intended for use}} in auto racing, are externally adjustable while the car is in the pit whereas some systems can be adjusted in real time by the driver from inside the car, such as in Super GT. This allows the stiffness to be altered, for example by increasing or reducing {{the length of the}} lever arms on some systems, or by rotating a flat lever arm from a stiff edge-on position to a more flexible flat-side-on position on other systems. This lets a mechanic tune the <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> for different situations without replacing the entire bar.|$|E
50|$|RCS {{effectively}} reduces {{body roll}} and pitching by hydraulically connecting all the shock absorbers together and regulating their damping pressures as necessary. Able to control both roll and pitching stiffness separately, RCS can {{operate in a}} variety of ways. It can, for example, reduce roll only when required during turn in or in other situations while being set up on the soft side to prioritize tire contact and ride comfort. Since the system controls <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> hydraulically, it eliminates the need for stabilizer bars. In the integrated control of its component systems, S-AWC employs information from RCS's hydraulic system to estimate the tire load at each wheel.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} changes, though seemingly subtle, {{transformed the}} soft {{and less than}} well-controlled ride of the Mulsanne Turbo into that of a real performer. Development on improving handling had already begun when Mike Dunn was appointed engineering director in Crewe in February 1983, but instead of the proposed 10% increase in <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness,</b> he demanded 50%. This goal was met by upping the anti-roll bar rates by 100% in front and 60% in the rear, and by increasing the damping. A Panhard rod to anchor the rear sub-frame was also introduced, reducing side-to-side movement in corners. Spring rates remained the same as on the Mulsanne.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} most {{desirable}} {{to have the}} car adjusted for {{a small amount of}} understeer, so that it responds predictably to a turn of the steering wheel and the rear wheels have a smaller slip angle than the front wheels. However this may not be achievable for all loading, road and weather conditions, speed ranges, or while turning under acceleration or braking. Ideally, a car should carry passengers and baggage near its center of gravity and have similar tire loading, camber angle and <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> in front and back to minimise the variation in handling characteristics. A driver can learn to deal with excessive oversteer or understeer, but not if it varies greatly {{in a short period of}} time.|$|E
50|$|The Hydraulic Body Motion Control System (HBMC) {{technology}} was employed initially in the Nissan Patrol, and subsequently the Infiniti QX. The system was invented and developed by Nissan Motors and was tested on the Nissan Patrol in the Middle East. The system helps reduce body lean while turning {{for a more}} comfortable ride. Utilizing hydraulic cylinders located at the shock absorbers (connected via cross piping and two accumulators), it adjusts <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> by allowing transfer of fluid between {{the left and right}} sides of the vehicle through passive weight transfer during normal driving. It also helps reduce bump shock by setting bounce and roll damping forces separately. In off-road conditions, HBMC activates when it senses that a wheel has dropped.|$|E
50|$|Load {{transfer}} is {{of critical importance}} for vehicle stability in vehicles such as SUVs. Ideally in high performance applications load transfer tends to be minimized as a tire's performance is directly affected {{by the amount of}} load that it has to transmit. In a steady state turn the final load transfer, summed across all the axles, is only related to the position of the center of mass above the ground, the track width and the lateral acceleration. SUVs must shift their center of mass lower, widen their wheel track, or decrease their lateral acceleration to avoid tipping. To keep them from tipping many auto manufacturers use tires with lower grip to reduce the vehicles cornering capacity, or the <b>roll</b> <b>stiffness</b> balance front to rear can be altered to encourage understeer or oversteer as necessary to limit the maximum lateral acceleration of the vehicle.|$|E
