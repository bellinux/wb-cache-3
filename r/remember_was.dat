5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting {{is one of the}} things that got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, to the point that at times all he could <b>remember</b> <b>was</b> the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
5|$|A Night to <b>Remember</b> <b>was</b> only Lord's {{second book}} {{but was a}} huge success, thanks {{in no small part}} to the {{aggressive}} advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955. The book also undoubtedly benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film Titanic and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time. Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as a best-seller for six months. The Ladies' Home Journal and Reader's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.|$|E
5|$|For {{producing}} the new songs for the album, Madonna worked with David Foster and Nellee Hooper, the former {{known for his}} work with such artists as Barbra Streisand and Olivia Newton-John. Madonna stated that the concept for the album was to make fans and critics alike remember her music contributions rather than her media controversies. Something to <b>Remember</b> <b>was</b> well received by music critics who were impressed with Madonna's vocals and the album's cohesiveness. It was also a commercial success, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Finland, and Italy, and peaking within top ten elsewhere. In the United States, it reached number six on the Billboard 200 and was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of three million units. Worldwide, Something to Remember has sold over ten million copies.|$|E

25|$|Elephants Can <b>Remember</b> <b>was</b> {{cited in}} a study done in 2009 using {{computer}} science to compare Christie's earlier works to her later ones. The sharp drops in vocabulary size and increases in repeated phrases and indefinite nouns suggested Christie may have been suffering from some form of onset dementia, perhaps what later became known as Alzheimer's disease. The subject of the book being memory may be another clue.|$|E

25|$|Titanic {{has gone}} {{down in history as}} the ship that was called unsinkable. For more than 100 years, she has been the {{inspiration}} of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking memorial postcards sold in huge numbers together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers, and even black mourning teddy bears. Several survivors wrote books about their experiences {{but it was not until}} 1955 the first historically accurate book A Night to <b>Remember</b> <b>was</b> published.|$|E
25|$|Christie {{wrote the}} novel {{in the early}} 1940s, during World War II. Partly fearing for her own survival, and wanting to have a fitting end to Poirot's series of novels, Christie had the novel locked away in a bank vault for over thirty years. The final Poirot novel that Christie wrote, Elephants Can <b>Remember,</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in 1972, followed by Christie's last novel, Postern of Fate. Christie authorised Curtains removal from the vault and subsequent publication. It {{was the last of}} her books to be published during her lifetime.|$|E

25|$|In November, Anatol E. Baconsky was reelected to the Writers' Union Committee, and, in 1969, his <b>Remember</b> <b>was</b> awarded Steaua 's annual prize. He {{visited the}} Hungarian capital Budapest, invited {{by the local}} branch of the International PEN. Late in 1969, he {{published}} the poetry volume Cadavre în vid ("Thermoformed Dead Bodies"), which was granted the 1970 Award by the Writers' Union. Also in 1970, his Echinoxul nebunilor was translated into German by Austrian author Max Demeter Peyfuss, being released in Austria, West Germany and Switzerland. The Romanian writer attended the event in Vienna, before leaving for Paris. The following year, he traveled to West Germany and again to Austria. Over the following three years, these visits were depicted by Baconsky in his permanent column at the journal Magazin. He also published his first volume {{on the art of}} Romania—a monograph dedicated to and named after painter Dimitrie Ghiaţă.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Caragiale's {{collected}} writings, {{edited by}} Barbu Cioculescu, were republished {{in a single}} edition, while his copy of Octav-George Lecca's Familii boierești române, featuring his many comments and sketches, {{was the basis for}} a 2002 reprint. In addition to the volumes of recollections by [...] "Grigri" [...] Ghica and Ionel Gherea, Mateiu Caragiale is mentioned in Gheorghe Jurgea-Negrilești's book of memoirs, Troica amintirilor. Sub patru regi ("The Troika of Recollections. Under Four Kings"), published only after the Revolution. The work depicts notable episodes in his Bohemian life, including a scene where the overweight and inebriated Admiral Vessiolkin leaps over tables at Casa Capșa and recites English-language quotes from William Shakespeare to an audience comprising Caragiale and various by-standers. In 2007, <b>Remember</b> <b>was</b> issued as an audiobook, read by actor Marcel Iureș.|$|E

500|$|His final album for Epic Records, titled A Night to <b>Remember,</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in 1999. As {{he did with}} the new cuts for his Greatest Hits package, Diffie worked with producers Don Cook and Lonnie Wilson, a friend of Diffie's who worked primarily as a session drummer and songwriter, and formerly fronted the band Bandana. Its title track spent twenty-nine weeks on the country charts and peaked at number six; it was his only Top 40 on the Hot 100, where it reached number 38. After this song came [...] "The Quittin' Kind" [...] and [...] "It's Always Somethin'", which respectively reached twenty-one and five on the country charts, and 90 and 57 on the Hot 100. The latter spent thirty-seven weeks on the country music charts, the longest chart run achieved by any of his singles.|$|E
500|$|At the time, teams rarely {{employed}} {{tactics of}} any sort – Chapman would later remark: [...] "No {{attempt was made to}} organise victory. The most that I <b>remember</b> <b>was</b> the occasional chat between, say two men playing on the same wing." [...] As a manager, he sought to change that; after seeing Northampton lose to Norwich City despite dominating, Chapman opined that [...] "a team can attack for too long". He thus set about creating a tactical framework for all his players; he dropped the half backs (midfield) back to give his forwards more space and draw the opposition defenders out of the penalty area, while encouraging his own back line to pass their way out of trouble. Gradually, he created a style of highly-organised, counter-attacking football, which was at odds with the prevailing orthodoxy but nevertheless highly effective; Swindon Town's England international Harold Fleming, after losing 4–1 at home to Northampton, remarked to Chapman: [...] "You have something more than a team: you have a machine." ...|$|E
500|$|Something to <b>Remember</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in some European countries on November 3, 1995. In Madonna's native country, {{the album was}} released on November 7, 1995. In Japan, the album was released under the title Best of Madonna: Ballad Collection on November 10, 1995, containing her 1986 song [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] as a bonus track. [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] was re-released three months prior the compilation as a double A-side record with [...] "Human Nature", the final single from Bedtime Stories. Receiving gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), the song was added to Something to Remember track listing {{in the hope of}} boosting the album sales in the region. In Latin America, the album included the bonus track [...] "Verás", the Spanish version of [...] "You'll See". In 2001, WEA Records released a box set of Something to Remember and The Immaculate Collection to coincide with the release of Madonna's second greatest hits package, GHV2.|$|E

40|$|Pigeons {{performed}} a delayed matching-to-sample task in which {{large or small}} reinforcers for correct <b>remembering</b> <b>were</b> signaled during the retention interval. Accuracy was low when small reinforcers were signaled, and high when large reinforcers were signaled (the signaled magnitude effect). When the reinforcer-size cue was switched from small to large partway through the retention interval, accuracy accordingly changed from low to high. The opposite happened when the cue was switched from large to small. This dissociation of forgetting from {{the passage of time}} raises the possibility that <b>remembering</b> <b>is</b> delay-specific. The reversal of the signaled magnitude effect during the retention interval is consistent with an attentional account in which the stimulus control of <b>remembering</b> <b>is</b> influenced by extraneous events...|$|R
