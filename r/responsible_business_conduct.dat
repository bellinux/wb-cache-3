40|$|Achievement of a {{sustainable}} future implies {{a collaborative effort}} between a variety of stakeholders including industry, government, and academia. We are traveling in unfamiliar waters where the course is not always clear and the goals are sometimes daunting. To develop the environmental wisdom {{we need to help}} us know the “right answers,” we must bring together the knowledge we get from our academic pursuits with the experience we obtain through trial and error. Bringing together the academic world and the business world not only helps us solve the immediate engineering need, it more importantly builds a partnership that will produce greater lasting value through students (future employees) who are attuned to the market demands for improved environmental performance in both business practices and products. This paper describes a new collaborative effort between Steelcase, Inc. and Kettering University that will prepare future engineers, managers, scientists, and policy-makers for a workplace that places greater emphasis on <b>conducting</b> <b>business</b> within a framework of environmental and social responsibility. Since its founding in 1912, Steelcase, Inc. has approached its business from a “value driven” perspective, focused on the underlying premise of how a <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> should <b>conduct</b> itself. As such, Steelcase, Inc. has been a leading company in promoting sustainable business practices both within the corporation and among a variety of other constituents. Kettering University (formerly GMI Engineering and Management Institute) has been preparing engineers and managers for the workforce since 1919, emphasizing the importance of leadership, integrity, and practical experience as the keys to success in the workplace. Together these organizations, along with other partners, are committed to demonstrating the practice need for enhanced education in issues of sustainability and social responsibility...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concentrates on}} <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> in the neoliberal era. In a multi-step approach this work aims {{to present a}} new composition of perspectives on <b>responsible</b> <b>business.</b> The reader is guided from a narrow perspective on <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> – presented by corporate social responsibility (CSR) concepts and current CSR strategies applied by businesses – to the legal aspects of <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> and finally to the bigger picture resulting from a closer examination of the prevailing political and economic conditions of our time. Over five chapters a more diversified view on <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> today will be unfolded step-by-step {{and placed in a}} wider context of contemporary political and economic conditions. First, voluntary measures or so-called ‘soft law’ measures enabling <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> are introduced and critically discussed. Their efficiency with regard to promoting <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> is then put to the test by five case studies on global corporations and their business behaviour with regard to responsible conduct. This is followed by an introduction of legal aspects, particularly ‘hard law’ measures, both in theory and in practice in the fourth chapter. Thereafter, in chapter five, <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> is placed in the wider context of international politics and the global economy. Chapter six includes an overall conclusion and an outlook on the future of <b>responsible</b> <b>business...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Responsible</b> <b>business</b> or {{corporate}} social responsibility has received increased attention {{in the past decade}} and has been identified as having the potential to make significant contributions to poverty alleviation and development. Companies are under greater pressure {{to take responsibility for their}} impacts on the societies, environment and value chain, in which they operate. There is however a great lack of research on what determines responsible behaviour in developing countries and what the impact is of ‘Western’ <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> approaches in the context of these countries. This research, investigates how <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> is practices by Dutch enterprises operational in Kenyan agribusiness and questions what this means for local sustainable development. Specific focus is put on the drivers of <b>responsible</b> <b>business,</b> the influence of stakeholders preventing and encouraging responsible behaviour and the impact of applying <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> in the value chain of a certain product. The similarities and differences that occur in <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> practices of the interviewed Dutch enterprises appear to be related to their market focus and the size of the enterprises. Results indicate that the enterprises are primarily engaged in <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> activities because this is required or a precondition by either international standardization and international market access, or by Kenyan labour and environmental laws. The international standardization has in addition led to several negative developmental impacts within certain international value chains. This research therefore discusses the implications of the findings to practice and policy proposing that there is a need to critically question: ‘how <b>responsible</b> is <b>responsible</b> <b>business?...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{demonstrate}} the unique circumstances that China poses {{for the development of}} socially <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> in China. Socially <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> is a concept that has emerged in Western nations in recent years, due to the growing environmental and social consciousness of consumers and their increasing demands for companies to meet higher standards in this regard. Socially <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> refers to those corporate entities that use the market to stimulate change in peoples’ awareness of and attitudes toward a certain social issue and, ultimately, consumer behavior and habits. China’s irresponsible corporate environment has resulted in harmful and threatening consequences, and the development of socially <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> is needed to reverse this unsustainable trend. This thesis identifies the key drivers of socially <b>responsible</b> <b>business,</b> surveys the state of those drivers in China, and draws conclusions about the likely evolution of socially <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> in China in the coming years. The conclusions demonstrate the important roles that different actors must take for this evolution to take place. The Chinese Communist Party recognizes the need for change within the corporate world, yet its rhetoric and regulations regarding corporate social responsibility are vague and do not have the institutional support for implementation and enforcement. Civil society, a medium through which socially <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> has developed in other nations, is growing with the environmental and social awareness of citizens, yet still remains closely monitored and restricted by the government. Ultimately, Chinese consumers will be the key to reversing the irresponsible business environment, just as they have been in other nations. We are already beginning to see the roots of this movement with consumers expressing that they are no longer willing to accept the status quo; however, they must channel these demand into their purchasing decisions in order to truly incentivize the Chinese business community to become more socially responsible...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} based on the empirical result of a Minor Field Study that was conducted in the small village of Paje, East coast Zanzibar, Tanzania during April-May 2012. The object of the research is Seaweed Center, a foreign initiated social <b>responsible</b> <b>business,</b> and the group of local seaweed farming women that are part owners and working for the company. With qualitative methods such as interviews and participatory observations this study sought to find out how a social <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> with the aim to create development can be perceived legitimate in a development context. Taking off in the employees point of view we discuss the perspective and expectations of social <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> and development and analyze it in relation to how legitimacy can be understood using the theoretical tools from organizational theory. To further understand the social <b>responsible</b> <b>business’s</b> legitimacy in its wider development context we are also relating our empirical data to, from the development discourse borrowed concept of local ownership. Applying these two corresponding but still different perspectives on the employees view and expectations of social <b>responsible</b> <b>business,</b> we have found that the legitimacy is high, even though the employees’ do not relate to the concept of social <b>responsible</b> <b>business.</b> Moreover, that the employees do not perceive themselves as part of the business development objective but instead as being the development actors, which we argue indicates that the local ownership is high. With this paper we hope to contribute to a wider understanding of what makes it possible and legitimate for an initiative coming from outside to operate in a complex development context...|$|R
