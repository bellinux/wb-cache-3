40|$|The {{industrial}} {{district is}} a model of production mainly related to medium and small cities characterized by industrial specializations in small and medium enterprises. However, the mapping of the phenomenon in countries as Italy and Spain suggest that industrial districts are also present in <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> The objective of this contribution is the identification, mapping and characterization of industrial districts located in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> as well as to evaluate the extent in which industrial districts in predominantly <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> have contributed to the dynamism of these areas. The analysis analyzes the importance of industrial districts for rural development and provides some recommendations regarding policy strategies. Specifically, the study illustrates some relevant results. First, industrial districts are present in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> of Italy and Spain although their importance is higher in Spain. Second, industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> are geographically concentrated in a few <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Third, patterns of specialization of industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> do not differ from their patterns in other <b>areas.</b> Fourth, predominantly <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> with industrial districts grow between two and three times faster than the rest of <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Fifth, a significant share of the growth of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> with industrial districts is explained by the more dynamic behaviour of these districts. Sixth, the results do not vary when transferring the unit of analysis from industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> to industrial districts with characteristics of predominantly <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> The existence of industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and their positive economic impact suggest that they have an important potential for development in those concrete <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> where they are present. The particularity of industrial districts suggests that any policy strategy including industrial districts should be based on the premises of a flexible bottom up framework where the key governance structure becomes the local level...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{determining}} the typology of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> {{on the basis}} of internationally established methodological approaches. The attempt to define the <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in Slovenia is made {{on the basis of}} two selected methodological approaches. The first analysis employed the OECD methodology of classification of urban-rural areas. In order to adapt this methodology to Slovenian territory, another, indicator-based analysis was conducted, where by the indicators were selected according to a previously created typology of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and according to Slovene legal bases. After the review and analysis of the indicators, individual types of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> were defined. The classification of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> was carried out in two steps. Firstly, three types of areas were determined: typical <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> transitional <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and areas of urban character. In the second step, areas were divided into demographically restricted areas, structure-restricted areas, moderately structure-restricted areas and predominantly developed areas. The comparison of these two approaches to defining <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> showed that the urban-rural classification is more suitable for Slovenian conditions and that the differences between the two approaches are minimal. In both cases, the majority of areas are classified as intermediate and transitional <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> On the national level, both classifications show similar results. All urban areas are located close to the main highway cross with its centre in Ljubljana, the capital of the country. <b>Rural</b> <b>areas</b> as well as intermediate and transitional <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> are scattered over the rest of the countryâ€™s territory without any specific pattern. Based on the comparison of the two classifications, we found out that it is impossible to define homogeneous areas on the basis of only one indicator and that a combination of several indicators is necessary...|$|R
