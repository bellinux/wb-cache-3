5|$|In 2009–2010, 97.65% of all Eastern {{suburbs and}} Illawarra {{services}} ran on-time, ranking {{it the most}} <b>reliable</b> line on the CityRail network.|$|E
5|$|Not {{everything}} {{contained in}} the New Testament gospels {{is considered to be}} historically <b>reliable.</b> Views range from their being inerrant descriptions of the life of Jesus to their providing little historical information about his life beyond the basics. According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), and not John, are the most <b>reliable</b> sources of information about Jesus.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. nuclear {{stockpile}} {{would not}} be as safe or <b>reliable</b> in the absence of testing.|$|E
5|$|The {{inability}} to compress the vein {{is one of}} the more <b>reliable</b> indications of venous thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Turbines {{offered more}} power than {{reciprocating}} engines for the same volume of machinery. This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, Charles Parsons, persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in Dreadnought. It is often said that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and more <b>reliable</b> than reciprocating engines. By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and more <b>reliable</b> than previous models.|$|E
5|$|Although {{at least}} some of the poems {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, there is a large enough body of his work contained in the relatively <b>reliable</b> Kokinshū for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style. Narihira made use of engo (related words) and kakekotoba (pivot words).|$|E
5|$|Although {{no details}} of author and date are given, {{this is likely}} to be a <b>reliable</b> source as it was {{published}} for the Manchester Ship Canal Company in 1973 or later (a picture of the reopening of the canal is on the cover).|$|E
5|$|Bede's {{extensive}} use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who consider him {{a more or less}} <b>reliable</b> historian, but do not accept the possibility of miracles.|$|E
5|$|British {{discipline}} of the First World War was not especially severe compared to most other armies of the time (e.g. the Russians and Italians). The French admitted to only 133 executions and the Germans 48, but these figures may not be <b>reliable</b> as both armies had problems with discipline.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of <b>reliable</b> reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with <b>reliable</b> reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of <b>reliable</b> cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} <b>reliable</b> and widely agreed upon figures place the total death toll of the {{massacre}} between {{the broad range of}} 40,000 to 200,000 massacre victims in the entire Nanking Special Administrative District. Some individual estimates by scholars and eyewitnesses are included in the following table.|$|E
5|$|For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is {{generally}} considered among scholars as the second most <b>reliable</b> witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is {{equal to that of}} Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is the most <b>reliable</b> witness of the text. In the Book of Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, Papyrus 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E
5|$|In U.S. {{consumer}} publications, Lexus' {{flagship model}} {{is recognized as}} one of the most <b>reliable</b> vehicles ever built, having held the top ranking in J.D. Power and Associates' U.S. Vehicle Dependability Survey for fifteen consecutive years (1994–2009), again in 2012, third place in 2013, and top again in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In children, the {{penicillamine}} test may be used. A 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered, {{and urine}} collected for 24 hours. If this {{contains more than}} 1600 μg (25 μmol), it is a <b>reliable</b> indicator of Wilson's disease. This test has not been validated in adults.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s (decade), Consumer Reports named Lexus {{among the}} top five most <b>reliable</b> brands in its Annual Car Reliability Surveys of over one million {{vehicles}} across the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Inadequate {{workforce}} {{skills and}} training, which includes {{lack of adequate}} scientific, technical, and manufacturing skills required for renewable energy production; lack of <b>reliable</b> installation, maintenance, and inspection services; and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been claimed that Heron's formula for calculating the area of a {{triangle}} from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes. However, the first <b>reliable</b> reference to the formula is given by Heron of Alexandria in the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli was a {{standout}} as {{a running back}} at Hudson High School and developed a <b>reliable</b> set of hands. Lavelli's Hudson High Explorers football team had three undefeated seasons and won three county championships. He also played baseball and basketball in high school.|$|E
5|$|Microbial {{culture from}} a throat swab is a <b>reliable</b> and {{affordable}} alternative to an RST which has high sensitivity and specificity. However, a culture requires special facilities and usually takes 48 hours {{to give a}} result, whereas an RST can give a result within several minutes.|$|E
5|$|Most Spectrum {{software}} was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes. The Spectrum {{was intended to}} work with a normal domestic cassette recorder, and despite differences in audio reproduction fidelity, the software loading process was quite <b>reliable</b> and faster than on competing systems of the time.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason {{it is likely that}} {{the surviving}} sites are not a <b>reliable</b> indicator of the original extent of these sites.|$|E
5|$|Mubarak {{asked the}} current {{aviation}} minister and {{former chief of}} Air Staff Ahmed Shafiq, {{to form a new}} government. Shafiq, a Mubarak loyalist, had often been mentioned as a potential successor to Mubarak due to his politically <b>reliable</b> nature.|$|E
5|$|Noting {{some of its}} {{architectural}} similarities, it {{is often}} stated that Delhi's Parliament House which {{was built in the}} 1920s has been patterned on the lines of this circular-shaped temple. There is, however, no <b>reliable</b> basis for this.|$|E
5|$|On a {{laboratory}} scale, lead(II) nitrate provides {{one of two}} convenient and <b>reliable</b> sources of dinitrogen tetroxide. By carefully drying lead(II) nitrate and then heating it in a steel vessel, nitrogen dioxide is produced, which dimerizes into the desired compound.|$|E
5|$|One of the studio's most <b>reliable</b> Western headliners was a dog: Ranger. The fabled Strongheart {{starred in}} FBO's White Fang (1925), and Rin Tin Tin {{had one of}} his {{earliest}} roles in My Dad (1922).|$|E
5|$|Packaging: SiC chips {{may have}} a higher power density than silicon power devices {{and are able to}} handle higher {{temperatures}} exceeding the silicon limit of 150°C. New die attach technologies such as sintering are required to efficiently get the heat out of the devices and ensure a <b>reliable</b> interconnection.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the moons}} of Saturn, {{including}} Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and {{prevent them from}} spreading out. Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded more <b>reliable</b> calculations of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Sunday's personality, demeanor, and athleticism {{made him}} {{popular with the}} fans, {{as well as with}} his teammates. Manager Cap Anson {{considered}} Sunday <b>reliable</b> enough to make him the team's business manager, which included such duties as handling the ticket receipts and paying the team's travel expenses.|$|E
5|$|The F-84C {{featured}} {{a somewhat more}} <b>reliable</b> J35-A-13 engine and had some engineering refinements. Being virtually identical to the F-84B, the C model suffered {{from all of the}} same defects and underwent a similar structural upgrade program in 1949. All F-84Cs were withdrawn from active service by 1952.|$|E

5|$|The Revolutionary War forced William and Mary {{to close}} in 1781, as its {{buildings}} were used as barracks for British, French, and American troops as each nation successively controlled the college and surrounding area. Although William C. Davis records that Breckinridge had previously served as an ensign in the Botetourt County militia, Harrison notes that the most <b>reliable</b> records of Virginians' military service do not indicate his participation in the Revolutionary War, but less <b>reliable</b> sources mention him as a subaltern in the Virginia militia. If he enlisted, Harrison speculates that he served {{in one or two}} short 1780 militia campaigns supporting Nathanael Greene's army in southwest Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The diamond can {{be split}} by a single, well {{calculated}} blow of a hammer to a pointed tool, which is quick, but risky. Alternatively, {{it can be}} cut with a diamond saw, which is a more <b>reliable</b> but tedious procedure.|$|E
