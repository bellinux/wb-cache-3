5|$|Birds {{currently}} {{receive the}} greatest attention {{in regards to}} conservation. Arguably the most successful fauna <b>recovery</b> <b>plan</b> in Puerto Rico was the Puerto Rican Parrot <b>Recovery</b> <b>Plan.</b> Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist the Puerto Rican parrot's status from critical to threatened by 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators, parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity. This program was fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico.|$|E

40|$|United States <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> contain {{biological}} {{information for}} a species listed under the Endangered Species Act and specify recovery criteria to provide basis for species recovery. The objective {{of our study}} was to evaluate whether <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> provide uncertainty (e. g., variance) with estimates of population size. We reviewed all finalized <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> for listed terrestrial vertebrate species to record the following data: (1) if a current population size was given, (2) if a measure of uncertainty or variance was associated with current estimates of population size and (3) if population size was stipulated for recovery. We found that 59 % of completed <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> specified a current population size, 14. 5 % specified a variance for the current population size estimate and 43 % specified population size as a recovery criterion. More recent <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> reported more estimates of current population size, uncertainty and population size as a recovery criterion. Also, bird and mammal <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> reported more estimates of population size and uncertainty compared to reptiles and amphibians. We suggest the use of calculating minimum detectable differences to improve confidence when delisting endangered animals and we identified incentives for individuals {{to get involved in}} <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> to improve access to quantitative data...|$|R

40|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} {{is a major}} environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> under {{the provisions of the}} Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of <b>recovery</b> <b>plans?</b> The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of <b>recovery</b> <b>plans,</b> experts’ workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 <b>recovery</b> <b>plans.</b> Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing <b>recovery</b> <b>plans,</b> key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of <b>recovery</b> <b>plans.</b> The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve <b>recovery</b> <b>planning.</b> Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in <b>recovery</b> <b>planning,</b> it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating <b>recovery</b> <b>plans.</b> State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89 % of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into <b>recovery</b> <b>planning,</b> prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system...|$|R

5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a <b>recovery</b> <b>plan</b> for them.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the <b>Recovery</b> <b>Plan</b> is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} <b>recovery</b> <b>plan</b> was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E
5|$|C. b. graptogyne, (Endangered) {{known as}} the {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo, is found in southwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia in an area bordered by Mount Gambier to the west, Portland to the south, Horsham to the northeast and Bordertown to the north. The smallest of the five subspecies, it was only recognised as distinct in the 1980s. It is predominantly dependent on stands of Eucalyptus baxteri (brown stringybark), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river redgum) and Allocasuarina luehmannii (buloke) for feeding and nesting. These tree species have been all threatened by land clearing and most remaining are on private land; possibly only 500–1000 individuals remain.

The receiver was granted partial approval to sell the project in April; 13 bids were received for the property and/or project, including from local firm Vulcan Real Estate, Las Vegas-based Molasky Group, and Chinese developer and original investor Binjiang Tower Corporation. On May 20, 2016, Judge James Robart approved a plan submitted by the receiver on behalf of Molasky and Binjiang, committing $30 million to the project and allowing for construction to resume pending final approval by foreign investors; Dargey approved the plan after a deal was struck with the new developers to pay $1.8 million of the attorney fees he had accrued during the trial.|$|E

40|$|This {{submission}} {{relates to}} a single issue, but one which may potentially impact upon the survival of an individual financial institution, and importantly {{the stability of the}} financial system; that is, organisational disaster <b>recovery</b> <b>planning.</b> Please find attached, as part of this submission, my paper which puts forward the proposition that disruption to critical business operations of a financial institution from a natural, technical or physical disaster represents a negative externality that may seriously impact the overall stability of the banking system and financial system generally. It is argued that the level of organisational disaster <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> varies significantly between banks and as such is an uncompensated risk within the financial system. This conclusion is drawn from a detailed examination of bank disaster recovery practices conducted in 1994 by the writer.
