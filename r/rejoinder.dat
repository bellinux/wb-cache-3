5|$|Thurisind, in {{observance}} {{of the laws}} of hospitality, received Alboin and his companions and organized a banquet in their honour, offering Alboin the place where his dead son habitually sat. Following a mockery by Turismod's brother Cunimund and Alboin's <b>rejoinder,</b> a clash was avoided by Thurisind's intervention, who restored the peace and sent Alboin away with Turismod's arms. According to István Boná, who believes in the veracity of the story, the event may have taken place as described by Paul, but it also could reflect a secret peace condition imposed by Audoin on Thurisind under which the Gepid king had to arm his son's killer.|$|E

Pimlott-Kubiak and Cortina found that severity and duration of abuse were the only accurate predictors of aftereffects of abuse; sex of perpetrator or victim were not reliable predictors.|$|E
25|$|A {{recently}} published <b>rejoinder</b> of the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti against the speculations of the Oore of Otun-Ekiti suffice on the superiority or supremacy contests among Ekiti Obas as the Ewi denounces Oore’s particular {{reference to his}} status as ‘the most senior Oba’ {{on the basis that}} it is a distortion of historical facts. The Ewi noted that beyond kiriji, Oore was not a prominently recognized Chief (natural ruler) in Ekitiland. Hence, the historical idea foisting his superiority was suspicious and unnecessary desire for special recognition.|$|E

In 1952 Buber and Jung exchanged letters regarding a paper Buber had published entitled “Religion and Modern Thinking”. In his <b>rejoinder,</b> Buber claimed that Jung had strayed outside his realm of expertise into theology by asserting that God does not exist independent of the psyches of human beings. He concluded that Jung was “mystically deifying the instincts instead of hallowing them in faith”, which he called a “modern manifestation of Gnosis”.|$|E

The figures for 2007 Voters Registration by INEC were an act subsequent to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborate, vindicate and validate the population figures in no uncertain terms.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Bhutto, {{who faced}} rogue {{criticism}} and a heated diplomatic {{war with the}} United States throughout the 1970s, Zia took different diplomatic approaches to counter the international pressure. From 1979 to 1983, the country was made a subject of attack by international organisation for not signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT); Zia deftly neutralised international pressure by tagging Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme to the nuclear designs of the neighbouring Indian nuclear programme. Zia, {{with the help of}} Munir Ahmad Khan and Agha Shahi, Foreign Minister, drew a five-point proposal as a practical <b>rejoinder</b> to world pressure on Pakistan to sign the NPT; the points including the renouncing of the use of nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum, volume 3 {{came out}} – edited by H. A.

Davis variously published a number of points contradicting Round's views, suggesting a loyal son's <b>rejoinder</b> to the scholar who had wounded his father. Volume ii, a collaboration of Cronne and Charles Johnson, had come out in 1956. Volume iv came out later. Ralph Davis was the main editor for volumes iii and iv.|$|E
25|$|The {{weaknesses}} in Hooper's argument, Ridley's laconic and temperate <b>rejoinder,</b> and Ridley's {{offer of a}} compromise no doubt turned the council against Hooper's inflexible convictions {{when he did not}} accept it. Heinrich Bullinger, Pietro Martire Vermigli, and Martin Bucer, while agreeing with Hooper's views, ceased to support him for the pragmatic sake of unity and slower reform. Only Jan Laski remained a constant ally. Some time in mid-December 1550, Hooper was put under house arrest, during which time he wrote and published A godly Confession and protestacion of the Christian faith. Because of this publication, his persistent nonconformism, and violations of the terms of his house arrest, Hooper was placed in Thomas Cranmer's custody at Lambeth Palace for two weeks by the Privy Council on 13 January 1551. Hooper was then sent to Fleet Prison by the council, who made that decision on 27 January. On 15 February, Hooper submitted to consecration in vestments in a letter to Cranmer. He was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester on 8 March 1551, and shortly thereafter, preached before the king in vestments.|$|E

In concluding Collon states: [...] " [...] believed that, with time, a forgery would look worse and worse, whereas a genuine object would grow better and better.

500|$|Chang also {{issued a}} <b>rejoinder</b> to Burress's {{argument}} that she incorrectly cited a telegram sent by Japan's foreign minister. She wrote {{that while the}} original figure of 300,000 Chinese civilian deaths in Nanjing was reported by a British reporter, this figure was cited in a message that Japan's foreign minister sent to his contacts in Washington, DC. Chang argued that figure's use by a high-ranking Japanese government official was evidence that the Japanese government recognized 300,000 {{as the number of}} Chinese civilian deaths. Finally, she criticized Burress for his [...] "nitpick" [...] of small details in order to draw attention away from the scope and magnitude of the Nanking Massacre, writing that such was a [...] "common tactic" [...] of Holocaust deniers.|$|E
500|$|After {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the term had become a synecdoche in Russia, as a {{reference}} referring to all of Soviet propaganda. During a trip to Washington, D.C., in 1999, then-prime minister of Russia Sergei Stepashin attempted to tell a joke using the phrase as a punchline at a speech before the National Press Club. He [...] faced a disturbing quiet from the audience in response to his attempt at humor, and he later observed those in the U.S. have difficulty understanding the Russian perspective on comedy. An alternative version of the phrase was ported for usage in Poland. The phrase also saw usage in other languages including Czech, Hungarian, and Romanian. By 2015 the phrase had entered the common lexicon in Russia as a tool to criticize any form of U.S. policy. Russians used the term between themselves so often it became a form of satire, as a ubiquitous <b>rejoinder</b> to all crises dealt with and low quality of life, including purchasing groceries or dealing with road congestion. Michael Bohm, a U.S. reporter working out of Moscow, became the target of the phrase after appearing on Sunday Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, which aired on a major state-run TV channel. Commentator Igor Korotchenko wrote [...] "people like Bohm dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they lynched Negroes." [...] In a 2015 contribution to the Russian journal International Affairs, Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and editor-in-chief Armen Oganesyan lamented the likelihood a Russian <b>rejoinder</b> to an international treaty's publication by the U.S. State Department would be viewed as a form of [...] "you lynch Negroes" [...] response. Ryabkov and Oganesyan wrote that this reaction harmed the collaborative process as it was important for nation states to disagree and enable discourse.|$|E
40|$|Does {{multiculturalism}} {{imply that}} certain cultural minorities – nomos groups, whose cultural conceptions extend {{in important ways}} into views about the law – should have forms of legal autonomy that go beyond normal multicultural accommodations such as exemptions and special protection? In other words: should we allow «minority jurisdictions» for multicultural reasons and give certain minorities powers of legislation and adjudication on certain issues? The paper sketches how one might arrive at such a conclusion given some standard multicultural reasoning, and then proceeds by examining eight key <b>rejoinders</b> to such a proposal. None of these <b>rejoinders</b> provide by themselves knockdown arguments against extending multicultural rights to forms of legal autonomy, but together they do {{provide a basis for}} some skepticism about the cogency and desirability of at least more ambitious forms of legal autonomy for cultural minorities within a liberal framework.
