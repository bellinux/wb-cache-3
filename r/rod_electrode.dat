50|$|Capacitors can {{originally}} {{be traced}} back to a device called a Leyden jar, created by the Dutch physicist Pieter van Musschenbroek. The Leyden jar consisted of a glass jar with tin foil layers on the inside and outside of the jar. A <b>rod</b> <b>electrode</b> was directly connected to the inlayer of foil by means of a small chain or wire. This device stored static electricity created when amber and wool where rubbed together.|$|E
50|$|A typical design {{consists}} of a glass jar with conducting tin foil coating {{the inner and outer}} surfaces. The foil coatings stop short of the mouth of the jar, to prevent the charge from arcing between the foils. A metal <b>rod</b> <b>electrode</b> projects through the stopper {{at the mouth of the}} jar, electrically connected by some means (usually a hanging chain) to the inner foil, to allow it to be charged. The jar is charged by an electrostatic generator, or other source of electric charge, connected to the inner electrode while the outer foil is grounded. The inner and outer surfaces of the jar store equal but opposite charges.|$|E

For lack of suitable power sources and at Oscar Kjellberg’s suggestion, Kjellberg Elektro-Maschinen GmbH was established in Finsterwalde in 1922. In 1923, the company's first welding generator developed and built in Finsterwalde, Ke 200/1450, was presented at the Leipzig spring fair.

50|$|A {{spark gap}} {{is one of}} the oldest {{protective}} electrical technologies still found in telephone circuits, having been developed in the nineteenth century. A carbon <b>rod</b> <b>electrode</b> is held with an insulator at a specific distance from a second electrode. The gap dimension determines the voltage at which a spark will jump between the two parts and short to ground. The typical spacing for telephone applications in North America is 0.076 mm (0.003"). Carbon block suppressors are similar to gas arrestors (GDTs) but with the two electrodes exposed to the air, so their behavior is affected by the surrounding atmosphere, especially the humidity. Since their operation produces an open spark, these devices should never be installed where an explosive atmosphere may develop.|$|E

40|$|Non-thermal plasma (NTP) {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{over the last few}} years as a promising after- treatment system for nitrogen oxides and particulate matter removal from diesel exhaust. NTP technology has not been commercialised as yet, due to its high rate of energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to seek out new methods to improve NTP performance. Residence time is a crucial parameter in engine exhaust emissions treatment. In this paper, different electrode shapes are analysed and the corresponding residence time and NOx removal efficiency are studied. An axisymmetric laminar model is used for obtaining residence time distribution numerically using FLUENT software. If the mean residence time in a NTP plasma reactor increases, there will be a corresponding increase in the reaction time and consequently the pollutant removal efficiency increases. Three different screw thread electrodes and a <b>rod</b> <b>electrode</b> are examined. The results show the advantage of screw thread electrodes in comparison with the <b>rod</b> <b>electrode.</b> Furthermore, between the screw thread electrodes, the electrode with the thread width of 1 mm has the highest NOx removal due to higher residence time and a greater number of micro-discharges. The results show that the residence time of the screw thread electrode with a thread width of 1 mm is 21 % more than for the <b>rod</b> <b>electrode...</b>|$|E

The droplet also deforms subsequently under 50 -Hz-voltage stress. Likewise, it has been observed that the surface of a water puddle on a high voltage conductor becomes unstable from a certain value of the electric filed strength, with respect to the geometry of the conductor or transmission line. In this paper, the dynamics of a water/air interface is investigated theoretically when the electrode system containing the water droplet or water puddle is submitted to AC voltage. A mathematical model enabling us to simulate the axisymmetric deformations of droplets is used to calculate the critical electric field strength at which a water/air interface becomes unstable according to some approximation techniques, for a sessile water droplet on a metal electrode faced to <b>rod</b> <b>electrode.</b> Furthermore, this paper presents an experimental study of the deformation of a water droplet and water puddle on a plane electrode faced to another <b>rod</b> <b>electrode</b> to check the theory.

The switch, which had a rod-plane geometry, was filled with SF 6 at a pressure of 0. 8 bar (1. 0 bar = 100 kPa) absolute and was operated at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 kHz. The erosion rates of anode and cathode electrode materials such as elkonite (a copper tungsten composite), brass, aluminum and two types of stainless steel was measured, and their surfaces were studied optically, photographed and chemically analyzed. The erosion rate of the anode (<b>rod)</b> <b>electrode</b> materials ranged from 21. 39 x 10 - 6 cm 3 C- 1 for elkonite to 60. 4 x 10 - 6 cm 3 C- 1 for brass, whilst a cathode (trigger disc) erosion rate as high as 51. 23 x 10 - 6 cm 3 C- 1 for aluminum was measured.

40|$|The {{performance}} of several important industrial processes, such as fluid coking or fluid catalytic cracking, {{is dependent on}} the good distribution of liquid feed sprayed into a fluidized bed of hot inert or catalytic particles, respectively. Liquid injected into a fluidized bed is distributed in three different ways: (i) free moisture, or liquid coating individual particles; (ii) wet micro-agglomerates, which are fluidized; and (iii) wet macro-agglomerates, which settle {{to the bottom of the}} bed. This study develops and evaluates various methods for the determination of this moisture. In the study using electrical techniques, two different kinds of electrodes geometries are considered, one single <b>rod</b> <b>electrode</b> and 5 separate plate wall electrodes. Several nozzles are used to spray water into a gas-solid fluidized bed: scaled-down versions of regular industrial nozzles and a nozzle (HALR) that uses an exceptionally high flowrate of atomization gas to provide a nearly perfect dispersion of the injected liquid on fluidized particles. Since the HALR nozzle does not form agglomerates, it is ideal to calibrate various methods for the measurement of the free moisture. The properties of the wet agglomerates that are formed during injection are determined with a method that is only suitable for small beds. A sugar solution as a binder is injected into a fluidized bed, and the bed is defluidized to preserve the initial agglomerates until the entire bed dries out. The agglomerates are collected, sorted in different size cuts, and their initial liquid content is estimated from their sugar concentration. The bed conductance is shown to provide an accurate measurement of the free moisture in both small and large fluidized beds. While plate wall electrodes provide the most accurate results, both experimental measurements and modeling results show how <b>rod</b> <b>electrode</b> geometry could provide reliable estimates of the free moisture. The <b>rod</b> <b>electrode</b> is applied in a large fluidized bed with commercial-scale spray nozzles to determine the best nozzle premixer and the best nozzle type.
