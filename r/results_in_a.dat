5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, which <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia {{to give a}} blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be detected by its malodorous vapours.|$|E
5|$|A forced {{variation}} {{that involves}} a sacrifice and usually <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tangible gain {{is called a}} combination. Brilliant combinations– {{such as those in}} the Immortal Game– are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{sufficiently}} sparse random graph is pseudoforest.

However, for c > 1/2, almost every random graph with cn edges has a large component that is not unicyclic.|$|E

5|$|An inelastic {{collision}} between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called Compton scattering. This collision <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift.|$|E
5|$|As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in {{the core}} of a main-sequence star, the {{reduction}} in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy that supports the higher layers of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the higher layers further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value. As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; it is not simply a narrow line.|$|E

5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E

5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.|$|E
