25|$|While the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) has an {{interest}} in the sport because it is open to people with cerebral palsy, it is not governed by them. In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the CP-ISRA, but in 2002, the <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the <b>sport,</b> including classification, were set by the 1994 IPC Handbook. In the United States, the <b>sport</b> is <b>governed</b> by Disabled <b>Sports</b> USA for skiers with functional mobility, and governed by the United States Association of Blind Athletes (USABA) for skiers with vision impairment, while Special Olympics <b>governs</b> the <b>sport</b> and classification for people with intellectual disabilities.|$|R

Admissions standards were changed for football players, notably an athlete who read at a third-grade level was given a full scholarship. The new head football coach earned more than $200,000 a year. Accusations arose of kickbacks, grade-changing, excessive spending and violations of the <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> high school <b>sports.</b> In April 2016, Mr. Koch announced that Academic Dean John Klemme would serve as the School's president, placing Mr. Parsons on paid leave pending an investigation of harassment claims.|$|R

50|$|Meddler won {{all three}} starts at age two, and was {{regarded}} as second only to Isinglass among the colts of his generation. The last of his wins came in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket on October 27 when he led {{all the way to}} beat Raeburn by half a length. According to <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the <b>sport</b> of British horse racing in effect at the time, when his owner George Alexander Baird died, all of Meddler's future race bookings were void. As such, Meddler could not race in the British Classic Races at age three and was sold for $76,000 to American William H. Forbes of Readville, Massachusetts who brought him to the United States in 1893 to stand at his Neponset Stud. On Forbes' death in 1894, Meddler was purchased by William Collins Whitney of New York city who sent him to stand at stud at his La Belle Stud at Lexington, Kentucky.|$|R

5000|$|The {{sport of}} {{practical}} shooting originated from competitions in California in the 1950s {{with the goal}} of developing handgun skills for defensive use, but quickly evolved into a pure sport with little grounding in the original purpose. The sport soon expanded to Europe, Australia, South America and Africa. IPSC was founded in May 1976 when practical shooting enthusiasts from around the world participated at a conference held in Columbia, Missouri, creating a constitution and establishing the <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the <b>sport.</b> Jeff Cooper served as the first IPSC President. Today there are over 100 active IPSC regions, making practical shooting a major international sport which emphasizes firearms safety highly. Through international rules concerning firearms, equipment and organizing of matches one tries to unite the three elements precision, power and speed, which is also the motto of IPSC that is [...] "Diligentia, Vis, Celeritas" [...] (DVC), Latin for [...] "precision, power, speed". Only full caliber firearms are used, i.e. for handguns 9x19 mm is the smallest caliber, and the competitors try to achieve most points in the shortest time possible.|$|R

On writing for an application in February 1966, she {{received a letter from}} the race director, Will Cloney, informing her that women were not physiologically capable of running marathon distances and that under the <b>rules</b> that <b>governed</b> amateur <b>sports</b> set out by the AAU, women were not allowed to run more than {{a mile and a half}} competitively. She realized that it was more important than ever to run and that her run would have a social significance far beyond just her own personal challenge.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC), {{founded in}} 1847 in Calcutta, British India (now Kolkata, India), became the premier horse racing {{organization}} in India during the British Raj. At one {{time it was}} the governing body for almost all courses in the sub-continent, defining and applying the <b>rules</b> that <b>governed</b> the <b>sport.</b> During its heyday the races it organized {{were among the most}} important social events of the calendar, opened by the Viceroy of India. During the 1930s the Calcutta Derby Sweeps, organized by the club, was the largest sweepstake in the world. It is still an exclusive private club and still operates the Kolkata Race Course.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, John H. Outland held an {{experimental}} game in Wichita, Kansas that {{reduced the number}} of scrimmage plays to earn a first down from four to three in an attempt to reduce injuries. [...] The Los Angeles Times reported an increase in punts and considered the game much safer than regular play but that the new rule was not [...] "conducive to the sport". In 1906, President Roosevelt organized a meeting among thirteen school leaders at the White House to find solutions to make the sport safer for the athletes. Because the college officials could not agree upon a change in rules, it was decided {{over the course of several}} subsequent meetings that an external governing body should be responsible. Finally, on December 28, 1905, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of this meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States was formed in 1906. The IAAUS was the original rule making body of college football, but would go on to sponsor championships in other sports. The IAAUS would get its current name of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1910, which still sets <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the <b>sport.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the peculiarities of lower limbs kinematics and kinetics during racewalking stance, by comparing it with normal walking gait. Four young but skilled athletes were analysed through a motion analysis system and a force platform. Results were expressed in terms of average kinetics and kinematics curves. Many differences emerged between the two walking modes, most of which can be reconducted to the <b>rules</b> that <b>govern</b> this <b>sport.</b> These observations might be useful, both for trainers and practitioners, to gain more insight in racewalking technique and proficiency, but they are just a first step toward an effective application “on the field”. In fact, an individual analysis might discover the athlete’s distinctive biomechanical characteristics and consequently might help in setting better training methodologies...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of sports {{medicine}} is to allow safe early return to competition after an injury. To permit this, it is often necessary to devise some sort of protective splint. Protective splints used in contact sports must serve the following purposes (11 provide e adequate protection to the mjured part and thus prevent further injury; (2) allow the injured player to participate safely and effectively, (3) protect the opposing players agamst injury from the splmt; and (4) satisfy the game officials that the above criteria are met within the <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the particular <b>sport.</b> Prohibited equipment in collegiate football includes: &dquo; (1) sole leather or other hard or unyieldmg substances on the hand, wrist, forearm, or elbow of any players, no matter how covered or padded, and (2) sole leather or other hard unyielding substances in thigh guards, shin guards, knee or other braces, unless such article is covered on both sides and all of its edge...|$|R

40|$|The {{skeleton}} bobsled is {{a relatively}} new discipline of winter sports that competes in the winter Olympic Games. It is a sport with high speeds where fearless determination of the individual slider is required to achieve a winning margin which can be a 100 th of a second. Skeleton bobsled requires the athlete to sprint, board a sled (weighing upto 43 kg) and slide down a bobsleigh track with their chin just millimetres from the ice at speeds up to 130 kmph in a head first position. This paper explores the basic physics that underlie the sport comprising the physics of ice friction, the aerodynamics of the slider, the dynamics of the descent of a curved track, control of direction and position on the track. The <b>rules</b> that <b>govern</b> the <b>sport</b> {{have a significant impact on}} the methods whereby performance can be improved and in effect determine the upper limits of achievable speeds. The relative differences in performance between the various competitors are analysed with respect to the published data for the male and female sliders who competed in the 2006 / 2007 World Championship in St Moritz. It is difficult to identify actual optimum body height and weight but interesting to note that the victors in both the men’s and women’s event were of similar size...|$|R
