This issue is particularly relevant for historical and monumental buildings, which currently represent {{a large part}} of the historic buildings stock in Europe. For such protected buildings most of the available retrofitting solutions are not feasible and alternatives have to be investigated to guarantee their usability potential. The purpose of this study is therefore to present a methodology to evaluate the potential of electric <b>radiant</b> <b>panels</b> as retrofitting solutions for historical and monumental buildings, focusing on thermal comfort and energy saving potential when compared with conventional fossil-fuel-based heating systems. In fact, the non-invasiveness and flexibility of electrical panels make them one of the few feasible solutions for protected buildings.

The test results verified the concept that a <b>radiant</b> <b>panel</b> ceiling, due to its extended heat transfer surface, can effectively utilize low temperature heat sources such as solar energy. A monthly averaged analysis showed that about 50 % of the heating load was met by solar energy when using these combined systems in March, 1985;A study on the transient thermal response of the radiant ceiling and room enclosure was also performed. This study provided a data pool for checking the theoretical model to be developed in the later part of this study;Another experimental study performed at the Energy Research House was a comparison of radiant heating and forced-air heating. Its major objective was to determine if radiant heating saves energy compared to forced-air heating.

It was concluded that the radiant heating was 15 to 20 % more energy efficient than forced-air heating in normal winter conditions;Theoretical modeling of the <b>radiant</b> <b>panel</b> heating system was performed in three steps.
