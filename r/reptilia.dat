5|$|Stories or {{descriptions}} of animal hybrids {{have appeared in}} many cultures worldwide. A 13th-century Persian work depicts a rabbit with a single horn, like a unicorn. In Europe, the horned rabbit appeared in Medieval and Renaissance folklore in Bavaria (the wolpertinger) and elsewhere. Natural history texts such as Historiae Naturalis de Quadrupetibus Libri (The History Book of Natural Quadrangles) by Joannes Jonstonus (John Jonston) in the 17th century and illustrations such as Animalia Qvadrvpedia et <b>Reptilia</b> (Terra): Plate XLVII by Joris Hoefnagel (1522–1600) in the 16th century included the horned hare. These early scientific texts described and illustrated the hybrids {{as though they were}} real creatures, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century scientists generally rejected the idea of horned hares as a biological species.|$|E
5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class <b>Reptilia.</b> Reptiles are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the early}} {{proposals}} for replacing the paraphyletic <b>Reptilia</b> with a monophyletic Sauropsida, which includes birds, that term was never adopted widely or, when it was, was not applied consistently. When Sauropsida was used, it often {{had the same}} content or even the same definition as <b>Reptilia.</b> In 1988, Jacques Gauthier proposed a cladistic definition of <b>Reptilia</b> as a monophyletic node-based crown group containing turtles, lizards and snakes, crocodilians, and birds, their common ancestor and all its descendants. Because the actual relationship of turtles to other reptiles was not yet well understood at this time, Gauthier's definition came to be considered inadequate.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} other {{definitions}} were proposed by other scientists {{in the years following}} Gauthier's paper. The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the PhyloCode, was published by Modesto and Anderson in 2004. Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it stable and monophyletic. They defined <b>Reptilia</b> as all amniotes closer to Lacerta agilis and Crocodylus niloticus than to Homo sapiens. This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more common definition of Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with <b>Reptilia,</b> since the latter is better known and more frequently used. Unlike most previous definitions of <b>Reptilia,</b> however, Modesto and Anderson's definition includes birds, as they are within the clade that includes both lizards and crocodiles.|$|E

25|$|Mammals are a clade, and {{therefore}} the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class <b>Reptilia</b> is not a clade. It is just {{a section of the}} clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional <b>Reptilia</b> are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.|$|E
25|$|Sea turtles are amphibious reptiles, {{but they}} are not {{amphibians}}. Reptiles belong to the class <b>Reptilia</b> while amphibians belong to the class Amphibia. These are two distinct taxonomic groups. Reptiles have scales and leathery skins, while the skins of amphibians are smooth and porous. Unlike frogs, sea turtle eggs have tough, leathery shells which allow them to survive on land without drying out.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{a number of}} {{definitions}} of <b>Reptilia</b> were offered. The traits listed by Lydekker in 1896, for example, include a single occipital condyle, a jaw joint formed by the quadrate and articular bones, and certain characteristics of the vertebrae. The animals singled out by these formulations, the amniotes other than the mammals and the birds, are still those considered reptiles today.|$|E

Recent molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies place lampreys and hagfish in the superclass Agnatha or Agnathostomata (both meaning without jaws). The other vertebrate superclass is Gnathostomata (jawed mouths) and includes the classes Chondrichthyes (sharks), Osteichthyes (bony fishes), Amphibia, <b>Reptilia,</b> Aves, and Mammalia.|$|E

500|$|Other {{animals that}} would later be {{classified}} as temnospondyls were placed in a group called Ganocephala, which was characterized by plate-like skull bones, small limbs, fish-like scales, and branchial arches. Unlike labyrinthodonts, {{they did not have}} parietal foramena, [...] small holes in their skulls behind their eye sockets. Archegosaurus, [...] Dendrerpeton, Eryops and Trimerorhachis were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of <b>Reptilia.</b> Their rhachitomous vertebrae, notochord, and lack of occipital condyles (which attached the head to the neck) were features that were also shared with fishes. Thus, they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as stegocephalians.|$|E
500|$|Dimetrodon is {{an early}} member {{of a group called}} synapsids, which include mammals and many of their extinct relatives, though it is not an {{ancestor}} of any mammal (which appeared millions of years later). It is often mistaken for a dinosaur in popular culture, despite having become extinct some 40million years (Ma) before the first appearance of dinosaurs in the Triassic period. As a synapsid, Dimetrodon is more closely related to mammals than to dinosaurs or any living reptile. By the early 1900s most paleontologists called Dimetrodon a reptile in accordance with Linnean taxonomy, which ranked <b>Reptilia</b> as a class and Dimetrodon as a genus within that class. Mammals were assigned to a separate class, and Dimetrodon was described as a [...] "mammal-like reptile". Paleontologists theorized that mammals evolved from this group in (what they called) a reptile-to-mammal transition.|$|E

Beyoncé wears a Gareth Pugh design in the video, a custom Brian Lichtenberg bodysuit, as well as a couple of vintage Thierry Mugler Haute Couture pieces, including a leather bodice and a <b>reptilia</b> inspired gown. Diana Palkington of Daily Mail wrote that the gown gave Beyoncé a distinct appearance of a mermaid; it was noted by another writer of the same publication that the same dress was worn by Jennifer Lopez in the past.|$|E

2500|$|Because some {{reptiles}} {{are more}} closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles (e.g., crocodiles are {{more closely related}} to birds than they are to lizards), the traditional groups of [...] "reptiles" [...] listed above do not together constitute a monophyletic grouping (or clade).

2500|$|Exposed {{parts of}} {{reptiles}} {{are protected by}} scales or scutes, sometimes with a bony base, forming armor.

2500|$|It was {{not until}} the {{beginning}} of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are, in fact, quite different animals, and Pierre André Latreille erected the class Batracia (1825) for the latter, dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar classes of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley made Latreille's definition popular and, together with Richard Owen, expanded <b>Reptilia</b> to include the various fossil [...] "antediluvian monsters", including dinosaurs and the mammal-like (synapsid) Dicynodon he helped describe. This was not the only possible classification scheme: In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrates into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the fishes and amphibians). He subsequently proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the latter two groups. In 1866, Haeckel demonstrated that vertebrates could be divided based on their reproductive strategies, and that reptiles, birds, and mammals were united by the amniotic egg.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{his work}} on {{reptiles}} related to the skeletons of extinct forms and his chief memoirs, on British specimens, were reprinted in a connected series in his History of British Fossil Reptiles (4 vols. London 1849–1884). He published the first important general account of the great group of Mesozoic land-reptiles, and he coined the name Dinosauria from Greek δεινός (deinos) [...] "terrible, powerful, wondrous" [...] + σαῦρος (sauros) [...] "lizard". Owen used 3 genera to define the dinosaurs: the carnivorous Megalosaurus, the herviborous Iguanodon and armoured Hylaeosaurus, specimens uncovered in southern England. He also first recognized the curious early Mesozoic synapsids, with affinities both to amphibians and mammals, which he termed Anomodontia (the mammal-like synapsids, Therapsida). Most of these were obtained from South Africa, beginning in 1845 (Dicynodon) and eventually furnished materials for his Catalogue of the Fossil <b>Reptilia</b> of South Africa, issued by the British Museum, in 1876. Among his writings on birds, his classical memoir on the kiwi (1840–1846), {{a long series of}} papers on the extinct Dinornithidae of New Zealand, other memoirs on Aptornis, the takahe, the dodo and the great auk, may be especially mentioned. His monograph on Archaeopteryx (1863), the long-tailed, toothed bird from the Bavarian lithographic stone, is also an epoch-making work.|$|E
60|$|Or, {{if we go}} back to {{the older}} half of the Mesozoic epoch, how truly {{surprising}} it is to find every order of the <b>Reptilia,</b> except the Ophidia, represented; while some groups, such as the Ornithoscelida and the Pterosauria, more specialized than any which now exist, abounded.|$|E
