The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth.
