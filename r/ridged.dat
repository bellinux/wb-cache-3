5|$|Much of this {{acceptance}} {{has been}} based on the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged; grooved canines in Euchambersia would parallel the fangs of various venomous snakes as well as the venom-delivering incisors of the living solenodons. This interpretation, which has consistently appeared in literature published after 1986, was determined by Julien Benoit {{to be the result of}} the propagation of Broom's overly reconstructed diagram of the skull, without the context of the actual specimens. This line of evidence has been raised to support the necessity of a re-evaluation the hypothesis of a venomous bite in Euchambersia. Additionally, Benoit argued that grooved and <b>ridged</b> canines are not necessarily associated with venomous animals either, as shown by their presence in hippopotami, muntjacs, and baboons, in which they play a role in grooming or sharpening the teeth; in the latter two, <b>ridged</b> canines are also accompanied by a distinct fossa in front of the eye, which is entirely unconnected with venom. Furthermore, grooved and <b>ridged</b> teeth in non-venomous snakes are used to reduce suctional drag when capturing slippery prey like fish or invertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate. Having very small, <b>ridged</b> teeth they could not have chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E

50|$|The major minutia {{features}} of fingerprint <b>ridges</b> are <b>ridge</b> ending, bifurcation, and short <b>ridge</b> (or dot). The <b>ridge</b> ending {{is the point}} at which a <b>ridge</b> terminates. Bifurcations are points at which a single <b>ridge</b> splits into two <b>ridges.</b> Short <b>ridges</b> (or dots) are <b>ridges</b> which are significantly shorter than the average <b>ridge</b> length on the fingerprint. Minutiae and patterns are very important in the analysis of fingerprints since no two fingers {{have been shown to be}} identical.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor <b>Ridge</b> is {{the most}} northwestern <b>ridge</b> {{in the state of}} Georgia within the <b>Ridge</b> and Valley physiographic region and is {{approximately}} 40 miles in length. [...] To the west the <b>ridge</b> is bordered by the Cumberland Plateau region and to the north Taylor <b>Ridge</b> becomes White Oak Mountain at Ringgold Gap although technically part of the same <b>ridge.</b> [...] The western foothills of Taylor <b>Ridge</b> are also the western border of the Chattahoochee National Forest.

5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut cavity and a transversely <b>ridged</b> ectoderm. The organism is {{in the shape of}} a flattened torus, with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.|$|E
5|$|Mycena maculata bears some {{resemblance}} to M.inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and {{is found in}} eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M.inclinata. M.inclinata is often confused with the edible M.galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M.galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M.polygramma has a <b>ridged</b> stem that is bluish-gray.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of Lepidoptera {{are usually}} rounded and small (1mm) {{though they may}} be as large as 4mm in the case of Sphingidae and Saturniidae. They are {{generally}} quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped). Some are barrel-shaped or pancake-shaped, while others are turban or cheese-shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, <b>ridged</b> or ornamented, spotted or blemished.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{parameters}} (namely <b>ridge</b> height, <b>ridge</b> clearance, <b>ridge</b> nose radius, <b>ridge</b> shoulder radius, ridge-to-punch nose distance, {{and number of}} <b>ridges)</b> were specified for the microridge punch. An excessively high <b>ridge</b> height induces the <b>ridges</b> to be deeply pressed into the blank, whereas an extremely low <b>ridge</b> height causes the <b>ridges</b> to generate unsatisfactory drawing effects. Moreover, an extremely high <b>ridge</b> clearance results in the excessive distribution of the <b>ridge</b> drawing force to the blank. The minimum <b>ridge</b> clearance {{is limited to the}} thickness of the grinding blade. An extremely long <b>ridge</b> nose radius reduces the drawing force of the ridges; however, an excessively short <b>ridge</b> nose radius causes the <b>ridge</b> to be deeply pressed into the blank. In addition, an excessively long <b>ridge</b> shoulder radius induces the <b>ridges</b> to deliver limited drawing force. The minimum <b>ridge</b> shoulder radius is limited to the nasal fillet radius of the grinding blade. An extremely long ridge-to-punch nose distance results in increased thickness difference percentages, whereas an excessively short ridge-to-punch nose distance leads to changes in the appearance of components. In addition, an extremely high number of <b>ridges</b> increases the punch manufacturing costs, whereas an extremely low number of <b>ridges</b> reduces the drawing effect.|$|R
2500|$|The Oak <b>Ridge</b> area is {{striated}} by five elongated <b>ridges</b> {{that run}} roughly parallel {{to one another}} in a northeast-to-southwest direction. In order from west-to-east, the five <b>ridges</b> are Blackoak Ridge—which connects the Elza and K-25 bends of the Clinch and thus [...] "walls off" [...] the half-rectangle—East Fork <b>Ridge,</b> Pine <b>Ridge,</b> Chestnut <b>Ridge,</b> and Haw <b>Ridge.</b> The five <b>ridges</b> are divided by four valleys—East Fork Valley (between Blackoak and East Fork <b>Ridge),</b> Gamble Valley (between East Fork <b>Ridge</b> and Pine <b>Ridge),</b> Bear Creek Valley (between Pine <b>Ridge</b> and Chestnut), and Bethel Valley (between Chestnut and Haw). These <b>ridges</b> and valleys are part of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians physiographic province. The main section of the city is located in the northeast, where East Fork and Pine <b>Ridge</b> give way to low, scattered hills. Many of the city's residences are located along the relatively steep northeastern slope of Blackoak <b>Ridge.</b>|$|R

5|$|The second main terrain type—ridged terrain—comprises {{bands of}} ridges and troughs {{hundreds}} of kilometers in extent. It bounds the cratered terrain and cuts it into polygons. Within each band, {{which can be}} up to 25 to 70km wide, are individual ridges and troughs up to 200km long and between 10 and 35km apart. The bands of <b>ridged</b> terrain often form continuations of canyons, suggesting {{that they may be}} a modified form of the graben or the result of a different reaction of the crust to the same extensional stresses, such as brittle failure.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical of the}} group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation {{in the side of the}} skull. Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of <b>ridged,</b> it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{tectonics}} on Enceladus is also {{derived from}} grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges. These bands, first discovered by Voyager 2, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. Grooved terrains {{such as the}} Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features. In other areas, these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running {{the length of the}} feature. Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these <b>ridged</b> plain belts.|$|E
50|$|The shoal {{consists}} of four geologic ridges: the north <b>ridge,</b> the central <b>ridge,</b> the halfway <b>ridge,</b> and the south <b>ridge.</b> The north <b>ridge</b> is a subtle but distinct rise across the northern portion of the shoal; the central <b>ridge</b> {{consists of}} a few high peaks in the eastern-center of the shoal; the halfway <b>ridge</b> is the largest <b>ridge</b> and stretches in an arc {{from east to west}} across the entire feature; the south <b>ridge</b> is made up of two associated basalt rises on the southern edge of the formation. The Isle Royale Fault creates a gorge between the north <b>ridge</b> and the other three <b>ridges.</b>|$|R

5|$|In late October, the ITCZ {{developed}} a persistent area of convection {{west of the}} Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tropical low formed on October28 within the Australian region, which initially failed to develop much due to persistent wind shear. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) named the system Melanie on October31 {{to the north of}} the Cocos Islands. The newly upgraded storm tracked generally westward due to a ridge to the south, and entered the south-west Indian Ocean on November1 as a strong tropical storm. At that time, Melanie was renamed Bellamine. After the <b>ridged</b> moved farther away, the storm turned more to the southwest and began quickly intensifying. Early on November3, Bellamine attained tropical cyclone status, and the next day reached peak 10minute winds of 175km/h (110mph); this made it an intense tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive <b>ridged</b> and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|The Ogle County Courthouse is a National Register of Historic Places listing in the Ogle County, Illinois, {{county seat}} of Oregon. The {{building}} {{stands on a}} public square in the city's downtown commercial district. The current structure was completed in 1891 and was preceded by two other buildings, {{one of which was}} destroyed by a group of outlaws. Following the destruction of the courthouse, the county was without a judicial building for a period during the 1840s. The Ogle County Courthouse was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. The <b>ridged</b> roof is dominated by its wooden cupola which stands out at a distance.|$|E

5|$|The roof is sharply angled {{toward its}} center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was {{completed}} after the building, in 1892. At {{each of the}} square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve {{to break up the}} monotony of the otherwise <b>ridged</b> roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, in that they are dormered as well as multi-gabled. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building's dominant feature, its cupola, sits on an oversized brick base with a terra cotta belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing.|$|E
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the <b>ridged</b> canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally <b>ridged)</b> in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} of image enhancement technique {{is to improve}} the overall performance by optimally arranging input images for afterward processing stages. A fingerprint is the pattern of <b>ridges</b> and valleys on the surface of a fingertip. Each person has unique fingerprints. The uniqueness of a fingerprint is exclusively determined by the local <b>ridge</b> characteristics and their relationships. 150 different local <b>ridge</b> distinctiveness like islands, short <b>ridges,</b> enclosure, etc. have been acknowledged. These local <b>ridge</b> distinctiveness are not evenly distributed. Most of them heavily depends on the impression conditions, quality of fingerprints and are not often observed in fingerprints. The two most prominent local <b>ridge</b> characteristics, called minutiae, are <b>ridge</b> ending and <b>ridge</b> bifurcation.

5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or <b>ridged.</b> Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} certain what pachycephalosaurs ate; having very small, <b>ridged</b> teeth {{they could not have}} chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that their sharp, serrated teeth were ideally suited for a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, fruit and insects. Stegoceras may have had an entirely herbivorous diet, as the tooth crowns were similar to those of iguanid lizards. The premaxillary teeth show wear facets from contact with the predentary bone, and the maxillary teeth have double wear facets similar to those seen in other ornithischian dinosaurs. Every third maxillary tooth of UALVP 2 are erupting replacement teeth, and tooth replacement happened in backwards progression in sequential threes. The occipital region of Stegoceras was well-demarcated for muscle-attachment and it is believed that the jaw movement of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs was mostly limited to up-and-down motions with only a slight capability for jaw rotation. This is based on the structure of the jaw and dental microwear and wear facets of the teeth indicate that the bite-force was used more for shearing than for crushing.|$|E
