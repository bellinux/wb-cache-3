In addition to biosurveillance, <b>radiological</b> <b>reports</b> are an important source of clinical data for health service research. Pneumonias and other radiological findings on chest xray or chest computed tomography (CT) are one type of relevant finding to both biosurveillance and health services research. In this study we examined the ability of a Natural Language Processing system to accurately identify pneumonias and other lesions from within free-text <b>radiological</b> <b>reports.</b> The system encoded the reports in the SNOMED CT Ontology and then a set of SNOMED CT based rules were created in our Health Archetype Language aimed at the identification of these radiological findings and diagnoses. The encoded rule was executed against the SNOMED CT encodings of the <b>radiological</b> <b>reports.</b> The accuracy of the reports was compared with a Clinician review of the <b>Radiological</b> <b>Reports.</b> The accuracy of the system in the identification of pneumonias was high with a Sensitivity (recall) of 100 %, a specificity of 98 %, and a positive predictive value (precision) of 97 %.

40|$|Background: Complete {{fracture}} ascertainment {{is critical}} for fracture cost estimates and planning for future health care facilities. Virtually complete ascertainment is possible for hip fractures because they nearly always require hospitalisation. Aims: To validate the use of <b>radiological</b> <b>reports</b> {{as a resource for}} ascertaining fracture cases, using hip fracture as a model. Methods: Hip fracture rates obtained from <b>radiological</b> <b>reports</b> were compared with rates obtained from hospital discharge summaries of medical records using International Classification of Diseases- 9 (ICD- 9) codes 820. 0 – 820. 9 and 733. 1 over a three-year period. Results: Hip fracture cases numbered 589 using <b>radiological</b> <b>reports</b> and 585 using medical records. Discharge summaries failed to identify 15 cases ascertained through radiology reports whereas 11 cases ascertained through medical records were not identified from X-ray reports. The age-specific incidence rates for radiological ascertainment were within the 95 % confidence limits of the rates derived from medical records. Conclusions: Among a population of patients generally admitted to hospital for treatment of their fracture, we were able to identify more cases from <b>radiological</b> <b>reports</b> than from medical records. Incidence rates for hip fracture were comparable using the two methods. <b>Radiological</b> <b>reports</b> provide a valuable resource for identifying incident fractures. This method of case ascertainment would be suitable for identifying both major and minor fractures in regions with self-contained health services where access to all <b>radiological</b> <b>reports</b> is possible. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Background Radiographic {{examinations}} of the ankle {{are important in}} the clinical management of ankle injuries in hospital emergency departments. National (Australian) Emergency Access Targets (NEAT) stipulate that 90 percent of presentations should leave the emergency department within 4 hours. For a <b>radiological</b> <b>report</b> to have clinical usefulness and relevance to clinical teams treating patients with ankle injuries in emergency departments, the report {{would need to be}} prepared and available to the clinical team within the NEAT 4 hour timeframe; before the patient has left the emergency department.

In this context, structured <b>radiological</b> <b>reporting</b> could offer a solution through standardised report content and more consistent language. Also, apart from being difficult to analyse for automated systems seeking to extract knowledge from the reports, {{it has been shown that}} referrers also favour more structured radiological reports [12 – 16].

This article reviews the biases that can undermine the results of plain ¿lm reading performance studies. These biases are subdivided into three categories. The ¿rst category refers to the selection of subjects, including both ¿lms and professionals, and covers the validity of generalizing results beyond the study population. The other two categories are concerned with study design and the interpretation both of ¿lms and of reports and the effect on study validity.

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} {{has proved}} to be a natural interaction modality and an effective technology for medical reporting, in particular in the speciality of radiology. High-volume text creation requirement and the complex structure of these texts make voice technologies useful. By employing speech, professionals in the field can generate reports and do so at a speed that approaches traditional dictation methods. However, the integration of speech recognition in a user interface creates new problems: speech recognizers may introduce errors and moreover they should be adaptable to spoken language variations. This paper describes a <b>radiological</b> <b>reporting</b> system and the related motivations for the use of the speech modality.

40|$|Imaging {{is a key}} {{component}} {{in the management of}} brain tumours, with MRI being the preferred modality for most clinical scenarios. However, although conventional MRI provides mainly structural information, such as tumour size and location, it leaves many important clinical questions, such as tumour type, aggressiveness and prognosis, unanswered. An increasing number of studies have shown that additional information can be obtained using functional imaging methods (which probe tissue properties), and that these techniques can give key information of clinical importance. These techniques include diffusion imaging, which can assess tissue structure, and perfusion imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures tissue metabolite profiles. Tumour metabolism can also be investigated using PET, with 18 F-deoxyglucose being the most readily available tracer. This Review discusses these methods and the studies that have investigated their clinical use. A strong emphasis is placed on the measurement of quantitative parameters, which is a move away from the qualitative nature of conventional <b>radiological</b> <b>reporting</b> and presents major challenges, particularly for multicentre studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{diagnostic}} work up {{of dementia}} {{may benefit from}} structured reporting of CT and/or MRI {{and the use of}} standardised visual rating scales. We advocate a more widespread use of standardised scales as part of the workflow in clinical and research evaluation of dementia. We propose routine clinical use of rating scales for medial temporal atrophy (MTA), global cortical atrophy (GCA) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). These scales can be used for evaluation of both CT and MRI and are efficient in routine imaging assessment in dementia, and may improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Our review provides detailed imaging examples of rating increments in each of these scales and a separate teaching file. The radiologist should relate visual ratings to the clinical assessment and other biomarkers to assist the clinician in the diagnostic decision. Teaching points: • Clinical dementia diagnostics would benefit from structured <b>radiological</b> <b>reporting.</b> • Standardised rating scales should be used in dementia assessment. • It is important to relate imaging findings to the clinically suspected diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} formal <b>radiological</b> <b>reporting</b> of all emergency department (ED) radiographs on clinical practice and patient outcome, and to consider whether a selective reporting policy might prove safe and effective. Methods: All radiographs taken in a single ED over a six month period were prospectively studied simultaneously in both the emergency and radiology departments to detect cases where a radiograph that was considered normal by ED staff was then reported as abnormal by the reporting radiologist. Whenever such a discrepancy occurred the patient’s records were scrutinised to ascertain {{the source of the}} discrepancy, with a gold standard interpretation derived from senior clinical review and addi-tional investigations where indicated. The clinical impact of the radiologist’s formal report was then assessed. Accuracy of interpretation was considered in relation to the grade of ED staff and the radio-graphic examination obtained. Results: During the study period, 19 468 new patient attendances to the ED generated 11 749 radio-graphic examinations. Discrepancies were detected in 175 patients (1. 5 % of all radiographic exami-nations). Of these, 136 (1. 2 %) were subsequently shown to have been incorrectly interpreted in the ED (ED false negatives), with 40 patients (0. 3 %) undergoing a change in management as a result.

30|$|Over {{a decade}} ago the International Osteoporosis Foundation {{developed}} a Vertebral Fracture Initiative to educate radiologists and to raise awareness for the relevance of detecting and reporting VBF (Schwartz and Steinberg 2005). However, previous investigations concerning <b>radiological</b> <b>reporting</b> of VBFs (Carberry et al. 2013; Bartalena et al. 2009; Müller et al. 2008) excluded patients with known malignancies from their investigations. However, a recent, large epidemiological study found that excluding patients with an underlying malignancy from research on pathologic fractures underestimated the incidence of VBFs from osteoporosis (Curtis et al. 2009). Furthermore, the current European Society of Medical oncology guideline advises pharmacotherapy for cancer patients with osteoporosis (Coleman et al. 2014) Therefore, pathologic fractures in cancer patients have to be evaluated and worked-up either {{for the presence of}} osteoporosis or for osseous metastasis. Due to the retrospective nature of our investigation we cannot determine the cause of the pathologic VBF, be it osteoporosis or metastasis—however this was not our investigational focus. Fur pure purpose of detection and reporting, the aetiology of VBFs is of lesser significance for the radiologist. However, when considering patient care and wellbeing from a radiological and especially clinical standpoint, aetiology of VBFs is of great importance. In fact, the unknown origin of VBF even more so should lead the clinician to further investigate and properly document the incidental fracture, as it can be induced by osteoporosis, cancer or oncological therapy (e.g., radiation or drug induced).|$|E
