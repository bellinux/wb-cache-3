Tendo como ponto de partida que a Teologia e a Literatura se entrelaçam ao exporem a vida humana, a trilogia de Gil Vicente, Auto da Barca do Inferno, Auto da Barca do Purgatório e Auto da Barca da Glória, foi escolhida para ser analisada por representar o pensamento, no que diz respeito à salvação, de um período tão importante em termos de descontentamento religioso, que resultou na Reforma Protestante (1517). Em primeiro lugar, são analisados a vida, a obra e o prestígio que o poeta tinha na corte portuguesa com os reis D. João II, D. Manuel e a Rainha Eleonor. Por meio da Trilogia das Barcas, a influência do tempo de Gil Vicente e do meio em ele viveu é observada. Ele mostra que, na Idade Média, na sociedade e na igreja podiam-se observar muitos pecados como a luxúria, a avareza, a inveja, a corrupção e o orgulho; todas as personagens têm um ou mais desses vícios e respondem por isso. O poeta nos mostra sua crença no céu, no inferno e no purgatório por meio do destino que ele dá para cada alma. Ele cria um espaço no qual os anjos, o diabo e a personificação da morte são responsáveis por quem morre. Na Trilogia das Barcas, analisamos o conceito que o autor tinha sobre a salvação e observamos aqueles que são enviados para o inferno, para o paraíso e para o purgatório. Não temos intenção de defender uma posição quanto à controvérsia soteriológica: se a salvação acontece por meio da eleição unicamente pela graça de Deus ou por meio de sua presciência; mas sim de mostrar que ambos os conceitos estavam presentes antes de Gil Vicente, durante sua vida, e depois de Gil Vicente, em todo o período da Reforma Protestante. A partir da análise histórico-cultural e da análise dos Autos propostos no tema, buscamos {{responder}} às questões: qual o conceito de salvação em Gil Vicente? Em que se fundamenta o pensamento soteriológico dele? Quais contribuições o poeta deu ao seu povo e às pessoas que ainda leem suas obras? Por último, vamos tentar responder se ele foi um préreformador ou apenas um católico descontente com sua igreja. The present work {{intends to}} analyze Gil Vicent s, play writer and poet, view about virtues and humans degradation considering the salvation aspect involved in it. Literature and Theology altogether can show aspects of humans life, {{for this reason}} the Trilogy of Boat: Act of the Boat of Hell, Act of the Boat of Purgatory and the Act of the Boat of Heaven were chosen to be analyzed for represent the thinking concerning salvations aspects in that important time period, that showed a religious disagreement that resulted in Protestant Reformation (1517). The life, the work and the prestige the poet had with the kings John II, Manuel and the queen Eleonor will be observed firstly. Vicent´s works is very important until today; by his work, Trilogy of Boat, the influence of his time and the mean where he lived are observed. He shows that in the Middle Age the society and the church {{had a lot of}} sins like lust, avarice, envy, robbery and pride; all Vicent s characters have {{one or more of these}} sins and they respond for that. He show us his religious believes in Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory by the destiny he gives to the sinners souls. The poet created a place where angels, the demon and personified death are responsible for who died. In his Trilogy of Boats we analyze the author s concept about salvation and we saw the ones who went to Hell, to Paradise and to Purgatory, to have their sins purified. Finally, we can observe that Gil Vincent was a man who wants to see the transformation of his society and his church. However, our intention isn t defend a point of view referent to soteriology controversy whether salvation can happen through God s grace or by the election through his prescience, we pretend show that both concepts were present before, during and after Vicente s life, as well during the Protestant Reformation. Starting from historic and culture analyses, our intention is <b>respond</b> <b>some</b> <b>questions</b> like: What are salvation concepts in Gil Vincent work? His soteriological thoughts are based on what? Whether, did he a significant contribution to his readers of all the times? And finally: Was he a precursor of Reformation or only discontent with Catholic Church...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{sustainability}} is {{an indicator}} {{or even a}} concept that guides many public as well as private decisions or actions. In manufacturing sectors, firms are paying an increasing attention to this concept with regards to their products once they are {{the end of their}} life; this attention is not only due to the respect of norms and laws policy makers are continuously editing to protect the environment or the sensitivity of consumers to ecological issues but also because of possibilities of new business this concept offers. Indeed, firms noticed that they can create value with the end-of-life products by dismantling them and recovering parts and/or materials that can be re-introduced into manufacturing process, into maintenance process, etc.; or just by the improvement of their image with regards to public opinion. The process of recuperating end-of-life products, known as reverse logistics, is therefore a sustainable development process which will be triggered by the consumer and consists in a series of activities; one such activity concerns withdrawal problem that consists in <b>responding</b> <b>some</b> <b>questions</b> such as: where the end-of-life product must be dismantled?, how to bring the product from its actual position to the dismantling place?, {{who is in charge of}} this activity?, etc. This paper considers the issue of evaluating and optimizing the withdrawal process in the field of aircraft dismantling.

40|$|Credit scoring is an automated, {{objective}} and consistent tool which helps lenders to provide quick loan decisions. It can replace {{some of the}} more mechanical work done by experienced loan officers whose decisions are intuitive but potentially subject to bias. Existing credit scoring models are built using as many historical data as possi-ble from past borrowers with known repayment performance. Analysts believe that using a larger dataset to build credit scoring models will always increase model ac-curacy. However, previous findings show that increasing the amount of data used to build models may result in a more complex model with no significant increase in ac-curacy. We will show that if <b>some</b> borrowers <b>respond</b> untruthfully to <b>some</b> <b>questions,</b> using higher dimensional data may even reduce the model’s predictive power compared against using a dataset with lower dimensions. Using more data to build the model will increase the associated accumulated error and results in an overestimated model with low accuracy. The proposed issue will be studied using simulated data and discriminant analysis based on the credit scoring context. Knowing the optimal amount of data that is required to build credit scoring models can both improve accuracy and reduce opera-tional cost and processing time.

40|$|In many fields, and {{especially}} in the medical and social sciences and in recommender systems, data are gathered through clinical studies or targeted surveys. Participants are generally reluctant to respond to all questions in a survey or they may lack information to <b>respond</b> adequately to <b>some</b> <b>questions.</b> The data collected from these studies tend to lead to linear regression models where the regression vectors are only known partially: some of their entries are either missing completely or replaced randomly by noisy values. In this work, assuming missing positions are replaced by noisy values, we examine how a connected network of agents, with each one of them subjected to a stream of data with incomplete regression information, can cooperate with each other through local interactions to estimate the underlying model parameters in the presence of missing data. We explain how to adjust the distributed diffusion strategy through (de) regularization in order to eliminate the bias introduced by the incomplete model. We also propose a technique to recursively estimate the (de) regularization parameter and examine the performance of the resulting strategy. We illustrate the results by considering two applications: one dealing with a mental health survey and the other dealing with a household consumption survey...|$|R
40|$|With 39 out of 50 states mandating {{universal}} newborn hearing screening (UNHS), and newborn hearing screening data being {{collected from}} 40 states, {{it would be}} easy to assume that the identification of permanent childhood hearing loss is guaranteed. Yet, the fact is that some childhood hearing losses have a later onset and will not be identified through newborn screening methods. This article <b>responds</b> to <b>some</b> basic <b>questions</b> about late-onset hearing loss in infancy and childhood. What is the prevalence of childhood hearing loss? Current UNHS statistics indicate an overall hearing loss prevalence rate of 1 - 2 per 1000 at birth. These prevalence statistics are consistent across the US and are not dependent on the particular hearing screening method being used. Statistical information about the prevalence of hearing loss in older children is difficult to find and interpret for a number of reasons. Late onset or progressive hearing loss can be due to hereditary factors, infection, trauma, noise exposure or teratogens. Studies also vary in how “significant hearing loss ” is defined. As a result, the prevalence of late onset hearing loss is not well defined. In general there is a trend toward increasing rates of hearing loss as children get older...|$|R

This study explores Chinese students’ views on and experiences in Dutch higher education: why they choose and how they perceive the education in the Netherlands, what differences they encounter in culture and classroom pedagogy, how these differences influence their learning experiences and how these experiences impact upon their identity negotiation. Thirty-seven in-depth interviews were conducted with thirty Chinese students and seven (another four <b>responded</b> to <b>some</b> <b>questions</b> through email) lecturers, international student advisors and admission officers from eight Dutch higher education institutions. The findings identified the influential aspects on their decisions including discouraging factors in Chinese education, the perceived benefits of a Dutch education as well as attractive policies in the Netherlands. In terms of cultural encounters, they tried to adapt to some differences, which they considered as necessary changes, while others remained challenging such as party culture and communication gap with Western peers due to different cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, although they found the Dutch lecturing style similar to that in China, they were confronted with various difficulties and challenges in classroom pedagogy such as classroom participation, group work and presentation, examination and assessment, cultivation of critical thinking and creativity, and different roles of teachers. Finally, they regarded their experiences overseas as generally positive, despite that some were subjected to prejudice and discrimination. In the process of negotiation in the multi-cultural environment, they witnessed themselves evolving into independent, self-confident and responsible adults with stronger and more open minds. At the same time, most of them exhibited a strong attachment to their Chinese identity. The results of this study contribute to discussions concerning culture adaptation, identity negotiation, and pedagogical experiences within the domain of internationalization {{of higher education}}, while hoping to provide insights and implications on how Western higher education institutions can better cater to the needs of international students...|$|R

Design and methods: A cross-sectional design using multistage sampling methods was used to select participants from antenatal and postnatal clinics in a primary health care setting in north Trinidad. A multi-item structured questionnaire was designed and administered by in-depth interviews. Sociodemographic data and data about history of previous pregnancies and outcomes and about knowledge and perceptions of CSs were collected from women aged 16 years and older. Results: Of the women who were eligible for entry into the study, 368 participated. However, participants chose not to <b>respond</b> to <b>some</b> <b>questions.</b> The majority of women (46. 2 %) were found to have very little information from which to make informed decisions about selecting CS as the preferred choice of delivery. Their preference was significantly associated with the perception of safety (maternal or fetal death, P = 0. 001), difficulty (complications to mother and baby, P = 0. 001), and pain (P = 0. 001). Notwithstanding, persons who received information from health care professionals (odds ratio [OR], 1. 9; confidence interval, 1. 50 &ndash; 2. 33) were more likely to have high or adequate levels of information about CSs. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, and ORs were calculated using logistic regression. Conclusion: The majority of women attending antenatal and postnatal clinics in north Trinidad were not sufficiently knowledgeable about CS to enable them to make informed choices. In addition, the information obtained was from an unreliable source, emphasizing the need for information on CS to form a component of a structured antenatal education program.

40|$|Score Following is {{the process}} by which a {{musician}} can be tracked through their perfor-mance of a piece, for the purpose of accompanying the musician with the appropriate notes. This tracking is done by following the progress of the musician through the score (written music) of the piece, using observations of the notes they are playing. Artificially intelligent musical accompaniment is where a human musician is ac-companied by a computer musician. The computer musician is able to produce musical accompaniment that relates musically to the human performance. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a stochastic modelling tool {{that can be used to}} represent real-world systems in a variety of domains. This project discusses how HMMs can be used in the domain of Score Follow-ing and describes the construction and evaluation of a score following system that uses HMMs to implement score following. It explores the hypothesis that using an HMM to represent a musical score is an efficient and practical way to implement score following, and that in particular this method is suitable for providing real-time accom-paniment to a human performer. The score followers developed during this project are tested and compared against other score following systems and against human musicians.

500|$|In essence the Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause does not protect a defendant's refusal to answer {{questions}} asked by law enforcement before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights. In the concrete case the court issued the following holding: When petitioner {{had not yet been}} placed in custody or received Miranda warnings, and voluntarily <b>responded</b> to <b>some</b> <b>questions</b> by police about a murder, the prosecution's use of his silence in response to another question as evidence of his guilty at trial did not violate the Fifth Amendment because petitioner failed to expressly invoke his privilege not to incriminate himself in response to the officer's question. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection. This requirement ensures that the government is put on notice when a defendant intends to claim this privilege and allows the government to either argue that the testimony is not self-incriminating or offer immunity. The plurality opinion of Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy reiterated two exceptions to this principle: 1) that a criminal defendant does not need to take the stand at trial in order to explicitly claim this privilege; and 2) that failure to claim this privilege must be excused when that failure was due to government coercion. The plurality opinion declined to extend these exceptions to the situation in Salinas v. Texas. Notwithstanding popular misconceptions, the Court held that the Fifth Amendment does not establish a complete right to remain silent but only guarantees that criminal defendant may not be forced to testify against himself or herself. Therefore, as long as police do not deprive defendants of the opportunity to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, there is no Constitutional violation. The Court stated that there was no [...] "ritualistic formula" [...] necessary to assert the privilege against self-incrimination, but that a person could not do so [...] "by simply standing mute." [...] If an individual fails to invoke his right, and is later charged with a crime, the prosecution may use his silence at trial as evidence of his guilt.|$|R
40|$|Very limited {{research}} {{exists that}} studies how customer personality traits influence the {{participation in the}} value co-creation process, nor does there exists much research on the further intention to use the brand or new products and services offered by the brand. This thesis aims to fill this gap, exploring consumer personality traits, specifically extraversion, innovativeness, risk taking propensity and openness to experience, to actively engage in co creating value, {{in the context of}} mobile operators. The author develops a conceptual model of the independent variable’s – customer personality traits and co-creation – and the influence they have on the dependent variables intention to use the mobile operator or its new products or services in the future. For this study, a survey was conducted that resulted in a sample size of 196 respondents. Participants were asked to self-assess their behavior in relation to their mobile operator, and <b>respond</b> to <b>some</b> <b>questions</b> about their personality. The results show that not all customer personality traits influence co-creational activities. Personality traits and co-creation positively influence the intention to buy new products or services offered by the company or brand, however, co-creational activities do not {{have a positive effect on}} the intention to buy an existing product or service from the company. All hypotheses except two where therefore confirmed. These findings have implications for mobile operator firms on how to conduct their businesses regarding their target group, for managers involved in new product and service marketing, and for future research on the topic of personality trait’s influence on co-creation and innovation.
