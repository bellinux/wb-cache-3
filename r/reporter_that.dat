5|$|After Bara's {{contract}} with Fox ended, Woods approached her about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage {{early in her}} career, working with touring companies and in summer stock, but had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a <b>reporter</b> <b>that</b> she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose The Blue Flame (at that time titled The Lost Soul) because it allowed her to play {{two versions of the}} character, one good and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her last year with Fox, but Bara was also promised half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods also provided a finely appointed private railroad car to take her from city to city when the show toured.|$|E
