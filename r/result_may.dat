This <b>result</b> <b>may</b> mean that the initial luminosity {{of this type of}} supernova depends on the viewing angle. However, the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time.

5|$|In {{a similar}} way, xenon isotopic ratios such as 129Xe/130Xe and 136Xe/130Xe are a {{powerful}} tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing. For example, the atmosphere of Mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of Earth (0.08parts per million) but Mars shows a greater abundance of 129Xe than the Earth or the Sun. Since this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the <b>result</b> <b>may</b> indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess 129Xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from New Mexico is believed to be from the decay of mantle-derived gases from soon after Earth's formation.|$|E

5|$|In the 5th century CE, the Indian astronomical text Surya Siddhanta {{estimated}} the angular size of Mars as 2arc-minutes (1/30 of a degree) and its distance to Earth as 10,433,000km (1,296,600yojana, where one yojana {{is equivalent to}} eightkm in the Surya Siddhanta). From this the diameter of Mars is deduced to be 6,070km (754.4 yojana), which has an error within 11% of the currently accepted value of 6,788km. However, this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet's angular size. The <b>result</b> <b>may</b> {{have been influenced by}} the work of Ptolemy, who listed a value of 1.57 arc-minutes. Both estimates are significantly larger than the value later obtained by telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the <b>result</b> <b>may</b> be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E
5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including N.pygmaeus, N. menagensis and N.javanicus) were shown to be genetically distinct—the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from some individuals of N.coucang and N.bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with {{members of their own}} species. The authors suggest that this <b>result</b> <b>may</b> be explained by introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N.coucang individuals was not known. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N.bengalensis and N.coucang, and suggested that there has been gene flow between the two species.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had been}} costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew-served weapons {{had also been}} captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was {{little doubt that the}} Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly-in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the <b>result</b> <b>may</b> have been different. Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid {{in the direction of the}} main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified.|$|E
