Questions have been raised about whether similar activity exists in Medicare Part D. GAO was asked to (1) {{determine the extent to}} which Medicare beneficiaries obtained frequently abused drugs from multiple prescribers, (2) identify examples of doctor shopping activity, and (3) determine the actions taken by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to limit access to drugs for known abusers. To meet the objectives, GAO analyzed Medicare Part D <b>claims</b> for calendar <b>year</b> <b>2008</b> to identify potential doctor shoppers. To identify examples, GAO chose a nonrepresentative selection of 10 beneficiaries based on a number of factors, including the number of prescribers.

40|$|Purposes: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the incidence rate of epilepsy in 2009 among various patient populations of Arizona seniors enrolled in Medicaid. Additionally, this study aimed to assess the incremental and relative economic and healthcare resource burden of new-onset epilepsy compared with those without newly diagnosed epilepsy. Methods: Arizona Medicaid <b>claims</b> data <b>years</b> <b>2008</b> through 2010 were used for this analysis. Patients who were at least 65 years of age as of January 1, 2009 and were continuously enrolled in any coverage group pertaining to Arizona Medicaid for at least 12 months during 2008 and 2009 were considered eligible for the 2009 cohort; patients who were continuously enrolled during 2008 but not at all during 2009 were excluded. In addition to meeting the criteria for the 2009 cohort, incident cases of 2009 must also have epilepsy-related healthcare claims, a one-year clean period during which they cannot have any epilepsy-related healthcare claim, and that their first epilepsy-related healthcare claim in 2009 cannot have with a diagnosis code of 345. x 1. The outcome variables assessed included incidence rate of being diagnosed with epilepsy, total monthly healthcare costs, total monthly inpatient costs, total monthly outpatient costs, total monthly prescription costs, incidence rate of inpatient stay, and incidence rate of physician visits. Results: The incidence rate of epilepsy in 2009 for this population was 7. 9 per 1, 000. Patients with epilepsy-related disease-based risk factors and of younger age had significantly greater incidence rate compared with their counterparts. In general, total monthly healthcare costs and incidence rate of inpatient stay were approximately three times greater in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy compared with their counterpart (p < 0. 001); incremental total monthly healthcare costs in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy reached 2, 077 US dollars. Conclusion: The Arizona Medicaid population appeared to have higher incidence rate compared with the US Medicare and the general US population. Additionally, Arizona Medicaid beneficiaries with newly diagnosed epilepsy had significantly greater healthcare costs and resource utilization compared with those without epilepsy...|$|R

40|$|Background-—Reducing {{hospital}} readmissions is a {{key component}} of reforms for stroke care. Current readmission prediction models lack accuracy and are limited by data being from only acute hospitalizations. We hypothesized that patient-level factors from a nationwide post–acute care database would improve prediction modeling. Methods and Results-—Medicare inpatient <b>claims</b> for the <b>year</b> <b>2008</b> that used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were used to identify ischemic stroke patients older than age 65. Unique individuals were linked to comprehensive post–acute care assessments through use of the Minimum Data Set (MDS). Logistic regression was used to construct risk-adjusted readmission models. Covariates were derived from MDS variables. Among 39 178 patients directly admitted to nursing homes after hospitalization due to acute stroke, there were 29 338 (75 %) with complete MDS assessments. Crude rates of readmission and death at 30 days were 8448 (21 %) and 2791 (7 %), respectively. Risk-adjusted models identified multiple independent predictors of all-cause 30 -day readmission. Model performance of the readmission model using MDS data had a c-statistic of 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 64 to 0. 66). Higher levels of social engagement, a marker of nursing home quality, were associated with progressively lower odds of readmission (odds ratio 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 55 to 0. 92). Conclusions-—Individual clinical characteristics from the post–acute care setting resulted in only modest improvement in the c-statistic relative to previous models that used only Medicare Part A data. Individual-level characteristics do not sufficiently account for the risk of acute hospital readmission. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2015; 4 :e 002145 doi: 10. 1161 /JAHA. 115. 002145...|$|R
