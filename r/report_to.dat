At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a <b>report</b> <b>to</b> the state about the special education program, a <b>report</b> <b>to</b> a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a <b>report</b> <b>to</b> another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures.
