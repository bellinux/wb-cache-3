As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink <b>rate</b> <b>increases,</b> and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact.

5|$|Predators of {{treecreeper}} nests {{and young}} include the great spotted woodpecker, red squirrel, and small mustelids, and predation {{is about three}} times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation <b>rate</b> <b>increases</b> {{with the amount of}} forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E

Rhythmic restructuring {{is considered}} {{here as the}} reorganization of stress groups due to speech <b>rate</b> <b>increase.</b> The Dynamical Speech Rhythm model {{was used as a}} theoretical background for the acoustic analyses. Main results have shown that speech <b>rate</b> <b>increase</b> reorganizes speech rhythm and modifies some pho-netic parameters in the following way: a) the standard deviation of vowel-to-vowel (VV) duration and stress group duration is smaller at faster rates; b) stress group duration tends to be con-stant with speech <b>rate</b> <b>increase</b> (rhythmic restructurings make VV units smaller, but with a greater number of VV units per stress group, what results in a statistically constant stress group duration); c) the number of VV units per stress group propor-tionally <b>increases</b> with speech <b>rate</b> <b>increase</b> due to rhythmic re-struturings; and d) speech <b>rate</b> <b>increase</b> exacerbates the mixture character of Brazilian Portuguese rhythm, i. e., tendencies to syl-lable as to stress-timed rhythm. 1...|$|R

5|$|As Energy Minister, Baird was {{entrusted}} with implementing the government's plan {{to sell off}} part of Ontario's Hydro One. A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals. The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly {{in many parts of}} the province. Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government's price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested that the <b>rate</b> <b>increases</b> resulted from an unusually hot summer. Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap. The government continued to support deregulation in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office. The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves announced that Hydro One would remain under public control.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate <b>rate</b> <b>increases.</b> It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|The secular {{effects of}} a distant massive planet alters this behavior, causing the longitudes of {{perihelion}} of anti-aligned objects to librate, or oscillate within a limited range of values, while their perihelia rise and fall. As the angle between an anti-aligned object's perihelion and Planet Nine's (delta longitude of perihelion on diagram) climbs beyond 180° Planet Nine exerts an increasingly positive torque on the object. This torque increases the object's angular momentum, causing the eccentricity of its orbit to decline (see blue curves on diagram) and its perihelion to rise away from Neptune's orbit. While the object's eccentricity is declining its precession rate is slowing. Once the object's precession rate becomes slower than that of Planet Nine delta longitude of perihelion begins to descend. After delta longitude of perihelion drops below 180° the object begins to feel an increasingly negative torque. This causes the object's angular momentum to decrease, and its eccentricity grows and perihelion falls. When the object's eccentricity is again large, its precession <b>rate</b> <b>increases,</b> causing delta longitude of perihelion to climb toward 180°, returning the object to its original orbit.|$|E

5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink <b>rate</b> <b>increases,</b> and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart <b>rate</b> <b>increases,</b> and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E
