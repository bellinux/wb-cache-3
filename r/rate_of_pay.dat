About 4 percent of workforce, 11.4 million workers, a year are temporary workers. Journalist Barbara Ehrenreich, found that people went from solid middle-class jobs to minimum-wage employment.|$|E

25|$|The {{soldiers}} of the squadron were recruited from the cavalry regiments of the Imperial Guard or {{from those of the}} line, and they had to be at least 1.80m tall. Their salary was 1,000 gold francs a year for guardsmen and trumpeters, an amount which was particularly high at the time.

25|$|Parliament {{suffered}} chronic {{difficulties in}} obtaining sufficient manpower, {{and found it}} impossible to fill the quotas they had set. The Army was a deeply unpopular profession, one contentious issue being pay. A Private infantryman was paid a wage of just 8d. per day, the same pay as for a New Model Army infantryman, 130 years earlier. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> in the army was insufficient to meet the rising costs of living, turning off potential recruits, as service was nominally for life.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} regarding {{the status of}} photography as a fine arts medium that {{is reflected in the}} unwillingness of some nude models for other fine art media to also pose for photography. The experience of nude modeling for an amateur photographer is different from that of posing for figure drawing/painting. Traditional media create a single image that is not a true likeness of the individual model, but photographs require a release {{in order to protect the}} model's right to privacy. The hourly <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> for models posing for fine art photography is much higher than for other media, although less than for commercial photography.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{announced that a}} committee be convened under Lord Desborough that would look at all aspects of police forces in England, Wales, and Scotland. One {{of the things the}} committee highlighted was the inconsistency in police pay. At the time, there was no uniform pay structure for the police. Local Watch Committees were the sole arbiters of police pay. The pay of agricultural workers and unskilled labourers had outstripped that of the police. The Desborough Committee recorded that the pay for the average constable serving in a provincial force with five years service who was married with two children would earn 2 pounds 15 shillings , including all their allowances such as rent and a child allowance. The Desborough Committee cited examples that a street sweeper in Newcastle-on-Tyne was on the same <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> as a constable in the provincial force. Ten other examples cited by the committee also showed police were paid less than menial labour occupations, six of which paid higher than the Metropolitan Police. Lord Desborough was therefore quite sympathetic to the plight of the ordinary policeman regarding pay, and consequently recommended comparatively generous increases.|$|E
25|$|In July 1808 Major Lefebure and Jones were {{selected}} {{to serve as the}} two assistant-commissioners under General Leith, appointed military and semi-diplomatic agent to the junta of the northern provinces of Spain. Jones was attached to the army of the Marquis de la Romana, and conceived a great affection for its commander. Towards {{the end of the year}} Leith was ordered to take command of a brigade and to select an officer to succeed him as commissioner. Leith offered to appoint Jones, but Jones declined, although the high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> was tempting, on the ground that his youth and want of rank would deprive his advice of its proper weight, and he asked instead to join the army. Leith at once appointed him his acting aide-de-camp. Jones continued to act in this capacity until after the skirmish in front of Lugo, when he was ordered, as an engineer officer, to assist in blowing up the bridge over the Tamboya, and was employed with his own corps during the retreat to Corunna. On his arrival in England Jones resumed his staff appointment at Woolwich, and on 24 June 1809 was promoted first captain. On the 9th of the following month he was appointed brigade-major to the engineers under Brigadier-General Fyers, to accompany the expedition under the Earl of Chatham to Walcheren.|$|E
25|$|The year 342 BC was one {{of crisis}} for the Roman state, with the Roman legions {{stationed}} around Capua, {{as well as the}} surrounding Campanian towns, rebelling and marching on Rome. In this crisis, Corvus was appointed Dictator to deal with the mutineers. He met them at the head of an army some eight miles outside of Rome, but decided to negotiate with the rebels instead of fighting a battle. Using his past association with the army to gain their trust, he was able to reach an agreement with the rebels. He agreed and pushed through laws (the ne cui militum fraudi secessio fuit) which granted the mutinous soldiers immunity from prosecution, prevented the removal of a soldier’s name from the roll of service without his consent, and prohibited any Military Tribune being demoted down to the rank of centurion. He however refused to agree to the lowering of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> for the cavalrymen, and to the immediate execution of the Decemviri. It was also alleged that, during the troubles that brought about the passage of the Leges Genuciae, Corvus suggested that the Senate agree to the plebeian demands for the abolition of all debts, but this was rejected out of hand. Some historians, such as Gary Forsythe and S. P. Oakley consider the alleged events of the mutiny to be later literary inventions, although the laws passed in this year are accurate.|$|E

500|$|Soldiers of the AIF {{were among}} the highest paid of the war. The pay for a private was set at five shillings a day, while an {{additional}} shilling was deferred to be paid on discharge. As a result, the AIF earned the sobriquet [...] "six bob a day tourists". Married men were required to allot two shillings a day for their dependents; however, a separation allowance was added in 1915. Reflecting the progressive nature of Australian industrial and social policy of the era, this <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> {{was intended to be}} equal to that of the average worker (after including rations and accommodation) and higher than that of soldiers in the Militia. In contrast, New Zealand soldiers received five shillings, while British infantrymen were initially only paid one shilling, although this was later increased to three. Junior officers in the AIF were also paid at a rate higher than those in the British Army, although senior officers were paid considerably less than their counterparts.|$|E
500|$|Once activated, the {{division}} {{remained in the}} United States for training and exercises. As {{the division}}, like all airborne units, {{was intended to be}} an elite formation, the training regime was extremely arduous. There were [...] and [...] towers built from which prospective airborne troops would jump off of to simulate landing by parachute, lengthy forced marches and practice jumps from transport aircraft; to pause in the doorway of an aircraft during a practice jump resulted in an automatic failure for the candidate. The resultant failure rate was accordingly high, but there was never a shortage of candidates, especially for the American divisions, as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> was much higher than that of an ordinary infantryman. As the division trained, a debate developed in the U.S. Army over whether the best use of airborne forces was en masse or as small compact units. On 9 July 1943, the first large-scale Allied airborne operation–the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky)–was carried out by elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the British 1st Airborne Division. The Commanding General (CG) of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division, Major General Joseph May Swing, had been temporarily assigned to act as airborne advisor to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, for the invasion of Sicily, and had observed the airborne assault, which went badly. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division had been deployed by both parachute and glider and had suffered high casualties, leading to a perception that it had failed to achieve many of its objectives.|$|E
