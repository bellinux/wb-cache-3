50|$|A {{benefit of}} the <b>revolving</b> <b>field</b> design {{is that if the}} poles are {{permanent}} magnets, then {{there is no need to}} use any slip ring and brush to deliver electricity out of the generator as the coils are stationary and can be wired directly from the generator to the external loads.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} turbine at Lauffen powered a three-phase alternator with a <b>revolving</b> <b>field.</b> The alternator revolved at 150 revolutions per minute, {{and had a}} rotating field magnet with 32 poles. It was rated at 300 hp and had a terminal voltage of 55 volts. The frequency of the current was 40 Hz. Power from the alternator was stepped up to 8000 volts for transmission by oil-insulated transformers. Later tests were carried out with transmission voltage up to 25,000 volts (between phases).|$|E
40|$|Considering {{motional}} {{effects in}} the steady-state finite-element simulation of single-phase induction machines inevitably requires a transient approach. The resulting computation time seriously hampers the application of finite elements within technical designs. In this paper, time-harmonic finite-element simulation, as commonly applied to the three-phase induction machine model, is also enabled for single-phase motors by decomposing the air-gap <b>field</b> in two <b>revolving</b> <b>fields</b> in the opposite direction. The advantages and drawbacks of the novel approach are illustrated by a benchmark model. Issues such as ferromagnetic saturation, external circuit coupling, adaptive mesh refinement, and torque computation are addressed. The method is used to simulate a capacitor start/run motor. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|MICROCOPTER {{is being}} {{developed}} with a copter-based propulsion system. The robot uses a rotor-shaped magnetic dipole placed in a rapidly <b>revolving</b> magnetic <b>field.</b> The rotor will constantly align itself with this magnetic field therefore mimicking a helicopter if the magnetic field can be moved quickly enough.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} <b>revolving</b> <b>field</b> {{generators}} {{is to have}} the armature part on stator and the magnetic field part on rotor. A basic design of <b>revolving</b> <b>field</b> single-phase generator is shown on the right. There are two magnetic poles, north and south, attached to a rotor and two coils which are connected in series and equally spaced on stator. The windings of the two coils are in reverse direction to have the current to flow in the same direction because the two coils always interact with opposing polarities. Since poles and coils are equally spaced and the locations of the poles match to the locations of the coils, the magnetic lines of force are cut at the same amount at any degree of the rotor. As a result, the voltages induced to all windings have the same value at any given time. The voltages from both coils are [...] "in phase" [...] to each other. Therefore the total output voltage is two times the voltage induced in each winding. In the figure, at the position where pole number 1 and coil number 1 meet, the generator produces the highest output voltage on one direction. As the rotor turns 180 degrees, the output voltage is alternated to produce the highest voltage on the other direction. The frequency of the AC output in this case equals to the number of rotations of the rotor per second.|$|E
50|$|Any {{polyphase}} system, {{by virtue}} of the time displacement of the currents in the phases, makes it possible to easily generate a magnetic field that revolves at the line frequency. Such a revolving magnetic field makes polyphase induction motors possible. Indeed, where induction motors must run on single-phase power (such as is usually distributed in homes), the motor must contain some mechanism to produce a <b>revolving</b> <b>field,</b> otherwise the motor cannot generate any stand-still torque and will not start. The field produced by a single-phase winding can provide energy to a motor already rotating, but without auxiliary mechanisms the motor will not accelerate from a stop when energized.|$|E
5000|$|The Niagara Power Station No. 1, as it {{was then}} called, would {{eventually}} generate [...] of electricity. There were 10 generator rated [...] of the outside <b>revolving</b> <b>field,</b> vertical shaft type. The generators were separated into two banks of five generators each with independent switchboards. The output was at 2,000 volts to serve in and around Niagara Falls. There were transformers to step up the voltage to 10,000 volts to serve the medium distance around Niagara Falls areas. The voltage was also stepped up to 20,000 to serve the longer distance for Buffalo, Lockport, and Tonawanda. The station was the model for a second similar station built in 1904. The entire plant was officially named after Edward Dean Adams in 1927.|$|E

5000|$|A {{transformer}} supplying a three-wire {{distribution system}} has a single-phase input (primary) winding. The output (secondary) winding is center-tapped {{and the center}} tap connected to a grounded neutral. As shown in Fig. 1. either end to center has half the voltage of end-to-end. Fig. 2 illustrates the phasor diagram of the output voltages for a split-phase transformer. Since the two phasors do not define a unique direction of rotation for a [...] <b>revolving</b> magnetic <b>field,</b> a split single-phase is not a two-phase system.|$|R
50|$|A {{synchronous}} motor {{may have a}} squirrel-cage winding embedded in its rotor, used to increase the motor starting torque and so decrease the time to accelerate to synchronous speed. The squirrel cage winding of a synchronous machine will generally be smaller than for an induction machine of similar rating. When the rotor is turning {{at the same speed}} as the stator's <b>revolving</b> magnetic <b>field,</b> no current is induced into the squirrel-cage windings and the windings will have no further effect on the operation of the {{synchronous motor}} at steady-state.|$|R
50|$|The {{revolving}} part of alternators {{can be the}} armature or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used. The <b>revolving</b> <b>field</b> type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the slip ring connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a slip ring connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts; manufacture of slip ring connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} an axial gap permanent magnet 	type high temperature superconducting synchronous motor 	(PMHTSSM) at liquid nitrogen temperature. There are two distinctive 	differences between this motor and the conventional HTS 	motors. The permanent magnet {{is applied to}} the field, iron cores 	and HTS wires are used as the armature. The motor has eight field 	poles, and six armature windings. The armature is put between 	the two fields. The field composes eight permanent magnets which 	are arranged as a circle. Four poles share three armature coils 	and there are two coils for every phase. The BSCCO wires, which 	are applied to armature windings, work at the temperatures of 	between 66 K and 70 K. The rated output is 400 kW at 250 rpm. 	It is known that superconducting wires have AC loss if they are 	operated at alternating magnetic fields. That is why there are few 	motors developed with superconducting armature windings. Also, 	there is no report of motors applying HTS wires such as BSCCO 	wires to armature windings. Furthermore, this motor adopted the 	<b>revolving</b> <b>field</b> type structure, so the brushes were not needed and 	the cooling system can be fixed.

Introduction: The {{generator}} tested is in {{the power}} plant of the Manhattan Ice, Light and Power Company, Manhattan, Kansas. Its regular work is to carry the lighting load {{during the second half}} of the night. It is belt driven by a 14 ” x 21,” Erie City, simple, non-condensing engine of one hundred and fifty horse power capacity at ninety five pounds steam pressure. The engine’s normal speed is one hundred and seventy eight revolutions per minute. The power is transmitted by a pulley nine feet, three inches in diameter to a twenty one inch pulley on the generator shaft. The generator is manufactured by the General Electric Company, Schenectady, New York. It is the <b>revolving</b> <b>field,</b> stationary armature type and is self-excited from a direct current shunt generator carried on the same shaft. The armature windings of the alternator are of the distributed, “Barrel” type. The core is of cast steel punchings laid together with suitable ducts to insure good ventilation through all parts. The coils are from wound and are laid on the core and held in place by beach wood wedges, which are driven into slots over the coils. This allows the speedy removal of damaged coils. As the armature is stationary, the insulation can be made more secure. It these machines the armature insulation is required to withstand four or five times the normal working pressure...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A capacitor-run motor is often necessary where silent running, low starting current, high efficiency and power factor and overload capacity are required. When a capacitor· motor is used in control or similar applications {{a knowledge of the}} variation in performance over a range of supply frequency is often important, and this has been investigated by previous workers using analyses of varying validity. For example, in early studies it was common to base performance calculations on the <b>revolving</b> <b>field</b> theory, when a general lack of agreement was found between calculated and test values. This occurred particularly in the starting wlnding under running conditions, and was attributed usually to saturation and to space harmonics of mmf. The crossfield theory provides a useful alternative to the revolving-field theory for analyses of single-phase motors, and when applied to the capacitor motor it is found that a much more accurate prediction of the machine performance is obtained. This thesis investigates the behaviour of a small singlephase capacitor-run induction motor with relation to variable frequency supplies and different capacitor values. The performance of the capacitor motor is calculated, using an equivalent circuit developed from basic cross-field theory considerations. However, before calculating the performance of the motor, the experimental determination of the parameters involved is necessary. From the equivalent circuit for no-load and locked rotor conditions, a set of voltage/current equations was obtained. Use of these equations requires a very complicated set of mathematical procedures to determine the required parameters, and no solution could be found. This difficulty was overcome by the extensive use of a digital computer, enabling the parameters to be obtained by the Newton-Raphson method of numerical iteration. Using these parameters, the predicted performance of the machine was compared with that obtained from an extensive experimental investigation. The agreement which was found to exist confirms both the validity of the theoretical analysis and the accuracy of the measurement from which the parameters were derived...|$|E

Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: An alternator is a machine, {{having a}} field and an armature, which generates an alternating current. The field may be either stationary or revolving, though usually of the revolving type. Nearly all the alternators {{of the present}} time are of the <b>revolving</b> <b>field</b> and stationary armature type, as it avoids the collection of high tension currents through brushes, since the armature may be permanently connected up, and only low tension direct -current need be fed through the rings to the field. Other advantages are, increased room for armature insulation, and, in polyphasers, the necessity for only two instead of three or more slip-rings. The revolving armature is still used to some extent on small machines of low voltage capacity. The alternaing current is produced by passing a coil of wire first over a north pole and then over a south pole, so that a current is first generated {{in one direction and}} then in the other, in the inductors. The current changes direction in the coil every time that it passes under a pole of the opposite polarity. At a point between the two poles, in passing from one to the other, the coil passes for a very small increment of time over a space in which there are no lines of force being cut {{and at the same time}} there is no current or E. M. F. generatedin the coil. At this point the E. M. F. generated is of minimum value or zero; but as soon as the coil begins to enter the field of the next pole, the E. M. F. begins to increase in the opposite direction until the point under the center of the pole piece or field of greatest density is reached, when the E. M. F. reaches its maximum value and again begins to decrease to zero, after which it again rises and falls in the opposite direction. When a current...|$|E

5000|$|The {{shape and}} depth of the rotor bars {{can be used to}} vary the speed-torque {{characteristics}} of the induction motor. At standstill, the <b>revolving</b> magnetic <b>field</b> passes the rotor bars at a high rate, inducing line-frequency current into the rotor bars. Due to the skin effect, the induced current tends to flow at {{the outer edge of the}} winding. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency decreases and induced current flows at greater depths in the winding. By tapering the profile of the rotor bars to vary their resistance at different depths, or by constructing a double squirrel cage, the motor can be arranged to produce more or less torque at standstill and near its synchronous speed.|$|R

Induction motors designed for two-phase operation use a similar winding configuration as capacitor start single-phase motors (however, in a two-phase induction motor, the impedances of the two windings are identical, whereas in a single-phase induction motor, the impedances can be, and usually are, quite different, to reduce cost without sacrificing starting performance; indeed, some single-phase capacitor start/capacitor run induction motors have superior starting characteristics when compared to two- or three-phase induction motors.) ...|$|R
