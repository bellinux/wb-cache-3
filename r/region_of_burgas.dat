40|$|The {{presented}} study {{deals with}} the interpretation of soil quality monitoring data using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA). Both statistical methods contributed to the correct data classification and projection of the surface (0 – 20  cm) and subsurface (20 – 40  cm) soil layers of 36 sampling sites in the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Burgas,</b> Bulgaria. Clustering of the variables led to formation of four significant clusters corresponding to possible sources defining the soil quality like agricultural activity, industrial impact, fertilizing, etc. Two major clusters were found to explain the sampling site locations according to soil composition—one cluster for coastal and mountain sites and another—for typical rural and industrial sites. Analogous results were obtained {{by the use of}} PCA. The advantage of the latter was the opportunity to offer more quantitative interpretation of the role of identified soil quality sources by the level of explained total variance. The score plots and the dendrogram of the sampling sites indicated a relative spatial homogeneity according to geographical location and soil layer depth. The high-risk areas and pollution profiles were detected and visualized using surface maps based on Kriging algorithm...|$|E

Child`s excellent vision is extremely important for his or her good physical and psychical development, social adaptation, formation of the entire personality. The purpose of this study is parents` health culture necessary for keeping the children`s sight in a good state. The object of this study is how to provide health education. A thorough analysis has been made on the literature ranging over that problem using the sociological research methods, as following: documentary and inquiry ones; a comparative analysis method. The inquiry was conducted in the month of March - April in 2016. The participants in that research were some accidentally selected parents in the <b>Region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Burgas</b> and parents of pupils attending Mihail Lakatnik Primary Base School in the town of Burgas. The results obtained from the above said inquiry defined negative health behaviors on the part of the predominant group of parents towards the preventive cares for children`s eye health protection. Regardless of the existing Vision 2020 – The Right to Sight Program, a lack of an adequate collaboration has been evidenced among parents, outpatients` assistance specialist, ophthalmologists, health care professionals, teachers. The analysis of the results obtained by the research have demonstrated the necessity to improve parents awareness and raise their responsibility towards children`s eyesight protection and to plan and conduct a series of preventive activities with the purpose of non admission of eye diseases development and traumatic lesions occurrence. ...|$|E
50|$|The Strandzha dialect is a dialect of the Bulgarian language, {{member of}} the Rup or Southeastern Bulgarian dialects. The present range of the dialect {{includes}} the Bulgarian part of Strandzha. In the past, the dialect was spoken on a much larger territory and extended far down into Eastern Thrace, now in Turkey. Following the Balkan wars, the Bulgarian population there was forced to flee to Bulgaria, settling mostly in the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Burgas</b> and Varna in eastern Bulgaria.|$|R

The present range of the dialect {{includes}} the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Haskovo, Parvomay, Elhovo, Harmanli, Svilengrad, Topolovgrad and Ivaylovgrad. In the past, the dialect was spoken on a much larger territory and extended far down into Eastern and Western Thrace, now in Turkey and Greece, respectively.

5000|$|The Subbalkan dialect is a Bulgarian dialect, {{which is}} part of the Balkan group of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. Its range {{includes}} the northeastern part of Bulgarian Thrace, i.e. the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Burgas,</b> Sliven, Yambol, Stara Zagora and Chirpan. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, speakers of the Subbalkan dialect have moved en masse to northeastern Bulgaria and now form a vast portion of the population of the districts of Varna, Dobrich and Balchik. Some of these also went as far as Bessarabia establishing numerous colonies there. Nowadays, a large part of the Bessarabian Bulgarians speak this dialect. The most significant feature of the Subbalkan dialect, as in all Balkan dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic ѣ (yat) as [...] or , depending on the character of the following syllable.|$|R
50|$|The Moesian dialects are a {{group of}} closely related dialects of the Bulgarian language, part of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. The Moesian dialects are spoken in northeastern Bulgaria and in the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Karnobat, Aytos, <b>Burgas</b> and Yambol in {{southern}} Bulgaria. However, due to the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th {{and the beginning of}} the 20th century, nowadays, there are very few areas where only Moesian is spoken. In most areas, and especially in southern Bulgaria and Dobruja, Moesian speakers are mixed with speakers speaking Balkan dialects. As a result of this and also due to the influence of the literary language, most features of the Moesian dialects have given way to features typical for the Balkan dialects.|$|R
