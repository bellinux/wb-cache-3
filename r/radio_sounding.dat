40|$|The {{propagation}} of thunderstorms in southern Germany was investigated. The thunderstorms were observed by a lightning position system {{during the summer}} months of the years 1992 to 1996. On average every second day thunderstorms were observed anywhere in southern Germany. In general thunderstorms approach from westerly and south-westerly directions. The average speed is 13 m/s. No significant relation between the occurrence of thunderstorms and the large scale synoptic pattern described by the Grosswetterlagen (large scale weather pattern) was found. Thunderstorms were observed during almost all Grosswetterlagen. The reduction to 8 weather pattern based on the low-level flow in southern Germany showed that thunderstorms are likely when the flow has westerly directions (43 %) or easterly directions (20 %). Three distinct groups of different lightning patterns could be identified; stationary, moving thunderstorms and thunderstorm lines. The convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the wind shear were retrieved from the <b>radio</b> <b>soundings</b> from Muenchen and Stuttgart. On average CAPE was 583 J/kg for stationary, 701 J/kg for moving thunderstorms, and 876 J/kg for thunderstorm lines. The average bulk Richardson numbers are 152, 80 and 52 for stationary, moving thunderstorms and thunderstorm lines, respectively. The steering level was found to be at about 3 and 6 km m. s. l. However, it should be noted, that in most cases the soundings do not completely describe the local environment of thunderstorms, since <b>radio</b> <b>soundings</b> are only available twice a day.

Especially, {{in the vicinity of}} Mizuho Plateau, gravity data made it possible to analyze three-dimensional subsurface structures. The data have revealed several contradictions between gravity anomaly and ice thickness measured by <b>radio</b> echo <b>sounding.</b> To explain ice thickness data and gravity anomaly-bedrock height relations without any contradiction, about 5 g/cm^ 3 of bedrock density is required. This high density is quite unnatural. In this study, the authors tried to construct the three-dimensional bedrock topography and shape of the Moho discontinuity by using gravity anomaly data. Through the analysis, we clarified the characteristics of the contradictions and found that ice thickness determined by <b>radio</b> echo <b>soundings</b> is always smaller than the actual thickness by a constant factor. Possible explanations are : 1) <b>radio</b> echo <b>sounding</b> detects an intra-ice discontinuity due to moraine and/or climatic change origin; 2) error of radio wave velocity due to variation of the estimated dielectric constant.

Application of this technique to Jupiter's icy moons and the surrounding Jovian magnetosphere will provide unique remote sensing observations of the plasma and magnetic field environments and the subsurface conductivities, of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Spatial structures of ionospheric plasma above the surfaces of the moons vary in response to magnetic-field perturbations from (1) magnetospheric plasma flows, (2) ionospheric currents from ionization of sputtered surface material, and (3) induced electric currents in salty subsurface oceans and from the plasma flows and ionospheric currents themselves. <b>Radio</b> <b>sounding</b> from 3 kHz to 10 MHz can provide the global electron densities necessary for the extraction of the oceanic current signals and supplements in-situ plasma and magnetic field measurements. While <b>radio</b> <b>sounding</b> requires high transmitter power for subsurface sounding, little power is needed to probe the electron density and magnetic field intensity near the spacecraft. For subsurface sounding, reflections occur at changes in the dielectric index, e. g., at the interfaces between two different phases of water or between water and soil.

40|$|Due to its fine-resolution {{requirement}} {{and subsequent}} computational demand, Large Eddy Simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer {{is limited in}} most cases to computational domains extending only a few kilometers in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Variations in the flow and in relevant atmospheric fields (e. g. temperature) that occur at larger scales must be imposed through boundary conditions or as external forcing. In this work we study the influence of such variations on the wind profile in Large Eddy Simulations of daytime atmospheric boundary layers, by comparing observations with simulations that use progressively more realistic forcing relative to observed large-scale pressure gradients. Two case studies are presented. One is based on measurements from the rural site of Høvsøre in Denmark, {{and the other on}} measurements from a suburban site in Hamburg, Germany. The applied domain-scale pressure gradient and its height- and time-dependence are estimated from LIDAR measurements of the wind speed above the atmospheric boundary layer in the Høvsøre case, and from <b>radio</b> <b>soundings</b> and a network of ground-based pressure sensors in the Hamburg case. In the two case studies, LIDAR measurements of the wind speed up to heights between 900 and 1600 m and tower-based measurements up to 100 and 250 m are used to evaluate the performance of the variably-driven Large Eddy Simulations. We find in both case studies that including height- and time-variations in the applied pressure gradient has a significant influence on simulated wind speeds, and improves agreement with measured wind speeds, especially in the Høvsøre case. In the Hamburg case, an overly simplified specification of the height dependence of the forcing, as well as the influence of phenomena such as large-scale subsidence and advection, tend to reduce agreement with measurements, relative to the Høvsøre case. The Hamburg case illustrates that measurements of the surface pressure gradient and relatively infrequent <b>radio</b> <b>soundings</b> alone are not sufficient for accurate estimation of a height- and time-dependent pressure gradient...|$|R
