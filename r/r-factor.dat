The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times.

40|$|Introduction: Health service {{research}} {{often involves}} the active participation of healthcare professionals. However, their ability {{and commitment to}} research varies. This can cause recruitment difficulties and thereby prolong the study period and inflate budgets. Solberg has identified seven <b>R-factors</b> as determinants for successfully recruiting healthcare professionals: relationships, reputation, requirements, rewards, reciprocity, resolution, and respect. Method: This is a process evaluation of the seven <b>R-factors.</b> We applied these factors to guide the design of our recruitment strategy {{as well as to}} make adjustments when recruiting general practices in a guideline implementation study. In the guideline implementation study, we studied the effect of outreach visits, quality reports, and new patient stratification tools for low back pain patients. Results: During a period of 15 [*]months, we recruited 60 practices, which was fewer than planned (100 practices). In this evaluation, five of Solberg’s seven <b>R-factors</b> were successfully addressed and two factors were not. The need to involve (reciprocity) end users in the development of new software and the amount of time needed to conduct recruitment (resolution) were underestimated. Conclusion: The framework of the seven <b>R-factors</b> was a feasible tool in our recruitment process. However, we suggest further investigation in developing systematic approaches to support the recruitment of healthcare professionals to research...|$|R

While Eysenck's <b>R-factor</b> is easily identified as the classical [...] "left-right" [...] dimension, the T-factor (representing a factor drawn at right angles to the <b>R-factor)</b> is less intuitive, as high-scorers favored pacifism, racial equality, religious education and restrictions on abortion, while low-scorers had attitudes more friendly to militarism, harsh punishment, easier divorce laws and companionate marriage.|$|E
5000|$|The minimum {{possible}} {{value is}} zero, indicating perfect agreement between experimental observations {{and the structure}} factors predicted from the model. There is no theoretical maximum, but in practice, values are considerably less than one even for poor models, provided the model includes a suitable scale factor.

Model inadequancies such as wrong or missing parts and unmodeled disorder are the other main contributors to , making it useful to assess the progress and final result of a crystallographic model refinement. For large molecules, the <b>R-factor</b> usually ranges between 0.6 (when computed for a random model and against an experimental data set) and 0.2 (for example for a well refined macro-molecular model at a resolution of 2.5 Ångström).

40|$|By disk {{diffusion}} antimicrobial susceptibility testing, 11 % of 313 consecutive {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa, examined during July to October 1973, were resistant to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration 12. 5 to > 100 μg/ml), and a further 31 % were moderately resistant (6. 25 to 12. 5 μg/ml) to gentamicin at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, Canada. Of 45 gentamicin-resistant strains from that hospital, none possessed <b>R-factors</b> or gentamicin-inactivating enzymes.
