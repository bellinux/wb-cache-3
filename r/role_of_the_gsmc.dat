40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{a global}} {{sliding mode control}} (GSMC) scheme is {{implemented}} on a piezo-driven XY parallel micropositioning stage {{to compensate for the}} unmodeled hys-teresis aiming at a sub-micron accuracy motion tracking con-trol. <b>The</b> <b>GSMC</b> controller is designed with <b>the</b> consideration <b>of</b> all uncertainty bounds. In the controller implementation, a high-gain velocity observer is adopted to estimate the feedback velocity from the measured position. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GSMC</b> over ordinary SMC and traditional PID control is demonstrated through simulations, while <b>the</b> variations <b>of</b> design parameters on control performances are examined as well. Results show that <b>the</b> <b>GSMC</b> can reduce <b>the</b> hysteresis to a negligible level and lead to a sub-micron accuracy tracking with tolerance to some degrees of external disturbances, which provides a sound base of practical control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microposition-ing system for micro/nano scale manipulation.

How to suppress negative disturbance imposed by the interaction between water-hull-propulsion and ensure <b>the</b> normal operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marine propulsion system is a challenging task. To address this issue, a new global sliding model control (GSMC) for marine water-hull-propulsion unit systems is proposed and investigated to obtain more accurate control performance {{in a series of}} researches. In Part 1 <b>the</b> <b>GSMC</b> controller has been developed and the bounded nonlinear model uncertainties have been derived based on the experiments and sea trial. In this work <b>the</b> upper boundary <b>of</b> 1, 85 % was introduced into <b>the</b> <b>GSMC</b> controller to derive the total control law realising <b>the</b> robust control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marine propulsion system. Numerical simulations based on the real bulk carrier parameters show a high effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GSMC</b> for speed tracking, compared with the traditional sliding model controller and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller. By the proposed and investigated control system in this paper may be developed a simple practical-effective robust control strategy for marine propulsion systems subject to some complex unknown uncertainties through further investigations, validations and modification...|$|R
40|$|For <b>the</b> {{supervision}} <b>of</b> ESTRACK, {{its network}} of ground stations, ESA/ESOC {{is developing a}} new system, the Ground Station Monitoring and Control system (<b>GSMC).</b> <b>The</b> monitoring and control systems for the spacecraft missions and for the ground stations were traditionally two distinct fields. This new system builds on existing frameworks and exploits synergy between the two areas. A Common Monitoring and Control Platform (CMCP) has been implemented, starting from the infrastructure used for the spacecraft operations and complementing it with operational concepts currently in use for the ground station domain. This approach brings benefits both for spacecraft operations and for ground station operations. Whereas the previous systems focused on <b>the</b> operations <b>of</b> a single ground station in isolation, this new system provides as well an overall view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire ground station network. This gives a better support for <b>the</b> automation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operations, with enhanced capabilities to coordinate <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scheduled activities prepared by the ESTRACK planning and scheduling system. In addition, the project took into consideration constraints imposed by the transition from an existing infrastructure and configuration, with the goal to provide means to support the migration and to re-use the logic and procedures developed over the years for configuring ESTRACK ground stations for spacecraft support. This paper presents <b>the</b> main elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GSMC,</b> providing an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall monitoring and control concepts for ESTRACK ground stations, highlighting automation aspects for <b>the</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ESTRACK network...|$|R

A new global sliding model control (GSMC) for marine water-hull-propulsion unit systems is proposed to obtain more accurate control performance in this paper. <b>The</b> <b>GSMC</b> was firstly employed to establish the marine propulsion control model with nonlinear uncertainties. In <b>the</b> <b>GSMC</b> model, <b>the</b> saturation function method is applied to eliminate chattering on the sliding surface. Then the Lyapunov stability criterion is adopted to confirm <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control system. Following, for the first time, <b>the</b> boundary problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonlinear model uncertainties were investigated quantitatively. The bounded nonlinear model uncertainties required in <b>the</b> proposed <b>GSMC</b> model, involving engine torque loss / variations, power transfer for various load conditions and shaft rotational speeds, were derived based on the experiments carried out on a marine shaft-line test-bed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integrated propulsion system {{as well as a}} sea trial implemented for a running bulk carrier. An upper boundary of 1, 85 % for the model uncertainty has been obtained, which would be introduced into <b>the</b> <b>GSMC</b> for <b>the</b> integrated marine propulsion system to derive the total control law realising <b>the</b> robust control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syste...|$|R

At <b>the</b> macro level we demonstrate <b>the</b> historical development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil servant in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> archeological layers. Our focus is on <b>the</b> progression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil servant in the centraladministration. We analyze from a New Public Manage-ment perspective to identify key factors that has influenced the role. Furthermore we briefly analyze that <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil servant is dependant on what structure and culture exists in a given organization. At the meso level, <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil servant is analyzed in relation to their ministerial service. The challenges to the role is problematized through fundamental norms and obligations. The Christiania case exemplifies the relationship between the minister and top-executive and how the various expectations and duties conflict.
