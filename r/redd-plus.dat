40|$|The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) {{regime has}} been {{developing}} a voluntary climate change mitigation mechanism that is called ‘Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries; and the Role of Conservation/Conservation of Forest Carbon Stocks, Sustainable Management of Forests, and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks in Developing Countries’ (<b>REDD-plus).</b> One {{of the most important}} aspects of the implementation of <b>REDD-plus</b> activities is that the activities should not violate the rights of indigenous peoples that live within and near the forest areas. This research has identified at least three main approaches that can be used by indigenous peoples to protect their rights in the context of <b>REDD-plus.</b> The first approach is the UNFCCC approach that uses the UNFCCC regime to protect indigenous peoples in the context of <b>REDD-plus.</b> The second approach is the human rights approach; it uses human rights treaties and their bodies, the regional commissions and courts on human rights, as well as the UN bodies and special rapporteur that are pertinent to indigenous peoples’ issues to protect indigenous peoples in the context of <b>REDD-plus.</b> The third approach is the financial approach that uses the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-REDD Programme) and the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) to protect indigenous peoples in the context of <b>REDD-plus.</b> In order to increase the protection of indigenous peoples in <b>REDD-plus,</b> a coherent approach needs to be created and enhanced through cooperation and coordination by the parties that are directly or indirectly involved with the three respective approaches listed above. It {{should be noted that the}} available protection for indigenous peoples in the context of <b>REDD-plus</b> are currently insufficient to quickly address cases where the rights of indigenous peoples have been violated in <b>REDD-plus</b> activities. In order to address this insufficiency, as well as to achieve a coherent approach to protecting indigenous peoples in the context of <b>REDD-plus,</b> the research recommends the establishment of a <b>REDD-Plus</b> Committee supported by a <b>REDD-Plus</b> Panel to develop and increase the protection of indigenous peoples in <b>REDD-plus,</b> should <b>REDD-plus</b> is placed outside the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). On the other hand, if <b>REDD-plus</b> is placed under the CDM then the research recommends the establishment of a Committee on <b>REDD-Plus</b> under the CDM and a Panel on the CDM.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a grounded theoretical {{analysis of}} the <b>REDD-plus</b> programme, the multi-level system of forest governance that is being developed since 2007 under the international legal regime on climate change. It examines REDD-plus’ main elements, seeks to preliminarily assess its likely impact and suggests measures to improve its design. The focus is on effectiveness, intended {{as the ability to}} address the causes of forest loss in developing countries. The research is divided in two parts. The first part concentrates on <b>REDD-plus</b> at the international level. It explores the programme’s innovative but still fragmented and contradictory use of ‘policy approaches’ and ‘positive incentives’, and assesses its strengths and weaknesses {{in the context of the}} broader trend towards the ‘neo-liberalisation’ of international environmental policy. The second part examines <b>REDD-plus</b> at the national and sub-national levels. It uses sustainable landscape governance as the overarching conceptual and physical framework for the effective implementation of <b>REDD-plus</b> activities and suggests three areas of public policy that should be prioritised by participant countries: tenure, spatial planning and financial intermediation. The dissertation examines each policy area in detail and provides specific recommendations on the measures available to overcome current problems. It argues that the programme’s effectiveness would be magnified by combining public policy and market instruments in such a way as to facilitate the negotiation of trade-offs between multiple environmental and development objectives and between diverse stakeholders. Building on this analysis, the conclusions advance some considerations on the possible significance of <b>REDD-plus</b> for the development of international environmental law...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Data {{availability}} {{in developing}} countries {{is known to be}} extremely varied {{and is one of the}} constraints for setting the national reference levels (RLs) for the <b>REDD-plus</b> (i. e. 'Policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation {{in developing countries}}; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries') under the UNFCCC. Taking Thailand as a case study country, this paper compares three types of RLs, which require different levels of datasets, including a simple historic RL, a projected forest-trend RL, and a business-as-usual (BAU) RL. Results Other than the finding that different RLs yielded different estimations on future deforestation areas, the analysis also identified the characteristics of each RL. The historical RL demanded simple data, but can be varied in accordance with a reference year or period. The forest-trend RL can be more reliable than the historical RL, if the country's deforestation trend curve is formed smoothly. The complicated BAU RL is useful as it can demonstrate the additionality of <b>REDD-plus</b> activities and distinguish the country's unintentional efforts. Conclusions With the <b>REDD-plus</b> that involves widespread participation, there should be steps from which countries choose the appropriate RL; ranging from simpler to more complex measures, in accordance with data availability in each country. Once registered with <b>REDD-plus,</b> the countries with weak capacity and capability should be supported to enhance the data collection system in that country. </p...|$|E

MEAs promote private participation in sustainable development mainly by creating new investment opportunities.

40|$|In {{the current}} debate and {{analysis}} on new forms of governance, the attention is rarely focused on the instruments to assess “good governance” effects. A well-consolidated system of indicators for measuring governance {{does not exist in}} forestry yet. World-wide, evaluation criteria and related indicators have been developed so far mainly for analyzing policies and governance issues at international, regional or national scales. The World Bank assessment of the governance in a country for evaluating risks of development cooperation investments, and the REFGOV project in Europe to assess the public sector governance are examples of these kind of policy-level analysis. Nevertheless, most of the emerging economic mechanisms for promoting SFM have to be implemented in the field, at local operational scale, by means of projects planning and monitoring instruments. These economic mechanisms are expected to have unprecedented effects on land use policies and related decision making processes, requiring deep changes in the role of stakeholders, in their reciprocal relationships and networking, in communication systems, in decision making procedures, in channels for resources flows: in other words, deep changes on governance. By analyzing examples of emerging economic mechanisms (including PES schemes, <b>REDD-plus</b> projects and forest certification initiatives), the paper aims to individualize key-indicators and related quantitative variables for assessing relevant dimensions of “good governance” in forestry (e. g. transparency, participation, accountability, capacity), at the level of projects implementation. The attempt is to indentify cheap and reliable secondary data’s sources, when available, and proper instruments for collecting and analyzing primary data.

40|$|The climate {{negotiations}} at the COP 15 in December 2009 did {{not produce}} a new international treaty with binding emissions commitments but the Copenhagen Accord for dealing with post- 2012 climate change. Given the current climate negotiation process {{it is unlikely that}} we will see a global climate agreement soon on a global cap between all Convention members participating in a single carbon market. We {{may be more likely to}} see a stepwise process moving towards this scenario, most likely involving linkages between different national policy programs when it comes to mitigation as well as offsetting emissions. In such a process countries will offer commitments based on their domestic abilities, preferences and policies, norms and institutions. National and sub-national policies are thus likely to be the de-facto building blocks of nations' abilities to make and fulfill international commitments. However, also with multilateral mitigation programs without binding commitments, carbon markets will be needed as well as international authorities that support measurement, reporting and verification rules and the international registries. Such markets will necessarily be complicated and temporary in a world without an overarching binding agreement. There will be numerous tradeoffs between different kinds of second-best arrangements. The purpose of this report is to build knowledge about the effects of the development of regional and international carbon markets and the auxiliary technology agreements that might be needed. Among the topics we address are: the evolution and integration of carbon markets, the impacts of policy and technology cost uncertainty on the cost of meeting targets through a carbon market mechanism, the effect of banking, price floors and ceilings, institutional constraints and technological change in the further development of carbon markets and their links to other environmental policy instruments, and the potential of <b>REDD-plus</b> to encourage sustainable forest development and climate mitigation.

40|$|Approximately 13 million {{hectares}} of tropical forests are cut down annually, contributing 12 - 20 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. REDD+ (Reduction in Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) {{is designed to}} tackle this challenge by providing economic incentives for conservation, restoration and sustainable management of forests. In addition to emissions reductions, REDD+ also {{has the capacity to}} deliver co-benefits including biodiversity conservation and rural development by conserving species-rich forests and providing poor forest communities with alternative livelihoods. The Philippines, a biodiversity hotspot with the seventh highest deforestation rate in the world seeks to maximize these co-benefits during project planning and site selection. The 2010 Philippine National <b>REDD-plus</b> Strategy outlines the rationale for targeting project sites, however, a national-scale spatial prioritization assessment has yet to be conducted. This study performs a multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) analysis using five environmental and socio-economic indicators (carbon stocks, deforestation rate, biodiversity, indigenous community areas, and poverty incidence). The model is then applied in geographic information system (GIS) to spatially identify potential priority areas (by province and municipality) for REDD+ investment in the Philippines. Having a clear, publicly available prioritization method ensures that REDD+ funds are allocated efficiently, and that the overall environmental and social objectives of the program are being effectively conveyed on the ground. It can also provide informed accounting of the trade-offs made between carbon, co-benefits and costs. The results from the MAUT decision framework and subsequent spatial analysis show four geographic scenarios coinciding with various possible stakeholder priorities. Areas with high utility scores were located primarily in the uplands, with some scenarios overlapping with the existing REDD+ pilot sites. While carbon, biodiversity and socioeconomic indicators proved to be spatially correlated, deforestation rates were not and thus require higher trade-offs. Additional, more detailed maps and studies on indicators are needed for the Philippines, however, this spatial prioritization assessment represents a compilation of the best available data and {{can be used as a}} stepping stone and resource until more robust analyses can be completed...|$|E

Die Forscher konnten aus den Übereinstimmungen zwischen bäuerlichen und wissenschaftlichen Kriterien schnellere Verfahren für die Erstellung regionaler Boden¬karten ableiten. Insofern schuf die Kombination der beiden Wissenssysteme klare Syn¬ergien für beide Partner. Der zweite Artikel (Kap. 5) zeigt, dass traditionelle agro-sylvo-pastorale Systeme ein zentrales Element nachhaltiger Waldwirtschaft sein können, und die Bergbauern in den SO-asiatischen Regenwaldgebieten ein Interesse an nach¬haltiger Bewirtschaftung haben. Die Regierungen haben bisher das lokale Wissen ignoriert. Ein Ländervergleich zeigt, dass gleiche Strategien der Bauern in Nord-Thailand und dem benachbarten Laos mit unterschiedlichen Politiken begegnet wird (förderlich und behindernd). Die Integration des lokalen Wissens über die nachhaltige Nutzung von Agrarpotenzialen im Hochland in Wissenschaft und Politik kann großen Fortschritt bringen. Der dritte Artikel (Kap. 6) zeigt klar, dass das Sammeln oder Anbauen von Kardamom ein wirksam das Einkommen von Armen und Kleinbauern im Hochland verbessert. Kardamom wird aus Laos v. a. nach China exportiert. Die Wertschöpfungskette wurde erfasst und die sozio-ökonomischen Potenziale für Sammler und Anbauer bestimmt. Das Geschäft ist lohnend. Allerdings sind Sammler in manchen Jahren von Übernutzung bedroht, und Händler bezahlen sie gerne schlechter als bessergestellte Bauern. Die Trocknung weist noch wesentliche Potentiale auf, durch einfache und schonendere Verfahren bessere Qualität zu erzielen. Die Politik kann durch Programme zur Erhaltung von Waldgebieten in Dorfnähe dazu beitragen, den Ärmsten der Armen in Nord-Laos, diese Einkommensquelle zu erhalten. Die besondere Herausforderung für das Ressoucen-Management besteht in der Verbindung von nachhaltiger und lohnender Agrarproduktion mit Ökosystem-Diensten und dem Erhalt der natürlichen Ressourcen. Lokales Wissen kann dabei helfen, von der Wissenschaft und Poli¬tik seither übersehene ökologische Zusammenhänge zu erkennen und zu berück¬sichtigen. Es kann künftige Forschung befruchten, als Vergleichsquelle für wissen¬schaftliche Ergebnisse dienen und so ganz wesentlich zu einem nachhaltigen Manage¬ment natürlicher Ressourcen beitragen und die Ressourcen und Lebensverhältnisse auf dem Land verbessern helfen. Conceptually, {{local knowledge}} is recognized and investigated {{by a wide}} array of disciplines, and the focus has shifted from definition of indigenous or traditional knowledge to a perception of local knowledge as a dynamic concept and a principal basis for decision-making processes. This enables the creation of a research environment that is conducive to participatory approaches seeking to bridge the division between local and scientific knowledge. This thesis explains how local knowledge systems are composed by different know-ledge types, such as practices and beliefs, values, and worldviews. The knowledge systems change constantly under the influence of power relations and cross-scale linkages both within and outside the community. Likewise, local knowledge and practices need to be understood as adaptive responses to internal and external changes which result e. g. in disaster preparedness or sustainable growth of livelihoods at the local level. This thesis is based on interviews and using PRA tools about local knowledge and practices and attempts to give an overview and framework of local knowledge in sustainable land use and an understanding of the benefits and problems involved. Local knowledge systems (LKS) {{are an important part of}} the lives of the poor. They are the basis for decision-making of communities in food security, human and animal health, education, and natural resource management. LKS point to how indigenous people manipulate their knowledge, which has accumulated, evolved and practiced for generations. They epitomize the relationship and interaction between local peoples and their natural surroundings. In the study shown in paper I (Chapter 4), results based on group discussions shows farmers use 6 out of 8 scientific soil classifications. Through participatory soil mapping exercises, it was sought to develop a single, comprehensive soil classification reflecting the main soil types in the village territory. This process helped to explore the potential for using local soil classification towards regional soil mapping. It was concluded that the comparison of scientific soil classification and soil survey maps with local knowledge of soils can generate valuable synergies through integrating the perceptions of soil properties of scientists and farmers. Moreover, villagers in this research area will be able to have alternative or complementary options to grow plants and to generate improved revenues in the future. In paper II (Chapter 5), it was found that traditional silvopastoral systems are a key component of sustainable forest management. Forestry and forst use is a part of the established activities of upland farmers, who show interest in sustainable management and utilization of their natural resources. Local farmers knowledge has been so far excluded from governmental development policies. A country comparative analysis shows similar strategies of farmers but different (promoting / prohibiting) national policies. Local ecological knowledge about sylvo-pastoral systems can provide useful resources for striving towards more sustainable highland agro-ecosystems, if it is integrated into scientific analysis and policy making. Paper III (Chapter 6) found that cardamom plantations/collections are considered as an effective approach to poverty alleviation and sustainable rural development under conditions of increased resource scarcity in the uplands of Northern Laos. The analysis of the value chain revealed various potentials for development. The main policy implication is that protecting the remaining of natural and secondary forests, for instance through making use of evolving international support mechanisms for community based forest protection including <b>REDD-plus,</b> will not only be of advantage for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, but would also improve the livelihoods of the poorest in the uplands of Northern Laos. The challenge for national resource managers is to combine the management of agricultural functions with ecological benefits through sustainable agriculture practices to enhance the livelihoods of local people. Local ecological knowledge can offer proven alternatives and complementary explanations of ecological cause-and-effect relationships. It may prove useful in further scientific investigation and can be utilized as a cross-reference with other findings and therefore contribute to sustainable resource management and improve the quality of local resources and livelihoods...|$|E
