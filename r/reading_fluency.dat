Since they were not struggling with the text they were able to develop vocabulary, reading comprehension skills and oral language skills.

500|$|Research has {{suggested}} that cognitive flexibility is related to other cognitive abilities, such as fluid intelligence, <b>reading</b> <b>fluency,</b> and reading comprehension. Fluid intelligence, described {{as the ability to}} solve problems in new situations, enables fluid reasoning ability. [...] When one is able to reason fluidly, they are in turn more likely to be cognitively flexible. Furthermore, those who are able to be cognitively flexible have been shown {{to have the ability to}} switch between and/or simultaneously think about sounds and meanings, which increases their <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> and comprehension. Cognitive flexibility has also been shown to be related to one’s ability to cope in particular situations. For example, when individuals are better able to shift their thinking from situation to situation they will focus less on stressors within these situations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ten sixth-grade middle-school {{teachers}} and their 60 targeted students (14 students with reading disabilities, 17 low-achieving students, and 29 average-achieving students) participated in a four-month professional development and inter-vention program to enhance reading outcomes. The multicompo-nent reading intervention included three reading strategies: word identification, fluency, and content area comprehension. All three groups improved in accuracy of oral <b>reading</b> and <b>fluency.</b> Although many students made significant gains in word identifi-cation, fluency, and comprehension, a subgroup of very poor readers made little or no gains.

Multivariate analyses of covariance and variance component analyses showed that reading problems are characterised by difficulties with phonological processing and with rapid automatic naming. Problems with executive functioning and with digit span were typical for students with arithmetical fluency difficulties. RAD students had problems with phonological processing, rapid naming, executive functioning, and digit span.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 18 - 19). One of {{the elements}} of effective literacy instruction is to provide the opportunity for every child to talk with peers about reading (Allington & Gabriel 2012). Book clubs and literature circles have become very popular for students as well as adults. The sharing of literature offers social opportunities that many readers enjoy. 	Third grade readers are typically transitioning in their reading from early reading, which involves implementing decoding skills, to <b>reading</b> with <b>fluency</b> and a confidence in understanding how text works. They are reading with automaticity and at a good pace, while developing strategies to figure out most words. The increase in the ability to <b>read</b> with <b>fluency</b> allows transitional readers to move toward comprehending increasingly more difficult text. As a third grade teacher I questioned how an increase in {{the amount of time spent}} sharing about what students are reading would affect reading comprehension in third grade readers. This study explores the effect of a structured time for transitioning third grade readers to share about what they have read on the growth in their reading comprehension skills. 	The targeted students in this study are those in my third grade classroom who are performing at the benchmark reading level, as defined by the Lead 21 curriculum. At the conclusion of the eight-week period, which incorporated daily reading and having book talks as part of the language arts block, the results showed that the targeted benchmark readers had a combined growth in reading scores of 11. 3 %. At the conclusion of the study I believe that the time third grade benchmark reading students spent sharing about what they are reading was valid use of instructional time that helped improve reading comprehension...|$|R

40|$|Background: Poor comprehenders have {{difficulty}} comprehending connected text, despite having age-appropriate levels of <b>reading</b> accuracy and <b>fluency.</b> We used a longitudinal design to examine earlier reading and language skills in children identified as poor comprehenders in mid-childhood. Method: Two hundred and forty-two children began the study at age 5. Further assessments {{of language and}} reading skill were made at 5. 5, 6, 7 and 8 years. At age 8, fifteen children met criteria for being a poor comprehender and were compared to 15 control children both concurrently and prospectively. Results: Poor comprehenders showed normal <b>reading</b> accuracy and <b>fluency</b> at all ages. Reading comprehension was poor {{at each time point}} and, notably, showed minimal increases in raw score between 6 and 8 years. Phonological skills were generally normal throughout, but mild impairments in expressive and receptive language, listening comprehension and grammatical understanding were seen at all ages. Conclusions: Children identified as poor comprehenders at 8 years showed the same reading profile throughout earlier development. Their difficulties with the non-phonological aspects of oral language were present at school entry and persisted through childhood, showing that the oral language weaknesses seen in poor comprehenders in mid-childhood are not a simple consequence of their reading comprehension impairment. © 2010 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health...|$|R
