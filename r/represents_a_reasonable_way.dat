40|$|This work {{seeks to}} develop a Kantian ethical theory {{in terms of a}} general {{ontology}} of values and norms together with a metaphysics of the person that makes sense of this ontology. It takes as its starting point Kant’s assertion that a good will {{is the only thing that}} has an unconditioned value and his accompanying view that the highest good consists in virtue and happiness in proportion to virtue. The soundness of Kant’s position on the value of the good will is defended against criticisms directed against it by G. E. Moore and it is argued that there is an ambiguity in Moore’s notion of ‘intrinsic value’ that makes him unable to fully understand and appreciate the Kantian view. It is also argued that the special value of moral goodness has been unduly neglected in modern moral philosophy, even by those working in the Kantian tradition, and it is suggested that the possibility of a Kantian ethical theory centred on the notion of the highest good remains to be explored. In order to lay the ground for such a theory a Kantian approach to reasons for action and the metaphysics of the person is developed and defended, albeit in a way that, in contrast to Kant himself, emphasizes the social dimension inherent in being a person and acting on reasons. It is also argued that there exists what Henry Sidgwick has called a dualism of practical reason, which means that there are two systematic modes, the self-interested and the moral, of approaching action. These two modes correspond to the two components of the highest good as understood by Kant and it is argued that the highest good <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>way</b> of unifying them. These two parts of the highest good are then considered, each in turn, and Kantian models for understanding them are elaborated and defended against main rivals. On the matter of happiness, it is argued that standard philosophical theories fail to properly account for the way in which a subject’s own opinions about what constitutes her happiness are important in determining where her happiness actually lies. On the matter of morality, Kantianism is contrasted with consequentialism, the other leading theory that understands morality in terms of an ideal of impartiality and it is argued that the Kantian ideal, which can be called ‘impartiality as universalizability’ is superior to the consequentialist one, which can be called ‘impartiality as impersonality’. A version of Kantian ethics that places its emphasis on the Formula of Universal Law is then elaborated and it is argued that it is reasonable to understand maxims, or at least those maxims eligible for the universalizability test, as having to do with the basic general principles according to which we live. This kind of interpretation creates a large room for the exercise of judgment on the part of the agent and it is suggested that the standards according to which such judgment is exercised are largely determined through our actual moral practices and discourses...|$|E
40|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Division 12 Task Force's report on empirically supported treatments raises 3 questions: (a) Is it desirable for the profession to specify what treatments are effective? (b) Do the criteria, either selected by the Task Force or modified by others, <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>way</b> of identifying effective treatments? (c) Would different and less controversial conclusions have been reached if the criteria used were broadened to include naturalistic and quasi-experimental studies? It is concluded that the Task Force's selection of criteria, particularly as modified by D. L. Chambless and S. D. Hollon (1998), was <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> response to these pressures. Findings from studies using less stringent and controlled research designs suggest that the proposals may have resulted in less palatable conclusions than those offered in its original report.

40|$|Abstract A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for computing elastic-rebound-based prob-abilities in an unsegmented fault or fault system, which involves computing along-fault averages of renewal-model parameters. The approach is less biased and more self-consistent than a logical extension of that applied most recently for multisegment ruptures in California. It also enables {{the application of}} magnitude-dependent aperi-odicity values, which the previous approach does not. Monte Carlo simulations are used to analyze long-term system behavior, which is generally found {{to be consistent with}} that of physics-based earthquake simulators. Results cast doubt that recurrence-interval distributions at points on faults look anything like traditionally applied re-newal models, a fact that should be considered when interpreting paleoseismic data. We avoid such assumptions by changing the “probability of what ” question (from offset at a point to the occurrence of a rupture, assuming it is the next event to occur). The new methodology is simple, although not perfect in terms of recovering long-term rates in Monte Carlo simulations. It <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable,</b> improved <b>way</b> to re-present first-order elastic-rebound predictability, assuming it is there in the first place, and for a system that clearly exhibits other unmodeled complexities, such as after-shock triggering...|$|R
