5000|$|Limit {{dextrinase}} ( [...] , <b>R-enzyme,</b> amylopectin-1,6-glucosidase, dextrin alpha-1,6-glucanohydrolase) is {{an enzyme}} with systematic name dextrin 6-alpha-glucanohydrolase. This enzyme catalyses the Hydrolysis of (1->6)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in alpha- and beta-limits dextrins of amylopectin and glycogen,in amylopectin and pullulan.|$|E
5000|$|Pullulanase ( [...] , limit dextrinase, {{amylopectin}} 6-glucanohydrolase, bacterial debranching enzyme, debranching enzyme, alpha-dextrin endo-1,6-alpha-glucosidase, <b>R-enzyme,</b> pullulan alpha-1,6-glucanohydrolase) is {{a specific}} kind of glucanase, an amylolytic exoenzyme, that degrades pullulan. It is produced as an extracellular, cell surface-anchored lipoprotein by Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Klebsiella. Type I pullulanases specifically attack α-1,6 linkages, while type II pullulanases are also able to hydrolyse α-1,4 linkages. It is also produced by some other bacteria and archaea. Pullulanase {{is used as a}} processing aid in grain processing biotechnology (production of ethanol and sweeteners).|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} starch, soluble sugars, protein, and enzymes {{involved}} in starch metabolism—α-amylase, β-amylase, phosphorylase, Q-enzyme, <b>R-enzyme,</b> and starch synthetase —were assayed in dehulled developing rice grains (Oryzasativa L., variety IR 8). Phosphorylase, Q-enzyme, and <b>R-enzyme</b> had peak activities 10 days after flowering, whereas α- and β-amylases had maximal activities 14 days after flowering. Starch synthetase {{bound to the}} starch granule increased in activity up to 21 days after flowering. These enzymes (except the starch synthetases) were also detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their activity in grains at the midmilky stage (8 - 10 days after flowering) was determined in five pairs of lines with low and high amylose content from different crosses. The samples had similar levels of amylases, phosphorylase, <b>R-enzyme,</b> and Q-enzyme. The samples consistently differed in their levels of starch synthetase bound to the starch granule, which was proportional to amylose content. Granule-bound starch synthetase {{may be responsible for}} the integrity of amylose in the developing starch granule...|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} starch and dextrin, free sugars, soluble protein, and enzymes {{involved}} in starch metabolism—α-amylase, β-amylase, phosphorylase, Q-enzyme, <b>R-enzyme,</b> and ADP-glucose starch synthetases—were assayed in the leaf sheaths and culm of the rice plant (Oryza sativa L., variety IR 8) during growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{subcellular}} localization of the starch biosynthetic and degradative enzymes of spinach leaves {{was carried}} out by measuring the distribution of the enzymes in a crude chloroplast pellet and soluble protein fraction, and by the separation on sucrose density gradients of intact organelles, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria of a protoplast lysate. ADP-Glucose pyrophosphorylase, starch synthase, and starch-branching enzymes are quantitatively associated with the chloroplasts. The starch degradative enzymes amylase, <b>R-enzyme</b> (debranching activity), phosphorylase, and D-enzyme (transglycosylase) are observed both in the chloroplast and soluble protein fractions, the bulk of the degradative enzyme activities reside in the latter fraction. Chromatography of a chloroplast extract on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose resolves the R- and D-enzymes from amylase and phosphorylase activities although the two latter enzyme activities coeluted. The digestion pattern of amylase with amylopectin as a substrate indicates an endolytic activity but displays properties unlike the typical α-amylase as isolated from endosperm tissue...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of two amylase activities which {{differ in their}} substrate specificity and subcellular location {{as well as a}} chloroplast-associated <b>R-enzyme</b> (debranching activity) are reported. An extrachloroplastic amylase is resolved by gel filtration chromatography into two activities of 80, 000 and 40, 000 daltons. Both extrachloroplastic activities hydrolyze amylopectin and shellfish glycogen and only slowly hydrolyze rabbit liver glycogen, β-limit amylopectin, and amylose. In contrast, the major chloroplastic amylase attacks all of these glucans at comparable rates. Glucan hydrolysis by both the extrachloroplastic and chloroplastic amylase generates not only maltose but appreciable amounts of other oligosaccharides, whereas maltotetraose hydrolysis produces glucose, maltose, and maltotriose. The action patterns displayed by the amylase activities indicate that both are endoamylases, although they lack the typical Ca 2 + requirement or heat stability of seed endosperm α-amylases. Dithiothreitol, glutathione (oxidized or reduced), ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, and dithiothreitol plus thioredoxin have no effect on either the chloroplastic or extrachloroplastic amylase activities...|$|E
40|$|Purified {{pullulanase}} (starch-debranching enzyme, <b>R-enzyme,</b> EC 3. 2. 1. 41) from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts {{separated into}} {{at least seven}} individual enzymically active proteins (isomers, numbered 1 - 7) on isoelectric focusing or column chromatofocusing. At their isoelectric points (between pH 4. 7 and 5. 2) these forms were rather stable. At slightly alkaline pH, each converted into the whole set of isomers. PAGE of the purified enzyme under denaturing or non-denaturing conditions resulted in one protein band. When substrate (amylopectin or pullulan) {{was included in the}} gel, the native enzyme as well as any of the individual isomers separated into two (sometimes three) bands ('substrate-induced forms', numbered I-III) with different specific activities, dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes and activation energies. Each substrate-induced form produced the whole set of seven isomers on isoelectric focusing. The specific activity of the total enzyme reflected the relative proportions of the substrate-induced forms. To some extent the relative proportions, as determined by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, could be shifted in favour of the more or the less active forms by reduction with dithiothreitol, and gentle oxidation respectively. Activation by dithiothreitol did not alter the mode of action of the enzyme but only increased the velocity of substrate degradation and extended its activity into the pH range of the chloroplast. As a consequence of isomer interconversion, microheterogeneity could serve to regulate pullulanase activity in a biochemical manner that shares some features with allosteric regulation...|$|E
40|$|Homologous panose coupled {{branched}} oligosaccharides {{have been}} prepared {{by the action of}} macerans amylase on alpha-dextrin and panose. The isomeric fractions B 5, B 6, and B 7 were separated by the multiple ascent technique of paper chromatography;Isomaltose has been separated from the products of acid hydrolyzed dextran by carbon chromatography. Isomaltose coupled products were prepared by the use of the macerans amylase coupling reaction. The oligosaccharide fractions were separated by multiple ascent paper chromatography into B 4, B 5, and B 6 groups;The action of beta-amylase on the panose coupled oligosaccharides has been studied. Fractions of the B 5 and B 6 groups were resistant to the action of beta-amylase. By the use of <b>R-enzyme,</b> it was concluded that the resistant B 5 was 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) - 0 -, and the resistant B 6 was 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 -. There might have been a small amount of a resistant B 7 with the probable structure 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 -. A measure of the rate of beta-amylase action on the various fractions has been made. The rate of enzyme action decreased considerably as the branch point (alpha- 1, 6 linkage) was approached;The action of beta-amylase on the isomaltose coupled oligosaccharides has been studied. Fractions of the B 4, B 5, and B 6 groups were resistant to the action of the enzyme. The resistant B 4 consisted mainly of 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) -, but could conceivably have contained 0 - 0 - 0 -(0) -. The resistant B 5 contained both 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - and 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) -. The resistant B 6 consisted of 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) -. One chain had an effect on the other as far as the action of the enzyme was concerned. The presence of a single glucose unit on the opposite chain was enough to make a resistant bond out of one which was formerly non-resistant. The rate of beta-amylase action on these fractions was also studied. Again the rate diminished as the branch point was approached;B 7 from the salivary amylase hydrolysis of amylopectin was separated by paper chromatography. This preparation consisted of a single oligosaccharide of known structure, 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 - 0 -. Salivary amylase was capable of slowly hydrolyzing this B 7 to a B 5 and maltose, but the B 7 was apparently completely resistant to the action of beta-amylase;The rate of beta-amylase on sweet corn glycogen and maltoheptaose was studied. Two distinct phases of hydrolysis were evident for both of these substrates. The slow phase of each was comparable in rate to that of beta-amylase on B 5 from panose and B 4 from isomaltose. Evidence was presented which indicated the impracticality of attaining an absolute limit dextrin from a high molecular weight natural molecule such as glycogen or amylopectin...|$|E
