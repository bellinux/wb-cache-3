These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet <b>research</b> <b>that</b> documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of <b>research.</b> <b>That</b> Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of <b>research</b> <b>that</b> he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E

5|$|CTW {{conducted}} research in two ways: in-house formative <b>research</b> <b>that</b> informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations {{conducted by the}} Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons to measure the program's educational effectiveness. CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers' attention to the program. Based on these findings, the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly. The formative research on Sesame Street {{was the first time}} children's television viewing was studied scientifically.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, <b>research</b> <b>that</b> tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rise}} of {{classical}} genetics, many biologists—including {{a new wave of}} physical scientists in biology—pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundation—issued grants to promote <b>research</b> <b>that</b> applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Her {{best known}} work was a {{comprehensive}} study of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, and investigation of various chemotherapies for the disease. Later she studied drug resistance in this parasite, <b>research</b> <b>that</b> proved valuable to the British military in World War II. She discovered the potential for cross-resistance in these parasites during that same period. Bishop also discovered the protozoan Pseudotrichomonas keilini and worked with Aedes aegypti, a malaria vector, {{as part of her}} research on the disease. Elected to the Royal Society in 1959, Bishop was the founder of the British Society for Parasitology and served on the World Health Organization's Malaria Committee.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{attachment}} theory {{had significant}} policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, {{and those in}} poor quality daycare. Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development.
