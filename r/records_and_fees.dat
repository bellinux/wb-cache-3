The federal government controls programs it funds like: Title I funding for low income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The Superintendent and Business Manager are appointed by the school board. The Superintendent is the chief administrative officer with overall responsibility for all aspects of operations, including education and finance. The Business Manager is responsible for budget and financial operations. Neither of these officials are voting members of the School Board. The School Board enters into individual employment contracts for these positions. In Pennsylvania, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the Superintendent regarding renewal of the employment contract.

In an event of an emergency, psychologists are not allowed to withhold records of clients who have failed to make payments. Psychologists are expected to arrange <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> financial arrangements in compliance with the law and accept barter only in situations that doing so, does not negatively impact the treatment. Psychologists are also expected to maintain and provide accurate reports of treatment, funding, and diagnostic details. This standard also emphasizes that psychologists should receive payment based on the services provided rather than the referral.|$|R

50|$|The ethical {{principles}} of psychologists and {{code of conduct}} put forth by the APA consists of ten ethical standards. The ethical standards are enforceable rules applicable for psychologists in academia and practice. These are written broadly to guide psychologists in varied areas and roles, addressing situations most psychologists may encounter in their professional roles. The types of situations include those related to resolving ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising <b>and</b> public statements, <b>record</b> keeping <b>and</b> <b>fees,</b> education <b>and</b> training, research and publication, assessment, and therapy. The ethical standards are enforced {{for the benefit of}} the psychologists, clients, students, and other individuals that work with psychologists. Any psychologist that is a member of the APA is expected to adhere to the ethical standards. Any violation of an ethical standard may result in sanctions ranging from termination of APA membership to loss of licensure.|$|R

Other players purchased during the summer included Gaël Clichy and Stefan Savić, while Owen Hargreaves joined on a free transfer after having been released by Manchester United.

In direct contrast to the previous two seasons, Brentford started strongly, winning six and drawing three of the first 11 league matches of the season to rise to 3rd position in the Third Division on 10 October 1979. Continued good results and a boost from the loan signing of winger Keith Fear put the Bees in 2nd place behind leaders Sheffield United one month later, but after a 7-2 victory over Hull City on 8 December, the Bees' biggest win of the season, the team's form collapsed.|$|R

40|$|This report explores {{public opinion}} on a new and {{promising}} concept—green transportation taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees.</b> These are taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> set at variable rates, with higher rates for more polluting vehicles and lower rates for those that pollute less. This approach to transportation taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> adapts the traditional transportation finance system to achieve two critical public benefits at once: encouraging drivers to choose more environmentally-friendly transportation options and raising revenue for needed transportation programs. To test public support for green transportation taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees,</b> the authors conducted a random telephone survey of 1, 500 Californians that asked respondents their views on five hypothetical tax <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> options: a flat-rate and a green vehicle registration <b>fee,</b> a flat-rate <b>and</b> a green mileage <b>fee,</b> <b>and</b> a “feebate” program for new vehicle purchases under which more-polluting vehicles would be charged a tax and less-polluting vehicles would receive a rebate. The survey {{results show that the}} concept of green transportation taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> strongly appeals to Californians. The survey tested this in two ways: by testing support for the three hypothetical green transportation tax <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> policies, <b>and</b> also by comparing support levels for flat-rate versus green versions of two taxes. Majorities of the respondents supported all three green taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> tested. Another striking finding from the survey is that support for the green taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> did not vary greatly by population subgroups; a diverse range of Californians supported the green taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees.</b> An analysis comparing support for the green and flat-rate vehicle registration <b>fee</b> <b>and</b> feebate proposals confirmed that in every subgroup, more people within that subgroup supported the green than the flat version of the two taxes tested...|$|R

Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While {{increases in}} textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition <b>and</b> <b>fees,</b> the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> varies by the type of institution attended.

Part II {{examines the}} approaches used by international arbitral tribunals in resolving claims for costs <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> finds that they are inadequate. Part Ill proposes a new model for resolving these claims. The model provides that, in evaluating claims for costs <b>and</b> <b>fees,</b> arbitrators should first look to the parties 2 ̆ 7 agreement. If the parties have agreed on rules regarding the costs of the arbitration, either directly or by reference to arbitral rules, the arbitrators should resolve the claim in accord with the agreement. However, if the agreement fails to address the issue or is ambiguous on how to resolve these claims, then the model gives the tribunal the power to award costs <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> sets forth the rules to follow. With respect to the latter, the model states that costs <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> should be awarded on the general principle that they should be borne by the unsuccessful party. It also defines which costs <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> may be awarded. This model provides a simple and straight forward approach for tribunals to use in resolving claims for costs <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> thus can bring much needed uniformity to the area...|$|R
