5|$|When the U.S. Highway System {{was created}} in 1926, US 9 was {{designated}} in New Jersey to run from US 30 in Absecon north to the New York border in Alpine, where it continued into New York as US 9W. In New Jersey, the route followed the entirety of pre-1927 Route 4 between Absecon and Rahway, bending farther {{to the east of}} its current alignment between Lakewood and South Amboy by running closer to the Atlantic Ocean. In Rahway, US 9 joined US 1 and pre-1927 Route 1 for a concurrency north toward Newark. Past Newark, the road followed current US 1/9 Truck toward Jersey City, where US 1 and US 9 split. At this point, US 9 continued north on its current alignment in Fort Lee, where it then ran north on present-day CR 501 toward the New York border. US 9 was designated along this alignment to the New York border as the original numbering plans called for it to continue up {{the west bank of the}} Hudson River to Albany, New York, with US 109 <b>running</b> <b>along</b> the east bank of the river. However, it was instead split into two suffixed routes in New York, with US 9W <b>running</b> <b>along</b> the west bank and US 9E <b>running</b> <b>along</b> the east bank, New Jersey had kept its alignment of US 9 to US 9W at the border in Alpine.|$|E

Along this one-way pair, the route carries one lane {{in each direction}} {{with the exception of}} Light Street, where the northbound direction has four lanes. Both directions of MD 2 join again along eight-lane divided Light Street and the route heads toward the Inner Harbor. Near Harborplace, the route splits into another one-way pair with northbound MD 2 <b>running</b> <b>along</b> three-lane Calvert Street and southbound MD 2 <b>running</b> <b>along</b> four-lane St. Paul Street.
