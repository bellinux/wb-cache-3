50|$|Problem- An ORVR carbon-filled {{canister}} (installed {{on modern}} vehicles) {{is designed to}} capture fuel vapors displaced while refueling, and then to inject them into the intake manifold later on, {{so that they are}} burned along with the regular fuel, during normal engine operation. However, a Stage II vapor recovery system, installed on refuling gas station pumps, uses a vacuum to prevent fuel vapors from being released into the atmosphere. The design of the fill pipe seal in ORVR systems, prevents fuel vapors from entering the fuel tank fill pipe. That frustrates the purpose of the Stage II nozzle, which was designed to vacuum away any fuel vapors that come up that fill pipe, during the refuelling process. If the car's own vapor recovery system is working properly, then the Stage II nozzle will only be vacuuming normal fresh air and depositing that into the gas station's underground fuel storage tanks. That ends up causing evaporation of fuel vapors into the atmosphere, because too much pressure builds up in those fuel storage tanks. When that pressure becomes too great, it is released into the atmosphere via a pressure <b>relief</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E

40|$|SIMPLE, SIMPLER, SIMPLEC and IDEAL are {{solution}} procedures {{originally developed}} for incompressible flows and staggered grids. For SIMPLE, SIMPLER and SIMPLEC, extensions for collocated grids and {{for treatment of}} flows at all speeds have already been proposed. For IDEAL, only an extension for collocated grids has been found, and an extension for treatment of flows at all speeds is proposed here. Extended versions of SIMPLE and SIMPLER are implemented in Brilliant, a multiphysics CFD-program developed by Petrell AS. These implemented algorithms are compared to the existing solution procedure in Brilliant, an extended version of the SIMPLEC algorithm. As expected, SIMPLE and SIMPLEC gave almost identical solutions for all the three presented test cases. The values given by the SIMPLER algorithm differed slightly from the values given by the two other algorithms. When simulating a shock tube, all three algorithms showed large deviations from the quasi-analytical solution in some regions of the shock tube. The SIMPLER algorithm spent the least CPU time for this simulation example, while SIMPLE and SIMPLEC spent less CPU time than SIMPLER when simulating methane flow in a pipe. Even though the CPU time was not registered for the last simulation example, a pressure <b>relief</b> <b>pipe,</b> it was noticed that the time consumption was much greater for the SIMPLER algorithm than for SIMPLE and SIMPLEC. </p...|$|E

Two different EV solutions have been analysed: a “dry” EV and a “wet” EV. In this last, a certain amount of water could be mixed (by spraying or discharging in a pool) with the discharged helium, to reduce its temperature and allowing a lower size of the EV with respect to the “dry” solution.

40|$|Explosion venting {{technology}} is widely accepted as the effective constructional protection measures against {{gas and dust}} explosions. The key problem in venting is the appropriate design of the vent area necessary for an effective release of the material i. e. the pressure developed during explosion did not cause any damage to the plant protected. Current gas explosion vent design standards in the USA (NFPA 68, 2002) and European (2007) rely on the vent correlation first published by Bartknecht in 1993 (Siwek, 1996). N FPA 68 also recommends the correlation of Swift (Swift, 1983) at low overpressures. For a vent to give no increase in overpressure other than that due to the pressure difference created by the mass flow of unburnt gases through the vent, the vent mass flow rate {{is assumed to be}} equal to the maximum mass burning rate of the flame and this consideration should be used as the design mass flow through the vent. Two different methods (Method I and Method 2) have been proposed based on the Sμ and Sμ (E- 1) to describe the maximum mass burning rate given as, mb = ASμpμ=CdeA(2 pPμred) o. 5 mb =ASgPm =AgSμ(E-I) P μ=Cde 4,(2 pu Pred) 0, 5 (2) The equation given in (2) is slightly different from (1) as is about 6. 5 times the mass flow of the first method as it takes the effect of (E- 1) where E is the expansion ratio. A critical review were carried out for the applicability, validity and limitation on the venting correlations adopted in NFPA 68 and European Standard with 470 literature experimental data, covering a wide range of values for vessel volume and geometries, bursting vent pressure, Pv L/D ratio, maximum reduced pressure, Pred and ignition location. The fuels involved are methane, propane, hydrogen, town gas, ethylene, acetone/air mixtures with the most hazardous near-stoichiornetric fuel-air concentration. Besides, Molkov's equation (Molkov, 2001) which is regarded as alternative venting design offered in NFPA 68 and Bradley and Mitcheson's equation for safe venting design were also analysed on the experimental data for their validity and limitation as well as the proposed methods. From the results, it is clear that Bartknecht's equation gave a satisfactory result with experimental data for K 200 mbar, providing the parameter PV is added into the equation. Method 2 gave a good agreement to most of the experimental data as it followed assumptions applied for correlations given by Bradley and Mitcheson for safe venting design (Bradley and Mitcheson, 1978 a,B radley and Mitcheson, 1978 b). It is also proven that the vent coefficient, K is confident to be used in quantifying the vessel's geometry for cubic vessel and the use of As/Av term is more favourable for non-cubic vessels. To justify the validity and applicability of the proposed methods, series of simply vented experiments were carried out, involving two different cylindrical volumes i. e. 0. 2 and 0. 0065 M 3. It is found that self acceleration plays important role in bigger vessel in determining the final Pmax inside the vessel. Method 2 gave closer prediction on Pmax in respect with other studied correlations. The investigation of vented gas explosion is explored further with the <b>relief</b> <b>pipe</b> been connected to the vessel at different fuel/air equivalence ratios, ignition position and Pv. The results demonstrate that the magnitude of Pmax was increased corresponding to the increase of Pv- From the experiments,it is found that peak pressure with strong acoustic behaviour is observed related to increase in Pv and in some cases,significant detonation spike was also observed particularly in high burning velocity mixtures. It is found that substantial amount of unburnt gases left inside the vessel after the vent burst is the leading factor in increase of Pmax for high burning velocity mixtures at centrally ignited. The associate gas velocities ahead of the flame create high unburnt gas flows conditions at entry to the vent and this give rise to high back pressures which lead to the severity in final Pmax inside the vessel. It was observed that end ignition leads to a higher explosion severity than central ignition in most cases, implying that central ignition is not a worst-case scenario in gas vented explosions as reported previously...|$|E

So in August 2008 the first test storage was accomplished under great public attention with a discharge of approx. 1.2  m 3 /s. Based on the assumed saturation of the surrounding rock during the storage phase and considering a residual risk of water losses through undiscovered gaps in the karst rock, a duration of at least 1 – 2  weeks was assumed to reach the design storage level of 15  m. However, within less than 2  days, this level was even exceeded.|$|R
40|$|Unsealed {{roads and}} tracks are {{acknowledged}} {{as the major}} sources of sediment pollution in forested catchments. In particular, road to stream connectivity via gullied pathways as well as via diffuse overland flow can contribute to significant fine sediment inputs to forest streams. At present in the State forests of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, road drainage spacings are determined {{on the basis of}} road slope. In this study forest road surveys were conducted across seven coastal catchments near Coffs Harbour on the sub-tropical NSW mid north coast to determine connectivity between gravel roads and streams via channelised and diffuse pathways under a range of rainfall intensities. A total of 10. 82 km of representative road sections was assessed, comprising 129 <b>relief</b> <b>pipes</b> and 22 mitre drains. Of the 151 drains surveyed, gullies were evident at the outlets of 26 <b>relief</b> <b>pipes</b> (20. 2 %) but at none of the mitre drains. Relationships previously derived between contributing road length and hillslope gradient, and between contributing area and hillslope gradient adequately predicted thresholds of gully formation at drain outlets. During lower intensity storms with average recurrence intervals of 10 years or less, less than 20 % of drains are connected to streams via overland flowpaths. However, the degree of diffuse connectivity increases when contributing area takes account of table drains and cut batters, as well as with increasing rainfall intensity. We conclude that when constructing new roads or reassessing drainage on existing roads in forest environments, in addition to preventing erosion of the road surface, gully formation and connectivity with streams via diffuse overland flow should be avoided. This requires factoring in contributing area, hillslope gradient at drain outlets and distance to the nearest stream. Preventing or reducing road-to-stream connectivity is essential for reducing impacts on water quality across all land tenures...|$|R

Many were connected through business and social links to Carnegie Steel. Development included lowering the dam to make its top wide {{enough to hold a}} road, and putting a fish screen in the spillway (the screen also trapped debris). These alterations are thought to have increased the vulnerability of the dam. Moreover, a system of <b>relief</b> <b>pipes</b> and valves, a feature of the original dam, previously sold off for scrap, was not replaced, so the club had no way of lowering the water level in the lake in case of an emergency.

40|$|Vent {{devices for}} {{gas and dust}} explosions are often ducted to safe {{locations}} by means of <b>relief</b> <b>pipes.</b> However, {{the presence of the}} duct increases the severity of explosion if compared to simply vented vessels (i. e. compared to cases where no duct is present). Besides, the identification of the key phenomena controlling the violence of explosion has not yet been gained. Multidimensional models coupling, mass, momentum and energy conservation equations can be valuable tools for the analysis of such complex explosion phenomena. In this work, gas explosions vented through ducts have been modelled by a two-dimensional (2 D) axi-symmetric computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model based on the unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach in which the laminar, flamelet and distributed combustion models have been implemented. Numerical test have been carried out by varying ignition position, duct diameter and length. Results have evidenced that the severity of ducted explosions is mainly driven by the vigorous secondary explosion occurring in the duct (burn-up) rather than by the duct flow resistance or acoustic enhancement. Moreover, it has been found out that the burn-up affects explosion severity due to the reduction of venting rate rather than to the burning rate enhancement through turbulization. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Vent {{devices for}} {{gas and dust}} explosions are often ducted to safety {{locations}} by means of <b>relief</b> <b>pipes</b> for the discharge of hot combustion products or blast waves (NFPA 68, 2002). The presence of the duct {{is likely to increase}} the severity of the explosion with respect to simply vented vessels posing a problem for the proper design of this venting configuration. The phenomenology of the vented explosion is complicated as the interaction of combustion in the duct with primary combustion in the protected vessel intrudes the problem. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the enhanced violence of the explosion in such a venting configuration but uncertainty still stands. The lack of both investigation and comprehension has so far prevented the development of reliable engineering guidelines for the sizing of the vent area. Prior to any development of engineering correlations, a preparatory step should be the investigation {{of the nature of the}} interaction of the external combustion with the venting process. In this work pilot scale experimental data are presented for an uncovered duct vented configuration. Moreover, a CFD 2 D axy-symmetric model based on the unsteady RANS approach is developed. The numerical model has been validated by comparison with available experimental results on a lab scale configuration and then tested on the pilot scale configuration. Numerical and experimental results have evidenced that the severity of ducted explosion is mainly driven by the vigorous secondary explosion occurring in the duct (burn-up). In particular the combustion in the duct has been found to interact with the internal combustion by means of purely mechanical effects. In dependence of the violence of the explosion in the duct, the mechanical effect acts as pre compression of the mixture in the vessel or venting flow rate reduction. No enhancement effects of the combustion in the vessel have been found to significantly affect the violence of the explosion. Experimental data analysis - aided by the numerical results- have highlighted that as the scale of the explosion goes up, the external explosion moves toward more severe conditions. A simple scaling law is proposed that accounts for many of the trends observed in literature but more data would be needed on scales of industrial interest to check its validity...|$|R

40|$|The {{replacement}} of on-off solenoids with solenoids which can adjust the spool {{position of a}} directional valve proportionally to their input voltage was {{the groundwork for the}} development of proportional valve technology. Due to their robustness and well-priced properties, proportional valves are a good alternative to conventional servo-solenoid valves. Indeed, servosolenoid valves are highly precise but that makes them highly expensive as well. Additionally, they place great demands on maintenance and industrial surroundings. Hence proportional valves are widely-used in automation engineering. A common application is the positioning of actuators. Thus, a closed-loop circuit is necessary. In doing so, the proportional valve’s input voltage is the manipulated value which enables a certain area for the oil to pass through the valve. Therefore, the flow rate to the actuator can be changed to control the actuator position with high precision. In this thesis the main components of a hydraulic positioning unit shall be modelled and simulated using the software Matlab/Simulink. That includes the actuator, the pressure <b>relief</b> valve, connecting <b>pipes</b> and of course the proportional directional control valve. With this model the positioning unit can be tested under different conditions to make predictions on how the system is going to react. Due {{to the fact that it}} was not possible to collect measured data from the several components, measured data from the datasheets have been used to verify the models. For the actuator was no datasheet available. Consequently, only a general model could be created. The dynamic behavior of the pressure relief valve could be obtained by using the dimensions given in the datasheet. However, the datasheet does not provide any curves related to dynamic behavior. Therefore, only the static behavior was verifiable. The simulation of the proportional directional control valve was divided into a static and a dynamic part. Based on flow, pressure and leakage curves given by the manufacturer, pseudo-section functions have been created. These functions characterize the relationship between normalized spool position and flow rate. For simulating the dynamic behavior, a nonlinear Simulink model was created. The model was fitted to nonlinear frequency response data points by using a Nelder-Mead simplex optimization algorithm. Methodologies and models were subsequently tested with used data from the manufacturer. The good quality of the results seems to support the approach. Nevertheless, the Simulink model has to be adjusted more properly to the measurement curves. All important components of a hydraulic positioning unit have been modelled. It is recommended to make further improvements to adjust the Simulink model more properly to the given curves in the datasheet. Subsequently, all components can be connected together to implement the closed-loop circuit...|$|R
