5000|$|Although {{the most}} common types of {{self-healing}} materials are polymers or elastomers, self-healing covers all classes of materials, including metals, ceramics, and cementitious materials. Healing mechanisms vary from an instrinsic repair of the material to {{the addition of a}} <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> contained in a microscopic vessel. For a material to be strictly defined as autonomously self-healing, it is necessary that the healing process occurs without human intervention.

40|$|A novel <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> for resin-injection {{repair of}} {{advanced}} high temperature composites {{was developed and}} characterized. The <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> was based on bisphenol E cyanate ester (BECy) and reinforced with alumina nanoparticles. To ensure good dispersion and compatibility with the BECy matrix in nanocomposites, the alumina nanoparticles were functionalized with silanes. The BECy nanocomposites, containing bare and functionalized alumina nanoparticles, were prepared and evaluated for their thermal, mechanical, rheological, and viscoelastic properties. The monomer of BECy has an extremely low viscosity at ambient temperature, which is good for processability. The cured BECy polymer is a highly cross-linked network with excellent thermal mechanical properties, with a high glass transition temperature (T{sub g}) of 270 C and decomposition temperature above 350 C. The incorporation of alumina nanoparticles enhances the mechanical and rheological properties of the BECy nanocomposites. Additionally, the alumina nanoparticles are shown to catalyze the cure of BECy. Characterization of the nanocomposites included dynamic mechanical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, rheological and rheokinetic evaluation, and transmission electron microscopy. The experimental {{results show that the}} BECy nanocomposite is a good candidate as <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> for resin-injection repair applications...|$|E

40|$|Self-repair of {{concrete}} cracks {{is a topic}} which has now been studied for several years in laboratories all over the world. Different mechanisms have been developed {{in order to obtain}} autonomous crack repair; dormant bacteria are activated and precipitate calcite inside the crack, flexible polymer tendons reduce the crack width, superabsorbent polymers swell upon water ingress and block the crack etc. While the afore-mentioned mechanisms are all different, their ultimate goal is the same. They all aim at increasing the durability of cracked concrete structures by making their cracks impermeable for aggressive agents. In this study, it was investigated whether concrete could be made more durable through the implementation of a self-repairing function. Self-repairing properties were obtained by the use of an encapsulated polymer-based <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> which was embedded in the matrix.

Hence, for Woody Pitch, four composition（asphaltene, resin, aromatic series and saturated fat）analyses, the degradation level by light irradiation, the analysis of the low boiling point material by the GC/MS and the toxicity test by the variability were performed. The Woody Pitch includes a lot of asphaltene in comparison with straight asphalt and includes saturated fat and aromatic series in small quantities. When the straight asphalt deteriorates, saturated fat and aromatic series decrease and asphaltene increase. Therefore the Woody Pitch resembles an ingredient when normal straight asphalt deteriorated, it is thought that the ability as the <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> is low.

The mechanical properties of the carbon fiber-epoxy composite stitched with mendable polymer fiber for self-healing and unmodified laminates were compared experimentally.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks in {{volatile}} environments {{may suffer}} damage which partitions the network, and connectivity must be restored. We investigate the online problem, {{in which the}} <b>repairing</b> <b>agent</b> must discover surviving nodes and {{the damage to the}} physical and radio environment as it moves around the sensor field to execute the repair. The objectives include minimising the cost of the repair in terms of new radios and distance travelled, and minimising the time to complete the repair. We consider a number of different agent features which we can combine in different configurations. The <b>repairing</b> <b>agent</b> may prioritise either the node cost or the travel distance. The focus of the agent may be local, with a greedy choice of next partition to re-connect, or global, maintaining a plan for all partitions. To handle the developing knowledge of the network conditions, the agent may revert to full replanning when a change is discovered, or try a minimal adjustment of the current plan in order to minimise the computation effort. For each configuration, we develop a number of heuristics for creating the plans. We evaluate the approach in simulation, varying the density of the connectivity graph and the level of damage suffered. We demonstrate that the plan repair method, while producing more expensive solutions, can require significantly less computation time, depending on the choice of heuristic. Finally, we evaluate the total time to repair the network for different speeds of agent, and we show the relative importance of the agent speeds on the two focuses. In particular, algorithms which prioritise mobility cost are preferred for slow agents, while faster moving agents should prioritise the radio node cost...|$|R

40|$|Injection of <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> (grout) into {{boreholes}} is {{a repair}} technique commonly applied to deteriorated concrete structures, ensuring that interconnected cracks and voids are eliminated. The repair effect is evaluated from {{the increase in}} the pulse velocity between before and after grouting. Measured velocities after grouting, however, unexpectedly led to a remarkable decrease {{in the case of a}} 70 -year old dam. This resulted in a doubt about the efficiency of repair. Through investigation, it was concluded that the velocity decrease was attributed to the initial low stiffness of the cement grouting agent due to insufficient hydration in cold environments where the structure is located. Theoretical investigation based on multiple scattering theory is performed, as the filling material acts as a scatterer in the concrete matrix. It is found that the pulse velocity of the structure is lower than that of the initial damaged condition before the <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> becomes hardened up to an adequate level of stiffness. Accordingly, the amount of the agent injected into the structure was strongly correlated with the velocity decrease after grouting. As a result, the velocity decrease was observed in the repaired dam. Further validation was conducted after a period of 2 years in the same structure with exactly the same sensor arrangement as before. It is clarified that, the velocity distribution measured is in remarkable agreement with that predicted in the theory just after grouting...|$|E

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Triad visible light-polymerized (VLP) reline resin has the {{potential}} to repair denture bases from other resin systems with the elimination of flasking/deflasking procedures. PURPOSE: This study measured the tensile and shear bond strengths of Triad VLP, PMMA, and glass-fiber-reinforced PMMA (GF-PMMA) acrylic resins before and after repair with Triad VLP reline material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six specimens were fabricated from Triad VLP, PMMA, and GF-PMMA denture base resins. Both Triad VLP reline material and autopolymerizing acrylic resins were used to repair identical laboratory fabricated resin joints. Twenty-eight rectangular specimens (in 4 different groups of 7 each) were prepared to study the shear bond strength of Triad reline material used to repair different denture base resin joints. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P<. 0001) were found between the tensile strengths of specimens repaired with the Triad VLP reline resin used as a <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> and those repaired with the autopolymerizing resin. The tensile strength of the Triad VLP denture base resin was found to be higher than that of both the PMMA and GF-PMMA acrylic resins. CONCLUSION: The low tensile and shear bond strengths found after the repair of PMMA and GF-PMMA acrylic resins with Triad VLP reline material were attributed to a lack of cohesion/adhesion between the Triad VLP reline material and the interfaces of the treated sites. The use of Triad VLP reline material to repair Triad VLP denture base resin produced the highest strengths. King Saud Universit...|$|E

Methods Twenty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: the PDRN treatment group (n= 11) and the control group (n= 11). Caudally pedicled random pattern skin flaps were elevated on their dorsal skin and resutured. The treatment group received daily intraperitoneal administration of PDRN (8 mg/kg/day), and the control group received fluid vehicle (NaCl 0. 9 %, 8 mg/kg/day) from day 0 to day 6. On day 7, the flap survival was evaluated and the harvested tissue surrounding the demarcation line of the necrotic area was stained with H&E, anti-rat vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) antibody, and PECAM- 1 /CD 31 antibody. Results The average necrotic area of the flap in the PDRN group was significantly smaller when compared with that of the control group. Histologic and immunohistochemical evaluationshowed that granulation thickness score and VEGF-positive staining cells were marked higher in the PDRN group than in the control group. PECAM- 1 /CD 31 -positive microvascular densities were significantly higher in the PDRN group when compared with the control group.

40|$|Microcapsules with {{different}} active core materials have been receiving {{a great deal}} of attention for developing polymer based materials with selfhealing abilities. The self-healing ability is crucial in particular for matrix materials having brittle nature such as epoxy resin. In order for abstaining from an abrupt failure of structural brittle manner polymeric materials, microcapsules can be used excellently as a viable <b>repair</b> <b>agent.</b> In this work, we present a study on the catalyst-free microcapsule based self-healing system. Microcapsules were produced by the insitu polymerization of urea-formaldehyde at the dispersed phase-water interface. Each microcapsule batches were characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA), Di erential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Characteristic peaks of urea-formaldehyde shell, core components; DGEBA, and PhCl was seen in the Mid- IR region. Characteristic thermal decomposition temperature of urea-formaldehyde wall material and DBEBA which is the main microcapsule content were determined from the TGA trace. In addition to the given thermal and spectral characterization tools, optic microscope and SEM images also ensure the formation of liquid- lled microcapsules. Although the microcapsules showed brittle behavior during the processing such as drying and sieving, incorporation of microcapsules into the epoxy matrix was achieved successfully. The healing characteristic of epoxy-microcapsule composite was assessed by the Tapered Double Cantilever Beam (TDCB) specimen at the mode-I crack opening fashion. Besides microcapsule-epoxy composite system showed a moderate healing efficiency, a significant increase in mode-I fracture toughness value was observed.

It is predicted that the barrier for photoexcited A should be lower than for photoexcited O, and the barrier for photoexcited A − should be lower than for photoexcited O−. Moreover, A, O−, and A − are predicted to have ππ * excited states at energies near where O does, which allows them to be excited by photons low enough in energy to avoid exciting or ionizing any of DNA’s bases. The origin {{of the differences in}} barriers is suggested to be the lower ionization potential of A compared to O and the lower electron detachment energy of A − compared to O−.

40|$|In vivo, {{proteins}} are {{the main}} targets for radicals and other reactive species. Their reactions result in formation of amino acid radicals on the protein surface that often yield tryptophan and tyrosyl radicals or, {{in the presence of}} O₂, protein peroxyl radicals and hydroperoxides. All these species may propagate damage to biomolecules. Low molecular weight antioxidants, such as ascorbate, urate, and glutathione, are part of the defense system and function by repairing damaged proteins. We briefly review the existing knowledge about protein and amino acid radicals and their repair by antioxidants, including results of our investigations. The main question addressed is whether the antioxidants ascorbate, urate, and glutathione are able to repair amino acid radicals in model compounds and in proteins in vitro by pulse radiolysis. We show that ascorbate and urate repair tryptophan and tyrosyl radicals efficiently and inhibit proton-coupled electron transfer from tyrosine residues to tryptophan radicals in a number of proteins. In contrast, repair by glutathione is much slower. Ascorbate also rapidly reduces the peroxyl radicals of the N-acetylamide derivatives of glycine, alanine, and proline, whereas glutathione reduces peroxyl radicals in lysozyme. In vivo urate, ascorbate, and glutathione may prevent biological damage or, at least, reduce its rate, because they: (a) repair tryptophan and tyrosyl radicals in proteins and (b) reduce protein peroxyl radicals to the corresponding protein hydroperoxides. Most likely, in vivo, ascorbate and glutathione do not inhibit the reaction of C-centered amino acid radicals with O₂. Glutathione is less efficient that urate and ascorbate in repairing protein radicals; furthermore, the resulting glutathiyl radical is harmful. Ascorbate may be the more important <b>repair</b> <b>agent</b> in cells and tissues characterized by high ascorbate concentrations, such as the lens and brain; urate may be mainly responsible for repair in tissue compartments with higher urate concentrations, such as in plasma and saliva. 11 page(s...|$|E

Results: Overall, approximately half of the subjects achieved success with investigator global assessment (clear or almost clear investigator global assessment scores) after three weeks of treatment with the ceramide-dominant, physiologic lipid barrier repair emulsion as monotherapy or in combination with another treatment. A large proportion of subjects (75 % of subjects) and investigators (for 77 % of subjects) reported satisfaction after three weeks of treatment. Pruritus and quality of life improved during the study. Conclusion: The ceramide-dominant, physiologic lipid-based product was shown to be an effective agent, with or without additional topical therapy, to provide good clinical efficacy and high levels of investigator and patient satisfaction for many patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. The results of this study are consistent with results noted in a previous study of atopic dermatitis patients using this same barrier <b>repair</b> <b>agent.</b> The treatment approach of using a skin barrier repair cream as an integral and standard component of initial atopic dermatitis therapy, either as monotherapy or as a part of combination topical therapy, is supported by the outcomes observed in this study. This specific ceramide-dominant, physiologic lipid-based product may be used when initiating topical therapy for atopic dermatitis based on results from this and other studies...|$|E
40|$|Adenoviral vectors (AdVs) {{constitute}} powerful {{gene delivery}} vehicles. However, so far, {{their potential for}} genome editing has not been extensively investigated. By tailoring AdVs as carriers of designer nucleases and donor DNA sequences, the research presented in this thesis expands {{the utility of the}} AdV platform to genome editing. In particular, {{in the first part of}} this thesis, AdVs are exploited for tackling two of the major bottlenecks of genome editing: (i) developing improved methods for delivering the sizable gene-editing tools, such as RNA-guided nuclease complexes, into target cells, and (ii) increasing the specificity and fidelity of the gene-editing procedures. In the second part of the thesis, the insights derived from these studies are further exploited for testing AdVs encoding nucleases as <b>repairing</b> <b>agents</b> of defective DMD alleles in muscle cell populations derived from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Finally, the application of AdVs as gene editing tools for repairing endogenous DMD alleles is discussed in the context of other viral vector-based DMD editing strategies. Taken together, the findings reported in this work are expected to aid in the designing and testing of new therapeutic interventions for tackling DMD and are anticipated to be applicable to other genetic disorders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Traumatic {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) leads to serious {{neurological}} and functional deficits through a chain of pathophysiological events. At the molecular level, progressive damage is initially revealed by collapse of plasma membrane organization and integrity produced by breaches. Consequently, the loss of {{its role as a}} semi-permeable barrier that generally mediates the regulation and transport of ions and molecules eventually results in cell death. In previous studies, we have demonstrated the functional recovery of compromised plasma membranes can be induced by the application of the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) after both spinal and brain trauma in adult rats and guinea pigs. Additionally, efforts have been directed towards a nanoparticle-based PEG application. The in vivo and ex vivo applications of PEG-decorated silica nanoparticles following CNS injury were able to effectively and efficiently enhance resealing of damaged cell membranes. Results The possibility for selectivity of tetramethyl rhodamine-dextran (TMR) dye-doped, PEG-functionalized silica nanoparticles (TMR-PSiNPs) to damaged spinal cord was evaluated using an ex vivo model of guinea pig SCI. Crushed and nearby undamaged spinal cord tissues exhibited an obvious difference in both the imbibement and accumulation of the TMR-PSiNPs, revealing selective labeling of compression-injured tissues. Conclusions These data show that appropriately functionalized nanoparticles can be an efficient means to both 1.) carry drugs, and 2.) apply membrane <b>repair</b> <b>agents</b> where they are needed in focally damaged nervous tissue. </p...|$|R
