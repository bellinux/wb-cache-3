5|$|Dodd {{wanted the}} SEC {{to limit the}} amount of {{scholarships}} to about 32 per year, which would keep the other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest. A vote was to be taken by the presidents of the colleges on the issue, and Dodd made it clear that Tech would leave the SEC unless the <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> changed. Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 <b>Rule</b> <b>was</b> upheld when the presidents split 6-6. Tech's president immediately walked to the podium and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E
5|$|During the {{election}} of a President, the previous President (or, if unable to, one of the previous Vice-Presidents) presides over the chamber.

5|$|Ivan Alexander's <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> also {{marked by}} efforts to {{strengthen}} {{the position of the}} Bulgarian Orthodox Church by pursuing heretics and Jews. He organized two anti-heretical church councils, in 1350 and 1359–1360, that condemned various sects such as the Bogomils, the Adamites and the Judaizers.|$|E

5|$|The en passant capture <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> {{added in}} the 15th century when the rule that gave pawns an initial double-step move was introduced. It {{prevents}} a pawn from using the two-square advance to pass an adjacent enemy pawn without {{the risk of being}} captured.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's <b>rule,</b> <b>was</b> invented {{shortly after}} Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E
5|$|The offside <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} to Sheffield Rules in 1863. Their version only required {{one member of}} the opposition between a player and the opposing goal to remain on side. Despite this the <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> only used sporadically in actual play. The FA version, which required a player to remain behind the ball at all times, was introduced during the 1865–66 season but was disliked {{due to the lack of}} goal scoring opportunities it caused. The one man offside was finally used a regular basis from 1867 until the adoption of FA rules in 1877.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{properties}} of {{this set of}} <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> that they are sound and complete. Informally {{this means that the}} <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> correct and that no other <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> required. These claims can be made more formal as follows.|$|R

5|$|After the Series, Ruth and {{teammates}} Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy {{participated in a}} barnstorming tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and undermining its value. Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} both Nash {{and strong}} Nash implementation of various matching rules for college admissions problems.

5|$|Alvear ordered Saavedra to move {{immediately}} to Buenos Aires, {{to close the}} case. He arrived to the city in time, and Alvear was sympathetic to his situation. However, Alvear {{was forced to resign}} a few days later, before being able to rule the case. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the interim government, restored Saavedra's military rank and honours, but the <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> abolished by Ignacio Álvarez Thomas, the following supreme director. He moved then to the countryside, to live with his brother Luis. He kept requesting to the government the restoration of his rank.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Báthory {{lost his}} throne {{and his life}} {{fighting}} against Michael the Brave and his Székely allies in autumn. Michael the Brave administered Transylvania as RudolphII's governor, but his <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> unpopular among the noblemen, especially because of the pillaging raids made by his unpaid soldiers. As early as 9February 1600 Sigismund {{announced that he was}} ready to return to Transylvania. Moses Székely, a commander-in-chief during Michael the Brave's campaign against Moldavia in May, deserted Michael and came to Poland to meet Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|Andronicus' <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> {{marked by}} {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions {{that in the}} long run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair. He began to debase the Byzantine hyperpyron, resulting in a reduction of the value of the Byzantine economy; taxes were decreased for the Powerful, i.e. landed aristocracy and instead placed upon the Knight-class Pronoia. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|As {{the game}} {{gradually}} {{moved away from}} being a pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along {{with the need for}} the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 the Football League, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change colours {{in the event of a}} clash, but in 1921 the <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> amended to require the away team to change.|$|E
5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} an axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|At the {{completion}} of the regular season, the top four teams progressed to the postseason. It was contested over three weeks, following the Page playoff system. Each stage was decided by a best–of–three game series. Unlike regular season games, which made use of a variation of the International Baseball Federation's mercy rule after seveninnings, no such <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> in place for postseason games; all games went the full nineinnings, with the only exception being two games that were tied after nineinnings, therefore requiring extra innings.|$|E

25|$|So {{following}} a <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> a practice. And furthermore, since one can think one <b>is</b> {{following a}} <b>rule</b> and yet <b>be</b> mistaken, thinking one <b>is</b> following a <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> {{not the same}} as following it. Therefore, following a <b>rule</b> cannot <b>be</b> a private activity.|$|R
