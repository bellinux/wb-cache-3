2500|$|Proenneke's {{cabin is}} hand-made and is notable for its {{remarkable}} craftsmanship {{due to his}} skill as a carpenter and wood worker, {{and because of the}} films he made of the complete construction procedure. Most of the structure and the furnishings are made from materials in and about the site, from the gravel taken from the lake bed to create the cabin's base, to the trees he selected, cut down, and then hand-cut with interlocking joints to create the walls and <b>roof</b> <b>rafter</b> framing. The window openings were planned and cut to suit. The fireplace and flue were made from stones he dug from around the site and meticulously mortared in place to create the chimney and hearth. He used metal containers for food storage—one-gallon cans were cut into basin shapes and buried below the frost line. This ensured that fruits and perishables could be stored for prolonged periods in the cool earth yet still be accessible when the winter months froze the ground above them. Proenneke's friend, bush pilot and missionary Leon Reid [...] "Babe" [...] Alsworth, returned periodically to bring food and orders that Proenneke placed through him to Sears.|$|E

A rope looped through a pulley {{attached}} to a fixed spot, e.g. a barn <b>roof</b> <b>rafter,</b> and attached to the weight is called a single pulley. It has a mechanical advantage (MA) = 1 (assuming frictionless bearings in the pulley), moving no mechanical advantage (or disadvantage) however advantageous the change in direction may be.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} architect William L. Steele in 1912 and built in 1912-1913. Set on a concrete foundation on a hill overlooking Walthill, the one-and-one-half-story hospital {{was built in the}} American Craftsman style of architecture. Typical of Craftsman style, it features a low-pitched, shingled (originally wood-shingled) roof, wide eaves with large braces beneath, exposed <b>roof</b> <b>rafter</b> tails, and a centered gabled dormer. A prominent screened porch runs {{the entire length of the}} front (east side) of the structure, bounded by columns that support the roof.|$|E
50|$|A single movable pulley has an MA of 2 (assuming {{frictionless}} bearings in the pulley). Consider {{a pulley}} {{attached to a}} weight being lifted. A rope passes around it, with one end attached to a fixed point above, e.g. a barn <b>roof</b> <b>rafter,</b> and a pulling force is applied upward {{to the other end}} with the two lengths parallel. In this situation the distance the lifter must pull the rope becomes twice the distance the weight travels, allowing the force applied to be halved. Note: if an additional pulley is used to change the direction of the rope, e.g. the person doing the work wants to stand on the ground instead of on a rafter, the mechanical advantage is not increased.|$|E
5000|$|In light frame construction, a {{birdsmouth}} joint or bird's beak cut is a woodworking joint that {{is generally}} used to connect a <b>roof</b> <b>rafter</b> {{to the top}} plate of a supporting wall. It is an indentation cut into the rafter which consists of a [...] "seat cut" [...] (the face of which rests on the top plate) and a [...] "heel cut" [...] or [...] "plumb cut" [...] (the face of which lies parallel to the supporting wall), forming a shape resembling a bird's mouth. The indentation should not extend unsupported on the interior {{in order to maintain}} the structural integrity of the rafter because the unsupported section can split along the grain of the wood. The joint is generally fastened with nails by toenailing the rafter from the side into the top plate below.|$|E

30|$|Light wood-frame {{buildings}} (W 1) in {{the study}} area are represented by traditional buildings which are the result of a long empirical process of trial and error in establishing a unique type structure (Prihatmaji et al. 2012). Traditional wood-frame structures were designed to deal with environmental threats to provide safety and convenience conditions for the people inside. The building is mainly built with wood which relatively results in significant reduction on the weight of building compared to that of different types of material. Since the seismic forces are proportional to the total weight of the building, the heavier building will suffer from greater horizontal force which might cause damage and even the collapse of the building. Another essential characteristic of light wood-frame structure is the common use of special connections which provide both strength and flexibility in responding forces. The connections will assure that the structural elements will be kept connected under a certain magnitude of forces and structural displacement in respond of the forces. Both light-weight and wooden connections provide structural flexibility to deal with seismic forces. However, the special characteristics of W 1 -type still do not guarantee that the building would be safe under an earthquake shake. According to Prihatmaji et al. (2012), there are three common damages causing the total of the Joglo Structure. First, the failure of the connection between the wood columns and the foundation due to the lacked of column-foundation especially in the side structure. Additionally, the column can easily slipped out from the bas stone when the column’s leg decayed. Second, the failur of connection between lower and upper beam because the damage of both column and beam after receiving the lateral force of the earthquake. Third, the roof strucuture failure which is triggered by the detachment of the <b>roof</b> <b>rafter</b> from the main beam due to the deformation, unstable, or collpases of the outer structure.|$|E
