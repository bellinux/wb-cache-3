This new grade shows very good resistances to steam oxidation and hot corrosion, and higher creep rupture strength than other austenitic {{stainless steel}}s available today.

This paper will mainly focus on the study of the creep and LCF behavior of the material at temperatures from 600 °C to 750 °C by using TEM and ECCI. The mechanisms at different temperatures and loading conditions have been identified. The interactions between dislocations and precipitates and their contribution to the creep rupture strength have been discussed.

50|$|It was a {{single-stage}} {{engine in}} that air was expanded in one piston and then exhausted. The air was reheated {{after leaving the}} tank and before entering the engine. The <b>reheater</b> bubbled air through a hot water tank, picking up hot water vapor to improve the engine's range.

All four generators (two low pressure generators and two high pressure/intermediate pressure generators) are Westinghouse generators. The low pressure steam turbines were originally Westinghouse units, but were replaced during an Alstom steam-path upgrade.

30|$|Efficiency of {{the power}} plant {{strongly}} depends on the operating steam temperature and pressure. The concern for reducing the CO 2 emission and coal consumption leads to the efforts to build power plants operating at higher steam parameters (Brozda 2007; Shu Ping et al. 2010; David et al. 2013). Austenitic stainless steels are selected for use in sections of superheaters and <b>reheaters,</b> which require good oxidation and fire side corrosion resistance, {{in addition to the}} creep strength. The recent improvements in operating steam temperatures up to 620  °C were achieved through the development of creep-resistant stainless steels, containing Cr, Ni, W, Co, Cu and N. Future plans of increasing the efficiency {{of the power}} plants up to 49  % require creep-resistant steels operating at steam temperatures of 760  °C and pressures of 35  MPa (Viswanathan et al. 2005). Super 304 H austenitic stainless steel is used in recently installed ultra super critical (USC) power units of Japan operating at steam temperature of about 613  °C (Thomas 2013). Further, Super 304 H is listed as a candidate material for superheaters and <b>reheaters</b> in the US program for development of materials for USC with steam temperatures of 760  °C (Viswanathan et al. 2005). Super 304 H with nominal composition of 0.1 C- 18 Cr- 9 Ni- 3 Cu-Nb-N derives excellent creep strength from the distinct Cu addition which precipitates as fine Cu-rich particle under creep conditions, in addition to NbCrN, Nb(C,N) and M 23 C 6 particles (Li et al. 2010).|$|R

Low damage rates were associated with all conditions of single phase liquid flow. There was damage for experiments in which atmospheric gasses (O- 2 and N- 2) were present; the experiments indicated that at 70 degrees C the impact of gas bubbles were responsible {{for much of the}} damage, whereas at 80 degrees C there was a significantly greater role for the chemical action of oxygen.

50|$|BWR steam {{turbines}} employ a high-pressure turbine {{designed to handle}} saturated steam, and multiple low-pressure turbines. The high-pressure turbine receives steam directly from the reactor. The high-pressure turbine exhaust passes through a steam <b>reheater</b> which superheats the steam to over 400 degrees F for the low-pressure turbines to use. The exhaust of the low-pressure turbines {{is sent to the}} main condenser. The steam reheaters take some of the reactor's steam {{and use it as a}} heating source to reheat what comes out of the high-pressure turbine exhaust. While the reheaters take steam away from the turbine, the net result is that the reheaters improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the plant.|$|E
50|$|The plant, {{owned and}} {{operated}} by CENG, a joint venture between Exelon and Électricité de France, has two 2737 megawatt thermal (MWth) Combustion Engineering Generation II two-loop pressurized water reactors. Each generating plant (CCNPP 1&2) produces approximately 850 megawatt electrical (MWe) net or 900 MWe gross. Each plant's electrical load consumes approximately 50 MWe. These are saturated steam plants (non-superheated) and are approximately 33% efficient (ratio of 900 MWe gross/2700 MWth core). Only the exhaust of the single high-pressure main turbine is slightly superheated by a two-stage <b>reheater</b> before delivering the superheated steam in parallel to the three low-pressure turbines. Unit 1 uses a General Electric-designed main turbine and generator, while Unit 2 uses a Westinghouse-designed main turbine and generator. The heat produced by the reactor is returned to the bay, which operates as a cooling heat-sink for the plant.|$|E
50|$|There was one turbine and one {{alternator}} per unit. Each turbine had a High Pressure (HP) stage, an Intermediate Pressure (IP) {{stage and}} two Low Pressure (LP) stages all connected in tandem {{to the same}} shaft. The superheated steam entered the HP turbine at a temperature of 566 °C and a pressure of 162 bar. The exhaust steam from the HP turbine travelled back through the boiler <b>Reheater</b> and entered the IP turbine at the same temperature but at a lower pressure of 43.5 bar. The exhaust steam from the IP turbine then entered the LP turbines. The steam was used to drive the turbines, causing the shaft to rotate at 3,000 rpm. This speed drove the alternator and gave a frequency of 50 cycles per second (Hz) and allowed connection to the National Grid. Electricity was generated at 17 kilovolts (kV).|$|E
30|$|Fouling is the {{formation}} of sintered ash deposits on conventional heating surfaces such as <b>reheaters</b> and super heaters [40] that are not directly exposed to flame radiation. It takes place as the suspended fly ash cools down along with flue gases [41]. Excessive fouling may {{lead to an increase}} in gas temperature and deposition rate which leads to continually changing conditions in the boiler, hence, reducing its efficiency [42]. Temperature variation for high temperature fouling lies in the range from 900 to 1300  °C, and for low temperature fouling, this range is from 300 to 900  °C [38]. Fouling in boilers is caused due to reduction in heat transfer, which further leads to sufficient loss of superheat and hot flue gas temperatures [43, 44]. Major factors that lead to the removal of fouling are the deposit strength and the adhesive bonding between the heat transfer surface and ash deposit. Deposit removal process involves breaking of deposit matrix and/or breaking of adhesive bonding. In coal-fired power plant boilers a lot of production problems are generated due to fouling. Lack in timely maintenance and cleaning can also lead to fouling problem [45].|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the analysis of a {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG) is to define energetic losses of the HRSG design and to provide an accurate estimate of investment cost with a model that is sensitive to thermodynamic and geometric changes in a HRSG. The backbone of the analysis is the requirement that the HRSG must satisfy a maximum allowable pressure loss on the exhaust side of the system. This pressure loss is an input to the analysis, and the HRSG is sized to meet this requirement. In addition, the internal pressure drops for the steam in the superheaters and <b>reheaters</b> and the water in the economizers and feedwater heaters are computed, and geometry changes can be made to assure that these pressure drops are acceptable. A secondary {{objective of the}} analysis is to determine the overall geometry of the HRSG. It is anticipated that the analysis can be a valuable tool to determine the impact of fundamental changes in the HRSG design on the investment cost and overall geometry and determine energetic losses.
