30|$|Since last 70  years, {{to carry}} the load of the {{structures}} namely three types of foundation system were used such as <b>raft</b> <b>foundations,</b> pile and piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> where former has limited to the rise building and later have used in high rise building. For pile and piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations,</b> different drilling fluids are used to stabilize bore hole such as bentonite and polymer. Mineral slurries are the commonly used drilling fluids, for the stabilization of the borehole in various constructions such as pile foundation, diaphragm wall panels etc. Bentonite being economical has been the most commonly used mineral slurry. Bentonite regains its strength due to remolding, when allowed to hydrate in water as it shows a thixotropic behavior with time thus bentonite particles form an impermeable layer of filter cake around the exposed soil layer which helps in borehole stabilization. The ultimate bearing capacity of a pile foundation is the sum of end bearing resistance as well as frictional resistance around its shaft, but various researchers have shown that the frictional resistance offered by the pile is found to be reduced due to the formation of a soft layer with the use of bentonite as a borehole stabilizer which is required to be formed to keep the soil intact in the borehole, thus indulges in compromising with the reduction in the overall ultimate load carrying capacity of the pile. Another problem associated with the bentonite, it is geo-hazards and leads to disposal problems. This {{led to the development of}} material, such as polymer fluids which helps in stabilizing the borehole without significantly affecting the frictional resistance of the pile. To stabilize the bore hole it was found that higher percentage of bentonite is required to achieve desired properties of fluid as compared to polymer as the required parameters suggested by the IS code for bentonite fluid. One of the traditional reasons behind switching from bentonite to polymer is its operational benefit. There are certain sites where it becomes difficult to construct a separate bentonite plant due to space restrictions thereby leading to the use of polymer as drilling fluid.|$|R
40|$|A piled raft is a {{composite}} foundation in which the piles are used as settlement reducers and they share, with the raft, the load from the superstructure. The applied load is transferred from the raft to the shallow soil and to the pile heads, and from the piles it is diffused through the shaft and the base to deeper soil. The pile–raft and pile–pile interactions represent the distinctive aspect of the piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> since they modify the load–bearing behaviour of each foundation component, compared to an analogous isolated element, thus determining the overall foundation behaviour. The main aim of this thesis is to highlight {{the effects of the}} raft–soil–pile interactions on the resistance and stiffness of axially loaded piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> in sand. A series of centrifuge tests on models of rigid circular piled rafts in loose saturated sand has been performed to this end, employing both non displacement and displacement piles. The raft settlement and the load transmitted to the pile heads and bases were monitored during the tests, which also included unpiled raft and isolated pile tests. The test results have been analysed in terms of bearing capacity and stiffness; the former according to a load efficiency method, the latter by comparing the values obtained from centrifuge tests with those evaluated through a simplified analytical method. ii Modelling of Piled <b>Raft</b> <b>Foundations</b> in Sand D. Giretti In order to clarify the effect of the pressure transmitted by the raft to the soil on the behaviour of a single capped pile, some of the centrifuge tests were simulated via finite element numerical analyses, using an elasto–plastic strain hardening constitutive model for the sand. The geometry and the dimensions of the numerical models corresponded to those of the physical ones and the simulations were carried out applying an accelerated gravitational field to the mesh.
