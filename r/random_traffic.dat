30|$|The {{increment}} of the <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> {{is larger}} {{than that of the}} uniform traffic. The reasons are as follows. Under uniform traffic, the transmission durations of links in a pairing are diverse in MPMH [1]. The diversities bring about the waste of time slots in a pairing. The differences among the transmission durations of links in a pairing under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> are worse, which result in further degradations in the throughput performance. However, the transmission durations of links in a pairing are the same under both traffic patterns in MPMH-SRSC. Thus, it outperforms the MPMH under uniform traffic and has greater performance increment under <b>random</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Balanced Gamma (BG) {{network has}} {{demonstrated}} high performance under unicast traffic and has displayed potential for application in broadband packet switching networks. As communication networks and their applications are moving towards B-ISDN, multicasting capability becomes a {{more and more}} important network function. Recently, we studied a new multicast switch fabric [...] - the BG Multicast Switch Fabric. A new BG network structure is proposed to support multicasting. The key characteristic of a multicast switch, the cell replication function, is integrated into the routing function of the switch element. Two new algorithms: the dynamic-length routing and splitting algorithm and the dynamic-length backpressure algorithm are designed to support the multicast function inside the switch fabric. The new network structure inherits the attractive features of the BG network and the banyan network and can be viewed to be topologically equivalent to the unicast BG network architecture. We simulated this multicast switch under uniform <b>random</b> unicast <b>traffic</b> {{and found that the}} performance is very close to that of the unicast BG switch under the same testing conditions. We also tested the multicast switch fabric under the <b>random</b> multicast <b>traffic</b> with the truncated geometric fanout distribution and found that given the same switch size and traffic load, the performance under the multicast traffic is even better than that of the pure unicast traffic...|$|R

The scheduling switch uses a series of feed forward delays interconnected with elementary optical switches. This series of programmable delay blocks constitute an optical buffer of depth T, whose purpose is to delay/re-arrange incoming packets that request the same outgoing link so as to resolve or reduce packet contention.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Section 6.2, MPMH-MRMC can better utilize MPMH than the MPMH-SRSC, {{which results in}} the decrease of delay. Compared with MPMH-SRSC, the average transmission delay of MPMH-MRMC decreases by about 74.20 % under uniform traffic and 70.91 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> with the traffic load ratio from 10 to 20. With the traffic load ratio from 10 to 20, MPMH-MRMC outperforms MPMH 2 by about 29.21 % under uniform traffic and 49.04 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> on average, respectively. The reason is identical with the one in network throughput. When the traffic load ratio is over 3, the number of discarded packets in TDMA exceeds MPMH and MPMH-SRSC, which leads to lower average delay in TDMA.|$|E
40|$|A new {{asynchronous}} interconnection {{network is}} introduced for globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS) chip multiprocessors. The network {{eliminates the need}} for global clock distribution, and can interface multiple synchronous timing domains operating at unrelated clock rates. In particular, two new highly-concurrent asynchronous components are introduced which provide simple routing and arbitration/merge functions. Post-layout simulations in identical commercial 90 nm technology indicate that comparable recent synchronous router nodes have 5. 6 - 10. 7 x more energy per packet and 2. 8 - 6. 4 x greater area than the new asynchronous nodes. Under <b>random</b> <b>traffic,</b> the network provides significantly lower latency and competitive throughput over the entire operating range of the 800 MHz network and through mid-range traffic rates for the 1. 36 GHz network, but with degradation at higher traffic rates. Preliminary evaluations are also presented for a mixedtiming (GALS) network in a shared-memory parallel architecture, running both <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> and parallel benchmark kernels, as well as directions for further improvement. ...|$|E
40|$|A general {{expression}} {{for the average}} distance for meshes of any dimension and radix, including unequal radices in different dimensions, valid for any traffic pattern under zero-load condition is formulated rigorously to allow its calculation without network-level simulations. The average distance expression is solved analytically for uniform <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> and {{for a set of}} local <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns. Hot spot traffic patterns are also considered and the formula is empirically validated by cycle true simulations for uniform random, local, and hot spot traffic. Moreover, a methodology to attain closed-form solutions for other traffic patterns is detailed. Furthermore, the model is applied to guide design decisions. Specifically, we show that the model can predict the optimal 3 -D topology for uniform and local traffic patterns. It can also predict the optimal placement of hot spots in the network. The fidelity of the approach in suggesting the correct design choices even for loaded and congested networks is surprising. For those cases we studied empirically it i...|$|E

The fading channel {{is assumed to be}} Nakagami-m and modeled with a finite state Markov channel, and transmit diversity is achieved with orthogonal space-time block code.

40|$|Practical {{crossbar}} scheduling algorithms for CIOQ switches such as PIM and i-SLIP, {{can perform}} poorly under extreme traffic conditions, frequently failing to be workconserving. The common practice of evaluating crossbar scheduling algorithms {{according to the}} packet delay under <b>random</b> admissible <b>traffic</b> tends to obscure significant differences that affect the robustness of different algorithms when exposed to extreme conditions. On the other hand, algorithms such as LOOFA with provably good worst-case performance, don't lend themselves readily to high performance implementation. We advocate evaluating crossbar scheduling algorithms using targeted stress tests which seek to probe the performance boundaries of competing alternatives. Appropriately designed stress tests can reveal key differences among algorithms and can provide the insight needed to spur the development of better solutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Internet {{censorship}} threatens people’s online privacy, and {{in recent}} years, new technologies such as high-speed Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and statistical traffic analysis methods had been applied in country scale censorship and surveillance projects. Traditional encryption protocols cannot hide statistical flow properties and new censoring systems can easily detect and block them “in the dark”. Recent work showed that traffic morphing and protocol obfuscation are effective ways to defend from statistical traffic analysis. In this paper, we proposed a novel traffic obfuscation protocol, where client and server communicate on random port. We implemented our idea as an open-source VPN tool named GoHop, and developed several obfuscation method including pre-shared key encryption, <b>traffic</b> shaping and <b>random</b> port communication.
