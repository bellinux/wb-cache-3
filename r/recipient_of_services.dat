40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{customer}} role has evolved from a passive <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> to a proactive cocreator {{in the activities of}} an organisation Customers are increasingly viewed as a resource with firms increasing collaboration to increase benefits to both parties. Cocreation activity can offer improved predictability and quality in the exchange for the firm and feelings of self-efficacy, enjoyment and psychological benefits for customers. Research exploring cocreation focuses mainly on direct relationships between a firm and it’s customers and the benefits accrued therein. Little attention has explored the extent to which collaborative activities might have an indirect effect on parties not directly involved in the process. This paper is based on a doctoral study which measured how value cocreation within a public transport setting can offer both direct and indirect benefits to users...|$|E

40|$|Current {{legislation}} regarding {{early intervention}} services {{has focused on}} the family unit, rather than the individual child, as the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> A model of family-centered care has been adopted and as a result, new models for service delivery have been developed. The present study examined family perspectives of the professional-paraprofessional partnership model, and assessed the ecological validity of this model {{as it relates to the}} basic principles of family-centered care. Families who participated in an early intervention program that utilized the professional-paraprofessional partnership model were interviewed upon program completion. Families reported receiving a wide range of child and family services, as well as assistance from their home visitor in accessing formal and informal resources within their community. Families recognized and positively responded to visitors who were flexible, supportive, and respectful of their family. A positive relationship was found between the number of family services received and ratings of the home visitor on variables of flexibility, support, and control. The majority of families described the home visiting service as the most helpful service they received. In addition, there were no differences in the services provided by professional and paraprofessional visitors, as reported by families. Overall, family reports indicated parent satisfaction with the professional-paraprofessional partnership model, and this model was found to meet the proposed family-centered objectives for early intervention services...|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{summarize}} the legal framework relating to the legal responsibility of Information Service Providers (ISP). This field is regulated by the Directive 2000 / 31 /EC ('Directive on electronic commerce') and the Czech Act No. 480 / 2004 Coll., on certain information society services. The secondary purpose of this thesis is to compare these two legal frameworks, consider the differences between them and identify their consequences. The legal definition of ISP is fully analyzed in this thesis however this basically means any provider of information society service, i. e service provided at a distance, by electronic means, at the individual request of a <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> and normally provided for remuneration. The thesis is composed of four chapters dealing with different issues. The first chapter is the short introduction into legal responsibility as a legal instrument. The main attention {{is given to the}} article 420 of the Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll. (Civil Code) and the changes which will be brought by the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., i. e. the "new" Civil Code effective from 1. 1. 2014. The second chapter deals with the first rulings concerning the ISP liability abroad (Godfrey v. Demon Internet, LICRA v. Yahoo, A&M Records v. Napster). In my point of view, these judgments are, even [...] ...|$|E
40|$|With the Demirkan {{case the}} CJEU was {{called upon to}} clarify the scope of Article 41 (1) of the Additional {{protocol}} to the EU - Turkey Association Agreement and affirm whether the Soysal and Savatli ruling was also applicable to the passive reception of services and, more specifically, to tourists. The CJEU answered negatively and adopted a strict literal interpretation of Article 41 (1). With this decision the CJEU affirmed that article 41 (1) of the Additional protocol {{does not apply to}} services recipients and to reach this conclusion the CJEU emphasised that the EU -Turkey Association Agreement and protocol should be interpreted {{in the light of the}} context and objectives enshrined at the time of their conclusion. By doing so the CJEU adopted a formal method of interpretation that does not seem to take into consideration the status of candidate country of Turkey and that appears stricter than the techniques used by the CJEU in other cases. As a result of this tourists and other <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> from Turkey will have to keep on applying for a visa to enter the Schengen area until the visa liberalisation agreement enters in to force.

40|$|A {{national}} {{disability insurance}} scheme Australia's {{move toward the}} development of an insurance scheme that provides the opportunity for Australians with a disability to receive adequate support was initiated at the 2020 summit in 2008. Since that time, a range of actions have been undertaken to bring Australia to the point at which it now stands, on the brink of decision making about the implementation of an National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The Australian Government has stated its commitment to developing a national disability strategy (Productivity Commission, 2011, p. iv) and it was in this context that the possibility of an NDIS was developed. An NDIS would see {{the development of an}} entitlement based scheme that is needs driven and which, quite importantly, sees the person with a disability as the customer, as opposed to the current system which arguably sees the person with a disability as the passive <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Why is the NDIS the next logical step for Australia? It was not that long ago that people in Australia who had a disability were completely separated from the community. People with disabilities were seen as not being normal. However {{it can be argued that}} the idea of normal is not part of human nature and that it is instead a construction of our society (Davis, 2010, p. 3). Attitudes to people with a disability did not begin to change until after the two world wars in the first half of the twentieth century when servicemen who had experienced disablement as a result of war, began to return home (Barnes, 2010, p. 27). But it was not until the 1950 's that we began to see a move to reduce segregation, and not until the 1960 's in America was there any plan to move people from institutiona...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the meaning of family-centered intervention {{and the extent to}} which it is being implemented from the perspectives of both professionals and families who participated in developing IFSPs. Practice indicators reflecting three principles of family-centered intervention were developed to evaluate current practices. Findings from semi-structured interviews indicated that professionals have an understanding of the change in focus from child to family; however, there is some incongruence between family-centered attitudes and actual practice. Although families expressed overall satisfaction with services they were receiving, some professionals were clearly more family-centered than others in their practice. Implications for the development of practices to support the family-centered intent of IDEA, Part H, are discussed. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Part H, created major challenges and opportunities for the development and deliv-ery of family-centered early intervention ser-vices to children with disabilities and their fam-ilies. Part H is unique in that the family, rather than just the child, is the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> (Krauss, 1990). The individual family service plan (IFSP) is the mechanism that allows for expansion of the intervention focus to include outcomes and services for families as well as their children. The processes used to deter-mine outcomes for the IFSP and the nature of services to families are being refined, as im-plementation of IDEA becomes a reality. The rules and regulations of IDEA are straightfor-ward (Federal Register, July 30, 1993), but Interpretation of the underlying family-cen-tered intent of the legislation will require de-fining new practices and acquiring new atti-tudes and skills for working with families. The purpose of this article is to investigate the meaning of family-centered practice {{and the extent to which}} it is being implemented from the perspectives of both professionals and families who have participated in developin...|$|E
40|$|My {{research}} concluded by the dissertation thesis {{focused on}} transfer pricing in financial management. The {{aim of this}} paper was to analyze the use of contracts for cost-sharing, contracts for contributing to the cost and service level agreements in a group of related persons of multinational companies. The work is divided into three logical parts. The first part of my dissertation analyzed the available scientific work and literature. A number of publications deals with the issue but only marginally. I thus drew upon mainly legal texts. I assumed the potential for practical use based on my finding that about 72 % of companies doing business in research and development operate in clusters of related persons. The second part of the paper deals with contracts for cost-sharing and cost contribution agreements. The basic problem of both agreements is reasonable estimation of the expected benefits. I suggested a procedure for estimation of benefit sharing among participants and also what indicators to use for measuring. Then I defined the share of costs. I suggested a definition of K. O. criteria for other than the U. S. legislation for incorrectly estimated shares. In this theoretical treatise on the weighted cost of capital I have found that companies that are not {{part of a group of}} related persons have a lower WACC. I pointed to the significant impact of agreements on avoidance of double taxation. As an alternative to the above contracts in the Czech Republic I presented a contract of association under the Civil Code. The third part of this work is dedicated to the Service Level Agreement. I conclude that it is necessary in certain ways to measure benefits, as it is a very important factor for the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> The benefits, however, cannot be measured directly, but through auxiliary variables, when the determining will always be influenced by the applied accounting standards. The second examined aspect was the allocation of costs to the service provider. Here, I conclude that there is no universally correct way. However, essential for these costs are only the actual relevant costs incurred in connection with the provision of intangible assets. Lastly, I focused on the usual profit margin surcharge over the cost provider of intangible assets. I conclude that when setting profit margins in accordance with the arm's length principle one should build on the level of normal returns on the invested assets of the provider...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Quality <b>of</b> health <b>services</b> is {{the rate}} of {{achievement}} to the most desirable resultants of health, so that provided services are effective, efficient, and affordable. Thus, quality evaluation {{can be an important}} source of information for recognition of problems and favorable plans in provision <b>of</b> treatment <b>services.</b> Method: In this cross-sectional study, criteria of quality in hospital services and the compatibility rate from viewpoint <b>of</b> providers and <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in Iran were studied using simple random sampling method in 4 provinces of country among 1485 people. Data were gathered using a designed questionnaire; criteria of quality in views <b>of</b> providers and <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in six dimensions were studied. The data were analyzed using SPSSW- 20 software. In order to analyze the information, descriptive tests and to determine the compatibility rate between the two groups, Chi-square test were used at a significance level of 0. 05. Results:Based on the results of this research, most percentage of accordance between the two groups <b>of</b> providers and <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> was in “Human Resources” dimension and in 1 st priority (“Knowledge and specialty and skills of physicians and nurses and other people involved in patient care” criterion) with a frequency of 76. 3 and 73. 1 percent. Among the six studied dimensions, compatibility rate between the two groups, in “Access to Service and Care”, “Respecting Values and Emotional Support”, and “Management and Coordination of Care System” dimensions was significant (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Quality evaluation is an important source of information for recognition of problems and favorable plans in provision <b>of</b> effective health <b>services.</b> Therefore, recognition <b>of</b> different views of beneficiary groups and specially attempts to make perceptions <b>of</b> providers and <b>recipients</b> closer in the context of quality criteria are essential...|$|R
