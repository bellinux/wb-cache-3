40|$|In {{order to}} assess the safety of {{concentric}} <b>reducers</b> and eccentric <b>reducers,</b> the meridian stress and circumferential stress of the <b>reducers</b> subjected to in-plane bending moments are calculated based on the membrane theory. Solutions of limit bending moments are derived by using the approach with the equivalent stress and engineering coefficient. The solutions for both <b>reducers</b> are identical, as the formulas are composed of a base term multiplied by a bending moment coefficient. The limit bending moments are dominated by the small end of the <b>reducers.</b> The value of limit bending moment of the <b>reducers</b> is 14. 6 % more {{than that of a}} thin wall reducing elbow with same diameter and thickness when corresponding bending coefficient λ> 3. 0. But comparison with a straight pipe which has the same diameter and thickness as the small end of the <b>reducers,</b> the limit bending moment of the <b>reducers</b> is 11. 1 % lower and the constant in the formula for the <b>reducers</b> is 3. 6 instead of 4. 0 for straight pipe.

500|$|The {{mortar and}} {{aggregate}} of Roman concrete was {{built up in}} horizontal layers laid by hand against wooden form-work with {{the thickness of the}} layers determined by the length of the workday, rather than being poured into a mold as concrete is today. Roman concrete domes were thus built similarly to the earlier corbel domes of the Mediterranean region, although they have different structural characteristics. The aggregate used by the Romans was often rubble, but lightweight aggregate in the upper levels served to reduce stresses. Empty [...] "vases and jugs" [...] could be hidden inside to reduce weight. [...] The dry concrete mixtures used by the Romans were compacted with rams to eliminate voids, and added animal blood acted as a water <b>reducer.</b> Because Roman concrete was weak in tension, it did not provide any structural advantage over the use of brick or stone. But, because it could be constructed with unskilled slave labor, it provided a constructional advantage and facilitated the building of large-scale domes.|$|E

40|$|According to reducer/augmenter theory, augmenters {{are assumed}} to react to sensory stimuli with {{enhanced}} responsiveness, whereas <b>reducers</b> respond to the same stimuli with dampened responsiveness. Due to their generally understimulated condition, <b>reducers</b> are motivated to seek out stronger or more intense forms of sensory stimulation. When emotion {{is viewed as a}} source of stimulation, it becomes plausible to hypothesize that <b>reducers</b> and augmenters may differentially utilize their emotions to modulate stimulation level. Results from Study 1 show that, after a period of boredom, <b>reducers</b> chose more frequently than augmenters to participate in an arousing, emotion-induction experiment, even though they believed the experience would involve the induction of negative affect. <b>Reducers</b> also found the initial boredom-induction task to be significantly more boring and less interesting than the augmenters. Study 2 found that <b>reducers</b> were more likely than augmenters to engage in activities that have a higher probability of evoking emotion in their natural, ongoing lives. <b>Reducers</b> also exhibited episodes of stronger affect and more frequently novelty- and sensation-seeking in their ongoing natural lives than augmenters. Implications of these results for reducer/augmenter theory and for understanding the role of emotion in arousal regulation are discussed, and directions for future research are proposed...|$|R

30|$|The {{programming}} {{model used}} in Hadoop is MapReduce [9] which was proposed by Dean and Ghemawat at Google. MapReduce {{is the basic}} data processing scheme used in Hadoop which includes breaking the entire task into two parts, known as mappers and <b>reducers.</b> At a high-level, mappers read the data from HDFS, process it and generate some intermediate results to the <b>reducers.</b> <b>Reducers</b> are used to aggregate the intermediate results to generate the final output which is again written to HDFS.

Methods: Participants in two smoking reduction intervention studies (N= 64) were selected for comparison with a group of light smokers (N= 62) who smoked the same number of cigarettes as the <b>reducers.</b> A compensatory smoking score was defined (biomarker level for reducer/biomarker level for light smoker) and calculated for urinary 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL) and its glucuronides (total NNAL), metabolites of the tobaccospecific lung carcinogen 4 -(methylnitrosamino) -I-(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone, to measure the degree of smoking compensation in <b>reducers</b> when compared with the light smokers. Results: The mean level of creatinine-adjusted total NNAL for <b>reducers</b> was over twice that of light smokers even when they smoked about the same number of cigarettes per day. The difference of the mean total NNAL concentrations between light smokers and <b>reducers</b> was highly significant (P < 0. 0001).
