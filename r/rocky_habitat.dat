25|$|Crevice-gleaning is a niche {{particular}} to dry and rocky habitats. Adaptations for crevice-gleaning {{are similar to}} that of bark-gleaning. Just as the Bewick's wren, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, has a long bill suited for poking around in the small places of woods and gardens, another North American wren, the canyon wren, has an even longer bill, which allows it to probe crevices in rocky cliffs. It also has skeletal adaptations to aid it in reaching deep into small spaces. These same traits are useful for gleaning the sides of buildings, as well. Another kind of <b>rocky</b> <b>habitat</b> is found along mountain streams, where birds such as the Louisiana waterthrush of North America and the forktails of Asia pick over stream-side rocks and exposed roots for aquatic insects and other moisture-loving prey.|$|E
25|$|The {{giant panda}} has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The {{rest of the}} animal's coat is white. Although {{scientists}} {{do not know why}} these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and <b>rocky</b> <b>habitat.</b> The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45kg (243.5lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292. Another study had a 117.5kg (259lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.|$|E
2500|$|The Mexican Spiny-tailed iguana is {{a social}} lizard, which has adapted to living in groups as opposed to other species of Ctenosaura {{which tend to be}} solitary animals. These iguanas are {{excellent}} climbers, and prefer a <b>rocky</b> <b>habitat</b> with plenty of crevices to hide in, rocks to bask on, and nearby trees to climb. They are diurnal and fast moving, employing their speed to escape predators but will lash with their tails and bite if cornered. [...] They are often found dwelling near or in towns in their native Mexico and where they have been introduced elsewhere.|$|E
