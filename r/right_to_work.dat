The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly elected government. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as applying equally to East and West German citizens. An East German who escaped or was {{released to the}} West was automatically granted West German rights including residence, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and EEC freedom of movement; West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E

5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E
5|$|Daniels {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run in Indiana's 2004 gubernatorial election after leaving the Bush administration. He won the Republican primary with 67% of the vote, and defeated Democratic incumbent Governor Joe Kernan in the general election. Daniels was reelected to a second term, defeating former U.S. Representative and US Department of Agriculture undersecretary Jill Long Thompson, on November 4, 2008. During his tenure as governor, Daniels cut the state government workforce by 18%, cut and capped state property taxes, and balanced the state budget through budget austerity measures and increasing spending by less than the inflation rate. In his second term, Daniels saw protest by labor unions and Democrats {{in the state legislature}} over his policies regarding Indiana's school voucher program and the Indiana House of Representatives attempt to pass <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> legislation, leading to the 2011 Indiana legislative walkouts. During the legislature's last session under Daniels, he signed the right-to-work law; with Indiana becoming the 23rd state in the nation to do so.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Telemark County Municipality had {{attempted}} to create a PSO contract for {{the operation of the}} Bratsberg Line, that had been transferred from the state to the county. Five private companies had bid, but all five had been disqualified and the county was forced to sign a concession contract with NSB instead, despite NSB not having bid in the tender. The same year, the national process was delayed one year. However, the government announced that the bidding would happen in three stages; first the Gjøvik Line and Bergen Commuter Rail, second the long-distance trains as well as the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and finally the rest of the Oslo Commuter Rail, as well as the Jæren Commuter Rail. Among the challenges was the ownership of the rolling stock and depots. The department considered creating a separate government-owned company that would own these. Since NSB had been converted to a limited company, it would be necessary for the state to purchase the trains and depots for full price from NSB. With 69 multiple units delivered within the past five years, this could become an expensive transaction for the state. An alternative was launched were NSB would have to lease locomotives, carriages and multiple units to the winner, and also sell tickets for them at railway stations, a solution that was later chosen. In September 2004, it was announced that current employees working for NSB along the Gjøvik Line would have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for the winner, and could demand the same wage and pension rights as before.|$|E

40|$|Ethiopia has acceded to {{too many}} global {{conventions}} and proclamations or treaties confirming the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> However, after years of ratifying different international conventions regarding human rights, the state is still facing difficulty on the practical implementation of its commitments to protect, respect and fulfill workers’ rights. This paper provides {{a brief overview of}} what the international human rights instruments mention about the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and compare these international conventions with Ethiopia’s labor proclamation No 377 / 2003. The study is conducted in Meadows Flower PLC, which is found in the Oromia region of Ethiopia in Hollata town. The thesis also analyzes the major problems that workers in Meadows Flower PLC currently face from human rights perspective. The thesis has concluded that Ethiopia is a signatory state of the ICESCR’s conventions, and ILO’s labour declaration regarding the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Besides, the country’s labor proclamation is largely in conformity with these major international labour conventions and declarations. However, {{in spite of the fact}} that the country has progressive labour laws, the gap between theory and practice is very wide. Because of this fact, the state as a primary duty bearer has failed to fulfill its obligation to protect and fulfill workers’ rights. However, the state is able to meet its obligation <b>to</b> respect the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> principle, at least in theory, as it has set in place legal and procedural mechanisms <b>to</b> protect workers’ <b>rights.</b> </p...|$|R
