40|$|We {{research}} the management approach that quantitatively combines {{decisions that affect}} different planning horizons [...] namely, the strategic and operational ones [...] and simultaneously derive the optimal values of these decisions. The system we investigate comprises <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> and customers in an infinite-horizon setting. Both <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> and customers are located on a finite homogenous line segment. The total demand posed by customers is normally distributed with known mean and variance. To optimally design and operate such a system, we need to determine the optimal values {{of the number of}} <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> the location of each <b>retail</b> <b>outlet,</b> and the replenishment inventory levels maintained at each <b>retail</b> <b>outlet.</b> We analyze the system from an expected cost point of view, considering the fixed costs of operating the <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> the expected holding and shortage costs, and the expected delivery costs. We show that all decisions can be represented {{as a function of the}} number of <b>retail</b> <b>outlets.</b> Moreover, we show that the system's expected cost function is quasi-convex in the number of <b>retail</b> <b>outlets.</b> We compare our model to a model that does not integrate these decisions at once. We show the advantage of our approach on both the solution and objective spaces. We propose an exact quantification of this advantage in terms of the cost and problem parameters. In addition, we point out several managerial insights. location-inventory model, implicit function theorem, risk pooling, infinite-horizon stochastic inventory, subadditive function, quasi-convex...|$|R
