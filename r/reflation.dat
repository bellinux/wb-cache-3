The IMF sometimes advocates [...] "austerity programmes", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even when the economy is weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing budget deficits. Countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax rate. In Globalization and Its Discontents, Joseph E. Stiglitz, former chief economist and senior vice-president at the World Bank, criticises these policies. He argues that by converting to a more monetarist approach, the purpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out Keynesian <b>reflations,</b> and that the IMF [...] "was not participating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and ideology of the Western financial community".|$|R
25|$|Macmillan {{saw in the}} {{by-election}} results {{evidence that}} former Conservative voters would abandon their candidates {{in support of the}} Liberals, who were well placed in Conservative safe seats. In instances where the Liberals had no candidate standing, such as the Labour safe seat of Pontefract, the Conservatives maintained their share of the vote. When a Liberal candidate was fielded, such as at the Stockton-on-Tees by-election in April, in a seat Macmillan himself formerly held, the Conservatives saw large numbers of voters desert them for the Liberals. Later by-elections confirmed the trend. By July the Chairman of the Conservative Party Iain Macleod warned that a government reshuffle was necessary to revitalise flagging support, a view confirmed by Martin Redmayne, the Conservative Chief Whip. Macmillan met with Rab Butler on 21 June. With Conservative unpopularity stemming from economic issues, they discussed replacing Selwyn Lloyd as Chancellor of the Exchequer with Reginald Maudling.

Although there were two periods of mild economic <b>reflation</b> (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of Mitterrand's presidency from 1983 onwards.

2500|$|Challenging the {{traditional}} view monetarists and New Keynesians like J.

The extraordinary growth in money supply beginning in 1933 lowered real {{interest rates and}} stimulated investment spending. According to Bernanke {{there was also a}} debt-deflation effect of the depression which was clearly offset by a <b>reflation</b> through the growth in money supply. But before 1992 scholars did not realize that the New Deal provided for a huge aggregate demand stimulus through a de facto easing of monetary policy. While Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued in [...] "Monetary History of the United States" [...] (1963) that the Federal Reserve System had made no attempt to increase the quantity in high-powered money and thus failed to foster recovery they somehow did not investigate the impact of the monetary policy of the New Deal. In 1992 Christina Romer explained in [...] "What Ended the Great Depression?" [...] that the rapid growth in money supply beginning in 1933 {{can be traced back to}} a large unsterilized gold inflow to the US which was partly due to political instability in Europe but to a larger degree to the revaluation of gold through the Gold Reserve Act. The Roosevelt administration had chosen not to sterilize the gold inflow precisely because they hoped that the growth of money supply would stimulate the economy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reflation,</b> {{which can}} be {{considered}} a form of inflation (increase in the price level), is contrasted with inflation (narrowly speaking) in that [...] "bad" [...] inflation is inflation above the long-term trend line, while <b>reflation</b> is a recovery of the price level when it has fallen below the trend line. For example, if inflation had been running at a 3% rate, but for one year it falls to 0%, the following year would need 6% inflation (actually 6.09% due to compounding) to catch back up to the long-term trend. This higher than normal inflation is considered <b>reflation,</b> since it is a return to trend, not exceeding the long-term trend.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reflation</b> is {{the act of}} {{stimulating}} the economy by increasing the money supply or by reducing taxes, seeking to bring the economy (specifically price level) {{back up to the}} long-term trend, following a dip in the business cycle.

50|$|This {{distinction}} {{is predicated on}} a theory of economic growth where there is long-term growth {{in the economy and}} price level, which is widely accepted in economics.

50|$|Disinflation is a {{decrease}} in the rate of inflation - a slowdown in the rate of increase of the general price level of goods and services in a nation's gross domestic product over time.

In the absence of <b>reflation,</b> he predicted an end only after [...] "needless and cruel bankruptcy, unemployment, and starvation", followed by [...] "a new boom-depression sequence": Unless some counteracting cause comes along to prevent the fall in the price level, such a depression as that of 1929-33 (namely when the more the debtors pay the more they owe) tends to continue, going deeper, in a vicious spiral, for many years. There is then no tendency of the boat to stop tipping until it has capsized. Ultimately, of course, but only after almost universal bankruptcy, the indebtedness must cease to grow greater and begin to grow less. Then comes recovery and a tendency for a new boom-depression sequence. This is the so-called [...] "natural" [...] {{way out of a}} depression, via needless and cruel bankruptcy, unemployment, and starvation.On the other hand, if the foregoing analysis is correct, it is always economically possible to stop or prevent such a depression simply by reflating the price level up to the average level at which outstanding debts were contracted by existing debtors and assumed by existing creditors, and then maintaining that level unchanged.|$|E

The Conservatives were struggling with deep unpopularity over their economic policies.
