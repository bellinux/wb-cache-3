25|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>refined</b> <b>asphalt</b> is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., rubber tyres), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.|$|E
2500|$|Canadian bitumen {{does not}} differ {{substantially}} from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition, {{and the real}} difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and <b>refined</b> <b>asphalt</b> without any preprocessing. This is particularly common {{in areas such as}} the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline.

40|$|The on-site {{construction}} process undertaken by asphalt teams has a critical impact on pavement quality. Process improvement and learning require explicit {{information about the}} process. However, current on-site operational activities and key parameters are, in general, not systematically monitored and mapped. The lack of process information {{makes it difficult for}} contractors and asphalt teams to distinguish between good and poor practices and to improve. Although technologies to make the on-site process explicit are becoming widely available, their adoption has been slow. To overcome this knowledge gap regarding explicit information about the on-site {{construction process}}, this paper proposes a framework and utilizes technologies for the systematic monitoring and mapping of on-site activities and key parameters. Various technologies and sensors, such as a global positioning system (GPS), a laser linescanner, and infrared cameras, make it possible to track the on-site movements of machinery and asphalt temperatures during construction. This framework was applied and <b>refined</b> during 29 <b>asphalting</b> projects in the Netherlands, creating an extensive set of on-site process data. Considerable variability was found in the delivered asphalt temperatures, the asphalt cooling, the compaction process and density progression, and the movements of machinery. This variability offers opportunities where action could be taken to improve process quality by reducing process variability. The framework and explicit data can help asphalt teams to verbalize their tacit knowledge and make their own processes and choices transparent and further promotes learning processes. This paper contributes to {{a deeper understanding of the}} on-site construction process and highlights how to encourage technology adoption in constructio...|$|R
40|$|Oil {{and natural}} gas are {{important}} energy supply around the world. The exploring, drilling, transportation, and processing in oil-gas regions can release abundant volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To understand the atmospheric behaviors of VOCs in such region, the fifty-six VOCs designed as the photochemical precursors by the United State Environmental Protection Agency were continuously measured {{for an entire year}} (September 2014 –August 2015) by a set of on-line monitor system at an oil-gas station in northwest China. The VOC concentrations in this study were 1 – 50 times higher than those measured in many other urban and industrial regions. The VOC compositions were also different from other studies with alkanes contributing up to 87. 5  % of the total VOCs in this study. According to the propylene-equivalent concentration and maximum incremental reactivity method, alkanes were identified as the most important VOC groups to the ozone formation potential. The photochemical reaction, meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and wind speed) and boundary layer height were found to influence the temporal variations of VOCs at different time scales. The positive matrix factorization analysis showed that the natural gas, fuel evaporation, combustion sources, oil <b>refining</b> process, and <b>asphalt</b> contributed 62. 6  %, 21. 5  %, 10. 9  %, 3. 8  %, and 1. 3  %, respectively to the total VOCs on the annual average. Clear temporal variations differed from one source to another was observed, due to their differences in source emission strength and the influence of meteorological parameters. Potential source contribution function and contribution weighted trajectory models based on backward trajectories indicated that five identified sources had similar geographic origins. Raster analysis based on CWT analysis indicated that the local emissions contributed 48. 4  %– 74. 6  % to the VOCs. This research filled the gaps in understanding the VOCs in the oil-gas field region, where exhibited different source emission behaviors compared with the urban/industrial regions...|$|R
