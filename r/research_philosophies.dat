In depicting the philosophical status of the field we apply Orlikowski and Baroudi’s (1991) framework that classifies IS research as relying on a foundation of assumptions from either positivism, interpretivism or critical theory. We found the framework well suited for our review of the field, although we did not find any instances where critical theory had been used as the basic assumption in an IOS adoption study. Our findings show that there are several clear openings for contributions that apply new research perspectives to the field of IOS or combine multiple research perspectives for added insight into the dynamics of IOS adoption...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an auto-ethnographic, narrative {{account of the}} struggles we – as doctoral students working in a business school – experienced navigating the link between <b>research</b> <b>philosophy</b> and methodology. We focus on a popular philosophical perspective amongst doctoral students: critical realism. In particular, we use an illustrative example of how we sought to apply this seemingly abstract philosophical perspective in practice in our qualitative interviews, using what we term the ontological whats and epistemological hows. Our initial critical realist approach proved inadequate however, prompting us to understand qualitative interviewing in more social constructionist terms. Given this, we suggest that doctoral students (and researchers) are reflexive and provocative {{in their use of}} applying <b>research</b> <b>philosophy</b> to methodology.

40|$|Governments are {{investing}} in e-government to enhance public sector efficiency. It has been argued by e-government scholars that citizens’ demand for e-government does not meet expectations; hence governments might not achieve the expected benefits. This study investigates formative evaluation as a method to ensure e-government benefits realization. The case is ex-post evaluation of value from digital communication in a citizen service center at a Danish municipality and was conducted as Action Research. Barriers to adoption were revealed, addressed and eliminated during the formative evaluation process. Clear expectations from top management, assessments and disclosure of workers' behavior and commitment from managers proved pivotal in the benefits realization process. Further research into the internal e-government adoption processes and the impact from external factors is {{needed in order to}} understand more profoundly the challenges for realizing benefits from e-governmentThis paper presents a study of the development in leading egovernment papers from 2001 - 2010.

Moving from data to theory is commonly discussed in social constructionism with inductive approach and ideographic methods.
