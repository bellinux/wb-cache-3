40|$|Effects of Shallow Plowing Tools on the Soil Structural State and the Potatoes Crop Yield. Effects {{of three}} tillage tools (disc <b>harrow,</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>harrow</b> and rotary cultivator) on two {{physical}} characteristics of silt-sandy soil (resistance to the penetration Rp and voluminous mass Mv) {{and their potential}} influence on fresh matter and total yield of potato were studied at the experimental field of the Horticultural School, Chott-Mariem (Sousse). Results show that the three tools reduce the resistance penetration and the voluminous mass of soil tilled especially using disc harrow at 15 cm depth (Rp= 2. 8 daN/cm 2 and Mv= 1. 03 g/ cm 3) compared with non tilled soil (Rp= 11. 4 daN/cm 2, Mv= 1. 43 g/cm 3). Highest fresh matter yield was obtained (at 130 days) after soil ploughing with disc harrow showing an average increase of 33, 24, 18 and 15 % respectively for leaves, tubercles, stems and roots compared with other tools. Best tubercles yield was also reached using disc harrow showing an increase of 21 % and 24 % compared, respectively, to <b>teeth</b> <b>harrow</b> and rotary cultivator...|$|R

40|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War II {{augmented}} {{the necessity of}} utilizing agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s resources to the fullest extent in meeting increased food demands with reduced supplies of labor. One of the principal means of expanding production under such conditions is by fuller use of available farm machinery. Unfortunately, however, when a state of national emergency was declared in May, 1941, little was known either about the utilization of Iowa farm machinery or about the numbers of various types of machines available on the farms. To provide the needed information a survey was conducted in August and September of 1941 {{with the cooperation of}} the Work Projects Administration and the Agricultural Marketing Service.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of different soil tillage methods on crop yield and some yield components in chickpea cultivation. For this reason, experimental trials were performed in Çayköy and Güzelpınar in Tokat-Kazova during 2008, 2009 and 2010. In this trials Gökçe cultivar of chickpea was used. Six different soil tillage methods were applied which were, mouldboard plough tillage in fall + cultivator in the spring + <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> (Method A), mouldboard plough tillage in spring + cultivator + <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> (Method B), rotary tiller in the spring (Method C), chisel in the spring + disc harrow and slider (Method D), strip tillage with router rotary hoe (Method E) and direct seeding (Method F). Trials were set up in completely randomized block design with three replications. The results indicated that the highest average plant and seed yield per square meter was obtained with method A (470. 74 g and 260. 63 g) and followed by method B (459. 43 g and 254. 18 g) and method D (447. 82 g and 247. 23 g).

40|$|There is a {{need for}} in-situ soil {{moisture}} conservation in arid and semi-arid regions due to insufficient rainfall for agriculture. For this purpose, a combination implement [integrated reservoir tillage system (RT) ] comprised of a single-row chisel plow, single-row spike <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow,</b> modified seeder, and spiked roller was developed and compared to the popular tillage practices, viz., minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT) in an arid Mediterranean environment in Egypt. The different tillage practices were conducted at tillage depths of 15, 20, and 25 cm and forward speeds of 0. 69, 1, 1. 25, and 1. 53 m s- 1. Some soil physical properties, runoff, soil loss, water harvesting efficiency and yield of wheat were evaluated. The different tillage practices caused significant differences in soil physical properties as the RT increased soil infiltration, producing a rate of 48...|$|R
40|$|Low {{efficiency}} and substandard machines are common problems in agricultural mechanization in most developing countries.

Field performance of NPRT, power rotary tiller (PRT) and traditional comb <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> (CTH) were compared. Results showed that highest pulverization was attained by PRT due to higher power transmitted directly from the engine to the rotary blades. Soil water content and bulk density were inversely proportional with tillage passes in all tested implements. PRT attained highest temperature diurnal wave than NPRT and CTH on soil surface and highly affected as the ambient temperature changes due to porous and looseness of the soil. Pulverization and mixing of clods had maximized the exposure of the lower layers to solar radiation and evaporation process and reducing soil moisture and bulk density...|$|R

Plant emergence and harvesting properties investigated were mean emergence dates, emerged rate index, percentage of emerged seedling, plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield. Soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance varied from 24. 39 to 25. 42 %, and from 1. 24 to 1. 33 g/cm 3, and from 0. 58 to 1. 60 MPa, at 0 - 10 cm soil depth respectively; the same properties varied from 24. 65 to 25. 95 %, and from 1. 25 to 1. 34 g/cm 3, and from 0. 95 to 1. 60 MPa, at 10 - 20 cm soil depth respectively. For plant properties; mean emerged dates, emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged varied from 12. 80 to 12. 85 days, and from 0. 335 to 0. 346 seedling/m day, and from 86. 11 to 88. 61, respectively. Plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield varied from 244. 7 to 266. 2 cm, from 2. 88 to 3. 13 cm, from 7525. 89 to 7580. 80 kg/da, and from 1523. 36 to 1534. 35 kg/da, respectively. The results indicated that soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance in conservational tillage system were higher than the conventional tillage system. Ridge planting system yielded higher values {{than that of the}} flat planting system. The emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged seedling in conservational tillage and flat planting systems were lower than conventional tillage and ridge planting system.

40|$|A wheat {{stubble field}} (clay-loam, light alkali; light salty and poor of organic matter) was {{established}} to carry out an experiment at Gökhöyük Agricultural Institute, Turkey. Effects of three different tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage on penetration resistance, emergence time, shooting degree and yield were investigated. Conventional tillage used a moldboard plough for primary tilling and a combined spring tine cultivator-spike <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> for consecutive secondary tilling. Reduced tillage included only a cultivator-tooth harrow combination. No-tillage was accomplished by a direct (stubble) drill. Although the earliest emergence time (17 day) and the highest emergence degree (66. 5 %) were obtained, yield was the lowest in no-tillage system. The highest penetration resistance (53. 71 kg cm - 2) was measured in no-tillage system. Reduced and no tillage systems could be proposed for Gökhöyük region if alternative solutions is found to prevent soil compaction and reduce mechanical impedance in root growth zone. Long-term investigations were suggested {{based on the results}} of this study in order to better understanding of the effects of the tillage systems on crop growth and yield for the region...|$|R

As the early 2WTs did not have steering clutches, longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, steering clutches were provided on many companies' models.

Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can drive a rotary tiller and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, maize shellers etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|R
