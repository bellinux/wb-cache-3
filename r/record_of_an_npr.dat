50|$|In 2015, Harris and {{her company}} {{were also the}} subject <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>NPR</b> {{interview}} {{on the process of}} looping, or automated dialogue replacement, in the film industry. In discussing her preparation for a project, she explained that she views the finished footage, takes notes, determines the number of voice actors that will be required and then provides those actors with direction. She also gives them information on the kind of research they will be asked to prepare in order to lend authenticity to the scenes they will be shooting.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} descriptive case {{study was to identify}} features of nurse-patient interactions (NPI) in the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nurse-patient relation-ship (<b>NPR).</b> Observations <b>of</b> interactions in <b>a</b> cancer treatment unit included 60 videotaped, sequential, naturally occurring NPIs involving one dyad over a 3 -day period. <b>A</b> microanalysis <b>of</b> the interactions was conducted using qualita-tive ethological methods. The analysis focused on identifying important recur-ring behavioral clusters and characteristic patterns of behavior that comprised these clusters. Important features of NPIs in the development <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>NPR</b> were identified and described in detail. The active and complementary roles of both participants in this process and the contribution of social exchange, trust, and humor are highlighted. The findings illustrate the importance of continuity of nursing care if NPRs are to be used to their fullest extent to address complex pa-tient care needs...|$|R
30|$|NPR {{interest}} by {{the scientific community}} has shown noticeable growth in the 1990 s. Some examples that support this observation are: (i) the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dedicated <b>NPR</b> section at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques (ACM-SIGGRAPH) event in 1998; (ii) the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dedicated <b>NPR</b> section in the 1999 Eurographics Conference; and especially (iii) {{the emergence of the}} first symposium dedicated exclusively to the NPR theme—the Non-photorealistic Animation and Rendering in 2000  [34]. Another milestone is the publication of two textbooks that addresses the topic, authored by Gooch and Gooch [19] and Strothotte and Schlechtweg [55].|$|R

30|$|The NPR {{prototype}} can {{be designed}} using, among others, window-based techniques [26] or the frequency sampling approach [27, 28]. In the studies described here, the prototype is obtained using the latter method, in which the filter impulse response is obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of the desired frequency response at certain frequency locations. The design <b>of</b> such <b>an</b> <b>NPR</b> prototype filter under different optimization criteria has been addressed in [24].|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Xiaolu Guo {{published}} the novel I Am China, that {{she describes as}} [...] "a parallel story about two Chinese lovers in exile - the external and internal exile that I had felt since leaving China". In the book, the London-based literary translator Iona Kirkpatrick discovers <b>a</b> story <b>of</b> romance and revolution as she translates <b>a</b> collection <b>of</b> letters and diaries by a Chinese punk musician named Kublai Jian. Unbeknownst to Iona, Jian has come to Britain seeking political asylum, while another character, Mu, is in Beijing trying to track him down. As the translator tracks Jian and Mu's twenty-year relationship, she develops <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> purpose in deciding to bring Jian and Mu together again {{before it is too}} late.

40|$|Citrus canker is {{a devastating}} disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac).   The NPR 1 gene plays {{a pivotal role}} in {{systemic}} acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis.   We report the isolation and characterization <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 homolog from citrus, namely Citrus NPR 1 homolog 1 (CtNH 1).   When over-expressed in citrus, CtNH 1 confers resistance to Xac and leads to constitutive expression of the pathogenesis-related (PR) gene chitinase 1 (Chi 1), suggesting that CtNH 1 is orthologous to NPR 1.   In addition, we recently identified two closely-related citrus genes, named Xbct 31 and Xbct 32.   Database searching and sequence analyses reveals that other plant species, including rice, Arabidopsis, tomato, and Nicotiana benthamiana, contain homologs of these two citrus genes and they share high levels of sequence identity at the amino acid level.   When overexpressed in Nicotiana benthamiana via Agrobacterium infiltration-mediated transient expression, the citrus genes as well as their closely-related homologs from rice and Arabidopsis all trigger (HR) -like cell death hypersensitive response.   Since HR is often associated with resistance (R) gene-mediated immunity, our data suggests Xbct 3 s represent <b>a</b> family <b>of</b> evolutionarily conserved defense regulators and could be used to heighten defense against citrus diseases including greening and canker...|$|R
