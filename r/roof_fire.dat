The Koç Foundation bought the first museum building in 1991, which was left derelict and seriously damaged after a <b>roof</b> <b>fire</b> in 1984. This building (in Turkish: Lengerhane), was initially used for casting anchors and chains for the Ottoman navy, during the rule of Ahmet III (1703-1730). It was restored {{during the reign of}} Selim III (1789-1807) before passing into the ownership of Ministry of Finance in the Ottoman Empire. During the Republican era, the State Monopoly and Tobacco Co. then used the building as a warehouse until 1951.

In some European countries the number of <b>roof</b> <b>fire</b> is very high and they affect also certified chimneys, that is, tested following the prescription of the related standards. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight that the certification procedure does not allow to test chimneys in the worst condition, therefore, chimney installed following the manufacturer prescriptions may in some cases cause the overheating and subsequent <b>roof</b> <b>fire.</b> To do this, experimental tests have been performed for measuring the temperature on roofs in the vicinity of a certified chimney.

40|$|ABSTRACT In many situations, the Brazilian Legislation {{does not}} require verifying roof {{structures}} in a fire, since their failure will not endanger {{the stability of the}} structure. In fire, the steel roof of an industrial building deforms by heating in geometry similar to a catenary, resulting in horizontal forces in the upper extremities of the columns. Thus, even roofs that do not constitute a frame with the columns may lead them to collapse, and should therefore be protected against fire. Due to the small dimensions of the structural elements of the <b>roof,</b> <b>fire</b> coating is uneconomical. There is thus a problem in the design practice. A procedure based on the British literature in which horizontal load is considered in the columns is presented in this paper. Columns and foundations must support that load. That load should be determined and the columns should be checked for fire situation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} detail this procedure, adapt it to Brazilian standards and apply it to a case study...|$|E
