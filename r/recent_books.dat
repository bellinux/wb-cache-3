500|$|Historians who penned {{biographies of}} Stevens {{in the late}} 1930s sought {{to move away from}} this perspective, seeking to {{rehabilitate}} him and his political career. [...] Thomas F. Woodley wrote of Stevens in 1937, and while his work shows admiration of Stevens, he attributed Stevens's driving force to bitterness over his clubfoot. [...] Alphonse Miller, in his 1939 biography, found that the former congressman was motivated by a desire for justice. [...] Both men were convinced that <b>recent</b> <b>books</b> had not treated him fairly. [...] Richard Current's 1942 work reflected current Beardian historiography, which saw all American history, including Reconstruction, as a three-way economic struggle between the industrialists of the Northeast (represented by Stevens), the planters of the South, and the farmers of the Midwest. Current argued that Stevens was motivated in his Reconstruction policies by frustrated ambitions and a desire to use his political position to promote industrial capitalism and advance the Republican Party. He concluded that despite Stevens's egalitarian beliefs, he actually promoted inequality, for [...] "none had done more than he to bring on the age of Big Business, with its concentration of wealth." ...|$|E
