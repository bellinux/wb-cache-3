He was four games pitched behind teammate Dale Polley for the International League lead. He made his major league debut in rough form on May 30, relieving Ramiro Mendoza with two on and one out against the Red Sox. He promptly served up back-to-back home runs to Wil Cordero and Mo Vaughn, the first two batters he faced. An inning later, Scott Hatteberg added another homer. He had allowed 3 runs in 1 IP, all on homers. He returned to Columbus but {{came back to the}} Yankees for a game late in the year, replacing Hideki Irabu with one on and one out in the 7th inning on September 5. He allowed three straight singles, bringing in one inherited runner and one another score.

50|$|By {{the rules}} of baseball, a runner {{has the right to}} an {{unobstructed}} path to a base. However, this right is not granted if the fielder guarding the base possesses the ball or {{is in the process of}} catching the ball. The fielders guarding first base through third base are unlikely to risk physical harm and will generally place themselves out of the path of the runner. The catcher guarding home plate, however, wears padding and a face mask and often placed his body as an obstacle between the <b>runner</b> and home <b>plate,</b> even prior to receiving the ball. Since the runner did not have to worry about remaining on home plate, only tagging it, he typically ran at full speed in an effort to reach the plate. The speed of the runner combined with the fact that the catcher still had to tag him (unless the bases were loaded and a force play at home was still available) often resulted in violent collisions.|$|R
5000|$|Molina's {{first chance}} in the Major Leagues arrived when {{incumbent}} Matheny went {{on the disabled list}} (DL) with a strained rib in the Cardinals' pennant-winning season of 2004.

He stroked a broken-bat single to shallow center field {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning against the New York Mets. On the play, the center fielder, Mike Cameron started towards the outfield wall based on Molina's full swing, not immediately realizing that he had made only partial contact because of the broken bat. By the time Cameron charged the ball, it was too late; it fell in for a hit, and Jim Edmonds was able to score.

Then, in , they nearly upset the Yankees, winning 95 games and finishing second, three games behind. A fluke botched double play was the team's undoing. Late in September at Cleveland, the Indians had the bases loaded in the tenth inning with one out and the score tied. Visibility was poor because smoke from Canadian forest fires was blowing across Lake Erie. On an apparent 3-2-3 double-play grounder to first base, Detroit catcher Aaron Robinson thought he simply needed to touch home plate for a force play to retire the Indians baserunner charging in from third. But in the smoky conditions Robinson had not seen that a putout had already been made at first base, necessitating that the catcher tag the <b>runner,</b> not the <b>plate,</b> to record an out. Robinson mistakenly tagged the plate, the run counted and Cleveland won the game. It was the turning point in the pennant race, for the postwar Tigers, and for Rolfe's managerial career.|$|R
50|$|Game 5 {{would be}} the pivotal game as the Phillies went up 3 games to 2. The game was {{scoreless}} until the fourth when Mike Schmidt hit a two-run bomb to right-center. The red-hot Amos Otis led the Royals back with another homer, and by the sixth, K.C. was in front 3-2. After the Phillies threw out a K.C. <b>runner</b> at the <b>plate</b> to keep the game a one-run affair, they marched to victory by coming back in the ninth. Schmidt led off the inning with a single, and Del Unser drove him home {{all the way from}} first with a double down the right-field line. After a bunt moved Unser to third, Manny Trillo drove in the go-ahead run with a line shot that ricocheted off pitcher Dan Quisenberry for an infield hit. In the bottom of the ninth, the Royals threatened by loading the bases with two out. The Royals Stadium crowd were standing hoping for a dramatic K.C. win. But Tug McGraw silenced the crowd by striking out José Cardenal with a high fastball to end the game.|$|R

5000|$|No run can be scored {{during the}} same {{continuous}} playing action as a force out for the third out, even if a <b>runner</b> reaches home <b>plate</b> before the third out is recorded. As a result, on a batted ball with two outs, fielders will nearly always ignore a runner trying to score, attempting instead to force out the batter or another runner. For example, suppose there are runners on first and third with one out. The batter hits a ground ball to the second baseman. The second baseman, seeing the bumper-carred runner on first heading his way, retrieves the ball and steps on second {{to get him out}} on the force out for the second out of the inning. If the runner on third had meanwhile run home and touched home plate, his run would count. But suppose the same play happened with two players out. The second baseman, seeing the bumper-carred runner on first heading his way, retrieves the ball and steps on second to get him out on the force play for the third out of the inning. If the runner on third had meanwhile run home and touched home plate, that run would not have counted. [...] Note that the 2nd baseman, tagging such a forced runner coming from first for the 3rd out, also prevents scoring by the speedy runner from third as this tag is considered a force out.|$|R
40|$|Drug {{discovery}} screenings {{performed on}} zebrafish embryos mirror {{with a high}} level of accuracy. The tests usually performed on mammalian animal models, and the fish embryo toxicity assay (FET) is one of the most promising alternative approaches to acute ecotoxicity testing with adult fish. Notwithstanding this, conventional methods utilising 96 -well microtiter plates and manual dispensing of fish embryos are very time-consuming. They rely on laborious and iterative manual pipetting that is a main source of analytical errors and low throughput. In this work, we present development of a miniaturised and high-throughput Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) platform for automation of FET assays. The 3 D high-density LOC array was fabricated in poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) transparent thermoplastic using infrared laser micromachining while the off-chip interfaces were fabricated using additive manufacturing processes (FDM and SLA). The system&# 039;s design facilitates rapid loading and immobilization of a large number of embryos in predefined clusters of traps during continuous microperfusion of drugs/toxins. It has been conceptually designed to seamlessly interface with both upright and inverted fluorescent imaging systems and also to directly interface with conventional microtiter plate readers that accept 96 -well plates.

40|$|The present work {{focused on}} running when leaping over an obstacle, {{ranging from a}} little barrier to a high hurdle, in {{recreational}} runners (RR) and trained athletes (TA) and at different speeds. Four studies were performed from a global to a segmental approach. Experiments were realised on a 33 m long running track equipped with a 13 m long force <b>plate.</b> <b>Runners</b> were filmed by a high-speed camera. Results show that the velocity of progression increases from the fourth to the second step before the barrier, depending on the obstacle height, approaching velocity and level of expertise of the runner (RR vs TA). Moreover, we founded that the bouncing mechanism of running is modified during the two steps immediately preceding the barrier. During the contact period two steps before the barrier, a decrease of the torsional stiffness {{at the level of}} the knee and of the ankle induces a decrease of the leg-spring stiffness (kleg). Consequently the centre of mass of the runner (COM) is accelerated forward while remaining lower compared to steady-state running. During the last step before the barrier, the runner places the foot, from which he takes off, well in front of the body. During the contact, the increase of the torsional stiffness {{at the level of the}} knee and of the ankle induces an increase of the kleg. Consequently the COM is decelerated forward and elevated. During this phase, the leg-spring stores elastic energy and changes the direction of the velocity vector to release this energy in a vertical direction. The same strategy is used by TA and RR to cross an obstacle. However, TA optimise the mechanism of jumping by reducing the loss in the velocity of progression when crossing the obstacle and by limiting the vertical trajectory of the COM.

50|$|The shortstop fields all balls hit to {{the infield}} between {{the second and}} third bases. This {{individual}} also helps cover second and third bases, is frequently involved in force plays and double plays, and often throws the ball to the catcher to throw out <b>runners</b> at home <b>plate.</b> On steals to second base (when the runner from first is advancing to second on the pitch) the shortstop usually covers. The shortstop doesn't cover second base only when a right handed batter is up. In this case, the second baseman covers the steal. Most short stops are very quick, agile and think fast. Shortstops may play in a restricted zone but are faced with many types of hits and interact closely with the 2nd base, 3rd base and home plate. Often double plays are due to quick thinking/reaction by the short stop. When a ball is hit up the middle and the shortstop catches it, they will flip the ball to the second baseman for the best result. Shortstop also takes the cut off for the left field when the play is at second base. When the ball is hit to {{the right side of the}} outfield, the short stop then covers second base. If there is a runner on first base and there is a hit down the line or in the gap to right field, the shortstop will then go for the cut to third. Meaning the runner that is going from first to second will most likely be advancing to third, and in that case, the shortstop will be the cut off for the throw from right field to third base. Shortstop can be one of the most difficult positions to play due to the amount of balls being hit in that direction.|$|R
