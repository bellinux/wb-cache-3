Talmud Torah Anshei Emes's membership was mostly made up of Eastern European Jews, who were stricter in their observances than Baith Israel's mostly German-origin membership; to accommodate them, a special all-men section of pews was designated at the front left of the sanctuary.|$|E

Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> has grown from the original 23 shotgun houses on 2 blocks to about 50 buildings on 8 blocks. Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> is internationally recognized and Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times said that Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> [...] "may be the most impressive and visionary public art project in the country."

5|$|After {{seeing a}} Bad Brains concert, MacKaye and Nelson began {{playing in a}} punk band, the Slinkees, with school friends Grindle and Mark Sullivan. The Slinkees played a single show before Sullivan went to college. After a failed attempt to recruit MacKaye's friend Henry Garfield (later Henry Rollins), the band added Strejcek as the vocalist. The Slinkees soon renamed {{themselves}} the Teen Idles. After touring and practicing for several months, the band recorded two demo sessions at a local studio in February and April 1980, despite the engineer and a visiting band openly laughing as they recorded. They also began playing at house parties and pizza parlors, and opened for Bad Brains at an art gallery, in a dilapidated <b>row</b> <b>house</b> in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, called Madam's Organ.|$|E

50|$|Bolton Hill {{is named}} after the estate of George Grundy, who named his estate house after Bolton le Moors, which was located {{at the site of}} the current Fifth Regiment Armory. Around 1850, the area began to {{transition}} from large estate to traditional baltimore <b>row</b> <b>houses,</b> which were built along a diagonal street grid, unlike the traditional north-south grid of most Baltimore neighborhoods. This grid was constructed by Thomas Poppleton to follow now Pennsylvania Avenue and the Jones Falls. Early <b>row</b> <b>houses</b> featured plain brick facades with decorative cornices, door surrounds, and window lintels. Later <b>row</b> <b>houses</b> features more ornate designs.

Ferry service linking Manhattan and Brooklyn launched in 1814, and Brooklyn's population exploded from 4,000 to nearly 100,000 by 1850. Fort Greene was known as The Hill and was home to a small commuter population, several large farms—the Post Farm, the Spader farm, the Ryerson Farm, and the Jackson farm—and a burial ground. As early as the 1840s the farms' owners began selling off their land in smaller plots for development.

25|$|By 1870, {{stone and}} brick had become firmly {{established}} as the building materials of choice, as {{the construction of}} wood-frame houses had been greatly limited {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Fire of 1835. Unlike Paris, which for centuries was built from its own limestone bedrock, New York has always drawn its building stone from a network of quarries, sometimes quite distant, which is evident in the variety of textures and hues of stone seen in the city's buildings. In the days before rail, stones were floated down the Hudson River or along the Atlantic Seaboard from pits in New England. While trains brought marble from Vermont and granite from Minnesota, it was Connecticut brownstone that was so popular in the construction of New York's row homes in the late 19th century that the term brownstone became synonymous with <b>row</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
