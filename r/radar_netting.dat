This system topology offers many advantages over traditional monostatic and bistatic systems which use a single transmitter {{and a single}} receiver. For example, it provides better utilization of reflected energy, more flexible system arrangement and enhanced information retrieval capability. Therefore, the <b>netted</b> <b>radar</b> system is of emerging interests among radar researchers. This work investigates several fundamental aspects that determine <b>netted</b> <b>radar</b> performance.

30|$|Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar {{is a kind}} of multi-static radar, but it is {{different}} from the previous multi-static <b>radar</b> or <b>netted</b> <b>radar</b> [1, 2]. For the previous multi-static <b>radar</b> and <b>netted</b> <b>radar</b> system, each radar works independently, transmitting the local processing results to the CPU for information fusion. However, the distributed MIMO radar can fuse the echo information detected by each beam while the signal is being transmitted and received, which is equivalent to data fusion at the original signal level. MIMO radar systems can offer enhanced target detection and localization capability by spatial multichannel [3 – 5]. While distributed MIMO radar systems have advantages on the extended target model and multiple targets monitoring by viewing the targets from different angles [6]. Meanwhile, with the development of stealth technology, the distributed MIMO radar systems are widely studied for the detection of stealth targets. Therefore, distributed MIMO radar systems become the research hotspot in the field of radar technology. The advantages of distributed MIMO radar lies in its flexible signal design and optimized system structure. In fact, transmitted parameters and antenna configuration can be regarded as system resources. Therefore, the research of distributed MIMO radar should mainly focus on the problem of resource allocation. In practical application, the radar resources may be limited. For the better system performance, it is necessary to improve the resource utilization in the multiple tasks system [7 – 12]. In this case, the resource allocation problem of distributed MIMO radar becomes a hot topic, especially for the problem of power allocation in low probability of interception (LPI) system [13, 14]. In the war of multiple target tracking [15], although target location is the mainly concerned parameter, target velocity estimation can {{have a significant effect on}} state prediction, which can further determine resource allocation results. Once the estimation error of target velocity is larger, especially for the target at a high speed, the predicted target state with estimation error will fail to obtain an optimal allocation result. Considering the variability and uncertainty of target velocity, the resource allocation problem of multiple targets velocity estimation of distributed MIMO radar is worth studying.|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} data from highly {{resolved}} tower-turntable ISAR measurements this paper investigates the influence of camouflage on the ATR performance. The recognition process {{is based on a}} template matching method. The two-dimensional templates are generated by extracting the most robust scatterers from the RCS image. Based on data sets of ISAR tower-turntable measurements, this paper shows the potential effect of some different camouflage methods on the ATR performace of a HR X band radar system. Camouflage by covering the target with birch branches is as well tested as occlusion by <b>radar</b> <b>nets.</b> Of course, a significant attenuation of the radar signal by the coverage of the target is precondition for affecting the ATR performance. This given, the degree of occlusion determines the impact on the reconnaissance, or other wise regarded, the applied ATR system shows a good robustness, if the target is only partially occluded. Additionaly, tests are undertaken to investigate the influence of multi-path effects by a reflecting ground. Here also, a remarkable effect on the ATR performance can be observed, depending on the degree of coverage of the target surrounding area. Finally, for complemantary a decoy designed for optical and infra-red application is tested with a classifier trained on the origin target. There, no deception of our ATR system can be observed. ...|$|R

Transmitted signal of each station is assigned a unique Pseudo Noise (PN) code and all the PN codes from different stations are orthogonal. Because of the good autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties, mutual interference becomes weaker and signals from different stations could be separated by the preassigned PN codes and several radar stations can be active simultaneously. At the same time, the spectrum of the emission signal is spreaded, the Peak-to-mean Envelope Power Ratio (PMEPR) and the intercepted probability of the signals descend therefore.

[...] This was done by equipping two wings of Lockheed RC-121 Warning Star aircraft, the 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, based at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, and the 552nd AEWCW, based at McClellan Air Force Base, California, one wing stationed on each coast. [...] The RC-121s, EC-121s and Texas Towers, it was believed, would contribute to extending contiguous east-coast radar coverage some 300 to 500 miles seaward. In terms of the air threat of the 1950s, this meant a gain of at least 30 extra minutes warning time of an oncoming bomber attack.	ADC's Operation Tail Wind on 11–12 July tested its augmentation plan that required Air Training Command interceptors participate in an air defense emergency.
