40|$|The 5 -HT 2 {{receptor}} antagonist, <b>ritanserin,</b> reduces {{alcohol intake}} in rats and the nucleus accumbens (NAC) {{has been proposed}} as a site of action for the drug.

The present study evaluated, in genetically heterogeneous rats with developed preference for 3 % ethanol, whether the attenuation of ethanol intake induced by <b>ritanserin</b> might be related to its effect on the synaptic availability of 5 -HT in the NAC. Damaging 5 -HTergic neurons by intracerebroventricular infusion of 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine (5, 7 -DHT) abolished the effect of <b>ritanserin</b> on ethanol consumption.

40|$|Serotonergic {{mechanisms}} {{have recently}} been implicated in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension; this suggests that blockade of serotonin S 2 receptors may be a new approach for the pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of <b>ritanserin,</b> a selective S 2 -serotonergic antagonist, in portal-hypertensive rats whose condition was due to partial portal vein ligation. The animals were randomized under double-blind conditions into two groups: the first received <b>ritanserin</b> (0. 7 mg/kg body wt, intravenously), and the second received the same volume of placebo (isotonic saline solution). The hemodynamic studies were performed using radiolabeled microspheres 60 min after drug administration. <b>Ritanserin</b> administration significantly reduced portal pressure (from 11. 8 +/- 0. 8 mm Hg to 9. 4 +/- 0. 6 mm Hg; p less than 0. 05). This was associated with lower portocollateral resistance (1. 8 +/- 0. 2 mm Hg/ml/min 100 gm in the <b>ritanserin</b> group vs. 2. 3 +/- 0. 2 mm Hg/ml/min 100 gm in rats receiving placebo; not significant), but we saw no changes in portal-vein inflow (5. 5 +/- 0. 7 ml/min 100 gm vs. 5. 4 +/- 0. 5 ml/min 100 gm), mean arterial pressure (95. 9 +/- 3. 5 mm Hg vs. 94. 0 +/- 4. 0 mm Hg) and cardiac index (31. 9 +/- 3. 5 ml/min 100 gm vs. 28. 5 +/- 2. 6 ml/min 100 gm). Hepatic arterial and kidney blood flows were not modified by <b>ritanserin.</b> In summary, our results demonstrate that <b>ritanserin</b> infusion decreases portal pressure without causing systemic hemodynamic changes.

40|$|Abstract Background Bipolar {{disorder}} {{is a lifelong}} episodic condition characterized by mood swings between mania and depression. Several lines of evidence suggest that serotonin is likely to play {{a pivotal role in}} the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. <b>Ritanserin,</b> a 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist, has been reported to have antipsychotic activity. In this 6 -week double blind, placebo controlled study involving moderate to severe manic patients, we assessed the effects of <b>ritanserin</b> plus haloperidol in combination with lithium. Methods 45 patients aged between 21 – 43 were eligible to participate as they met the DSM-IV criteria for a current manic episode, {{on the basis of a}} clinical interview by an academician psychiatrist. In addition, a score of at least 20 points on the Young Mania rating Scale was required representing moderate to severe mania. Patients were randomly allocated lithium (1 – 1. 2 mEq/L) + haloperidol (10 mg/day) + <b>ritanserin</b> (10 mg/day) (Group A) or lithium (1 – 1. 2 mEq/L) + haloperidol (10 mg/day) + placebo (Group B) for a 6 -week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were assessed by a third year psychiatry resident at baseline and 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after the medication started. All patients entered the hospital were not previously under any medication. The mean decrease in the Young Mania Rating Scale score from baseline was used as the main outcome measure of response of mania to treatment. The extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale. Side effects were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist. Results Young Mania Rating Scale total scores improved with <b>ritanserin.</b> The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of group and the between-subjects factor (F = 5. 02, d. f. = 1, P = 0. 03). The means Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale scores for the placebo group were higher than the <b>ritanserin</b> group and the difference was significant in day 42. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant Conclusions The efficacy of <b>ritanserin</b> to obtain a better improvement in patients with mania seems to support the 5 -HT hypothesis of bipolar disorder. </p...|$|E
40|$|The exact {{relationship}} between depression and chronic headache remains unclear. Considerable clinical and pharmacological evidence suggests {{the existence of}} a common biological terrain. Many antidepressant drugs are effective in the treatment of migraine and chronic headache disorders. <b>Ritanserin,</b> a new very selective serotonin- 2 (5 -HT 2) antagonist, has recently shown both analgesic and antidepressant properties. The present study compares in a double-blind design, the effectiveness of <b>ritanserin</b> and amitriptyline, a well-known antidepressant extensively used in migraine prophylaxis. Thirty-eight patients (30 females and 8 males ranging in age from 20 to 50 yrs) were classified according to the International Headache Society criteria as: patients with chronic tension-type headache (CTH) (11 cases) and patients with coexisting migraine and CTH (MCTH) (27 cases). Only patients with a score equal to or higher than 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) were included. <b>Ritanserin</b> was highly effective in reducing Pain Total Index and analgesic consumption in chronic headache, and its activity was similar to that observed during amitriptyline treatment. A significant improvement of HRSD and HRSA (Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety) scores was observed during both treatments. The main results of our study concern the demonstration of antiheadache and antidepressive properties of <b>ritanserin.</b> To better define the profile of the patients and their clinical responsiveness to the treatment, dexamethasone suppression test, clonidine test and nociceptive flexion reflex were investigated in our patients.

The published article can be found at: [URL] The significance of the serotonergic system in bone physiology and, more specifically, {{the importance of the}} five hydroxytryptamine receptor 2 A (5 HTR 2 A) in normal osteoblast proliferation have been previously described; however the role of serotonin in osteosarcoma remains unclear. Particularly, the expression and function of 5 HTR 2 A in canine osteosarcoma has not yet been studied, thus we sought to determine if this indoleamine modulates cellular proliferation in vitro. Using real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunoblot analyses, we explored receptor expression and signaling differences between non-neoplastic canine osteoblasts (CnOb) and an osteosarcoma cell line (COS). To elucidate specific serotonergic signaling pathways triggered by 5 HTR 2 A, we performed immunoblots for ERK and CREB. Finally, we compared cell viability and the induction of apoptosis in the presence 5 HTR 2 A agonists and antagonists. RESULTS: 5 HTR 2 A was overexpressed in the malignant cell line in comparison to normal cells. In CnOb cells, ERK phosphorylation (ERK-P) decreased in response to both serotonin and a specific 5 HTR 2 A antagonist, <b>ritanserin.</b> In contrast, ERK-P abundance increased in COS cells following either treatment. While endogenous CREB was undetectable in CnOb, CREB was observed constitutively in COS, with expression and exhibited increased CREB phosphorylation following escalating concentrations of <b>ritanserin.</b> To determine the influence of 5 HTR 2 A signaling on cell viability we challenged cells with <b>ritanserin</b> and serotonin. Our findings confirmed that serotonin treatment promoted cell viability in malignant cells but not in normal osteoblasts. Conversely, <b>ritanserin</b> reduced cell viability in both the normal and osteosarcoma cells. Further, <b>ritanserin</b> induced apoptosis in COS at the same concentrations associated with decreased cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the existence of a functional 5 HTR 2 A in a canine osteosarcoma cell line.

Single-dose infusions of 5 -HT (1, 10, and 80 ng/kg/min) and of the 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist <b>ritanserin</b> (50, 150, and 500 ng/kg/min) were administered into the brachial artery. Subsequently, the relative arterial and venous effects of the highest dose of 5 -HT were investigated. Forearm blood flow (FBF) and maximum venous outflow (MVO) were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Heart rate (HR) and intraarterial (i. a.) blood pressure were recorded semicontinuously. In both age groups, 5 -HT induced an initial transient arterial dilation, followed by a persistent increase in FBF for the doses of 1 and 10 ng/kg/min and a relative small decrease in FBF for the highest dose. In both age groups, the highest dose of 5 -HT induced a similar large reduction in MVO (p less than 0. 05 for both). The reduction in MVO was attenuated by <b>ritanserin</b> (500 ng/kg/min, p less than 0. 05 for both groups). In the younger subjects, this dose of <b>ritanserin</b> also unmasked an arterial dilator effect of the highest dose of 5 -HT (p less than 0. 05). The single infusions of <b>ritanserin</b> did not influence FBF significantly in either study group. No significant differences were observed between the age groups. These results show that in the forearm of healthy subjects arterial and venous vascular responses to 5 -HT were not age-related.

40|$|Ten years ago, the {{rediscovery of}} the {{atypical}} antipsychotic drug clozapine represented a breakthrough {{for the treatment}} of schizophrenia. Clozapine, among several other actions, potently antagonises serotonin (5 -HT) 2 receptors, and thus, {{it has been suggested that}} a truly selective 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist may exert antipsychotic efficacy on its own. However, <b>ritanserin,</b> a selective 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist, appeared active mainly against the negative (and depressive) symptoms of schizophrenia, with less effect on the positive symptom cluster. Clozapine and <b>ritanserin</b> block all three 5 -HT 2 receptor subtypes, ie the 5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 2 C receptors; the relative contribution to the therapeutic effect of antagonism at each subtype is not well-known. To address this issue we studied M 100907, the first highly selective and potent antagonist at 5 -HT 2 A receptors, in a hypoglutamatergia rodent model of schizophrenia. Based on the prevailing hypothesis that a glutamatergic deficiency is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, mice or rats were rendered hypoglutamatergic by means of acute systemic injections of MK- 801, an un-competitive antagonist of the glutamatergic NMDA receptor. We argue that the hyperlocomotion induced by MK- 801 is related to positive symptoms/acute episodes of schizophrenia. Effects on spontaneous locomotion of drug-naive rodents were measured to detect non-specific interactions with locomotor activity. Postmortem brain tissue or perfusates from in vivo microdialysis were analysed for monoamine levels. M 100907 potently abolished MK- 801 -induced hyperlocomotion with no or minor reductions of spontaneous locomotion. Although <b>ritanserin</b> and M 100907 have equal in vitro and in vivo potencies as 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonists, <b>ritanserin</b> displayed a 100 -fold lower potency with regard to inhibition of MK- 801 -induced hyperlocomotion. This enigma was resolved by experiments where <b>ritanserin</b> was found to markedly counteract M 100907 s inhibitory effect on MK- 801 -treated hyperlocomotion. This effect of <b>ritanserin</b> was probably mediated by antagonism at 5 -HT 2 B/C receptors since similar, albeit weaker, effects were obtained with the selective 5 -HT 2 B/C receptor antagonist SB 206553. Further, in rats, spontaneous locomotion was significantly enhanced by <b>ritanserin,</b> accompanied by elevations in 3 -MT in the striatum and limbic regions. MK- 801 increased brain serotonin metabolism in rats and mice, and the levels of cortical 5 -HIAA in MK- 801 -treated mice were positively correlated to locomotor activity. However, neurochemically verified depletion of serotonin by means of pretreatment with the 5 -HT synthesis inhibitor PCPA, did only reduce MK- 801 induced hyperlocomotion slightly (on average 17 %). At the same time, the inhibitory effect of M 100907 (as well as low doses of clozapine or olanzapine) on MK- 801 -induced hyperlocomotion was abolished by PCPA pretreatment; the effect of M 100907 was reinstated by acute administration of the 5 -HT precursor 5 -HTP or the 5 -HT 2 A/B/C receptor agonist DOI. Taken together, the data suggest that endogenous 5 -HT exerts a dual action on psychotic-like behaviour, ie promotes locomotion through stimulation of 5 -HT 2 A receptors, and reduces locomotion through stimulation of other 5 -HT (possibly 5 -HT 2 C) receptors. Further, the antipsychotic-like effect of 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonists is dependent on increased serotonergic tone. Possible implications {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Radioligand binding {{techniques}} {{have demonstrated the}} existence of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) binding subtypes: 5 -HT 2, 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B. These {{techniques have}} also indicated that certain drugs appear to show sub-type specificity: 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin(8 -OH-DPAT), a 5 -HT 1 A agonist; 5 -methoxy- 3 (1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridin- 4 -yl) 1 -H indole (RU 24969), a 5 -HT 1 B agonist; and <b>ritanserin,</b> a 5 -HT 2 antagonist. (-) -Propranolol is a 5 -HT 1 antagonist of uncertain sub-type specificity. An examination {{has been made in}} mice and rats of the behavioural and biochemical effects of these drugs to determine whether the binding sites have physiological functions and further characterise the behavioural models. Administration of carbidopa (25 mg kg- 1) plus 5 -hydroxytryptophan (100 mg kg- 1) produced head-twitch behaviour in mice which was antagonized by <b>ritanserin</b> (ED 50 = 65 micrograms kg- 1) but not (-) -propranolol (20 mg kg- 1). 8 -OH-DPAT (1 - 10 mg kg- 1 s. c.) and RU 24949 (5 mg kg- 1 i. p.) did not produce head-twitch behaviour. 8 -OH-DPAT decreased 5 -HTP- but not 5 -methoxy-N-N-dimethyltryptamine (5 mg kg- 1) -induced head-twitch by a (-) -propranolol-insensitive mechanism. Locomotor activity produced in mice by RU 24969 (3 mg kg- 1) was antagonized by (-) -propranolol (20 mg kg- 1) but not the (+) -isomer. (-) -Propranolol did not antagonize the behaviour induced in rats. In mice, both 8 -OH-DPAT and RU 24969 markedly inhibited whole brain 5 -HT synthesis and this effect was not antagonized by (-) -propranolol. In rats, 8 -OH-DPAT (3 mg kg- 1 s. c.) produced all the behavioural changes seen after quipazine (25 mg kg- 1). (-) -Propranolol inhibited the behaviour changes produced by both agonists, while <b>ritanserin</b> antagonized the behaviour produced by quipazine but not 8 -OH-DPAT. It is concluded, therefore, that the 5 -HT 1 A receptor exists between the 5 -HT 2 receptor and the behavioural effectors. 8 -OH-DPAT (at 20 degrees C ambient temperature) rapidly decreased rat body temperature, an effect antagonized by (-) -propranolol but not <b>ritanserin.</b> Quipazine (at 27 degrees C ambient temperature, but not 20 degrees C) increased body temperature but the effect was not blocked by either antagonist. <b>Ritanserin</b> does not antagonize apomorphine-induced locomotion in either species.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{hypothesized}} impairment of the serotoninergic system in human obesity, an insulin tolerance test (ITT) was carried out on 12 obese normoprolactinemic women and on 6 normal-weight women before (A) and after (B) the administration of a serotoninergic drug, fenfluramine (60 mg twice a day per os for 7 days). After a washout period, a new ITT (C) followed the administration of fenfluramine at the same dose, associated with a specific S 2 blocker receptor agent, <b>ritanserin</b> (30 mg/day for the first 2 days and 20 mg/day for a further 5 days). In obese subjects, the prolactin (PRL) response to ITT A was reduced {{as compared to the}} controls: in 6 patients ('nonresponders') the PRL levels did not change, while in the other 6 ('responders') they increased (p < 0. 003) but less than in the controls (p < 0. 02). In normal-weight subjects, the administration of fenfluramine alone or with <b>ritanserin</b> did not modify the PRL response to ITT. In the responders, the serotoninergic drug normalized the PRL response to ITT while significantly improving it in the nonresponders; these effects were not antagonized by <b>ritanserin.</b> In conclusion, our data suggest that the serotoninergic system of obese patients is impaired and that the different secretory pattern observed in the two groups before and after fenfluramine may reflect differing degrees of this impairment...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the involvement of}} serotonergic systems in the locomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), and the PCP analog, N- (1 -(2 -benzo(b) thiophenyl) cyclohexyl) piperidine (BTCP). Central serotonin (5 -HT) activity was disrupted in rats with para-chloroamphetamine (p-CA), or <b>ritanserin</b> pretreatment, and by lesioning of the medial raphe (MR) and dorsal raphe (DR) nuclei. P-CA potentiated cocaine- and PCP- but not BTCP-induced hyperactivity. <b>Ritanserin</b> enhanced PCP hyperlocomotion and attenuated caffeine hyperactivity, but failed to alter cocaine and BTCP hyperlocomotion. MR lesions, but not DR lesions, dramatically increased spontaneous activity and potentiated the hyperlocomotion of cocaine, BTCP, and caffeine but not of PCP. This differential sensitivity to 5 -HT disruption may reflect {{the relative importance of}} 5 -HT systems in mediating the dopamine-dependent actions of these drugs. These results are discussed in relation to the neurochemical bases of drug reinforcement and schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|Rationale Clozapine and the “atypical” {{antipsychotics}} {{are less}} prone than neuroleptics to induce extrapyramidal motor effects, worsening {{of the negative}} symptoms of schizophrenia and dysphoria. This is paralleled by preclinical evidence showing reduced suppression of behaviours aimed at the pursuit of reward, with increased measures of reward efficacy. Serotonin 5 -HT 2 receptors seem {{to play a role}} in determining this profile. Objective We investigated the effects of clozapine on the microstructure of ingestive behaviour, which might reveal behavioural dimensions, such as reward evaluation and behavioural activation, which might be relevant in explaining its atypical profile. Moreover, we investigated the possibility that coadministration of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol and the 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C receptor antagonist <b>ritanserin</b> might mimic clozapine effects. Materials and methods The effects of clozapine (0. 5, 1 and 5 mg/kg) and of the coadministration of haloperidol (0. 05 mg/kg) and <b>ritanserin</b> (0. 5 and 3 mg/kg) have been examined on the microstructure of licking for a 10...|$|E
40|$|Electrophysiological and {{behavioral}} methods were utilized {{in conjunction with}} either specific brain lesions or drug administration to evaluate serotonin's modulatory influence on phencyclidine's actions. Dorsal raphe (DR) and medial raphe (MR) nucleus lesions were preformed to destroy serotonin cell bodies, while <b>ritanserin</b> and parachloroamphetamine (PCA) were used to remove or inhibit serotonin. The DR lesions changed phencyclidine's electrophysiological response in only the VTA (A 10), while the MR lesions effected only the SN (A 9) neurons. Thus the DR innervates the VTA, and the MR innervates the SN. The PCA, <b>ritanserin,</b> and DR groups showed a potentiated locomotor response to phencyclidine with {{no change in the}} animals spontaneous activity. The MR group showed an increase in spontaneous activity, but when normalized for this, there was no potentiation of the phencyclidine effect. Thus, the drug potentiation of the locomotor hyperactivity appears to be mediated through the DR serotoninergic system and A 10 dopamine system...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>ritanserin,</b> a potent 5 HT(2 A/ 2 C) {{receptor}} antagonist, {{used as an}} add-on medication to neuroleptic treatmentin patients with schizophrenia, was {{compared with that of}} placebo, in an international, double-blind, parallel-group study. Previously established neuroleptic therapy was maintained, and <b>ritanserin</b> 10 mg or placebo was given once daily for 8 weeks. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) cale. Safety assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), and the requirement for antiparkinsonian medication was monitored. About 70 per cent of patients completed the treatment. There was no {{difference between the two groups}} in the numbers of patients with clinical improvement at endpoint on the PANSS negative subscale and total PANSS. The CGIs of overall severity of schizophrenia were better under placebo. The overall prevalence of side effects and the requirements for antiparkinsonism medication were comparable in the two groups.
