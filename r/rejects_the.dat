5|$|Rathamma {{lives in}} a village with her sons Raja and Kundu, and her {{daughter}} Ammadu. Raja is a teacher and a theatre enthusiast. Along with Kundu {{and a group of}} fellow actors, Raja performs plays in a local theatre during his free time. Raja's maternal uncle Govindayya, a pleader, wants him to marry his daughter Chitti, who is in a relationship with a bodybuilder named Bheemudu. Raja <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> proposal and Govindayya offers to find a suitable bridegroom for Ammadu if Raja marries Chitti. Raja <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> proposal and with Kundu he sets out to find a suitable bridegroom for Ammadu.|$|E

5|$|The lack of {{codification}} of Sharia {{leads to}} considerable variation in its interpretation and application. Furthermore, {{there is no}} system of judicial precedent, as Wahhabism <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> imitation of past scholarship (taqlid) in favor of independent reasoning (ijtihad).|$|E
5|$|Faramir's {{decision}} {{to reject the}} One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon. By not taking the Ring, Faramir <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> desire for power and glory {{and the desire for}} renown which a defeat of Sauron would bring him.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} believe Taoism arose as a countermovement to Confucianism. The philosophical terms Tao and De {{are indeed}} shared by both Taoism and Confucianism, and Laozi is traditionally held {{to have been}} a teacher of Confucius. Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucianist and Mohist tenets in his work. In general, Taoism <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> Confucianist emphasis on rituals, hierarchical social order, and conventional morality, and favors naturalness, spontaneity, and individualism instead.|$|E

5000|$|A {{consular}} officer may <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> beneficiary's visa application without returning the petition to the USCIS. This {{is because the}} {{consular officer}} has many potential grounds for <b>rejecting</b> <b>the</b> application without calling {{the legitimacy of the}} petition in question. For instance, the consular officer may <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> application using Section 214(b), failure to establish non-immigrant intent.|$|R
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> prosecution's plea offer must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the offer would have been accepted by the defendant, not withdrawn by the prosecution, and accepted by the court, and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea.|$|E
5|$|Tony Stark {{recalls a}} New Year's Eve party in 1999 where he meets {{scientist}} Maya Hansen, {{the inventor of}} Extremis, an experimental regenerative treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries.

5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, {{especially since he}} is not financially well off. Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for her marriage to Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a neighbouring country. Thamarai <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, {{who had come to}} see her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a gounder custom). Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter for choosing Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Hristo Matanov conjectures {{that after}} 1355, John may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside the inner Balkans. He bases this theory {{on a new}} reading of several Latin-language coin inscriptions as Monita despoti Ioanni instead of Monita despoti Oliveri, as previously thought. The new reading, which would identify the coins as being minted by John, was proposed by Yugoslav numismatist NedeljkoviÄ‡, who <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> initial attribution of these coins to Jovan Oliver.|$|E
5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> theatrics {{of earlier}} metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson's {{depression}} returns again, when Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs {{her that}} she has an infection that requires surgery. She <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> surgery, and is further disappointed when Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her that the worst-case scenario is that she will need an ostomy pouching system. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E

50|$|Democratic socialists {{and social}} democrats <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> idea that {{socialism}} {{can be accomplished}} only through class conflict and a proletarian revolution. Many anarchists <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> need for a transitory state phase. Some thinkers have <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> fundamentals of Marxist theory, such as historical materialism and the labour theory of value, and gone on to criticise capitalism - and advocate socialism - using other arguments.|$|R
40|$|Retribution enjoys an unwarranted appeal {{from the}} public and its politicians. This is because it is {{impractical}} and perhaps even incoherent. This {{does not mean that}} we should <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> importance of morality for criminal justice nor should we <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> link between desert and proportionality. Nevertheless, we can <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> way retribution has understood these ideas in defense of a more plausible and compelling alternative...|$|R
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about downsizing measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing to shut down the Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing this through a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking the door behind him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open it, but it <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> card. When he inserts a manual override key, he is fatally electrocuted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, modern film {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} possible homosexual reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, {{and some of the}} actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be gay or bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.|$|E

5|$|It <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E
5|$|Paul is {{rescued by}} Stewie Wilkes (Stewie), Paul's self-proclaimed number-one fan, {{who takes the}} injured Paul to his/her remote cabin. Upon finding and reading the {{manuscript}} of Paul's latest Snuggly Jeff book, Stewie is infuriated about the main character's death and forces Paul to rewrite it and bring Snuggly Jeff back to life, holding him hostage until he manages to do so. Stewie <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> idea of bringing Snuggly Jeff back to life with a child's wish, calling it bad storytelling and comparing it to a plot hole in the film Contact.|$|E
5|$|Peter is now {{forced into}} helping Tyler, who has mind control powers {{due to his}} father James (Andrew Airlie) working on thought-controlled weapons systems for Massive Dynamic. Peter tries to get into Tyler's head by sharing his own stories of his father not believing in him, but Tyler <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> {{attempts}} to bond, as he only needs a driver. Their destination {{is the home of}} Tyler's mother, whom Tyler had been told was dead. When the two of them meet, Tyler wants her to run off {{so that they can be}} together again. She refuses, and Tyler becomes enraged at her husband when he returns home.|$|E
