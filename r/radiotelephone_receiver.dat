5000|$|The term is {{sometimes}} {{also used to}} refer to the frequency-shifted speech from an improperly tuned single sideband modulation (SSB) <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>receiver,</b> or the (nearly unintelligible) sound of a SSB signal on a conventional amplitude modulation (AM) receiver.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>receivers</b> {{are usually}} {{designed}} {{to a very}} high standard, and are usually of the double-conversion superhet design. Likewise, transmitters are carefully designed to avoid unwanted interference and feature power outputs from a few tens of milliwatts to perhaps 50 watts for a mobile unit, up {{to a couple of}} hundred watts for a base station. Multiple channels are often provided using a frequency synthesizer.|$|R

The Co-ordinate Rotational Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm configured in Rotation Mode (RM) can behave as a quadrature phase-to-amplitude converter that directly generates sine and cosine waveforms. The main advantage of using CORDIC-based DDS with respect to Look Up Table (LUT) based methods {{is that it can}} achieve both high phase resolution and high precision with lower hardware cost. CORDIC algorithm is a unique technique for performing various complex arithmetic functions using shift-add iterations. This paper reviews the use CORDIC architectures and types along with Direct Digital Synthesis to implement both analog and digital modulation techniques that {{can be found in a}} software defined radios i. e. reconfigurable digital radios. Also this system found in many modern devices, including radio <b>receivers,</b> mobile telephones, <b>radiotelephones,</b> walkie-talkies, satellite <b>receivers,</b> GPS systems, etc...|$|R
