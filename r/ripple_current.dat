WECSs use permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) directly coupled {{to the wind}} turbine and connected to the grid through a single-phase grid-tie converter. The loading produced on the DC-link is characterized by large <b>ripple</b> <b>currents</b> at twice the grid frequency. These <b>ripple</b> <b>currents</b> are reflected through the DC bus into the PMSG, causing increased heating and ripple torque. In this paper, the PMSG inverter is used to control the DC link voltage. In order to avoid reflecting the <b>ripple</b> <b>currents</b> into the PMSG, the feedback DC-link voltage is passed through a filter. The Butterworth filters, notch filters, antiresonant filter (ARF) and moving average filter (MAF) are considered. For a fair comparison, formulas are provided to tune the filter parameters so that DC-link voltage control will achieve the selected bandwidth. The different filtering options produce different levels of torque ripple reduction. Notch Filter, ARF and MAF obtain the best results {{and there is a}} trade-off between the filter implementation complexity, bandwidth, overshoot and the torque ripple reduction.

40|$|Analysis of the {{peak-to-peak}} output <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> amplitude {{for multiphase}} and multilevel inverters {{is presented in}} this PhD thesis. The <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> is calculated {{on the basis of}} the alternating voltage component, and peak-to-peak value is defined by the current slopes and application times of the voltage levels in a switching period. Detailed analytical expressions of peak-to-peak <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> distribution over a fundamental period are given as function of the modulation index. For all the cases, reference is made to centered and symmetrical switching patterns, generated either by carrier-based or space vector PWM. Starting from the definition and the analysis of the output <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> in three-phase two-level inverters, the theoretical developments have been extended to the case of multiphase inverters, with emphasis on the five- and seven-phase inverters. The instantaneous <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> is introduced for a generic balanced multiphase loads consisting of series RL impedance and ac back emf (RLE). Simplified and effective expressions to account for the maximum of the output <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> have been defined. The peak-to-peak <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> diagrams are presented and discussed.
