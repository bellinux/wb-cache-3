An experimental study was carried out to evaluate the performance of asolar thermally driven, low-flow, falling-film, internally-cooledparallel-plate liquid desiccant air-conditioner in Kingston, Ontario at Queen's University. A solution of LiCl and water was used as the desiccant. Unlike high-flow devices, the low-flow of desiccant solution flowing across the unit's dehumidifier and <b>regenerator</b> <b>sections</b> produces large variations in solution concentration. In this study, a series of tests were undertaken to evaluate the performance of the dehumidifier section of the unit. Results presented are based on mass flow and energy transport measurements that allowed the moisture transport rate between the air and liquid desiccant solution to be determined. Based on these results, arelationship between the desiccant concentration and the rate of dehumidification rate was found and the effect of inlet-air humidity onthe dehumidification effectiveness identified. The moisture removal rate of the system was found to range from 1. 1 g/s to 3. 5 g/s under the conditions evaluated. These result corresponded to an average dehumidification effectivenessof 0. 55...|$|R

30|$|Due to {{the severe}} {{reaction}} temperatures and short contact time, higher catalyst circulation {{is required to}} achieve high conversions [2]. A C/O ratio of approximately 20  to  30 minimizes the effects of operating at high reaction temperature (thermal cracking) by supplying more heat from its <b>regenerator</b> to reactor <b>section</b> to attain the heat balance. Also, increasing the C/O ratio improves selectivity and conversion by enhancing catalytic reaction over thermal reaction.|$|R
40|$|Fluidic cat {{crackers}} {{using the}} catalyst regeneration cycle have significant power recovery potential. Typically, the regenerator takes the spent coked catalyst and burns off the coke {{in an air}} pressurized atmosphere. The hot pressurized flue gas, leaving the <b>regenerator</b> <b>section,</b> contains the potential for power conversion from the heat energy and pressure head. Many existing systems recover the heat energy by means of carbon monoxide or waste heat boilers, but fail to utilize the pressure energy which can be recovered {{by the use of}} high temperature, dirty gas expanders. The use of an expander in the regenerator system introduces additional complexity. Analysis of the system operation during "off-design" conditions must be determined in order to properly design and size all turbo machinery and process components. A computer simulation model has been developed which allows the equipment vendor to size the air string components and assist the process designer in the evaluation of the many possible operating conditions. The digital computer model simulates the performance of the axial compressor, power recovery expander, <b>regenerator</b> <b>section,</b> and system pressure drops. The program can simulate the process system design conditions for compatibility with the axial compressor and the power recovery expander. It can predict off-design operation, such as the variation of ambient air inlet temperature and its effect on the compressor-expander power balance. It can test the startup procedures so that component design limitations are not exceeded. This paper will cover some of the basic modeling concepts for the axial compressor, regeneration and hot gas expander...|$|E
40|$|Model IV Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units (FCCUs) {{differ from}} other {{cracking}} units in that model IV FCCUs {{do not have}} slide valves in the catalyst circulation lines to enable direct control of catalyst circulation rate through the unit. Reducing fluctuations in catalyst circulation rate is found to significantly improve closed loop performance of the FCCU. Some design and operational modifications {{that can be made}} to model IV FCCUs to improve closed loop performance at the regulatory level based on this insight are modeled and compared. Closed loop performance of a model IV FCCU operated with the weir and standpipe always flooded is examined. The achievable performance is significantly better than that of the standard model IV FCCU. The closed loop performance of the model IV FCCU modified to incorporate slide valves in the catalyst circulation lines is also examined. The performance of the FCCU with slide valves is better than the performance achievable by the FCCU with the weir flooded.

40|$|Biosurfactant {{production}} of eight Streptococcus thermophilus strains, isolated from heat exchanger plates in the downstream {{side of the}} <b>regenerator</b> <b>section</b> of pasteurizers in the dairy industry has been measured using axisymmetric drop shape analysis by profile (ADSA-P). Strains were grown in M 17 broth with either lactose, saccharose or glucose added. After harvesting, cells were suspended in water or in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. 0, and suspension droplets were put {{on a piece of}} FEP-Tenon. Changes in droplet profile were analysed by ADSA-P to yield the surface tension decrease due to biosurfactant production as a function of time. Surface tension decreases larger than 8 mJ. m(- 2) were taken as indicative of biosurfactant production. Only five strains produced biosurfactants in water, solely when saccharose was added to the growth medium. In buffer, all strains produced biosurfactants and production was generally greater than in water. Also, most strains suspended in buffer produced maximally when saccharose was added to the growth medium, whereas one strain produced maximally in buffer upon the addition of glucose. Four strains suspended in buffer produced biosurfactants when glucose was added and only two strains when lactose was added. The possible role of these biosurfactants as anti-adhesives in the dairy industry and for the survival of these strains in natural systems is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Non-proprietary {{gas turbine}} {{transient}} performance models {{that deal with}} volume dynamics in the open literature usually do not consider heat transfer effects and friction existing in the volume walls. Such models are more than satisfactory {{for the analysis of}} aero gas turbines because the associated volumes of their components are inherently small and therefore treated as adiabatic, frictionless and passing low Mach number flows. When focusing upon gas turbines with heat exchangers, such as those working on regenerative cycles, on the other hand, these simplifying hypotheses may not be valid. The analysis model suggested in this work takes account of non-adiabatic volume dynamics with friction and high Mach number flows. The model is applied to the study of a regenerative-cycle gas turbine, through which the need for a more complete analysis model is demonstrated. The result of the study showed that the <b>regenerator</b> cold <b>section</b> volume has a greater influence on the dynamics than the hot section volume, this causing the power output. Friction has little influence on the dynamic response but causes a decrease in the steady state power output, as expected. Heat exchange also reduces the power output and lowers the transient engine surge margin...|$|R
30|$|The {{specifics}} of the MST technology are described in detail in US patent 7, 708, 941 (Arofikin, 2010). Briefly, the system consists of a balance tank, product pumps, magnetic flow meters, temperature transmitters, level transmitters, tubular heat exchanger with raw regenerator, heater, hold tube, MST chamber, pasteurized <b>regenerator,</b> and cooler <b>sections.</b> The system is started up on water, then sanitized by circulating water at 98  °C for 20  min. After sanitization, the system is cooled down and controlled at the desired operating temperatures for the experiment. The system is equipped with: regenerator bypass on the raw regenerator to allow {{for control of the}} temperature out of the regenerator and cascade hot water to heater product out temperature control to control the feed temperature to the MST inlet. The product is then fed to the inlet nozzle or nozzles of the MST chamber at a controlled pressure (pressure =  800, 000  Pa). Milk droplets are sprayed into the unit, at which time the milk is then heated to temperature within 0.02  s, which establishes the desired effect. The internal temperature of the MST unit is controlled by the cascade temperature control of hot water to internal temperature. This temperature is controlled at a value 10  °C higher than the inlet temperature. The lower jacket is cooled to prevent further heat treatment of the droplets collecting {{on the bottom of the}} MST Chamber. The discharge pump from the MST chamber controls a minimum level in the discharge leg of the MST chamber, and acts as the motive force to push through the downstream pasteurized <b>regenerator</b> and cooling <b>sections</b> of the process, and finally discharged to the destination. The system is controlled for circulation of water, water to product change-over, product discharge, product to water change-over, and clean-in-place (CIP) cycles. The milk is then cooled to 4  °C and expelled from the processor.|$|R
40|$|A {{secondary}} tar-cleaning process {{based on}} Chemical-Looping Reforming (CLR) was investigated for upgrading biomass producer gas, {{derived from the}} Chalmers University of Technology 2 - 4 MW indirect gasifier. The experiments were conducted in a bench-scale CLR reactor using a manufactured nickel oxide (NiO) catalyst. Although Ni is a well-documented and efficient steam-reforming catalyst, it is susceptible to rapid deactivation under tar-rich conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the advantages of CLR as a gas-cleaning application, a process which offers continuous regeneration of the carbon deposits on catalysts. The tar-reforming performance of this Ni material and its influence on the gas composition and in particular its potential to increase the H 2 /CO ratio, were studied. The system was tested at reforming temperatures that ranged from 700 °C to 880 °C and at oxygen concentrations of 1. 0 % and 2. 2 % in the inlet feed to <b>regenerator</b> <b>section.</b> The results confirm the strong ability of the catalyst to reform tars. Higher process temperatures clearly promoted tar conversion, with 96 % overall conversion at 880 °C (99 % if benzene is excluded), as compared with 45 % conversion at 700 °C. The hydrogen production was favored when temperature was raised. Though, a maximum ratio H 2 /CO of 2. 2 was observed at 750 °C. Finally, no time-on-stream deactivation of the catalyst in the CLR was observed during the test, which lasted almost 7 hours...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic thermal regenerators have an {{important}} industrial application, however most of the design techniques are old and use many simplifying assumptions. With the advent of digital computers many of these simplifying assumptions can be examined, however {{there is very little}} scope for practical verification. An apparatus has been designed, built and fully commissioned to investigate thermal regenerator characteristics. The analog operation of the apparatus is enhanced by four computer aspects. Commissioning of the regenerator highlighted how the response of apparatus can be influenced by the peripheral pipework around the test section, radiation effects from the heaters and jetting of air into the <b>regenerator</b> packed bed <b>section.</b> A series of experiments, comprising runs (a maximum of ten period changes) within a set-up (a known air flowrate and packed bed length) were formulated to examine the regenerator response, using three types of spherical packing, steel lead glass and alumina. A method of obtaining convective heat transfer coefficients was produced and represented in two forms. One in a graphical form which can be used for cyclic regenerator designs without the prior knowledge of a heat transfer coefficient, whilst the other form is data stored on a computer disc which produces convective heat transfer coefficients for regenerator raw data. Analysis of the practical data clearly shows the importance of the number of cycles required to reach equilibrium, test bed heat leak and packing intraconduction. Finally, prior to each cyclic set-up a single shot run was performed and the convective heat transfer coefficient obtained using Darabi's(1981) graphical technique. This offered a unique opportunity to compare cylic and single shot characteristics for the same physical system...|$|R
