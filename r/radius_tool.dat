50|$|A radius grinder (or <b>radius</b> <b>tool</b> grinder) is {{a special}} grinder used for {{grinding}} the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC tool and cutter grinder. Like the CNC grinder, it {{may be used for}} other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary. The tool itself consists of three parts: The grinder head, work table, and holding fixture. The grinder head has three degrees of freedom. Vertical movement, movement into the workpeice, and tilt. These are generally set statically, and left fixed throughout operations. The work table is a T-slotted X-axis table mounted on top of a radial fixture. Mounting the X axis on top of the radius table, as opposed to the other way around, allows for complex and accurate radius grinds. The holding fixtures can be anything one can mount on a slotted table, but most commonly used is a collet or chuck fixture that indexes and has a separate Y movement to allow accurate depth setting and endmill sharpening. The dressers used on these grinders are usually quite expensive, and can dress the grinding wheel itself with a particular radius.|$|E

The problem {{of this investigation}} was {{to determine the effects of}} surface roughness and surface stressing on the reversed bending fatigue properties of 25 S-T, 75 ST and 76 S-T aluminum alloys. Tests were conducted in a stress range from 37, 700 psi, to that stress giving a fatigue life of 500, 000, 000 cycles. Surface roughness was varied from five micro-inches to 400 micro-inches. Two different machining tools were used to obtain the various degrees of surface roughness: 1 / 8 " <b>radius</b> <b>tool,</b> and a sharp pointed tool. Surface stressing was obtained by shot peening with 0 [ [...] . ] 028 diameter shot at. 010 /. 012 A- 2 intensity, and cold rolling at 100 lbs. and 200 lbs. pressure. It was determined that fatigue life decreased as surface roughness increased in a similar manner for specimens machined with both types of tool; but that endurance limit was not affected by the sharp tool, whereas it was decreased by the 1 / 8 " <b>radius</b> <b>tool.</b> Shot peening increased fatigue life of 25 S-T by about 500 %; it had but slight effect on 76 S-T.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of components used in recent optical technologies is ever increasing. In many applications like micro-lens arrays the optically functional surfaces have a smooth and steady geometry, but have an uncontinuous transition between the surrounding surface or other lenses. That type of non-rotationally symmetric surfaces can be machined by ultra precision diamond turning assisted by a Fast Tool Servo System (FTS), which extends the turning kinematics {{by a high}} frequency tool movement. To achieve high form accuracy and optical surface quality, two compensation approaches are discussed in this paper. The form error resulting from the geometry of the diamond tool's radius shaped cutting edge is corrected by the superposition of a compensation value. The form accuracy of the work piece beside the geometrical factors is further influenced by {{the accuracy of the}} FTS and the basis machine, especially regarding the dynamics of the axes. The transfer behaviour of the FTS is improved by applying a pre-control filter with significant order. Its extraction from measurements is shown in the paper. The positioning accuracy is mainly affected by the following error and the transfer behaviour of the axis. Using a pre-control filter, the following error of the axis can be reduced by 90 %. The combination with the <b>radius</b> <b>tool</b> compensation results in a rapid improvement of the form accuracy. Further improvements of the dynamic behaviour of the axis are possible with the application of a model-based control strategy. The dimensioning of such a modelbased system can be facilitated by a modification of the optimisation algorithm which was used to evaluate the pre-control filter.

An attractive solution for deformation reduction is the utilization of large radius punches.

This software is capable of simulating the cutting process of low-pressure turbine disks of aircraft jet engines from its very beginning to steady-state conditions. Basically, the present analysis is a coupled thermo-mechanical dynamictransient problem, based on the update Lagrangian formulation; no pre-defined path is given for the separation of the chip from the workpiece, since material deformation occurs as a continuous indentation performed by the rigid tool. In addition to the cutting parameters, the main inputs in this analysis are material constitutive data, the friction coefficient at the toolchip interface and the cutting tool temperature. All the relevant variables, like stresses, strains, temperatures, chip shape and residual stresses, are predicted in a wide range of cutting conditions.
