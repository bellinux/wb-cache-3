5000|$|Flavescence dorée (from French [...] "Flavescence" [...] : {{yellowing}} and [...] "dorée" [...] : golden) is {{a bacterial}} {{disease of the}} vine {{with the potential to}} threaten vineyards.

Infection may kill young vines and greatly reduce the productivity <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>vines.</b> It is classified as a phytoplasma disease belonging to the group generically termed grapevine yellows.

Paintings of the house kept at the Štajerska Provincial Museum in Graz show the vine growing at least as early as 1657. In 1972, the vine was tested by a Paris laboratory with its age confirmed to be over 400 years. During its life, the Maribor vine survived the Ottoman-Habsburg wars that affected the entire region, Napoleon's invasion and rule of the Illyrian Provinces, the phylloxera epidemic that devastated Vitis vinifera vines across the continent as well as World War I and World War II.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} Turkey Flat wines began in 1847 when Johann Frederick August Fiedler planted Shiraz vines near Bethany Creek.

50|$|The {{demand for}} White Zinfandel {{resulted}} in extended commercial viability <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>vine</b> Zinfandel vineyards, which saved {{them from being}} ripped out. When the fine wine boom started in the 1980s, demand for red Zinfandel picked up considerably and these vineyards became prized for the low yields from century-old vines. With White Zinfandel outselling red Zinfandel 6:1 by volume, there's not enough juice left over from red wine production to satisfy demand for White Zinfandel. So Sutter Home (and most producers today) grow grapes specifically for use in White Zinfandel, {{in places like the}} Central Valley of California. Production costs are substantially lower and fruit quality is not as important to the final taste as it would be in a dry table wine.|$|R

25|$|Most of the Barossa Valley makes {{extensive}} use of irrigation to supplement the region's low rainfall supply during the growing season. However, concerns about water supply in the late 20th and early 21st century {{led to the development}} of strict regulations on the numbers and locations of irrigation boreholes as well as the amount of water that can be used by vineyards. Some <b>of</b> the region's <b>oldest</b> vineyards, especially those on the slightly cooler west side of the valley, practice dryland farming. The increased water stress of the practice, coupled with the naturally reduced yields <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>vines,</b> tends to produce the most deeply concentrated grapes in the valley which often go into the Barossa Valley 's most expensive and sought after wines. Harvest usually begins in February and may be conducted in the cooler temperatures of night to help maintain acid levels.|$|R

These vines are believed to be some <b>of</b> the <b>oldest</b> <b>vines</b> in Bordeaux (where only 27% of the vines average more than 30 years age [...] ), having likely survived the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century due to the ancient Libournais practice of flooding the vineyards in winter which would disrupt the nymph stage in the life cycle of phylloxera.|$|R
5|$|Among the reds, Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault, and Mourvedre {{are major}} grapes of the Corbières, Faugères, Fitou, and Minervois AOCs.

Grenache is also the main grape used in the fortified wines of the Banyuls and Rivesaltes region. Some <b>of</b> the <b>oldest</b> <b>vines</b> in France are Carignan grapes.

5000|$|Paul Draper (born March 10, 1936) is a California {{winemaker}} who {{has been}} the chief winemaker at Ridge Vineyards in California since 1969. Without any formal training in winemaking, Draper first gained recognition for his 1971 Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon when it placed fifth at the Judgment of Paris wine tasting. Draper has {{played a significant role in}} the history of California wine through his pioneering work in popularizing [...] "vineyard-designated" [...] wines as well as instigating the resurgence <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>vine</b> Zinfandel. Along with Ravenswood Winery's Joel Peterson, Draper is considered one of the most important figures in the history of Californian Zinfandel, rescuing the grape from obscurity and demonstrating its full potential as a serious wine. Draper was featured in a short film titled Terroir and directed by Christopher McGilvray which was shown at the 2017 Cinequest Film Festival.|$|R
