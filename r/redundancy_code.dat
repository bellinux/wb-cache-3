Further the proposed aircraft identity code also comprised 24 bits with 16 million permutations. This allowed each aircraft to be wired with its own unique address.

Real-time video communication across an ad hoc network allows helpers to better understand the nature of the problem within a disaster area but the lack of centralized routing and network resource management is challenging, particularly if the wireless nodes have limited processing power.

40|$|Parallel {{scientific}} applications {{deal with}} machine unreliability by periodic checkpointing, {{in which all}} processes coordinate to dump memory to stable storage simultaneously. However, in systems comprising {{tens of thousands of}} nodes, the total data volume can overwhelm the network and storage farm, creating an I/O bottleneck. Furthermore, a very large class of scientific applications can fail on these systems if one of the processes dies. Poor checkpointing performance limits checkpointing frequency and increases the time-to-solution of applications. Also, the application can spend more time in recovery and restart because large systems tend to fail often. Diskless checkpointing is a viable approach that provides high-performance and reliable storage for intermediate or temporary data, such as checkpoint files. First, the data is stored in memory instead of disk.

40|$|A Cyclic <b>Redundancy</b> <b>Code</b> (CRC), {{when used}} properly, {{can be an}} {{effective}} and relatively inexpensive method to detect data corruption across communication channels. However, some systems use CRCs in ways that violate common assumptions made in analyzing CRC effectiveness, resulting in an overly optimistic prediction of system dependability. CRCs detect errors with some finite probability, which depends on factors including the strength of the particular code used, the bit-error rate, and the message length being checked. Common assumptions also include a passive network inter-stage, explicit data words, memoryless channels, and random independent symbol errors. In this paper we identify some examples of CRC usage that compromise ultra-dependable system design goals, and recommend alternate ways to improve system dependability via architectural approaches rather than error detection coding approaches. 1...|$|E
