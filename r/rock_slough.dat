5000|$|The Contra Costa Canal is {{used for}} agricultural, industrial, and {{municipal}} water purposes. Due to the water used for water supply for different cities, the canal is fenced off from the public. [...] The canal provides water for the largest urban contractor of the Central Valley Project, the Contra Costa Water District. It {{is part of the}} Central Valley Project managed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation to divert Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta water from <b>Rock</b> <b>Slough</b> as far as Martinez, California in Central Contra Costa County.|$|E
50|$|Carlson and {{his team}} of canal {{supporters}} went to Washington , D. C. to lobby the U. S. government for funding. Their efforts were successful, although it took three years. In August 1937, the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation (BuRec) announced that it would fund the Central Valley Project. A groundbreaking ceremony for the Contra Costa Canal occurred in Oakley, California on November 7, 1937. Despite delays caused by demands for labor and materials needed of World War II, the 48 mile km long tunnel was completed in 1948, from the Delta intake on <b>Rock</b> <b>Slough</b> (near Knightsen) to Martinez.|$|E

50|$|Batholiths exposed at {{the surface}} are {{subjected}} to huge pressure differences between their former location deep in the earth and their new location {{at or near the}} surface. As a result, their crystal structure expands slightly over time. This manifests itself by a form of mass wasting called exfoliation. This form of weathering causes convex and relatively thin sheets of <b>rock</b> to <b>slough</b> off the exposed surfaces of batholiths (a process accelerated by frost wedging). The result is fairly clean and rounded rock faces. A well-known result of this process is Half Dome, located in Yosemite Valley.|$|R
50|$|Viva Brother were an indie <b>rock</b> {{band from}} <b>Slough,</b> England. Previously known as Brother, they signed to Geffen Records in October and EMI Publishing in November 2010. Their debut album, Famous First Words, was {{released}} on 1 August 2011, and reached #34 on the UK Albums Chart. It was confirmed on 1 April 2012 that Viva Brother had split up. In June 2012, the band members launched a new band, the synthpop group Lovelife.|$|R
5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, <b>rock</b> formations, backwater <b>sloughs,</b> and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|R
50|$|Many creeks run at a {{southwest}} direction {{toward the}} township. They provide drainage for the townships farmland and residences. Three of these creeks begin the Will Township, Sumner Township's {{neighbor to the}} north in Will County. These include the Marshall <b>Slough,</b> <b>Rock</b> Creek, and the Exline Slough. The Marshall Slough cuts through Sumner Township in the far northwest corner and quickly cuts into Manteno Township. Rock Creek also cuts quickly through the township before it cuts into Manteno Township a mile south of Sumner Township's northern border. The Exline Slough is the biggest creek in Sumner Township and runs {{all the way from}} County Line Road at the north edge of the township to 6000 N. Rd. In Section 30 the Canavan Slough, which starts a mile north of the town of Whitaker, joins up with the Exline Slough. Farr Creek begins a half mile south of the southern border of Sumner Township, in Section 32, before crossing the southern border. Tower Creek starts in the northeast quarter of the township and runs into Ganeer Township which is south of Sumner Township.|$|R
