50|$|A spherical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> is a {{rolling-element bearing}} of thrust type that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. The bearing {{is designed to}} take radial loads, and heavy axial loads in one direction. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the shaft washer that may be misaligned in respect to the housing washer. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape of the house washer.|$|E
50|$|Self-aligning ball bearings, {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small angular misalignment resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius). This led to {{the invention of the}} spherical roller bearing, which has a similar design, but use rollers instead of balls. Also the spherical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> is an invention that derives from the findings by Wingquist.|$|E

The effect of lub-ricating systems, speed, load, oil-flow rates, lubricant viscosity, and oil-inlet tempera-ture on the operating temperature is demonstrated. The test-rig results are generalized by means of dimensional analysis enabling the designer to predict operating tempera-ture for various operating conditions of speed, load, oil-flow rates, and oil-inlet viscosity...|$|R
50|$|Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> {{consist of}} small tapered rollers {{arranged}} {{so that their}} axes all converge at a point on the axis of the bearing. The length of the roller and {{the diameter of the}} wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the bearing face without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as radial loads. They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture.|$|R
40|$|Bearings are {{essential}} parts used in machine tools where high precision is required. It {{is important to}} understand bearing failure in order to replace a bearing before it affects the quality of precision. Bearing failure appears as a run-out in some applications, which is a critical factor for precision. However, previous studies have only focused on failure mechanisms, such as spalling. In this study, two types of wear models were used to predict the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> run-out: Linear and non-linear mechanisms. In order to validate the models, wear experiments of cross <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> were performed. The average difference between the experiment and simulation run-out result was 16 %. Then, the wear of different sized cross roller bearings was predicted by using a simulation. This was compared with the experiment result and showed up to a 6 % difference. The suggested wear models are expected to be used to predict the failure/life of bearings...|$|R
40|$|Rotating {{machines}} serves {{an important}} role in many different applications. Extensive research has been made, manly during the last century, in order to develop these systems and understand the dynamics. The theory of rotordynamics differs in many fundamental aspects from structural dynamics and is therefore usually treated as an own research area. In rotordynamical applications there exist several qualitatively different concepts. For example super- and subcritical machines supported on different types of bearings like ball-, roller- or journal bearings etc. At the early stage of the product development, the problem is often to find a general tool which can be used for dynamical evaluation of these concepts. Many concepts also contain significant nonlinearities which need to be studied separately. One such nonlinearity is a clearance which arises between a fixed support and an axially movable bearing assembly. Another nonlinear effect is the loss of contact which can occur in preloaded spherical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> The aim is hence to present a method to dynamically evaluate different rotordynamical concepts, describe nonlinear effects due to these contact problems and suggest suitable design parameters. For the concept evaluation a linear model which captured the gyroscopic effect is proposed, while the contact problems are handled with nonlinear models (usually piecewise linear). The governing equations of motion are solved analytically in the linear case but needs to be simulated in the nonlinear cases. However, in some special cases it is possible to find steady state solutions even for the contact problems. Simulations of design spaces, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, contact forces etc. have been used to study the systems. In order to evaluate different concept, design spaces spanned by a requirement variable and three design parameters are plotted. These are four dimensional plots where the variations of the requirement variables are visualised by colours. This is done both for the unbalance response and an impact in order to include both the homogenous and particular solution. In the clearance problem bifurcation diagrams and Poincaré maps indicates that multi-, quasi- or chaotic motions are possible which in many cases include impacts. When stabilising rods are applied the unstable areas (positive maximum Lyapunov exponent) are reduced. In the case with the spherical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> nonperiodic motions are found. The stability shows strong dependency on the amount of preload. A method to dynamically evaluate rotordynamical concepts is suggested. Some especially interesting ranges of the design parameters which give low vibrations are presented. It has further been shown that strong nonlinear dynamics which may lead to failure can be expected in systems with clearance between the stator and bearing assembly. One {{way to get rid of}} such unwanted vibrations is to apply stabilising rods. It is than important to choose the right parameters since otherwise worse conditions may occur. In systems supported by preloaded spherical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> it is important that the preloading is high enough. Otherwise jump phenomenon and nonperiodic motions can arise. An expression of the limit preload of going in or out of full contact has been derived which can be used to choose a suitable preloading.

40|$|International audienceIn a {{tribological}} system {{consisting of}} <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> and various lubricants, we investigated reaction layers formed under {{the presence of}} lubricants with low wear protection, high wear and fatigue protection as well as high wear but low fatigue protection.

Chemical composition and microstructure analysis of the layers was subsequently carried out by transmission electron microscopy on thin cross sections prepared by the focused ion beam technique. The nanomechanical properties of the different tribological layers were analysed by nanoindentation. The formation {{and structure of the}} layer system, and thus the ability to protect against wear and fatigue, depends on the lubrication and additive, respectively.

However, Agostino Ramelli {{is the first to}} have published sketches of <b>roller</b> and <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> An issue with ball and roller bearings is that the balls or rollers rub against each other causing additional friction which can be reduced by enclosing the balls or rollers within a cage.

40|$|Zinc dithiophosphates (ZDDP) {{have been}} widely applied in {{automobile}} industry for over 70 years as a lubricant additive for wear protection. Tribolayers {{have been described as}} blue- and brown-colored layers on surfaces observed by microscopical observation or even bare eye presumably as a consequence of layer thickness or chemical composition. However, the reaction pathways of ZDDP tribolayers are still not yet fully understood. In the present study, the difference between the blue- and brown-colored tribolayers has been revealed by high resolution methods in cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> at relatively high contact pressures of around 1. 92 GPa. After running a FE 8 standard bearing test with a normal load of 80 kN and a temperature of 60 °C, said tribolayers could be identified on the bearing surfaces. By using Raman spectroscopy, it could be shown that the blue-colored layers are enriched by FeS and ZnS whereas the brown-colored layers show a significant amount of Fe 3 O 4. This is an interesting finding as it clearly shows a correlation between the color appearance of the films and the chemical composition besides potential film thickness variations.

40|$|Abstract: The risk {{of fatigue}} failure of {{elements}} working in rolling contact conditions (such as railway wheels, rolling bearings, etc.) {{is a significant}} issue with respect to safety and economy. In this case the complex and non-proportional stress state with pulsating three dimensional compression occurs. Therefore, the analysis of fatigue life of structures working in rolling contact conditions can be performed using recently proposed multiaxial high-cycle fatigue criteria. However, there is no hypothesis that could be universally accepted for calculations of fatigue strength. Furthermore, not all criteria proposed in literature for rolling contact fatigue (RCF) analysis can predict it. In the paper, the most popular criteria based on different theories are investigated in the application to RCF problem. Moreover, modification of the popular Dang Van hypothesis is proposed.
