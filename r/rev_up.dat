5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the show, the {{producers}} from WCW/Turner Broadcasting System made several changes to the format, including reducing the overall time by 40 minutes. This forced AAA to change the first three matches from the traditional best-of-three falls to a single fall. The producers also cut back on the elaborate entrances that AAA usually had for their major shows and did not allow AAA to have a dark match before the broadcast started to <b>rev</b> <b>up</b> the crowd. The producers also pushed to change the semi-main event to a singles match between El Hijo del Santo and Eddie Guerrero, but in the end, the match went on as originally planned and advertised.|$|E

2500|$|A second key musical {{element in}} hip hop music is emceeing (also called MCing or rapping). Emceeing is the rhythmic spoken {{delivery}} of rhymes and wordplay, delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat. This spoken style {{was influenced by}} the African American style of [...] "capping", a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners. The basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps, rival [...] "posses" [...] (groups), uptown [...] "throw-downs", and political and social commentary—were all long present in African American music. MCing and rapping performers moved {{back and forth between the}} predominance of [...] "toasting'" [...] songs packed with a mix of boasting, 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, socially conscious style. The role of the MC originally was as a Master of Ceremonies for a DJ dance event. The MC would introduce the DJ and try to pump up the audience. The MC spoke between the DJ's songs, urging everyone to get up and dance. MCs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to <b>rev</b> <b>up</b> the crowd. Eventually, this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken, rhythmic wordplay, and rhyming, which became rapping.|$|E

Members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and PA speakers into the lampposts on 163rd Street and Prospect Avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between African-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Whites and other ethnic groups. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc also {{played a key role in}} developing hip hop music. At 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, Herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion [...] "breaks", mixing this music with his own Jamaican-style [...] "toasting" [...] (a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone) to <b>rev</b> <b>up</b> the crowd and dancers. Kool Herc is credited as the [...] "father" [...] of hip hop for developing the key DJ techniques that, along with rapping, founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping [...] "breaks" [...] (small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern) on two turntables. This was later accompanied by [...] "rapping" [...] or [...] "MCing" [...] and beatboxing. [...] An original form of dancing called breakdancing, which later became accompanied by popping, locking and other dance moves, which was done to the accompaniment of hip hop songs played on boom boxes and particular fashion styles also developed.|$|E

2500|$|Despite its {{international}} success, Star Trek Beyond {{was met by}} critics who were less taken with the film. Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film 1½ stars out of 4 and he commented that the filmmakers [...] "should have called it Star Trek Into Drowsiness." [...] Smith later added, [...] "Beyond is tepid when it’s trying to be emotional, moronic when it’s trying to be thrilling and unfunny when it’s trying to be non-unfunny. It lacks a storytelling module: Things just click into place when needed, as when Kirk commands Scotty to <b>rev</b> <b>up</b> a busted old spaceship, Scott says it’s impossible, and 14 seconds later everything is ready to rip." [...] James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave 2½ stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one; The action sequences are frenetic, kinetic, and at times incoherent. This isn’t unexpected; it’s Lin’s trademark. But the plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it’s also instantly forgettable." [...] Dave Robinson of outlet Crash Landed writes that [...] "Star Trek Beyond fails to push beyond its own roots and becomes just another very safe sci-fi popcorn movie in an increasingly crowded market, that will likely have you leaving the theatre feeling exactly as you entered." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+ and wrote, [...] "ith Beyond, it feels like just another summer tentpole with not enough going on underneath the tent." ...|$|E
