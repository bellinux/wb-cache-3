5|$|The {{magnitude}} 6.3 ML earthquake occurred inland on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST, (02:20 UTC) at {{a shallow}} depth of 6.0km (4mi), about 10km (6mi) to the east-southeast of Christchurch, New Zealand. Owing to {{the interaction of}} the major Pacific and Australia Plates, much of the regional plate boundary along central South Island is characterised by land deformation. The earthquake was a direct result of strike-slip faulting at the eastern end of the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> of another strong magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake, which occurred on 22 February 2011 along the Port Hills Fault. The June earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor with a similar focal mechanism that struck 1 hour and 20 minutes earlier. Experts believe the quakes were triggered by a previously undiscovered fault in the region, located several kilometres south of the Port Hills Fault. The United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw and a focal depth of 9km (5.6mi) for the earthquake, while the precursor tremor was assigned a magnitude of 5.2 Mw at a similar depth.|$|E

500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County. Although the Hayward Fault Zone is also nearby, making this an area of regular seismic activity, no observable foreshocks occurred within the preceding three months. The mainshock was felt throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, but damage was mainly limited to the nearby towns of Gilroy and Hollister. A large number of strong motion stations recorded the event, including an array of units along the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone,</b> and instruments at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory. The records revealed that strike-slip motion occurred over [...] on a vertical fault, and that {{the total amount of}} slip varied with depth, with more slip occurring in the shallower regions. The two closest stations at Coyote Creek and Gilroy, as well as the Berkeley stations, were used to refine the overall fault length, slip, and depth of faulting.|$|E
2500|$|Surface {{faulting}} {{may have}} extended {{beyond the boundaries}} of the regularly acknowledged slip length. Researchers recorded first and second-hand accounts of the ground crack, which was understood to be recent surface faulting and not just the topography of the existing rift. On the extreme northern end of the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone,</b> the surface cracking extended [...] north of Cholame into San Benito County. On the southern end, the population centers were not as close to the fault, and early observers were probably limited to the stretch of the fault between Fort Tejon and Elizabeth Lake, as that was close to the Stockton – Los Angeles Road, the primary inland north−south route then.|$|E

The estimation of the earthquake's intensity was based on the condition of the soil where the damage occurred. A lower magnitude range would be preferred if the soil in the area was soft and loosely compacted and a range based on firm ground or bedrock would be proportionately higher.|$|E

Prior events occurred in 1806, 1818, and 1900, and a recurrence period of 77 years was proposed for the region, but because of difficulty in positively identifying the <b>rupture</b> <b>zones,</b> this time frame was not precisely established. [...] In 2003, near the same location, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 claimed 29 lives.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1988, the Working Group for California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP) {{made several}} {{statements}} regarding their forecasts for the [...] northern San Andreas Fault segment, the [...] San Francisco Peninsula segment, and a [...] {{portion of that}} segment which {{was referred to as}} the southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. The thirty year probability for one or more M7 earthquakes in the study area was given as 50%, but {{because of a lack of}} information and low confidence, a 30% probability was assigned to the Southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. Two moderate shocks, referred to as the Lake Elsman earthquakes by the USGS, occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains region in June 1988 and again in August 1989. Following each event, the State office of Emergency Services issued (for the first time in Bay Area history) short term advisories for a possible large earthquake, which meant there was [...] "a slightly increased likelihood of an M6.5 event on the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San Andreas fault". The advisories following the two Lake Elsman events were issued in part because of the statements made by WGCEP and because they were two of the three largest shocks to occur along the 1906 earthquake's <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> since 1914.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> of the 1978 {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} the westernmost limit of known interplate earthquakes, some 150 km back from the trench.

50|$|The surface <b>rupture</b> <b>zone,</b> {{which was}} between 1 - 4 km wide, {{stretched}} some 80 km from to Lake Abant (Abant Gölu) to Sapanca in an East-West direction, generally following {{the course of}} the Mudurnu River until it flows north near Lake Sapanca. The earthquake is named after the river valley, not the town of Mudurnu itself, which is some distance south of the river and outside the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
30|$|We {{carry out}} {{numerical}} simulation of disturbance propagation within a plate floating over a viscous layer {{based on the}} 2 -dimensional equations of Lehner et al. (1981). We apply the results to the anomalous crustal movements in central Honshu that followed the dike intrusion event between Miyakejima and Kozushima in the mid of 2000. We assume that the anomalous crustal movements represent diffusive transfer of a slip on the detachment beneath the Izu Peninsula, that occurred {{at the time of}} the dike intrusion event, over thin viscous layers such as the fault gouge of nearby great interplate earthquakes (Seno, 2005). From the arrival times of the disturbance in the Tokai district, the diffusion coefficient is determined to be 50 – 150 m 2 /s, and the viscosity of the fault gouge to be 1013 – 1015 Pa s. This value of viscosity is significantly smaller than that of the asthenosphere, and would probably be caused by the elevation of pore fluid pressure close to the lithostatic in the <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> of nearby great earthquakes. The serpentinized wedge mantle landward of the <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> may also constitute part of the thin viscous layers.|$|R
40|$|Summary. A {{tripartite}} ocean-bottom seismograph array at {{the junction}} of the East Pacific Rise and Rivera Fracture Zone recorded an eathquake sequence, consisting of three main shocks (mB = 4. 3, 4. 3 and 4. 8) and numerous after-shocks from the fracture zone, in the distance range 35 - 50 km. Delineation of the <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> by aftershocks indicates that the first two main shocks took place on overlapping fault areas, while the third occurred over a fault area separated from the first by several kilometres. Both <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> were about 4 !un long. Surface wave spectra indicate a shallow (about 3 km below the sea floor) source, as does OBS array phase velocity data. The seismic moments, obtained from teleseismic surface wave data, of 1. 3, 2. 1 and 2. 8 x loz 3 dyn cm, with the fault areas as delineated by aftershocks, imply a stress drop of about 8 bars for the main shocks. Aftershock sequences {{of each of the}} main shocks are similar, with a b-value of about 0. 65. Teleseismic P travel times are similar to those from near-surface sources in Nevada...|$|R
30|$|Bosworth {{repaired}} Achilles tendon rupture {{by taking}} a wide strip of the proximal aponeurosis, which was woven through the proximal and distal tendon stumps. This repair needed some amount of distal stump for repair. This method is not ideally suited to <b>ruptures</b> in <b>zone</b> I. We modified the Bosworth technique by passing the apenurosis through the calcaneum instead of passing it through the distal stump and suturing {{it back to the}} main tendon, thus making it a good option for avulsions and <b>ruptures</b> in <b>zone</b> I [21].|$|R
50|$|The 1946 Nankaido {{earthquake}} {{was unusual}} in its seismological perspective, with a <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> estimated from long-period geodetic data {{that was more}} than twice as large as that derived from shorter period seismic data. In the center of this earthquake <b>rupture</b> <b>zone,</b> scientists used densely deployed ocean bottom seismographs to detect a subducted seamount 13 km thick by 50 km wide at a depth of 10 km. Scientists propose that this seamount might work as a barrier inhibiting brittle seismogenic rupture.|$|E

50|$|In seismology, the {{epicenter}} {{is the point}} on the Earth's surface directly above {{the point where the}} fault begins to rupture, and in most cases, it is the area of greatest damage. However, in larger events, the length of the fault rupture is much longer, and damage can be spread across the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone.</b> For example, in the magnitude 7.9, 2002 Denali earthquake in Alaska, {{the epicenter}} was at the western end of the rupture, but the greatest damage occurred about 330 km away at the eastern end of the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} major home {{mortgage}} lenders and real -property appraisers in California and the Puget Sound region shows a general inattention to earthquake hazards in appraisal and lending policy.

30|$|Motivated by an {{interest}} in investigating the mechanism of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, the Wenchuan Earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling Project (WFSD) was launched on November 4, 2008, only 178  days after the Wenchuan Earthquake (Xu and Li 2010). The Wenchuan Earthquake (Mw 7.9) produced two major surface <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> along the Yingxiu-Beichuan and Anxian-Guanxian faults. The Yingxiu-Beichuan Fault crosses heavily populated regions and is associated with destructive earthquakes.

50|$|This {{earthquake}} was an interplate earthquake {{between the}} Cocos Plate and the North American Plate. It {{occurred in the}} Colima region of the Middle America Trench. This earthquake {{was very close to}} where the 1973 Colima earthquake occurred. From the locally recorded time intervals between the arrival of the S wave and the P wave (S-P times) and from the felt intensities, it is suggested that the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> of this earthquake was larger than the 1973 earthquake and may have extended into the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> of the 1985 Michoacán earthquake.|$|E
50|$|This is a megathrust {{earthquake}} which ruptured part of {{the boundary}} between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. In this area, the Nazca Plate is subducting beneath the South America Plate with a convergence vector of about 7.6 cm/yr. Much of the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> of the 1942 earthquake overlapped with that of the 1996 Nazca earthquake. The <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> of the 1942 earthquake was about 40 km longer than that of the 1996 earthquake. The epicenter of the 1942 earthquake was very close to, but slightly southeast of, that of the 1996 earthquake. The energy released by the 1942 earthquake was about 2.5×1017 Nm.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} small {{aftershocks}} occurred, mostly towards the westward end of the fault zone; its eastern end overlapped the <b>rupture</b> <b>zone</b> of the previous M7.1 1957 Abant earthquake with a similar epicentre, by about 25 km.|$|E
30|$|All {{patients}} had undergone an ultrasound {{scan of the}} Achilles tendon to confirm the rupture. Seventy-two {{patients had}} a <b>rupture</b> in <b>zone</b> I (<b>rupture</b> within 2  cm of the calcaneal insertion). Six patients had a <b>rupture</b> in <b>zone</b> II (<b>rupture</b> 2 to 6  cm from the calcaneal insertion). The patients who received steroid injection had an avulsion of the tendon from the calcaneum. Intraoperatively, patients had necrosis of the tendon end, which was confirmed histologically. Calcification of the tendon along with necrosis was seen in a few patients.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{orientation}} of the stress tensors derived from the first and second data subsets is different, the transtensional stress regime (σ 1 close to vertical, σ 2 and σ 3 close to horizontal) and the stress magnitude ratio close to R = 0.8 are common features (Figs. 14, 15, 16). These stress tensors are somewhat contradictory to the expectation because the Sakarya and Karadere segment forms a restraining bend in the Akyazı region where the compressive stress tensor should be expected. However, when we carefully check the location of the aftershocks, we see that they tend to occur to the south of the restraining bend, i.e., between the <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> of the 1967 Mudurnu and the 1999 Izmit earthquakes. Thus, the stress tensors derived from the aftershocks of the 1999 event show that the region between the <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> of the northern and southern branches of the NAFZ forms a releasing bend that generates a several-kilometer-wide step-over basin where the sediment thickness reaches up to 10 km (Tank et al., 2005). The wide and thick sedimentary basin has arrested the westward propagating ruptures of the 1967 Mudurnu earthquake for 32 years. In contrast, the eastward propagating ruptures of the Sakarya segment were able to cross the basin and trigger a 1 - to 1.5 -m slip on the Karadere segment (Langridge et al., 2002; Müller and Aydın, 2004).|$|R

The propagation of local undamped motion (PLUM) method is also scheduled to be implemented {{in order to minimize}} under-predictions for massive earthquakes with large <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> (Kodera et al. 2014). It would be advantageous to analyze actual improvements achievable by these methods for the Kumamoto earthquake sequence because the spatial and temporal patterns of these earthquake occurrences significantly differ from those of past earthquakes.|$|R

Because these earthquakes generally should have focal regions in excess of 100 km diameter, their <b>rupture</b> <b>zones</b> apparently intersect. For all these pairs, the time interval is significantly less than the time span needed for plate motion to accumulate the strain released by the first event. These observations conflict strongly with quasi-periodic recurrence models on which the seismic gap hypothesis i based. Power-law recurrence fits these earthquake ob-servations much better...|$|R
