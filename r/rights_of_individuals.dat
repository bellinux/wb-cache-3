A new Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level: the bicameral parliament (legislative), the Federal Council (executive) and the Federal Court (judicial).|$|E

This theme is, according to our opinion, current topic because there are conflicts between the personal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> and the <b>right</b> to freedom <b>of</b> expression nearly every day. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse, if {{the attitude of the}} courts to the protection <b>of</b> these two <b>rights</b> is equal and if the individuals, who have disadvantageous position against the mass media, can adequately defend their rights. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter one is introductory. Chapter two briefly defines the issue <b>of</b> personal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individual.</b> The third chapter consists of four parts. Each of these parts deals with one personal right and characterises the rules which mass media have to comply with in order not to contravening the personal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individual.</b> Fourth chapter describes the ways how individual can defend himself or herself against the violation of his or her personal rights. This chapter describes all legal remedies possible according to the Czech laws. It means legal remedy on the base of civil law, criminal law, administrative law and the remedies according to the special laws, complaint to the [...] ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the revolutionary}} period between {{creation}} of Czechoslovakia {{and the first}} free parliamentary elections in 1920, legislative power was held by temporary, revolutionary (not elected) The Czechoslovak National Council (later The Czechoslovak National Assembly). The revolutionary parliament without participation of minorities adopted also new constitution. The constitution guaranteed equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender, nationality or religion. In comparison with previous state in Kingdom of Hungary it extended also political <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> of Hungarian nationality, because it introduced universal suffrage, canceled criteria based on size of property and benefits based on titles and functions or education (typical for previous Hungarian elections) and granted full women suffrage also for Hungarian women which was introduced in Hungary only in 1945.|$|E
25|$|On November 7, 2008 (but amended {{twice in}} January 2009), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals tackled {{the issue of}} the due process <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> who were mistakenly placed on the California Child Abuse Central Index (CCACI), a {{registry}} for accused and known child abusers. In Los Angeles County v. Humphries, Craig and Wendy Humphries fought to have their names removed from the CCACI after the courts had cleared them completely of abuse charges brought by a rebellious child. Because the state of California had no system in place for removing names that did not belong on the CCACI, the Court held that the CCACI violated the due process rights of those who had been falsely accused but could not get their names removed from the CCACI.|$|E
25|$|A red-light {{perspective}} of administrative law embodies deep-rooted suspicion of governmental {{power and a}} desire to minimize the encroachment of the state on the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals.</b> This envisions the courts being locked in an adversarial or combative relationship with the Executive and functioning as a check on administrative power. Where a green-light perspective is concerned, the focus is not so much on actively resisting administrative bodies as a form of negative control (as in the red-light perspective), but instead raising areas where public bodies may improve their various administrative procedures. This approach is derived from the utilitarian tradition, and the priority in achieving the greatest good for the greatest number is to encourage the contribution of the state through means of egalitarian and ameliorative social reform so as to deliver communitarian goals. Thus, the red-light perspective is more conservative and control-oriented, while the green-light perspective is more liberal or socialist in orientation and facilitative in nature.|$|E

5000|$|The Law of the Republic of Tajikistan [...] "On Religion and Religious Organizations" [...] was {{established}} December 1, 1994, and amended in 1997.

500|$|... have {{multiple}} implications {{in regard to}} coercive mechanisms from implicit curtailments of freedom to ascription of vulnerability. The former would include threats to personal autonomy, instilling fear in regard to a potential loss of freedom, an increase of dependency with mistrust of one's own capabilities to manage the business of living and, hence, an increase of feelings and attitudes of helplessness. The ascription of vulnerability overrides the principle of equality between the partners, constitutes and invasion of privacy and impacts on the positive <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals.</b>|$|E
500|$|Even if the {{subject-matter}} {{of a case}} {{is generally}} non-justiciable, there are exceptions where the courts will still review the case. For instance, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but, on a closer look, the courts may decide {{that there is a}} justiciable matter within it. In such a situation, the courts will intervene and review the case. An example of this was given by Judicial Commissioner Menon in Lee Hsien Loong: [...] "here what appears to raise a question of international law in fact bears on the application of domestic law, that is something the court may well find justiciable." [...] In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the court similarly distinguished a pronouncement on the interpretation of a treaty generally, which is impermissible, from the consideration of [...] "the application of an international treaty by reference to the facts of an individual case" [...] which is allowed. Also, in R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Everett (1988), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales took the view that a decision by the Secretary of State exercised under the royal prerogative to deny a passport to a British citizen residing abroad raised a justiciable issue because it was not a high policy matter involving foreign affairs but [...] "a matter of administrative decision, affecting the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> and their freedom of travel".|$|E
