5|$|Government {{financial}} support for the tour was withdrawn by Prime Minister Edward Heath's Conservative government in 1970, but Pegler decided to return for the 1970 season. By {{the end of that}} season's tour, the money had <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> Pegler was £132,000 in debt, with the locomotive in storage at the US Army Sharpe Depot to keep it away from unpaid creditors. Pegler worked his passage home from San Francisco to England on a P cruise ship in 1971, giving lectures about trains and travel; he was declared bankrupt in the High Court in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E

After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the {{backseat}} of his car: after he pushes his luck too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's limousine time has <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing that he was the man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{starts with}} the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players may re-attempt unlocked levels as many times as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June, the French bombarded {{the fort}} from land and sea. The fort's {{garrison}} fought back, and its commander, Rechberg, managed {{to bring in}} more ammunition from Floriana. On 12 June, the bombardment of the fort continued, but by then the French had captured Valletta, Floriana, and Fort Manoel. The Maltese militia left the fort, reducing its garrison to 80 men. By the end of the day, the ammunition had <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> parts of the fort were damaged during the bombardment. When Rechberg and his soldiers attempted to escape, the French captured them, and the fort was in French hands by 13 June.|$|E

5|$|Standing {{in the way}} of Okabe's advance was A Company of the 2/6th Infantry Battalion under Captain W. H. Sherlock. Okabe {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Sherlock's {{position}} on 28 January. Sherlock was forced from his position and retreated onto a nearby spur. For much of the afternoon, frontal Japanese attacks were repelled by Australian mortar and machine gun fire, and efforts to infiltrate Sherlock's positions were defeated by a bayonet attack led by Sherlock in person. By 18:00, Sherlock's mortar ammunition had <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> his small arms ammunition was running short, while his position was being plastered with mortar rounds and swept by machine gun fire. Sherlock held on through the night and was killed the next day trying to break through the Japanese lines. For his actions, Sherlock was posthumously mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{made his}} Test debut in a one-off Test against New Zealand at Wellington in March 1946, {{although}} the match was only given Test accreditation two years later. On a wet wicket, New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the slow bowling of Bill O'Reilly and Ernie Toshack. Tallon made a stumping, a <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> took a catch. He scored only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103runs. Tallon had rarely kept to O'Reilly's leg spin and impressed the bowler, who compared him with Oldfield. During {{the tour of}} New Zealand, Australia won all of their five matches, four by an innings. Tallon scored 123 runs at 41.00 and made 12 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} match of the 1922–23 season, Woodfull scored 74 <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> four not out as Victoria scraped past the Marylebone Cricket Club by two wickets. The next match against New South Wales was Woodfull's first against Victoria's arch-rivals. Woodfull made 47 {{in the first}} innings before being {{dismissed}} by Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey. After exactly 300 first-class runs, a bowler had dismissed {{him for the first}} time. He then made an unbeaten 84 to steer his team to a seven-wicket victory. He showed a liking for the South Australian bowlers, scoring 0, 115, 123 and 94 not out as Victoria won both of their matches against the aforementioned team. He ended his first full season with 598 runs at 74.75. Despite this, Victoria lost the Sheffield Shield to New South Wales on scoring difference; both teams had finished equal on points.|$|E

5|$|On {{his first}} {{overseas}} trip, McCabe struggled badly {{in his first}} four weeks in England. In six matches in that time, he scored only 51 runs at 7.28 and failed to take a wicket after being asked to bowl only 18 overs. After being dismissed {{in the last of}} these matches, McCabe came off the field and despondently said {{that he was going to}} retire. Teammate Clarrie Grimmett suggested that McCabe play with a fuller face of the bat, advice that the batsman accepted. McCabe's fortunes changed in the next match against Oxford University; he scored 91 and took 1/5 in an innings win. He added 65 in the next match against Hampshire and starred with both bat and ball against Cambridge University, the final tour match before the First Test. McCabe scored 96 before being <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> took 4/25 and 4/60, which would remain his career best match bowling figures, as Australia completed a commanding innings victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{first public}} {{announcement}} of the cancellation of the Paramount Television Service and Phase II came {{at the hands of}} the gossip columnist Rona Barrett at the start of December. In response, Paramount released a statement that said the new network had been pushed back to the fall of 1978, and that Phase II had its episode order increased from 13 to between 15 and 22. Despite this, behind the scenes, production continued on Star Trek as a film, not as a series. One of the changes around the same time as Barrett's reports was the realization that all the model work completed thus far had to be restarted from scratch, as it was not detailed enough to be blown up on a motion picture-sized screen. Two further changes took place in December: Collins was dropped as director, for Paramount wanted a motion picture director and not one with experience only in television; and Livingston allowed his contract to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> left the production, owing to the poor relationship he had with Roddenberry. By January, Paramount no longer pretended that Star Trek was to be anything other than a feature film. Livingston was brought back, but only in a writing capacity, and Robert Wise was hired as director on the film to replace Collins.|$|E
5|$|Thus locked together, both captains ordered {{their ships}} to pour fire into the other. So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships {{could not be}} <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> instead had to be fired from inside the ships. The heat from this {{sustained}} bombardment was so intense that the wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in the sides of each ship: during the combat the ragged holes torn {{in the side of}} Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away, leaving wide scars along the ship's sides. Casualties were heavy on both sides: 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh, severing his femoral artery. Fatally wounded and bleeding profusely, Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield. The French casualties were significantly higher than the British, a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood's well-trained crew.|$|E

5|$|The Test started amid {{controversy}} {{following the}} omission of leading England batsman Len Hutton for performing poorly in the previous match. Having largely failedapart from brief periodsto challenge Australia {{in the first two}} Tests, the hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten the visitors' supremacy. Australia made their first change for the series, ending the Test career of veteran batsman Bill Brown after two poor matches. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, but his team were quickly in trouble, with Denis Compton forced from the field after being bloodied in the head by a Ray Lindwall bouncer. At this stage, the hosts were at 33/2 with an injured player, and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup. Having received treatment, Compton returned with England in difficulty at 119/5 midway through the day and proceeded to score 145 not out, aided by several dropped catches, helping England to recover to 363 all out on the second afternoon. England could have been in an even stronger position, but Compton and seamer Alec Bedser were involved in a mix-up, resulting in the latter being <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> ending a 121-run partnership. Lindwall was the most successful bowler, taking 4/99. During the England innings, Australian opener Sid Barnes, who had gained much attention throughout the season for fielding at point-blank range in front of the batsman on strike, was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and had to be carried from the ground and hospitalised. In reply, Australia batted steadily to be 126/3 {{by the end of the}} second day, but then fell to be 172/6—effectively seven wickets down with Barnes unable to bat after collapsing again—before evading the follow on by reaching 221. Australia scored slowly through the innings, finding the hosts' bowlers difficult to negotiate; Bedser took 4/81 and Pollard 3/53.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, Australia had reached 114/8, never {{recovering}} from the early loss of Trumper to a <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> the last two wickets fell quickly the next morning.
