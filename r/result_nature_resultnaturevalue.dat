It is concluded that the three scenarios studied have comparable effects on ammonia emissions and the resulting depositions. Values are low compared to other parts of the Netherlands. In general nature values are high and differences between the scenarios are mainly a result from the localisation of different land use types. A more detailed analysis shows that the scenario called 'Raamwerk' generally produces slightly higher nature values than the other two scenarios...|$|R

The study reveals that Nordic ecosystems play an integral role in supporting socio-economic wellbeing. However, a number of gaps in the existing information base still need to be addressed to ensure that these benefits are fully integrated into the Nordic decision-making processes...|$|R

Errors’ measuring for specific patient group with electronic portal imaging device and proper correction strategy enables to predict, minimize, and keep under control the amount for most of geometrical errors; it also improves the preciseness of treatment and consequent <b>results.</b> <b>Nature</b> and characteristics of most frequent geometrical errors are discussed and clinically applicable methods for their proper managing are described in this paper...|$|R

40|$|SummaryNicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} (NAD) is {{an essential}} cofactor for cellular redox reactions and can act as an important substrate in numerous biological processes. As a <b>result,</b> <b>nature</b> has evolved multiple biosynthetic pathways to meet this high chemical demand. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the NAD salvage pathway relies on the activity of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase), {{a member of the}} phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) superfamily. Here, we report the structure of a eukaryotic (yeast) NAPRTase at 1. 75 Å resolution (locus name: YOR 209 C, gene name: NPT 1). The structure reveals a two-domain fold that resembles the architecture of quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferases (QAPRTases), but with completely different dispositions that provide evidence for structural heterogeneity among the Type II PRTases. The identification of a third domain in NAPRTases provides a structural basis and possible mechanism for the functional modulation of this family of enzymes by ATP...|$|R
