40|$|Earlier phylogenetic {{analyses}} of the marine Rhodobacteraceae (class Alphaproteobacteria) genera Leisingera and Phaeobacter indicated that neither genus might be monophyletic. We here used phylogenetic reconstruction from genome-scale data, MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry analysis and a re-assessment of the phenotypic data from the literature to settle this matter, aiming at a <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> the two genera. Neither Phaeobacter nor Leisingera formed a clade {{in any of the}} phylogenetic analyses conducted. Rather, smaller monophyletic assemblages emerged, which were phenotypically more homogeneous, too. We thus propose the <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> Leisingera nanhaiensis as the type species of a new genus as Sedimentitalea nanhaiensis gen. nov., comb. nov., the <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> Phaeobacter arcticus and Phaeobacter leonis as Pseudophaeobacter arcticus gen. nov., comb. nov. and Pseudophaeobacter leonis comb. nov., and the <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> Phaeobacter aquaemixtae, Phaeobacter caeruleus and Phaeobacter daeponensis as Leisingera aquaemixtae comb. nov., Leisingera caerulea comb. nov. and Leisingera daeponensis comb. nov.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a formula for}} the <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> multidimensional data points (columns of real numbers, "objects", "vectors", etc.). This formula describes {{the change in the}} total squared error caused by <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> data points from one cluster into another and prompts the way to calculate the sequence of optimal partitions, which are characterized by a minimum value of the total squared error E (weighted sum of within-class variance, within-cluster sum of squares WCSS etc.), i. e. the sum of squared distances from each data point to its cluster center. At that source data points are treated with repetitions allowed, and resulting clusters from different partitions, in general case, overlap each other. The final partitions are characterized by "equilibrium" stability with respect to the <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> the data points, where the term "stability" means that any prescribed <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> data points does not increase the total squared error E. It is important that conventional K-means method, in general case, provides generation of instable partitions with overstated values of the total squared error E. The proposed method, based on the formula <b>of</b> <b>reclassification,</b> is more efficient than K-means method owing to converting of any partition into stable one, as well as involving into the process <b>of</b> <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> certain sets of data points, in contrast to the classification of individual data points according to K-means method.

40|$|Abstract This study {{analyzes}} the impact <b>of</b> imminent <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> credit rating on the decision-making regarding capital structure of non-financial corporations listed in Latin America. Despite the importance attributed {{by the market}} agents {{and the existence of}} empirical evidence of the effect caused by rating in the capital structure of companies in developed countries, this issue is still incipient in Latin-American countries. For this purpose, all the non-financial corporation owners of, at least one corporate rating issued by an international rating agency were taken into account, with the requirement of being listed on a stock exchange in at least one Latin-American country. Through a data panel analysis comprising the period between 2001 and 2010 and by making use of the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), the main results that were achieved did not indicate that non-financial corporations listed in Latin America, with imminent <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> ratings, adopt less debts than those without an imminent <b>reclassification</b> <b>of</b> their ratings. These findings suggest that the imminent <b>reclassifications</b> <b>of</b> credit ratings do not present important information for managers of non-financial corporations in Latin America when making decisions about capital structure...|$|R
