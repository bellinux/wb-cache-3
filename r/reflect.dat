50|$|The {{issue of}} the {{photoswitch}} that the <b>reflecting</b> efficiency of the <b>reflecting</b> member may be drastically lowered due to dewing and clouding of the <b>reflecting</b> surface due {{to a change in}} the ambient temperature. The dew on the <b>reflecting</b> surface causes a random reflection. In order to avoid the clouding of the <b>reflecting</b> surface, it has been proposed to apply silicon or the like {{to the surface of the}} <b>reflecting</b> member. This countermeasure, however, cannot prevent condensing of dew onto the lower part of the <b>reflecting</b> surface. Thus, there are many problems in the prior art.|$|R

5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to <b>reflect</b> the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people.

The novels also <b>reflect</b> the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
