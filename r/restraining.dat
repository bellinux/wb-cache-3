40|$|A set D⊆ V of a graph G=(V,E) {{is called}} a <b>restrained</b> {{dominating}} set of G if every vertex not in D is adjacent to a vertex in D and to a vertex in V ∖ D. The Minimum <b>Restrained</b> Domination problem {{is to find a}} <b>restrained</b> dominating set of minimum cardinality. Given a graph G, and a positive integer k, the <b>Restrained</b> Domination Decision problem is to decide whether G has a <b>restrained</b> dominating set of cardinality a most k. The <b>Restrained</b> Domination Decision problem is known to be NP-complete for chordal graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this NP-completeness result by showing that the <b>Restrained</b> Domination Decision problem remains NP-complete for doubly chordal graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs. We also propose a polynomial time algorithm to solve the Minimum <b>Restrained</b> Domination problem in block graphs, a subclass of doubly chordal graphs. The <b>Restrained</b> Domination Decision problem is also known to be NP-complete for split graphs. We propose a polynomial time algorithm to compute a minimum <b>restrained</b> dominating set of threshold graphs, a subclass of split graphs. In addition, we also propose polynomial time algorithms to solve the Minimum <b>Restrained</b> Domination problem in cographs and chain graphs.

The Dincovs' neighbors, in opposition to the gravel mine, proposed to form an incorporated town in order to halt operations. A special election was held on August 14, 1956, and 108 residents voted in favor of incorporating East Redmond as a fourth-class town, while 67 opposed. The town's government passed an ordinance that prohibited the county's gravel mine operations, leading King County to seek a <b>restraining</b> order against the town. East Redmond officials threatened to arrest county employees violating the ordinance, and the requested temporary <b>restraining</b> order was denied by a Superior Court judge. The county was eventually denied an injunction that removed the town from interfering with the mine, due to expired and lapsed permits.|$|E

40|$|A robust {{finding in}} eating {{research}} is the so-called counterregulation in <b>restrained</b> eaters. This means that while normal subjects eat less during a taste test, after they consumed a preload, <b>restrained</b> eaters consume more. An explanation is that food exposure causes stronger physiological preparatory reactivity in the <b>restrained</b> eaters. This reactivity is experienced as craving and leads to an increased food intake. To test this theory, 46 high and low <b>restrained</b> eaters were exposed to food or soap, while physiological measurements were made. Afterwards, the subjects performed a taste test, during which food intake was secretly measured. Unrestrained eaters showed an increase in heart rate, gastric activity, and saliva during food exposure; however, <b>restrained</b> eaters did not.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the eating {{patterns}} that <b>restrain</b> chronic dieters (<b>restrained</b> eaters) can be disinhibited by anxiety, which in turn has been associated with relative right frontal brain activity in independent electroencephalographic (EEG) studies. Combining these two lines of evidence, the authors tested the hypothesis that chronic <b>restrained</b> eating is associated with relative right frontal asymmetry. Resting anterior brain asymmetry and self-reported measures of anxiety and depression were collected in 23 <b>restrained</b> and 32 unrestrained eaters. As hypothesized, groups differed in tonic frontal activity, with <b>restrained</b> eaters showing more relative right frontal activity. Furthermore, relative right frontal activity was associated with greater self-reported restraint. Right-sided prefrontal asymmetry may thus represent a diathesis associated with increased vulnerability toward <b>restrained</b> eating. By definition, <b>restrained</b> eaters are people who chronically limit their eating behavior in order to prevent weight gain (Herman & Polivy, 1980).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 32 - 33) The {{relationship among}} dietary restraint, smoking cessation and postcessation weight gain was studied in 138 former participants of five Chicago suburban Stopsmoking Programs. It {{was hypothesized that}} a) smoking cessation leads {{to an increase in}} the likelihood of <b>restrained</b> eating behavior as measured by higher scores on the Restraint Scale; b) weight gain after smoking cessation occurs more often in <b>restrained</b> eaters; c) a greater weight gain occurs after smoking cessation in <b>restrained</b> eaters; and d) <b>restrained</b> eaters are less likely to successfully quit smoking. Results support the first two hypotheses. Subjects who successfully guit smoking showed significant increases in Restraint Scale scores from before the program to currently. Also, <b>restrained</b> eaters {{were significantly more likely to}} gain weight after smoking cessation. No significant effects of restraint on amount of postcessation weight gain were found, although the proportion of <b>restrained</b> subjects gaining greater than 10 pounds was higher.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although <b>restrained</b> {{eating is}} {{believed}} to increase overeating and weight in the long term, the opposite has also been found: Heavy individuals {{are more likely to}} diet. The objective of the current study was to test both pathways for adolescents. DESIGN: A longitudinal model was used to explore the bidirectional associations between <b>restrained</b> eating and body mass index (BMI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At 3 annual waves, <b>restrained</b> eating and BMI were obtained from both older (M age 15. 2 years old) and younger (M age 13. 4 years old) adolescent boys and girls who were sibling pairs in 404 Dutch families. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling showed that BMI predicted <b>restrained</b> eating more consistently than the other way round.
