40|$|Background: Differential {{selection}} between clones of {{apomictic species}} {{may result in}} ecological differentiation without mutation and recombination, thus offering a simple system to study adaptation and life-history evolution in plants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We caused density-independent mortality by weeding to colonizer populations of the largely apomictic Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae) over a 5 -year period in a grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment). We compared the offspring of colonizer <b>populations</b> with <b>resident</b> <b>populations</b> deliberately sown into similar communities. Plants raised from cuttings and seeds of colonizer and <b>resident</b> <b>populations</b> were grown under uniform conditions. Offspring from colonizer populations had higher reproductive output, which was in general agreement with predictions of r-selection theory. Offspring from <b>resident</b> <b>populations</b> had higher root and leaf biomass, fewer flower heads and higher individual seed mass as predicted under K-selection. Plants grown from cuttings and seeds differed to some degree in the strength, {{but not in the}} direction, of their response to the r- vs. K-selection regime. More diverse communities appeared to exert stronger K-selection on <b>resident</b> <b>populations</b> in plants grown from cuttings, while we did not find significant effects of increasing species richness on plants grown from seeds. Conclusions/Significance: Differentiation into r- and K-strategists suggests that clones with characteristics of r-strategists were selected in regularly weeded plots through rapid colonization, while increasing plant diversity favoured the selectio...|$|R

40|$|Events {{happening}} {{in one season}} can affect life-history traits at (the) subsequent season(s) by carry-over effects. Wintering conditions are known to affect breeding success, but few studies have investigated carry-over effects on survival. The Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus is a coastal wader with sedentary populations at temperate sites and migratory populations in northern breeding grounds of Europe. We pooled continental European ringing-recovery datasets from 1975 to 2000 to estimate winter and summer survival rates of migrant and <b>resident</b> <b>populations</b> and to investigate long-term effects of winter habitat changes. During mild climatic periods, adults of both migratory and <b>resident</b> <b>populations</b> exhibited survival rates 2 % lower in summer than in winter. Severe winters reduced survival rates (down to 25 % reduction) and were often followed by a decline in survival during the following summer, via short-term carry-over effects. Habitat changes in the Dutch wintering grounds caused a reduction in food stocks, leading to reduced survival rates, particularly in young birds. Therefore, wintering habitat changes resulted in long-term (> 10 years) 8. 7 and 9. 4 % decrease in adult annual survival of migrant and <b>resident</b> <b>populations</b> respectively. Studying the impact of carry-over effects is crucial for understanding the life history of migratory birds {{and the development of}} conservation measures. <br /...|$|R
