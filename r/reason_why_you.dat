Sunny Tse, {{reviewing the}} album for the South China Morning Post, {{said that the}} album was [...] "just right for the kids", but added that Talbot's [...] "stunning rendition of 'Ave Maria' ... will blow your mind".

[...] He gave the album a B-. David Burger, writing for The Salt Lake Tribune, gave the album a B, and praised Talbot's range, saying that there were [...] "sweet, playful and jazzy arrangements".

So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E

500|$|Three {{months prior}} to its broadcast, an {{incomplete}} version of the pilot was released through BitTorrent clients, fueling speculation that it was leaked deliberately to increase interest in the program. Executive producer Burk denied the claims, saying that [...] "we hate putting anything out there until it's done, and that's really the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> guys didn't get any advance copies". Abrams {{said that while the}} production crew [...] "freaked out" [...] about the leak, he was pleased that the [...] "response has been much more positive than not, especially for something that wasn't completed yet". The broadcast version of the pilot had new scenes added while other scenes were removed; Abrams also said that there was [...] "tightening and moving some moments here and there", and the ending was entirely different. Burk also stated that the composer, Michael Giacchino, had not finished his score {{at the time of the}} leak, and the most of the featured music was temp music. A variation of a piece of Giacchino's music called [...] "Hollywood and Vines" [...] used in the pilot was originally featured on Lost, as it was created for that show, also created by Abrams.|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a tropical house, EDM, and electropop song with elements of bashment, featuring a drum and horn instrumentation. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, the song is composed in the key of A minor, and has a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Lipa's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. In the lyrics, the singer sets a list of rules that prevent her from getting back together with an ex-boyfriend. The rules are: [...] "One: Don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone / Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again / Three: Don't be his friend, you know you're going to wake up in his bed in the morning." [...] Lipa confessed in an interview with NPR that [...] "hey're not necessarily rules I've been able to stick by. But [...] rules that I feel like it's important to be able to tell yourself, to tell your friends... There's a reason people break up, and it's probably the same <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't get back together." [...] Warren explained through an annotation on website Genius that the track was a self-reminder for people recovering from a break-up to not succumb to a momentary temptation since it is not [...] "a good idea in the long term".|$|E

God replies to the Imperfect Man, [...] "It's not for you to <b>reason</b> <b>why,</b> <b>you</b> too are blind without my eyes, so question not what I command". In the last stanza, the character now expresses [...] his fear of the Lord and his reluctance to question the unfairness of the world again. The medley [...] "These Are Difficult Times / Remember the Good Times", describes the character's bad times and his recovery by remembering the good times.|$|E
