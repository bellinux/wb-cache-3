40|$|Idiopathic normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a syndrome {{characterized by}} gait disturbance, cognitive deterioration and urinary incontinence in elderly individuals. These symptoms {{can be improved}} by <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> in some but not all patients. Therefore, discovering predictive factors for the surgical outcome is of great clinical importance. We used normalized power variance (NPV) of electroencephalography (EEG) waves, a sensitive measure of the instability of cortical electrical activity, and found significantly higher NPV in beta frequency band at the right fronto-temporo-occipital electrodes (Fp 2, T 4 and O 2) in shunt responders compared to non-responders. By utilizing these differences, {{we were able to}} correctly identify responders and non-responders to <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> with a positive predictive value of 80 % and a negative predictive value of 88 %. Our findings indicate that NPV can be useful in noninvasively predicting the clinical outcome of <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> in patients with iNPH...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} CSF {{dynamics in}} fourty patients of hydrocephalus by simultaneous In-SPECT and metrizamide-CT cisternography. These two methods produced apparently similar results. However, In-SPECT demonstrated more prolonged visualization of CSF flow and more precise three-dimensional CSF dynamics (especially in the convexity CSF flow) than metrizamide-CT. We classified {{the patterns of}} CSF dynamics into five types. In In-SPECT, type I was defined as normal CSF kinetics, type II subnormal CSF kinetics, and type V hydrocephalus. CSF <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> was necessary for type III ~ V and type II with severe clinical symptoms. Type II (except one case, they were classified as type HI by metrizamide-CT) were followed up and in two cases, CSF <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> was done because of clinical deterioration. Therefore, type II seemed to need carefull follow up. In-SPECT is useful for the estimation of CSF dynamics and for deciding the need for CSF <b>shunt</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cranial CT {{and high}} {{resolution}} measurements of regional {{cerebral blood flow}} (rCBF) with brain dedicated single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) and [99 mTc]-d,l-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime ([99 mTc]-d,l-HMPAO) were performed before and after <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> in 14 consecutive patients with dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). When compared with a control group of 14 age matched healthy volunteers, the group of NPH patients was characterised by an enlarged subcortical low-flow region, significantly reduced rCBF and enhanced side-to-side asymmetry of rCBF in the central white matter, and enhanced side-to-side asymmetry in the inferior and mid-temporal cortex. Global CBF was normal. <b>Shunt</b> <b>operation</b> reduced the mean area of the ventricles on CT and of the subcortical low-flow region on SPECT. Global CBF was unchanged. All 14 patients had an abnormal pre-shunt rCBF pattern with enlargement of the subcortical low flow region, focal cortical blood flow deficits, or both. <b>Shunt</b> <b>operation</b> improved the clinical status in 11 patients, and {{the area of the}} subcortical low flow region correctly classified 3 / 3 unimproved and 10 / 11 improved patients. <b>Shunt</b> <b>operation</b> normalised or reduced the area of the subcortical low flow region in nine of 10 patients. It is concluded that SPECT with [99 mTc]-d,l-HMPAO is a useful supplement in the diagnosis of NPH versus normal ageing, and that SPECT may help to identify patients not likely to benefit clinically from surgery...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-three {{patients}} with hydrocephalic dementia were studied {{before and after}} <b>shunt</b> <b>operation,</b> and improvement was found in 12. Before operation, the improved cases showed more symptoms of confabulation, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, lack of insight, and constructional apraxia. The improvement was also most marked in these symptoms. The significance of general versus specific symptoms, duration, and aetiology is discussed from a differential diagnostic standpoint, and we conclude that the adequate and early diagnosis of hydrocephalic dementia is essential for good outcome after <b>shunt</b> <b>operation,</b> and that psychiatric and psychometric evaluation enable such a diagnosis to be made...|$|R

In 40 % of the patients bromsulphalein was retained to an abnormal degree and retention was increased post-operatively in the patients studied before and after portacaval <b>shunt</b> <b>operations.</b> The increased retention of bromsulphalein was found {{to be the result of}} prehepatic factors, namely, diminished hepatic blood flow and increased systemic portal collateral circulation either singly or in combination...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesWalker–Warburg Syndrome is a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive {{congenital muscular dystrophy}} manifested by central nervous system, eye malformations and possible multisystem involvement. The diagnosis is established {{by the presence of}} four criteria: congenital muscular dystrophy, type II lissencephaly, cerebellar malformation, and retinal malformation. Most of the syndromic children die in {{the first three years of}} life because of respiratory failure, pneumonia, seizures, hyperthermia and ventricular fibrillation.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{configuration}} of the railway freight shunting locomotives, improve the efficiency of locomotive operation; a DEA cross evaluating method based on grey incidence analysis is presented in this paper. This method is based on collecting underlying data of factors that influence the <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> efficiency in train service depot, which utilizes grey incidence analysis to establish corresponding evaluation indicators system. Furthermore, the method as well adopts DEA and DEA cross efficiency model to analyze, evaluate and estimate the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> locomotives <b>operation</b> in train service depots. A sorting result of the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> locomotives <b>operation</b> in each train service depot has been acquired with help of programming using MATLAB 7. 0. What the result indicates is that the DEA cross efficiency evaluating model based on grey incidence analysis can reflect the actual state of the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> locomotives <b>operation</b> in each train service depot. Eventually, based on a projection analysis of non-DEA's three decision-making units, key factors that influence the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> locomotives <b>operation</b> are identified, which can provide decision support for further improvement of the configuration and operation in train service depots...|$|R
