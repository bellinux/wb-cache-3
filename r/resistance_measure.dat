This study developed and validated a new measure of stigma resistance. Preliminary items, derived from qualitative interviews of people with lived experience, were pilot tested online with people self-reporting a mental illness diagnosis (n = 489). Best performing items were selected, and the refined measure was administered to an independent sample of {{people with mental illness}} at two state mental health consumer recovery conferences (n = 202). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) guided by theory were used to test item fit, correlations between the refined stigma <b>resistance</b> <b>measure</b> and theoretically relevant measures were examined for validity, and test-retest correlations of a subsample were examined for stability.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Some {{types of}} antenatal {{maternal}} psychological distress {{may be associated}} with reduced fetal growth and birthweight. A stress-mediated reduction in placental blood flow has been suggested as a mechanism. Previous studies have examined this using ultrasound-derived arterial <b>resistance</b> <b>measures</b> in the uterine (UtA) and umbilical (UA) arteries, with mixed conclusions. However, a reduction in placental volume blood flow may occur before changes in arterial <b>resistance</b> <b>measures</b> are seen. Fetoplacental volume blood flow can be quantified non-invasively in the umbilical vein (UV). Our objective was to study whether specific types of maternal psychological distress affect the placental circulation, using volume blood flow quantification in addition to arterial <b>resistance</b> <b>measures.</b> METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of 104 non-smoking pregnant women (gestational age 30 weeks) with uncomplicated obstetric histories. Psychological distress was measured by General Health Questionnaire- 28 (subscales anxiety and depression) and Impact of Event Scale- 22 (subscales intrusion, avoidance and arousal). UtA and UA <b>resistance</b> <b>measures</b> and UV volume blood flow normalized for fetal abdominal circumference, were obtained by Doppler ultrasound. RESULTS: IES intrusion scores above the mean were associated with a reduction in normalized UV volume blood flow (corresponding to - 0. 61 SD; P =  0. 003). Adjusting for UA resistance increased the strength of this association (difference - 0. 66 SD; P< 0. 001). Other distress types were not associated with UV volume blood flow. Maternal distress was not associated with arterial <b>resistance</b> <b>measures,</b> despite adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Intrusive thoughts and emotional distress regarding the fetus were associated with reduced fetoplacental volume blood flow in third trimester. Uterine and umbilical artery <b>resistance</b> <b>measures</b> were not associated with maternal distress. Our findings support a decrease in fetoplacental blood flow as a possible pathway between maternal distress and reduced fetal growth...|$|R

The study is a refinement of former control solutions of the process, providing more robust and industrially acceptable measurement techniques. The system uses a solid state laser that melts metal wire, {{which in turn is}} deposited and solidified to build the desired solid feature on a substrate. The process is inherently subjected to disturbances that might hinder consecutive layers to be deposited appropriately. The control action is a modified wire feed rate depending {{on the surface of the}} deposited former layer, in this case measured as a resistance. The resistance of the wire stick-out and the weld pool has shown to give an accurate measure of the process stability, and a solution is proposed on how to measure it. By controlling the wire feed rate based on the <b>resistance</b> <b>measure,</b> the next layer surface can be made more even. A second order iterative learning control algorithm is used for determining the wire feed rate, and the solution is implemented and validated in an industrial setting for building a single bead wall in titanium alloy. A comparison is made between a controlled and an uncontrolled situation when a relevant disturbance is introduced throughout all layers. The controller proves to successfully mitigate these disturbances and maintain stable deposition while the uncontrolled deposition fails...|$|E

The values of narrow-sense heritability were moderate and very similar for the two models. In a similar genetic study on diploid A. chinensis populations, Cheng (2014) recently reported resistance measured by time-to-infection to be similarly heritable. In a naturally infected environment, binary scoring followed by modelling that incorporates spatial trends should minimize any confounding effects on the <b>resistance</b> <b>measure</b> itself and estimates derived thereafter caused by spatial variation within the field. Other researchers have also reported on inheritance of resistance to bacterial diseases in plants caused by other Pseudomonas spp. Olczak-Woltman et al. (2009) reported a broad-sense heritability estimate of 53 % for resistance to angular leaf spot in cucumber caused by P. syringae pv. lachrymans. This estimate was based on resistance measured by disease scores made on F 2 families. Similarly, Sthapit et al. (1995) presented broad-sense heritabilities ranging from 0.72 – 0.84 for sheath brown rot in rice caused by P. fuscovaginae, using F 3 families of three crosses, and the analysis was based on% incidence. Resistance is a notion that can be measured only indirectly using different criteria, such as the% incidence and severity scores. Heritability estimates will {{vary depending on the}} type of measurement used as well as the scale of the response variable analysed. As discussed earlier, our estimate of heritability is presented on a logit liability scale.|$|E

40|$|The {{framework}} of self psychology suggests that narcissism {{can play a}} significant role in the pervasive treatment resistance in eating disorders (EDs). The primary focus of this research program is to examine the differential roles of grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism in treatment resistance in a clinical population of individuals with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. This research explored the factor structure of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI), assessed grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism among ED patients including their influence on resistance, and examined whether therapists endorse eating symptomatology and narcissism (in turn, contributing to clients’ resistance). Study 1 assessed the factor structure of the NPI and examined GN in the ED population. Using a sample of the general population (N = 905), a three-factor solution of the NPI was found: 1) authority and self-sufficiency; 2) entitlement, exhibitionism and exploitativeness; and 3) superiority and vanity, highlighting the three main components of GN. Study 2 explored whether the two facets of narcissism, grandiose narcissism (including its factors as identified in Study 1) and vulnerable narcissism, are present in individuals with either anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa and whether these facets of narcissism predict treatment resistance in this population. Using a self-report questionnaire with a sample of adults (N = 180), findings revealed that 1) VN was elevated in individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa compared to a mental health control group and a healthy control group; 2) both ED groups scored significantly higher on entitlement, exhibitionism and exploitativeness; 3) both ED groups endorsed state-like resistance; 4) both ED groups endorsed one trait-like <b>resistance</b> <b>measure</b> (i. e., significantly lower expectation of benefit); 5) anorexia nervosa endorsed an additional trait-like <b>resistance</b> <b>measure</b> (i. e., significantly higher self-orientation/narcissism); 6) authority and self-sufficiency contributed to state-like resistance in the bulimia nervosa group; and 7) entitlement, exhibitionism, exploitativeness, superiority and vanity contributed to trait-like resistance in the AN group. Study 3 explored narcissism and eating disorder symptoms in treatment providers of individuals with eating disorders as the presence of these characteristics in this population may result in treatment hindering countertransference. In Study 3, ED therapists, non-ED therapists, individuals with anorexia or bulimia nervosa and a healthy control group (N = 955) completed self-report measures. Results revealed that ED therapists scored 1) higher on GN and authority and self-sufficiency compared to all groups; 2) significantly higher on entitlement, exhibitionism and exploitativeness than non-ED therapists; and 3) significantly lower on superiority and vanity than non-ED therapists and healthy controls. Study 4 aimed to clarify and obtain a deeper understanding of the findings of Study 2 and Study 3 by interviewing patients with EDs (N = 14). The data confirmed that participants identified with the characteristics of GN and VN and that these characteristics contributed to resistance. However, there was little evidence that ED-therapists were perceived as eating disordered or narcissistic. This research provides the first psychometrically sound three-factor solution of the NPI in a general population sample. Also, this research is the first to examine the two facets of narcissism (VN and GN) in a clinical eating disorder population and demonstrates the importance of including VN and aspects of GN in the conceptualisation of AN and BN as these play some role in treatment resistance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-A group {{detector}} jointly detects a {{group of}} users, and a parallel group detection scheme is a bank of J independently operating group detectors, one for each group of a J group partition of the I< transmitting users of a Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) channel. In this paper, two group detectors are introduced for the Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading (FSRF) CDMA channel. While the optimum multiuser detector has a Time Complexity per Symbol (TCS) of O(MK/K) for M-ary signaling, {{each of the two}} group detectors has a TCS of O(&ZiGi/lGl) where IGI is the group size. Hence, there are parallel group detection schemes, based on each of the two group detectors, that satisfy a wide range of complexity constraints that result from the choice of partition. Each of the two group detec-tors is minimax optima 1 in the corresponding conditional group near-far <b>resistance</b> <b>measure.</b> Furthermore, a succinct indicator of the average BER over high SNR regions is defined via the asymptotic efficiency. A lower bound and an exact formula for the asymptotic efficiency are derived for the first and second group detectors, respectively. The group detection approach for the FSRF-CDMA channel generalizes previous approaches to the complexity-performance tradeoff problem. It yields the optimum detector when the group size is I<. When the group size is equal to one, the first group detector results in a new optimum linear detector and the second reduces to a recently proposed suboptimum linear detector. All other nontrivial partitions yield new multiuser detectors whose performances are commensurate with their complexities.

40|$|The rate {{of erosion}} of {{hillside}} gullies depends both on gully flow characteristics and the resistance {{offered by the}} gully soil profile to erosion. This paper describes a method for quantifying a physically-based <b>resistance</b> <b>measure,</b> illustrated by application to a gully feeding sediment into the Bremer River, southeast Queensland, Australia. The dynamics of discharge down the gully during runoff events is the driver of erosion, but this was unknown. A new method is described whereby this unmeasured flow can be estimated using data on rainfall rate and river gauge monitoring. The data collected on the gully was the increase in dimensions and volume (and so soil loss) over a two year period. This information was obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM) of the catchment, derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) observations made {{at either end of}} the two year period. The soil profile resistance characteristic evaluated is the energy required to erode a unit mass of soil from the gully walls, a physically-defined parameter, J, present in flow-driven erosion theory, which was adapted and applied to predict soil loss from the Bremer River gully. The value of J was evaluated by equating predicted to measured gully soil loss over the two year period using two alternative descriptions of gully cross-section. Firstly a realistic gully shape description was used, made possible by LiDAR data, yielding J?=? 405. 5 ?J/kg. Secondly, in order to allow use of more widely-available aerial photography for such studies, the simplifying assumption of a semi-circular gully shape was made, yielding J?=? 455 ?J/kg. Allowing a ᳰ% error in estimated effective runoff rate for this ungauged gully, the estimated J value would have an uncertainty of + 1 %/- 7 % using the actual gully geometry. The assumptions made in estimating J are discussed, and possible applications of this information listed. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Resistance and {{tolerance}} represent two general strategies of plant defence against herbivores. Since resources available for allocation to defence are limited and resistance {{and tolerance}} {{are likely to}} serve the same functions for plants, the occurrence of trade offs between these two strategies has been assumed. We review the empirical evidence for tolerance-resistance tradeoffs by means of meta-analysis of genetic correlations between resistance and tolerance obtained from 31 ecological and agricultural studies published during 1980 - 2003 and conducted on 17 different plant species. The sign {{of the relationship between}} tolerance and resistance differed {{depending on the type of}} plants examined. Tolerance and resistance tended to be positively correlated in crops and negatively correlated in wild plants, but the mean correlation coefficients in both plant types were not significantly different from zero. The magnitude of correlations was affected neither by the tolerance measure (reduction in growth or in fitness in damaged plants) nor by the <b>resistance</b> <b>measure</b> used (inverse of damage, antibiosis, antixenosis, or specific resistance trait). In wild plants correlations between resistance and tolerance were significantly negative (r=- 0. 069) only in studies where resistance was assessed as a specific chemical or mechanical resistance trait, but this correlation is based only on two studies. No difference in the mean resistance-tolerance correlations was found between studies conducted in the field and in the greenhouse; in both cases mean correlations tended to be positive. The results of our analysis indicate that conditions under which a negative association between resistance and tolerance occurs and, thus, the evolution of multiple defensive strategies in plants is constrained, are much more restrictive than previously assumed. However, the currently available studies are still scarce and taxonomically skewed to allow a thorough analysis of sources of variation in resistance-tolerance relationship. Specifically, we need more studies examining the relationship between specific resistance and tolerance traits, studies on perennial plants and under different environmental conditions.

40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} {{depression}} affects glucose metabolism, and therefore {{is a risk}} factor for insulin resistance. The association between depression and insulin resistance has been investigated in a number of studies, but there is no agreement on the results. The objective {{of this study is to}} survey the epidemiological studies, identify the ones that measured the association of depression (as exposure) with insulin resistance (as outcome), and perform a systematic review to assess the reliability and strength of the association. For high quality reporting, and assessment, this systematic review used the outlined procedures, guidelines and recommendations for reviews in health care, suggested by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, along with recommendations from the STROBE group (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology). Ovid MEDLINE 1996 to April Week 1 2010, was used to identify the relevant epidemiological studies. To identify the most relevant set of articles for this systematic review, a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Six studies that met the specific criteria were selected. Key information from identified studies was tabulated, and the methodological quality, internal and external validity, and the strength of the evidence of the selected studies were assessed. The result from the tabulated data of the reviewed studies indicates that the studies either did not apply a case definition for insulin resistance in their investigation, or did not state a specific value for the index used to define insulin resistance. The quality assessment of the reviewed studies indicates that to assess the association between insulin resistance and depression, specifying a case definition for insulin resistance is important. The case definition for insulin resistance is defined by the World Health Organization and the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance as the insulin sensitivity index of the lowest quartile or lowest decile of a general population, respectively. Three studies defined the percentile cut-off point for insulin resistance, but did not give the insulin sensitivity index value. In these cases, it is not possible to compare the results. Three other studies did not define the cut-off point for insulin resistance. In these cases, it is hard to confirm the existence of insulin resistance. In conclusion, to convincingly answer our question, future studies need to adopt a clear case definition, define a percentile cut-off point and reference population, and give value of the insulin <b>resistance</b> <b>measure</b> at the specified percentile. ...|$|E
