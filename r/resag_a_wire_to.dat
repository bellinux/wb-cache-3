5000|$|Conducting wire: A {{relatively}} wide pipe completely {{filled with}} water is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> piece of <b>wire.</b> When comparing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> piece of <b>wire,</b> the pipe should {{be thought of as}} having semi-permanent caps on the ends. Connecting one end of <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> circuit is equivalent to un-capping one end of the pipe and attaching it to another pipe. With few exceptions (such as a high-voltage power source), <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> with only one end attached to a circuit will do nothing; the pipe remains capped on the free end, and thus adds nothing to the circuit.|$|R
