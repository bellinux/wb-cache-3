40|$|Community based forest {{management}} (CBFM) {{is seen as}} an alternative way of protecting forests while also generating income for small land-holders. Since the mid- 1990 s, the number of CBFM projects has increased in the Brazilian Amazon. However, most of them face a number of difficulties despite significant public support. Two CBFM projects, located in the State of Pará (Eastern Amazon), were analyzed between 2008 and 2010 to highlight the main obstacles to their long-term financial viability and to assess the cash income that the communities eventually received from logging activities. The first important hurdle in successful CBFM implementation is the complex legal framework: it currently takes at least 2 years to get a plan approved. Moreover, developing and implementing a management plan is a costly process. None of the CBFM plans could have been successfully implemented without external national and international financial support, as well as technical assistance. Otherwise, in the current Amazonian market context, timber harvesting only represents a limited cash income for small farmers, even if forest covers 80 % of their landholding. Market access is very uncertain and smallholder communities do not easily succeed in selling their timber at remunerative prices. Public guarantees ensuring a minimum <b>remunerative</b> <b>price</b> for harvested timber from community {{forest management}} plans are certainly necessary to make them an effective source of income for smallholders in the Amazon.

40|$|This study {{undertaken}} in Punjab on kinnow mandarin has suggested to include marketing {{loss in the}} estimation of marketing margins, price spread and efficiency and has used a modified formula for it. It has been observed {{that a majority of}} kinnow producers sell their orchards to the pre-harvest contractors / traders at different stages. The aggregate post-harvest losses from orchards to consumers in kinnow in two different markets ranges from 14. 87 per cent in Delhi market to 21. 91 per cent in Bangalore market. It has indicated the necessity of establishing kinnow processing industries for development of value-added ready-to-serve (RTS) quality products, minimizing post-harvest losses and providing <b>remunerative</b> <b>price</b> to the producers. The results have emphasized that efforts should be made to adopt improved packaging techniques, cushioning material and cold storage facilities at the retail level. The producer’s share in consumer’s price as estimated by old method has been found higher in local market than Bangalore and Delhi markets, largely because of lower marketing costs and profit margins of traders. The inclusion of marketing loss in the estimation of marketing margins, price spread and efficiency has indicated that the old estimation method unduly over-states the farmers ’ net price and profit margins to the market middlemen. It is appropriate to use modified method for the estimation of marketing margins and price spread...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to estimate and compare the costs and returns in deep litter and cage systems of poultry rearing and also to identify the constraints, which affect the poultry production in India. Results of this study reveal that the fixed investment per farm is found to be more on cage system of rearing for all the three size groups. In both systems, the feed cost decrease gradually when the stock size increases except in medium size group in deep litter system and accounts for more than 84 % of the total cost of production irrespective of stock size and system of rearing. The cost of production per bird reveal that the cost of permanent and family labor and electricity increase with increase in stock size in case of deep litter system whereas in cage system, it is found to decrease with increase in flock size. The cage system appears to be more efficient than the deep litter system in producing eggs and the feed efficiency increases with decrease in stock size in both the system of rearing. Further, the net returns per farm increase as the size of the farm increases in both the systems and the returns per farm is, however, higher in cage system than in deep litter system in all the three groups. The major constraints in egg production are identified and ranked by using Garrett’s Ranking Technique and are in the order of high cost of feed, high cost of medicine and vaccine, supply of poor quality feed and feed ingredients, non <b>remunerative</b> <b>price</b> for eggs, lack of disease control facilities and higher rate of electricity tariff...|$|E
30|$|For {{choice of}} market, yield, FBOs and price of crops are the {{important}} decision variables in encouraging market centre sales. Step one in commercialisation of smallholder agriculture is participation, which is significantly influenced by yield; {{the second step}} is selling at remunerative sources (market centres), which is influenced by these three variables (yield, FBOs and price). This implies that incentivising smallholders to incur transaction costs to reach remunerative markets lies in measures that would increase yield (as discussed already), well-functioning farmer associations and offering <b>remunerative</b> <b>prices</b> for produce.

30|$|The {{increased}} {{emphasis on}} market access relates to its potential to help smallholder farmers break the poverty trap that ensnares them. Several studies (e.g. Al-Hassan et al. 2006; Omiti et al. 2009; Jari and Fraser 2009; Siziba et al. 2011) highlight better incomes and prospects of reducing poverty, sustainable livelihoods, creation of the necessary demand, offering of <b>remunerative</b> <b>prices,</b> expanded production and the attendant adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies and increased economic diversification {{as some of the}} benefits of markets to small scale farmers. Muamba (2011) adds that greater market participation will promote the transformation of the farmers’ economic status from subsistent or semi-subsistent to specialised farmers where they produce only crops for which they have a comparative advantage. In view of these benefits, the growing realisation of stimulating market participation of poor farmers for the goal of poverty alleviation cannot be overemphasised.|$|R

There {{have been few}} systems / models in which farmers are assured of a market for their produce, leave alone a <b>remunerative</b> <b>price.</b> However, farmers have on occasions had to throw their produce away for want of buyers. This is {{one side of the}} coin. The PAR (Poverty Analysis Report) 2004, based on the BLSS (Bhutan Living Standard Survey) 2003, estimated that 31. 7 percent of the Bhutanese population (or about 173, 500 of the 547, 000 extrapolated total number of persons from the sample) belonged to households who were consuming less than the national poverty line of Nu. 740. 36 per person per month. Further, the PAR 2004 indicated that poverty in Bhutan was more of a rural phenomenon, i. e. 97. 4 percent of the poor reside in rural areas   Contract farming usually involves certain basic elements viz., pre-agreed price, quantity, quality or acreage (min/max) and time. According to the contract the farmer is required to plant the contractor’s crop on his land, and to harvest and deliver to the contractor a quantum of produce, based on the anticipated yield and contracted acreage. This could be at a pre-agreed price. Towards these ends the contractor supplies the farmers with selected inputs, including the required technical advice. To be successful, it requires a long term commitment from both parties. And to safeguard the interests of both the farmers and the contractors, it becomes necessary that the contracts are made in writing and duly backed up by appropriate legislative measures. This system when handled properly becomes a lever that would lift few lakhs of farmers to a higher plain. If wrongly handled it becomes a weapon of destruction which destroys all their cherished hope and dreams for a better living. </p...|$|E
30|$|Access {{to credit}} has a {{positive}} influence on the probability of selling and the choice of maize market. This shows that farmers with access to credit are able to produce enough marketable surpluses and then sell these at market centres. Farmers who have access to credit are 48.1  % more likely to sell maize and 26.7  % more likely to sell at the market. One argument is that access to credit gives the farmer the economic power to cultivate on a large scale and sell at market centres. Also, the obligation of paying back the loan together with the interest provides incentive for producing beyond consumption and to incur transaction costs to reach markets to benefit from <b>remunerative</b> <b>prices.</b> While the influence of credit on participation corroborates the finding of Vance and Geoghegan (2004), it contradicts the negative influence of credit on market centre sale of maize by Muamba (2011).|$|R
