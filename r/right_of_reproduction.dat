50|$|The Right to Make Transmittable is one {{of several}} rights granted to the creators of {{creative}} works by Japanese copyright law. The law defines copyright not as a single comprehensive right but as a bundle of various rights including <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> right of performance, right of screen presentation and right of public transmission.|$|E
50|$|In a House Report, Congress said:The {{exclusive}} right to prepare derivative works, specified separately in clause (2) of section 106, overlaps the exclusive <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> to some extent. It is broader than that right, however, {{in the sense}} that reproduction requires fixation in copies or phonorecords, whereas the preparation of a derivative work, such as a ballet, pantomime, or improvised performance, may be an infringement even though nothing is ever fixed in tangible form.|$|E
50|$|The {{proper balance}} among {{these and other}} public policy {{objectives}} lies not only in recognizing the creator's rights but in giving due weight to their limited nature. In crassly economic terms {{it would be as}} inefficient to overcompensate artists and authors for the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> as it would be self-defeating to undercompensate them. Once an authorized copy of a work is sold to a member of the public, it is generally for the purchaser, not the author, to determine what happens to it.|$|E

50|$|Infopaq disputed DDF's {{claim that}} the {{procedure}} required consent from the rightholders and brought an action against DDF before the Østre Landsret (Eastern Regional Court), claiming that DDF should be ordered to acknowledge that Infopaq is entitled in Denmark to apply the above-mentioned procedure {{without the consent of}} DDF or of its members. After the Østre Landsret dismissed that action, Infopaq brought an appeal before the Højesteret, Denmark's highest court. The parties disagreed whether there was reproduction as contemplated by Article 2 of Directive 2001/29, as well as whether, if there is reproduction, the acts in question were covered by the exemption from the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> provided for in Article 5(1) of that directive.|$|E
5000|$|However, the Supreme Court of Canada held in Théberge v. Galerie d'Art du Petit Champlain Inc. that Canadian {{copyright}} law is primarily utilitarian. It finds its purpose {{in promoting the}} public interest through providing incentives for the creation and dissemination of expressive works. This balance is reached by recognizing the creator’s rights, while also recognizing their limited nature. It is recognized that “it would be as inefficient to overcompensate artists and authors for the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{as it would be}} self-defeating to undercompensate them.” This is contrasted by the American approach in Feist Publications Inc. v. Rural Tel. Co. Ltd. [...] that focuses on public interest without consideration of obtaining a just reward to the creator.|$|E
50|$|The {{first sale}} {{doctrine}} only limits the distribution rights of copyright holders. This principle sometimes clashes with the holder's other rights, {{such as the}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> & derivative work rights. For example, in Lee v. A.R.T. Co., the defendant bought plaintiff's artworks {{in the form of}} notecards and then mounted them on ceramic tiles, covering the artworks with transparent epoxy resin. Despite plaintiff's assertion of violation of his right to prepare derivative works, the 7th Circuit held that the derivative work right was not violated and that defendant's sale of the tiles was protected under the first sale doctrine. However, based on very similar facts, the 9th Circuit in Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Company held that plaintiff's right to prepare derivative works was infringed and that the first sale doctrine did not protect the defendant under such circumstances.|$|E

50|$|Copyright is {{a bundle}} <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> {{given by the}} law to the creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and the {{producers}} of cinematograph films and sound recordings. The rights provided under Copyright law include the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> the work, communication of the work to the public, adaptation {{of the work and}} translation of the work. The scope and duration of protection provided under copyright law varies with the nature of the protected work.|$|R
5000|$|The three-step {{test was}} first {{established}} {{in relation to}} the exclusive <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> under Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in 1967. Article 9 of the Berne Convention states that:Right of Reproduction: 1. Generally; 2. Possible exceptions; 3. Sound and visual recordings - (1) Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form. (2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author. (3) Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention.|$|E
50|$|In Canada {{software}} is protected {{as a literary}} work under the Copyright Act of Canada. Copyright is acquired automatically when an original work is generated, the creator {{is not required to}} register or mark the work with the copyright symbol in order to be protected. The rights holder is granted: the exclusive <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> the right to rent the software, the right to restrain others from renting the software and the right to assign or license the copyright to others. Exceptions to these rights are set out by the terms of Fair Dealing, these exempt users from copyright liability covering usage and reproduction when performed for research, private study, education, parody or satire. Changes to the Copyright Act in regard to digital copyright were debated in the Canadian Parliament in 2008. Bill C-61 proposed alterations of the breadth and depth of exemptions for uses such as personal back-ups, reverse engineering and security testing.|$|E
5000|$|ReDigi {{argued that}} the process of {{uploading}} a lawfully bought music file to the Internet for sale through ReDigi's service was not a reproduction under the Copyright Act, because the file never existed in two places simultaneously. Under ReDigi's uploading architecture, as pieces of the music file are uploaded by the seller to ReDigi's servers, the very same pieces are erased from the seller's own hard drive, and scans are performed to ensure no other copies exist on the seller's computer. However, the court did not find ReDigi's argument persuasive. Instead, the court reasoned that the plain text of the Copyright Act made it clear that a copyright holder's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> is infringed [...] "when a copyrighted work is fixed in a new material object." [...] The court referred to the definition of [...] "sound recordings" [...] under Section 106(1) of the Copyright Act, which are [...] "works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{rights of}} a {{performer}} bars any unauthorized person from; broadcasting or communicating a performance of the performer directly or indirectly to the public, with some exceptions; fixation of a performance not previously fixed on a physical medium, exercising the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> of the fixation {{in any manner or}} form, providing the first public distribution of the original or a copy of a fixation of a performance, providing or obtaining a rental of the original or a copy of the performance for the purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage irrespective of the ownership of the original or copy rented, or making available to the public a fixed performance by wire or wireless means, in a way that members of the public may access it from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.The duration of a performer’s right is seventy years starting {{from the end of the}} calendar year in which the performance was fixed on a physical medium or in the absence of such a fixation, from the end of the calendar year in which the performance took place. Also a performer is not precluded from entering into a contract as stated in Section 30. The moral rights of the performer are outlined under Section 31.|$|E
50|$|The saisie-contrefaçon was {{introduced}} into French law by the Decree of 19-24 July 1793, {{which is the}} first general text concerning the rights of authors of intellectual works, {{for the protection of the}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> (it was not applicable in the case of a violation of a performance right). At that time, only police commissioners and Justices of the Peace (the predecessors of instance court judges) were entitled to carry out a saisie-contrefaçon. The saisie-contrefaçon was conceived more as a type of protective measure (and was characterised as such by previous laws) than as a probative measure. The saisie-contrefaçon therefore had a monitoring and even criminal and protective nature, certain traits of which have remained in practice (for example, deposit of the seized objects at the court clerk’s office). The remarkable effectiveness of the saisie-contrefaçon led to its progressive extension - recently through French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007 - to all intellectual property rights, its criminal and protective nature correspondingly tending to diminish in favour of a probative nature. Today, the saisie-contrefaçon has an exclusively probative nature, except in the field of copyright and related rights where, for the historical reasons set out above, it has also retained its protective nature.|$|E
