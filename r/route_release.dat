40|$|International {{audience}} Railway {{operations management}} must cope with {{failures of the}} railway system and with external disturbances that may cause initial delays, the so-called primary delays. In heavy traffic areas of railway networks, primary delays can quickly lead to many further delays, called secondary delays or knock-on delays. This paper describes {{the results of an}} experimental analysis which aims to evaluate the ability of railway traffic optimization tools to decrease secondary delays, by selecting appropriate route settings and sequences of train movements. We have previously proposed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to tackle this problem (Pellegrini, P., Marlière, G. and Rodriguez, J. 2013. Optimal train routing and scheduling for managing traffic perturbations in complex junctions, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, to appear). This formulation considers a fine granularity of the infrastructure and it takes into account a large number of commercial and technical aspects characterizing real situations, e. g., passenger and rolling stock connections between trains, signal watching times, different numbers of signaling aspects, sectional <b>route</b> <b>release</b> of the interlocking systems. The experiments reported in this paper have been carried out {{in the context of the}} ON-TIME European project ([URL] This project aims to develop a prototype for a new generation of railway traffic management systems which will increase capacity and decrease delays, for augmenting customers' satisfaction. The results of the project will be validated through system simulation and real-life case studies proposed by different railway undertakings partners of the project. </p...|$|E

50|$|H. nana is a tapeworm, {{belonging}} to the class Cestoidea, phylum Platyhelminthes.It consists of a linear series of sets of reproductive organs of both sexes; each set {{is referred to as}} a genitaluim and the area arount it is a proglottid. New proglottids are continuously differentiated near the anterior end in a process called strobilation. Each segment moves toward the posterior end as a new one takes its place and, during the process, becomes sexually mature. The proglottid can copulate with itself, with others in the strobilla, or with those in other worms. When the segment reaches the end of its strobila, it disintegrates en <b>route,</b> <b>releasing</b> eggs in a process called apolysis.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} factor in an efficient operation of freight railroad companies is their ability to obtain routes and schedules that improve rail network capacity utilization. In this paper we present a decision tool to aid train planners obtain quickly good quality routes and schedules for short time horizons (e. g., daily) to better manage the limited track capacity available for train movements. This decision tool {{is made up of}} an integer programming (IP) -based capacity management model and a genetic algorithm (GA) -based solution procedure. The capacity management model assigns trains to routes based on the statistical expectation of running times in order to balance the railroad traffic. The GA procedure determines the best initial <b>routes</b> and <b>release</b> times for trains to depart from origin stations and enter a network, given travel time estimates across aggregated sections of a network. We test our modeling technique by comparing the travel times obtained for a network in Los Angeles using these initial <b>routes</b> and <b>release</b> times, with those obtained from a simulation model, presented by Lu et al. (2004), which {{has been shown to be}} representative of the real-world travel times. Our experimental results show that our recommended solution procedure is capable of lowering travel times, as estimated by Lu et al...|$|R
