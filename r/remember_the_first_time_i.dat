500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism that I liked. I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw the cue where Griet opens the shutters. He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere." [...] Desplat was then known primarily for scoring films in his native language.|$|E
500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{had ever}} heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had {{mentioned}} {{that he had been}} in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1869, Dr. Dio Lewis {{gave the}} lecture in Dover {{that he gave}} three years later in Hillsboro, Ohio, where it {{inspired}} the woman's temperance crusade {{and led to the}} organization of the W. C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills came to my house and told me I had been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, I would be in fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H." [...] The prominent men, Dr. O. B. Cheney, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, who had formerly conducted the exercises for the women, sat in the front pew, ready to grasp the helm should anything go wrong. Ascending the steps to the platform, Burlingame was too abashed to stand behind the pulpit, so she stood beside it. Other officers sustained their parts well. At the close of the exercises Rev. Knowlton came and congratulated her and said, [...] "The brethren will have to look out for their laurels after this.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{tour was}} among the first concerts {{attended}} by Britney Spears, who commented [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> went to her show, I was just like 'Oh my God,' I wanted to be her." [...] Spears added, [...] "she just has this presence that you're so drawn to her, you can't keep your eyes off her." [...] Spears' rendition of [...] "Stronger" [...] on the Dream Within a Dream Tour referenced Jackson's performance of [...] "You", performing in a similar vein among masked dancers wearing one-piece attire. Several performances and themes of Spears' Onyx Hotel Tour drew comparisons for its choreography and sensuality, as well as a reworked lounge version of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] sonically reminiscent of Jackson's [...] "Rope Burn." [...] Spears' following tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears used a circus theme, observed to be partially inspired by segments of the tour. During [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] on the Femme Fatale Tour, Spears performed a lap dance for a selected fan while wearing a boa after a pole dance, considered a direct reference to Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn." [...] An analysis of Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour observed there was [...] "definitely a Janet vibe", particularly comparing Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn", [...] "in which she tied an audience member to a bed and proceeded to seduce them", to Rihanna's rendition of [...] "Skin." [...] The critique added, [...] "Fast forward 13 years later, and there was Rihanna, writhing around on a lucky audience member at the conclusion of Skin off her current Loud album." [...] New Zealand's Stuff.co.nz praised Lady Gaga's Born This Way Ball as the best [...] "pop-star show" [...] since Jackson's Velvet Rope Tour.|$|E
