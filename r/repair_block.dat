25|$|It {{appears that}} there was a repair done on the {{portside}} hull. To patch it, a larger portion of the hull was worked away and a rebate was cut around the edges. Then, a repair patch, some 1.25 m long, was manufactured with similar rebates so both parts would perfectly match. In both parts, the corresponding holes were cut and tree-nails used to fasten them from outside. The other repair, which was done to the starboard inner face of the hull at the stern, was patched by an insertion of a pre-shaped block and fastened by a tree-nail. Based on the analysis of the hull, this repair was initiated as a split stopper. Boring a hole at one end of a split is a recognized way of minimizing a possibility of its spreading. The split was therefore caulked, a section of wood around the transom removed, and the <b>repair</b> <b>block</b> inserted and the transom finished.|$|E
40|$|Cisplatin {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used cancer {{chemotherapy}} agents, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Current models suggest that cell killing by cisplatin occurs in a cell-autonomous manner by means of formation of platinum-DNA adducts that, if not removed by DNA <b>repair,</b> <b>block</b> transcription and replication. Here, we show that there is a separate cell-interdependent pathway of cisplatin killing in which damaged cells can transmit a death signal to neighboring cells. This signal is produced within the damaged cell by the kinase function of the Ku 70, Ku 80, and DNA-dependent protein kinase complex and is conveyed to the recipient cell by direct cell-to-cell communication through gap junctions. These findings suggest that DNA-dependent protein kinase activity and gap junction expression in human cancers may influence the clinical response to cisplatin. In addition, strategies to manipulate these cellular components in conjunction with cisplatin treatment may provide new approaches to cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|Genome {{integrity}} {{maintenance is}} crucial for cell survival and for counteracting cancer onset and progression. Mammary cells invest great amount of energy in DNA repair, {{in order to avoid}} errors accumulation in DNA sequence. Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) removes a broad spectrum of DNA damages, mainly bulky DNA lesions. Tissues of Head and Neck region are heavily exposed to bulky lesions inducing carcinogens, this making NER process of great interest in the field. Here we review the recent literature about NER in HNC and we also discuss the role played by NER in HNSCC in the chromatin context; to this aim we particularly focus on the role played by histones chaperon CAF- 1, essential in restoring the chromatin structure following DNA replication and DNA damage repair, including NER. A better understanding of basic mechanisms underlying the DNA damage response, particularly involving NER, especially in the chromatin context, will provide us with new promising way to bypass the <b>repair</b> <b>block,</b> possibly becoming an unexpected mode of  "transversal" control also of the proliferative deregulation, classically observed in HNSCC...|$|E

30|$|The {{differences}} between the prototype beams and the full-scale beams are that the <b>repair</b> <b>blocks</b> are not full length, the tensile reinforcement in the full-scale beams is steel and the compressive strength of the concrete is lower at 4600 psi. The reason for the sectional <b>repair</b> <b>blocks</b> is that given the deflections of the reinforced concrete beam, full length blocks might cause complex stresses on the blocks {{that are difficult to}} account for. By dividing the blocks into sections, pure shear stress along the repair can be applied. The reason for the steel reinforcement is to utilize steel as the tensile reinforcement as typical in traditional concrete bridge decks. The lower compressive strength was specified for the full-scale tests to simulate typical field conditions.|$|R
40|$|During meiosis, self-inflicted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{are created}} by the protein Spo 11 and {{repaired}} by homologous recombination leading to gene conversions and crossovers. Crossover formation is vital for the segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division and requires the RecA orthologue, Dmc 1. We analyzed repair during meiosis of site-specific DSBs created by another nuclease, VMA 1 -derived endonuclease (VDE), in cells lacking Dmc 1 strand-exchange protein. Turnover and resection of the VDE-DSBs was assessed in two different reporter cassettes that can repair using flanking direct repeat sequences, thereby obviating {{the need for a}} Dmc 1 dependent DNA strand invasion step. Access of the single-strand binding complex replication protein A, which is normally used in all modes of DSB repair, was checked in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, using antibody against Rfa 1. Repair of the VDE-DSBs was severely inhibited in dmc 1 D cells, a defect that was associated with a reduction in the long tract resection required to initiate single-strand annealing between the flanking repeat sequences. Mutants that either reduce Spo 11 -DSB formation or abolish resection at Spo 11 -DSBs rescued the <b>repair</b> <b>block.</b> We also found that a replication protein A component, Rfa 1, does not accumulate to expected levels at unrepaired single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in dmc 1 D cells. The requirement of Dmc 1 for VDE-DSB repair using flanking repeats appears to be caused by the accumulation of large quantities of ssDNA that accumulate at Spo 11 -DSBs when Dmc 1 is absent. We propose that these resected DSBs sequester both resection machinery and ssDNA binding proteins...|$|E

40|$|Background: Kin 17 is ubiquitously {{expressed}} at {{low levels}} in human tissue and participates in DNA replication, DNA repair and cell cycle control. Breast cancer cells {{are characterized by}} enabling replicative immortality and accumulated DNA damage. However, whether kin 17 contributes to breast carcinogenesis remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we show {{for the first time}} that kin 17 is an important molecule related to breast cancer. Our results show that kin 17 expression was markedly increased in clinical breast tumors and was associated with tumor grade, Ki- 67 expression, p 53 mutation status and progesterone receptor expression, which were assessed in a clinicopathologic characteristics review. Knockdown of kin 17 inhibited DNA replication and <b>repair,</b> <b>blocked</b> cell cycle progression and inhibited anchorage-independent growth, while increasing sensitivity to chemotherapy in breast cancer cells. Moreover, kin 17 silencing decreased EGF-stimulated cell growth. Furthermore, overexpression of kin 17 promoted DNA replication and cell proliferation in MCF- 10 A. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that up-regulation of kin 17 is strongly associated with cellular proliferation, DNA replication, DNA damage response and breast cancer development. The increased level of kin 17 was not only a consequence of immortalization but also associated with tumorigenesis. Therefore, kin 17 could be a novel therapeuti...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{exposure}} of cells to high levels of replicational stress leads to permanent proliferation arrest that does not require p 53. We have examined cellular responses to therapeutically relevant low levels of replicational stress that allow limited proliferation. Chronic exposure to low concentrations of hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, or etoposide induced irreversible cell cycle arrest after several population doublings. Inhibition of p 53 activity antagonized this arrest and enhanced the long-term proliferation of p 53 mutant cells. p 21 CIP 1 was found to be a critical p 53 target for arrest induced by hydroxyurea or aphidicolin, but not etoposide, as judged by the ability of p 21 CIP 1 suppression to mimic the effects of p 53 disruption. Suppression of Rad 51 expression, required for homologous recombination <b>repair,</b> <b>blocked</b> the ability of mutant p 53 to antagonize arrest induced by etoposide, but not aphidicolin. Thus, the ability of mutant p 53 to prevent arrest induced by replicational stress per se is primarily dependent on preventing p 21 CIP 1 up-regulation. However, when replication stress is associated with DNA strand breaks (such as with etoposide), up-regulation of homologous recombination repair in response to p 53 disruption becomes important. Since replicational stress leads to clonal selection of cells with p 53 mutations, our results highlight the potential importance of chronic replicational stress in promoting cancer development...|$|R

This allows the virus to replicate, package its genome, lyse the cell and spread to new cells.|$|R
40|$|Ataxia {{telangiectasia}} {{is caused}} by mutations in ATM and represents a paradigm for cancer predisposition and neurodegenerative syndromes linked to deficiencies in the DNA-damage response. The role of ATM as a key regulator of signalling following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been dissected in extraordinary detail, but {{the impact of this}} process on DSB repair still remains controversial. Here we develop novel genetic and molecular tools to modify the structure of DSB ends and demonstrate that ATM is indeed required for efficient and accurate DSB repair, preventing cell death and genome instability, but exclusively when the ends are irreversibly blocked. We therefore identify the nature of ATM involvement in DSB <b>repair,</b> presenting <b>blocked</b> DNA ends as a possible pathogenic trigger of ataxia telangiectasia and related disorders...|$|R
