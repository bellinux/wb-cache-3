5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties.

Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry <b>Reid,</b> <b>and</b> organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E
5|$|Dacey {{became a}} senior party {{figure in the}} late 1890s and began to work on {{political}} strategy to win support in suburban seats and from white-collar voters.

At a Labor Party conference in 1899, the party executive decided to put forward the protectionism/free trade debate to a referendum of all party members, despite Dacey's campaigning. Dacey's standing in the Labor Party continued to grow: he was the party's treasurer from 1901 to 1910 and on the Party Central Executive in 1912.|$|E
