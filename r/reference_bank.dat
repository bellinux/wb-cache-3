40|$|Abstract- As the {{genomic data}} {{generated}} by high throughput sequencing machines continue to exponentially grow, {{the need for}} very efficient bioinformatics tools to extract relevant knowledge from this mass of data doesn’t weaken. Comparing sequences is still a major task in this discovering process, but {{tends to be more}} and more time-consuming. KLAST is a sequence comparison software optimized to compare two nucleotides or proteins data sets, typically a set of query sequences and a <b>reference</b> <b>bank.</b> Performances of KLAST are obtained by a new indexing scheme, an optimized seed-extend methodology, and a multi-level parallelism implementation. To scale up to NGS data processing, a Hadoop version has been designed. Experiments demonstrate a good scalability and a large speed-up over BLAST, the reference software of the domain. In addition, computation can be optionally performed on compressed data without any loss in performances...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of benchmarking as an effective tool for improving the efficiency of the bank’s functioning, its implementation {{does not take into account}} the relation between comparable performance indicators, the choice of benchmark for comparison, deviations of indicators from target values with stages of the bank’s life cycle, which cause differences in the intensity and characteristics of development of financial institutions. The procedure for identifying a <b>reference</b> <b>bank</b> for comparison is also insufficiently specified, which is important in terms of adapting its experience by the recipient bank due to the possible fundamental differences in their functioning. Therefore, the article has modified the technology of benchmarking of the bank’s performance based on the life cycle concept and the DEA approach. The research is based on the use of the DEA method to determine the most efficient bank as a <b>reference</b> <b>bank</b> in benchmarking comparison; canonical analysis – for the formation of a list of indicators of bank performance; cluster analysis – to substantiate the levels of deviations of the actual values of comparable indicators from the target ones. The study envisages, firstly, the selection of indicators for benchmarking comparisons based on the identification of causal relationships between the indicators of subsystems “Finance”, “Customers”, “Business processes”, “Personnel development” that arise at each stage of a bank’s life cycle; secondly, the choice of a benchmark bank for comparison according to the maximum value of the performance indicator calculated through the DEA method for a set of banks that are at one and the same stage of their life cycle; thirdly, definition of the range of deviations (low, permissible, critical) of the actual values of comparable indicators of the effectiveness of management of finance, customer base, business processes and personnel of the bank from the target ones. A practical testing of the benchmarking technology was carried out on the example of Ukrainian banks, whose stage in 2016 was identified as “intense growth”...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{successfully}} applied SDS (so-dium dodecyl sulfate) gel/protein blot radioimmu-nobinding method {{to identify the}} molecular size of sperm antigens that elicit antisperm antibodies from patients with unexplained infertility. Following the transfer of renatured proteins from SDS gel of human sperm extract onto nitrocellulose strips, the radioim-munobinding was performed by incubating the strips with patients ' sera at 1 : 100 dilution and then with p 25 _ labeled goat antihuman immunoglobulin G (lgG) or protein A as detecting probes. Unique sperm anti-gens that reacted with some patients ' sera were iden-tified following the autoradiography of the incubated paper strips. Among the fifty-nine standard serum samples from the <b>Reference</b> <b>Bank</b> of the World Health Organization, about one-fourth of them were found to react predominantly with a sperm protein band having the reference value (Rf value) of 0. 2 and the approximate molecular weight of 90, 000 dalton. A similar analysis was also performed with serum sam-ples from vasectomized patients. Some of them also revealed a specific binding with the sperm antigents) of similar molecular weight. The results of this anal-ysis were also {{compared with those of}} conventional tests for sperm antibodies {{as well as those of}} micro-plate radioimmunoassays and enzyme-linked im-munoassays.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} human spermatozoal surface autoantigens, suspensions of previously frozen washed sperm were ground and ultracentrifuged (170, 000 g for 60 min). The antigenicity of the fast supernatant (FS) and the fast pellet (FP) were defined by specific inhibition of spermotoxic and various sperm-agglutinating activities of autoimmune human sera (WHO <b>Reference</b> <b>Bank).</b> The FS and the urea-soluble extract of FP were fractionated on Sephadex G- 200 columns, and the antigenicity of these fractions was similarly defined. Both FS and FP inhibited, to variable extents, the anti-sperm activities. Inhibition of head-to-head (H-H) agglutination by FS was twice as strong as by FP. The reverse was observed with tail-to-tail (T-T) agglutination. Ten times more FS than FP was necessary to inhibit the spermotoxicity of all tested sera. Four fractions were collected after FS filtration on Sephadex G- 200. F 1, a homogeneous protein, inhibited spermotoxicity and H-H agglutination F 2 inhibited all activities (including T-T agglutination). F 3, a low molecular weight fraction, selectively inhibited H-H agglutination. F 4 was inactive. Treatment by 8 M urea allowed a partial solubilization of FP antigenicity. Urea-soluble fractions inhibited spermotoxicity and H-H but not T-T agglutination. The antigen(s) involved in T-T agglutination is (are) destroyed by urea since the urea-treated FP was no longer able significantly to decrease T-T agglutination. These results suggest that at least three different autoantigens are responsible for H-H sperm agglutination, T-T sperm agglutination and spermotoxicity respectively...|$|E

Research fellowships in Oxford and Paris follow, providing the fundamental experience of molecular genetics that was to develop into major studies of the genetics of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with Dr Bob Williamson at St. Mary's Hospital, London, in the 1980 s.

At this point in the interview attention turns to Professor Davies's return to Oxford as professor in 1995 and recent research showing the capacity of the protein utrophin to substitute for dystrophin, the protein deficient in the muscles of DMD sufferers.

40|$|The Institute of Flight Guidance of the Deutsches Zentrum fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Bruns-wick {{has been}} researching a {{perspective}} display format called “pathway-in-the-sky”, which provides the pilot with navigation and guidance cue using a perspective {{image of the}} nominal trajectory. This display format {{is the result of}} the enhanced vision research program ADvanced VIsual system for Situation awareness Enhancement – PROtotype (ADVISE-PRO). Although the pathway-in-the-sky displays enables pilots to accurately fly difficult trajectories, these displays may drive pilot’s attention to the aircraft guidance task at the expense of other tasks particularly when the pathway display is lo-cated head-down. A pathway Head-Up Display (HUD) may be a viable solution to overcome this dis-advantage. Moreover, the pathway may mitigate the perceptual segregation between the static near domain and the dynamic far domain and hence, may improve attention switching between both sources. In order to more comprehensively overcome the perceptual near-to-far domain disconnect alphanumeric symbols could be attached to the pathway leading to a HUD design concept called “scene-linking”. In a preceding study of the ADVISE-PRO program, a scene-linked pathway concept was implemented on a monocular retinal scanning Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and tested in real flights on a Dornier (Do) 228 involving 5 test pilots. The flight test mainly focused at usability issues of the display in combination with an optical head tracker. The flight test results indicated limitation of the HMD usability in relation to readability, see-through capability, field of view and wearing comfort as well as the display symbology that has to be improved regarding attitude awareness, commencing turning cue and symbol overlap. Some pilots sometimes deviated from pathway with scene-linked pathway HMD. As a result of the study, improved new display symbology was implemented the HMD and a second series of flight experiments was conducted with Dornier (Do) 228 involving 4 test pilots in April 2006. The main purpose of the experiments was to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed new HMD symbology. Flight scenario includes some climb, descent phases that have variable rate of climb, descent and path angle and turning phases that has left and right turn with different bank an-gles. The pilot tasks were evaluated comparing HMD navigation with Global Positioning System (GPS), i. e. without HMD, navigation. The study revealed the display symbology resulted in good flight path performance, helping the pilots with on-going and/or next pilot’s action and giving pilot the aware-ness of changing flight phases. However, some degraded flight performance relation to exceeding <b>reference</b> <b>bank</b> angle and difficulty to return reference trajectory in case of flying far off the track, high pilot workload regarding fully attended control in the “tunnel-in-the-sky” flight and degraded situation awareness, visual attention fixation and display clutter were observed with HMD flight in the pilot evaluation. Usability results are consistent with the latest human factors literature on the HMD regard-ing visual discomfort, headache and human visual capability limitation for visual focus, brightness ad-aptation and visual switching between HMD and Head-Down Display (HDD) and/or external view...|$|E
