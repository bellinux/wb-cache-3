The bronze statue is placed near the team entrance to the stadium. [...] When the renovation of the stadium was completed, and the statue unveiled, a tradition among the players began: one player, before entering the locker room, <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> the helmet that was placed at Kinnick's feet.

Last of all came Paula and Evan, passing so close {{that he could have}} <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> them. But, though the moon shone full on him, they did not see him.

5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touches</b> adjacent members, <b>and</b> cuffs other members. <b>Reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|R

The victims could not see the cause of the disturbance, but Tarzan did not have to see, for he knew by the voices of the apes the identity of the disturbers. He only wondered what had brought them and what the purpose of the attack, for he could not believe that they had come to rescue him.|$|E

Lise was sobbing. Janet dried her face and hands, arranged her hair, {{and sat down on the}} windowsill; the scorn and anger, which had been so intense as completely to possess her, melting into a pity and contempt not unmixed with bewilderment. Ordinarily Lise was hard, impervious to such reproaches, holding her own in the passionate quarrels that occasionally took place between them yet there were times, such as this, when her resistance broke down unexpectedly, and she lost all self control. She rocked to and fro in the chair, her shoulders bowed, her face hidden in her hands. Janet <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> her.|$|E

As we passed out into the village plaza, I saw Chal-az--we were so close to one another that I could have <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> him--and our eyes met; but though I greeted him pleasantly and paused to speak to him, he brushed past me without a sign of recognition. I was puzzled at his behavior, and then I recalled that To-mar, though he had warned me, had appeared not to wish to seem friendly with me. I could not understand their attitude, and was trying to puzzle out some sort of explanation, when the matter was suddenly driven from my mind by the report of a firearm. Instantly I broke into a run, my brain in a whirl of forebodings, for the only firearms in the Kro-lu country were those I had left in the hut with Ajor.|$|E

And yet {{what did it matter}} whether Lise knew or only suspected, if her words were true, if men were all alike? Had she been a dupe as well as Lise? and was the only {{difference}} between them now the fact that Lise was able, without illusion, to see things as they were, to accept the consequences, while she, Janet, had beheld visions and dreamed dreams? was there any real choice between the luxurious hotel to which Ditmar had taken her and this detestable house? Suddenly, seemingly by chance, her eyes fell on the box of drug-store candy from which the cheap red ribbon had been torn, and by some odd association of ideas it suggested and epitomized Lise's Sunday excursion with a mama hideous travesty on the journey of wonders she herself had taken. Had that been heaven, and this of Lise's, hell?... And was. Lise's ambition to be supported in idleness and luxury to be condemned because she had believed her own to be higher? Did not both lead to destruction?
