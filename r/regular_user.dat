25|$|In May 2012, a BFK manager {{challenged}} their subcontractor, Electrical Installations Services Ltd. (EIS), {{saying that}} one of their electricians was a trade union activist. Some days later, Pat Swift, the HR manager for BFK and a <b>regular</b> <b>user</b> of the Consulting Association, again challenged EIS. EIS refused to dismiss their worker and lost the contract.

The Scottish Affairs Select Committee called on the UK Business Secretary, Vince Cable, to set up a government investigation into blacklisting at Crossrail. The electrician was reinstated. Further allegations of blacklisting against Crossrail were made in Parliament in September 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Florence {{made quite}} an {{impression}} on the social scene in Liverpool, and the Maybricks were usually to {{be found at the}} most important balls and functions, the very picture of a happy, successful couple. But all was not as it seemed. Maybrick, a hypochondriac, was a <b>regular</b> <b>user</b> of arsenic and patent medicines containing poisonous chemicals and had a number of mistresses, one of whom bore him five children. Florence meanwhile, increasingly unhappy in her marriage, entered into several liaisons of her own. One was with a local businessman, Alfred Brierley, which her husband was told about. She was also suspected of having an affair with one of her brothers-in-law, Edwin. A violent row ensued after Maybrick heard reports of Florence's relationship with Brierley, during which Maybrick assaulted her and announced his intention of seeking a divorce. The wish for divorce seemed mutual. In her memoir, Mrs. Maybrick's Own Story: My Fifteen Lost Years, Maybrick describes the following, as she kneeled down by her late husband's bedside: ...|$|E
2500|$|Manyonga {{opened his}} 2012 {{season with a}} jump of eight metres on the {{national}} Yellow Pages Series. However, the winnings of 80,000 Rand that he had received from his performances the previous year disrupted his life. Family and friends came to rely on him financially and he quickly fell into debt. Coach Mario Smith began to support Manyonga's family at his own expense so the jumper could focus on training. Around this time, Manyonga had become a <b>regular</b> <b>user</b> of tik – the local variant of crystal methamphetamine commonly used in his township. He first tried the recreational drug in 2011 and had used it when outside of competition (when it would not constitute a doping offence), but he gave a positive doping test in-competition at a national series meet on 20 March. He waived his {{right to have a}} [...] "B" [...] sample testing and admitted taking the drug for non-performance-enhancing reasons, resulting in his suspension from competition. He admitted he had developed an addiction in the preceding months and was admitted for drug rehabilitation.|$|E

Sir Peter Parker lived nearby at Minster Lovell and was a <b>regular</b> <b>user</b> of Charlbury station while chairman of the British Railways Board (1976 to 1983).

2500|$|Marketers target {{influential}} {{people on}} social media who are recognised as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify {{the impact of their}} message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or [...] "liking" [...] of the post) than a social media post by a <b>regular</b> <b>user.</b> Marketers have come to the understanding that [...] "consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals" [...] who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). The adjusted communication model shows the use of using opinion leaders and opinion formers. The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.) [...] (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p.39).|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a long-held belief that the {{substance}} use of those who become <b>regular</b> <b>users</b> of illicit drugs marks them out as a distinctive group. However, recent evidence suggests that young people who use drugs are little different from their non-using peers. The rising trends in drug-taking among young people may have accelerated the process of normalization {{which began in the}} 1960 s. This survey, carried out on a sample of 348 UK students, used a questionnaire to examine the relationships between their substance use and a range of perceptions about causes and ratings of the self. It was found that recent drug use was mainly confined to cannabis, amphetamines, Ecstasy and hallucinogens. Almost one-quarter of the participants were <b>regular</b> <b>users</b> of cannabis and/or amphetamines, the two most popular illict drugs. Subjective ratings on a range of statements about the causes of drug use and personal beliefs provided little evidence to suggest that <b>regular</b> <b>users</b> were different from the normal population of students. This conclusion was confirmed in an examination of students' answers to open-ended questions about why people take drugs and the type of advice they would give to others. These findings support the view that <b>regular</b> <b>users</b> are similar to the normal population of students both in their views about the causes of drug use or their personal and social characteristics...|$|R
