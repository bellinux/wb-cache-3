A false positive in this case occurs when the person tests positive, but does not actually have the disease. A false negative, on the other hand, occurs when the person tests negative, suggesting they are healthy, when they actually do have the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{programming}} of the {{stored program}} for ENIAC {{was done by}} Betty Jennings, Clippinger and Adele Goldstine. It was first demonstrated as a stored-program computer on September 16, 1948, running a program by Adele Goldstine for John von Neumann. This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC {{by a factor of}} six and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time to hours instead of days, it was considered well worth the loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any <b>real-world</b> <b>problem</b> was completely I/O bound, even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the speed reduction imposed by this modification.|$|E

[...] It originates from a <b>real-world</b> <b>problem</b> of guarding an art gallery with the minimum number of guards who together can observe the whole gallery. [...] In the computational geometry version of the problem {{the layout of the}} art gallery is represented by a simple polygon and each guard is represented by a point in the polygon. [...] A set [...] of points is said to guard a polygon if, for every point [...] in the polygon, there is some [...] such that the line segment between [...] and [...] does not leave the polygon.|$|E

40|$|There {{are some}} {{questions}} concerning the applicability of meta-heuristic methods for real-world problems; further, some researchers claim {{there is a growing}} gap between research and practice in this area. The reason is that the complexity of <b>real-world</b> <b>problems</b> is growing very fast (e. g. due to globalisation), while researchers experiment with benchmark problems that are fundamentally the same as those of 50 years ago. Thus {{there is a need for}} a new class of benchmark problems that reflect the characteristics of <b>real-world</b> <b>problems.</b> In this paper, two main characteristics of <b>real-world</b> <b>problems</b> are introduced: combination and interdependence. We argue that <b>real-world</b> <b>problems</b> usually consist of two or more sub-problems that are interdependent (to each other). This interdependence is responsible for the complexity of the <b>real-world</b> <b>problems,</b> while the type of complexity in current benchmark problems is missing. A new problem, called the travelling thief problem, is introduced; it is a combination of two well-known problems, the knapsack problem and the travelling salesman problem. Some parameters which are responsible for the interdependence of these two sub-problems are defined. Two sets of parameters are introduced that result in generating two instances of the travelling thief problem. The complexities that are raised by interdependences for these two instances are discussed in detail. Finally, a procedure for generating these two instances is given.
