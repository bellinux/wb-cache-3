English is {{considered}} {{as an important}} language and it makes the Indonesian government decrees English {{as one of the}} school subjects to develop the ability of Indonesian people in English. The application of government 2 ̆ 7 s decrees is by making National Standard School (SSN) which has advanced and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> program. This program classifies the students based on their ability and takes English as important subject in learning process. In order to be successful in English learning, the students need to know language learning strategies for increasing their academic achievement and increasing ability of English. This study is conducted to investigate the application of language learning strategies of the XI grade students in advanced and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> of Natural Science Program at SMAN 1 Dampit. The research design of this study is quantitative approach since it examines phenomenon in detail. The subjects in this study are 140 second grade students comprising 27 students from advanced class and 113 students from <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> of Natural Science Program at SMAN 1 Dampit. The data was obtained using Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL) questionnaire completed by advanced and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> students. The results show that the application of language learning strategies in advanced <b>class</b> and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> are different. Advanced class students most frequently use cognitive strategies and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> tends to use compensation strategy as the most frequently used strategy. The overall mean score of advanced class in language learning strategies USAge is higher than the <b>regular</b> <b>class.</b> The difference of the overall mean score between advanced <b>class</b> and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> is influenced by different teaching system used for both classes and from the students themselves such as motivation or environments of the students. In conclusion, giving different teaching system can influence theapplication of language learning strategies. By knowing the language learning strategies used by advanced and regular students, the teachers can give appropriate language learning strategies training to advanced and regular students to increase their English ability...|$|R

A comparison was made between the children with intellectual disabilities and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> children of comparable developmental level (mental age). The children with intellectual disabilities were also compared with <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> children of comparable chronological age. Subjects completed a preliminary task to determine mastery of the required skills before attempting an experimental problem solving game. The game required subjects to ask questions {{in order to achieve}} a problem solution. Each subject 2 ̆ 7 s level of motivation to solve the problem was also measured using a Likert type scale. Three main dependent variables which examined solution time rates and interrogative strategies were generated by the experimental game: (i) time taken to solve the problem, (ii) total number of questions needed to solve the problem, and (iii) type of question generated to solve the problem. A fourth dependent variable, level of motivation to solve the problem, was employed as a moderating variable in other analyses. ANCOV A and ANOV A were used to determine if performance differences existed among the groups on the dependent variables. Single df tests were then carried out to identify between-group differences. The most significant finding was that there were no differences between the children with intellectual disabilities and the <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> children of comparable mental age on any of the dependent variables. A significant difference was shown between the children with intellectual disabilities and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> children of similar chronological age on each of the dependent variables. No {{significant differences were found between}} students in terms of gender on any of the variables. These results indicate that children with intellectual disabilities and <b>regular</b> <b>class</b> children of comparable mental age employ much the same problem solving strategies and have similar solution time rates when involved with problem solving of game-like tasks.

We also show that extendible cardinals are Laver-generating, i. e., that assuming only that κ is extendible, there is an extendible Laver sequence at κ. We use the method of proof to answer a question about Laver-closure of extendible cardinals at inaccessibles. Finally, we consider Laver sequences for super-almost-huge cardinals. Assuming slightly more than super-almost-hugeness, we show that there are super-almost-huge Laver sequences, improving the previously known upper bound for such Laver sequences. We also describe conditions under which the canonicalconstruction of a Laver sequence fails for super-almost-huge cardinals...|$|R
