40|$|ABSTRACTIn casting steels for {{offshore}} construction, manufacturing integral casted {{structures to}} prevent fatigue {{cracks in the}} stress raisers is superior to using welded structures. Here, mold design and casting analysis were conducted for integral casting steel. The laminar flow of molten metal was analyzed and distributions of hot spots and porosities were studied. A prototype was subsequently produced, and air vents were designed to improve the surface defects caused by the release of gas. A <b>radiographic</b> <b>test</b> revealed no internal defects inside the casted steel. Evaluating the chemical and mechanical properties of specimens sampled from the product revealed that target values were quantitatively satisfied. To assess weldability in consideration of repair welding, the product was machined with grooves and welded, after which the mechanical properties of hardness as well as tensile, impact, and bending strengths were evaluated. No substantive {{differences were found in}} the mechanical properties before and after welding...|$|E
40|$|Posterior tibialis tendon rupture is a {{diagnosis}} {{that is often}} missed. This {{is thought to be}} secondary to nonspecific clinical findings and the lack of any laboratory or <b>radiographic</b> <b>test</b> to reliably confirm the diagnosis. We report sixteen cases of surgically confirmed posterior tibialis tendon rupture. Based on our review of these patients, the diagnosis of posterior tibialis tendon rupture should be strongly suspected in the adult patient presenting with a history of a twisting ankle injury and generalized medial ankle pain and swelling. A flexible, asymmetric pes planus and forefoot pronation deformity with absence of posterior tibialis tendon function on manual testing is seen on examination. This is associated with loss of ipsilateral heel inversion on bilateral heel rise. The patient is usually unable to perform ipsilateral single leg heel rise and has less severe pes planus of the contralateral foot. This study reviews the presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of posterior tibialis tendon rupture...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Cerebral {{vasospasm}} {{remains a}} major source of morbidity after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We demonstrate that simvastatin reduces serum markers of brain injury and attenuates vasospasm after SAH. Methods—Patients with angiographically documented aneurysmal SAH were randomized within 48 hours of symptom onset to receive either simvastatin (80 mg daily; n 19) or placebo (n 20) for 14 days. Plasma alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase were recorded weekly to evaluate laboratory evidence of hepatitis or myositis. Serum markers of brain injury were recorded daily. The primary end point of vasospasm was defined as clinical impression (delayed ischemic deficit not associated with rebleed, infection, or hydrocephalus) in the presence of 1 confirmatory <b>radiographic</b> <b>test</b> (angiography or transcranial Doppler demonstrating mean VMCA 160 m/sec). Results—There {{were no significant differences in}} laboratory-defined transaminitis or myositis between groups. No patients developed clinical symptoms of myopathy or hepatitis. Plasma von Willebrand factor and S 100 were decreased 3 to 10 days after SAH (P 0. 05) in patients receiving simvastatin versus placebo. Highest mean middle cerebral artery transcranial Doppler velocities were significantly lower in the simvastatin-treated group (10341 versus 14947; P 0. 01). In addition, vasospasm was significantly reduced (P 0. 05) in the simvastatin-treated group (5 of 19...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} pelvic tilt on commonly performed measurements on radiography in primary protrusio acetabuli and developmental dysplasia of the hip. Materials and methods: A dry assembled pelvis and spine skeleton was positioned in an isocentric skull unit and films exposed with increasing degrees of angulation of pelvic tilt. The films were then read by two independent readers for seven different measurements used to evaluate the hips and acetabular: acetabular line to ilioischial line, teardrop appearance, intercristal/intertuberous ratio, co-ordinates of femoral head, centre edge angle, acetabular depth/width ratio and acetabular angle. Results: There was so much variation in the protrusio results that no formal recommendation of any standard <b>radiographic</b> <b>test</b> can be given. Only the inter tuberous distance is not effected by pelvic tilt. The acetabular angles for developmental dysplasia of the hip showed the most potential with pelvic tilt below 15 °. Conclusion: As pelvic tilt increases, measurements used in protusio become unreliable, and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging are probably going to be more accurate as one can directly visualise pelvic intrusion. We recommend a lateral view to assess the degree of pelvic tilt in patients with protrusion to ensure these measurements are valid...|$|E
40|$|It is an {{important}} question regarding to the contemporary NDT systems how reliable {{is the result of}} the test. This question is rising connected to all diagnosis system in human medicine mechanical engineering or civil constructions. The reliability of an NDE system means the consistency of capability the system to detect, to classify and to evaluate the existing deviation within test pieces. The main elements of the reliability are: the intrinsic capability of the system, the effect of application parameters and the human factors. At present time we cannot determine all of the effect of the elements, so we have to measure the reliability with different methods like POD (probability of determination) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) methods. According to the modular concept it is possible to determine the reliability all of the modules of NDE systems differently. The NDT section of Scientific Society of Mechanical Engineering recognised the importance of reliability degree of NDE. So we organised a round-robin test of radiographic film evaluation as a module of <b>radiographic</b> <b>test,</b> and try to measure the effect of human factor. The first round-robin test finished and the evaluation method is presented in details as an example of the measuring of reliability. The second round-robin test is in progress in Hungary.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{validation}} of a 'best-judgement' standardised questionnaire using guidelines and algorithms developed by an expert working group conducted in Nicaragua between 1995 and 1997. Prospective hospital data, including standardised medical recording of selected signs and symptoms, laboratory and <b>radiographic</b> <b>test</b> results and physician diagnoses were collected for children < 5 years admitted with any serious life-threatening condition in 3 study hospitals. The mothers or caregivers {{of the children}} were later traced and interviewed using the 'best-judgement' questionnaire. Interviews were completed 1 - 22 months after admission to hospital for 1115 children (400 who died during the stay in hospital and 715 who were discharged alive). The cause of death or admission to hospital was determined by an expert algorithm applied to hospital data. A similar procedure was used to derive the cause using the answers to questions from interviews. Hospital causes were compared with interview causes and sensitivity and specificity calculated, together with the estimated cause-specific fraction for diarrhoea and pneumonia. Multiple diagnoses were allowed; 378 children in the sample (104 deaths, 274 survivors) had a reference diagnosis of diarrhoeal illness, and 506 (168 deaths, 338 survivors) a reference diagnosis of pneumonia. When results for deaths and survivors in all age groups were combined, the expert algorithms had sensitivity between 86 % and 88 % and specificity between 81 % and 83 % for any diarrhoeal illness; and sensitivity between 74 % and 87 % and specificity between 37 % and 72 % for pneumonia. Algorithms tested in previous validation studies were also applied to data obtained in this study, and the results are compared. Despite less than perfect sensitivity and specificity, reasonably accurate estimates of the cause-specific mortality and morbidity fractions for diarrhoea were obtained, although the accuracy of estimates in other settings using the same instrument will depend on the true cause-specific fraction in those settings. The algorithms tested for pneumonia did not produce accurate estimates of the cause-specific fraction, and are not recommended for use in community settings...|$|E

40|$|Properties of {{clay brick}} {{includes}} strength, water absorption, durability, expansion, efflorescence and pitting due to lime. Generally these properties are measured using destructive testing methods {{and as a}} result sampling errors are inevitable in addition to other considerations such as additional cost for discarding the tested component. Therefore to optimize the costing considerations as well as to reduce the sampling errors an NDT technique such as <b>Radiographic</b> <b>Testing</b> was used to evaluate the properties like water absorption etc. Initially a theoretical model was developed to obtain a relationship between X-ray intensity and the absorbed water volume. From that model it was deduced that the natural log of the intensity changes and the absorbed water volume shows a linear relationship. First to find the appropriate tube voltage and the exposure time, a preliminary experiment was carried out as the first stage and from the results of that, the exposure time and the tube voltages were used for the subsequent second stage to determine whether the experimental findings were in line with the theoretical model For the experimental purpose three sets of samples obtained from different locations were used with five clay bricks in each set. The samples were immersed in water for specified time intervals and the <b>radiographic</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on them. Natural log intensity (index) vs water volume relationship was studied and found to be linear which confirms the theoretical model developed. As per the findings of the research it could be concluded that the <b>Radiographic</b> <b>testing</b> method could be applied to find porosity and water absorption of clay bricks.
