25|$|The Roman Catholics who {{originate}} {{from the present}} state of Goa, a region on the west coast of India, and their descendants are generally referred to as Goan Catholics. After the Portuguese possession of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese consolidated their power by imposing their own government and cultural traditions some of which are still retained in Goa. Many pre-Portuguese Hindu (and some Islamic) traditions were adapted or retained by the Goan Catholics. This often includes the Hindu caste system although it is not widely practiced. Throughout the Portuguese Empire a large part of civic administration (e.g. <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> marriage and death, schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc.) was initially maintained by the religious orders and it is still possible to find these records with the Catholic church in Goa. All Goans born before 1961 were Portuguese citizens by birth and many present-day Goans and their descendants are reclaiming their ancestral right.|$|E

Birth registration processes are set by individual provinces and may present unique challenges for Queer families. For example, in Ontario a female same sex couple using an unknown sperm donor may place both their names on the form automatically. If a known sperm donor is used the donor must forfeit their rights and the non-biological parent must legally declare second parentage or second parent adoption. This creates a lapse in legal recognition of the non-biological parent, the family maintains responsibility for legal fees.|$|E
