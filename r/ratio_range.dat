5|$|Frequency {{estimates}} vary enormously. In 2015 it {{was estimated}} that 37.2 million people globally are affected. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1; combining the geometric mean ratio of 5:1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for autism of 1.3 per 1,000 suggests indirectly that the prevalence of AS might be around 0.26 per 1,000. Part of the variance in estimates arises from differences in diagnostic criteria. For example, a relatively small 2007 study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland found 2.9 children per 1,000 met the ICD-10 criteria for an AS diagnosis, 2.7 per 1,000 for Gillberg and Gillberg criteria, 2.5 for DSM-IV, 1.6 for Szatmari et al., and 4.3 per 1,000 for the union of the four criteria. Boys seem to be more likely to have AS than girls; estimates of the sex <b>ratio</b> <b>range</b> from 1.6:1 to 4:1, using the Gillberg and Gillberg criteria. Females with autism spectrum disorders may be underdiagnosed.|$|E
25|$|Cases of extrasolar planets {{close to}} a 1:2 mean-motion {{resonance}} are fairly common. Sixteen percent of systems found by the transit method are reported to have {{an example of this}} (with period ratios in the range 1.83-2.18), as well as one sixth of planetary systems characterized by Doppler spectroscopy (with in this case a narrower period <b>ratio</b> <b>range).</b> Due to incomplete knowledge of the systems, the actual proportions are likely to be higher. Overall, about a third of radial velocity characterized systems appear to have a pair of planets {{close to a}} commensurability. It is much more common for pairs of planets to have orbital period ratios a few percent larger than a mean-motion resonance ratio than a few percent smaller (particularly in the case of first order resonances, in which the integers in the ratio differ by one). This was predicted to be true in cases where tidal interactions with the star are significant.|$|E
500|$|The {{emission}} of hydroxyl megamasers occurs predominantly {{in the so-called}} [...] "main lines" [...] at 1665 and 1667 MHz. The hydroxyl molecule also has two [...] "satellite lines" [...] that emit at 1612 and 1720MHz, but few hydroxyl megamasers have had satellite lines detected. Emission in all known hydroxyl megamasers is stronger in the 1667MHz line; typical ratios of the flux in the 1667MHz line to the 1665MHz line, called the hyperfine <b>ratio,</b> <b>range</b> from a minimum of 2 to greater than 20. For hydroxyl emitting in thermodynamic equilibrium, this ratio will range from 1.8 to 1, depending upon the optical depth, so line ratios greater than 2 are indicative of a population out of thermal equilibrium. This may be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers in star-forming regions, where the 1665MHz line is typically strongest, and hydroxyl masers around evolved stars, in which the 1612MHz line is often strongest, and of the main lines, 1667MHz emission is frequently stronger than 1612MHz. The total width of emission at a given frequency is typically many hundreds of kilometers per second, and individual features {{that make up the}} total emission profile have widths ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers per second. These may also be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers, which typically have linewidths of order a kilometer per second or narrower, and are spread over a velocity of a few to tens of kilometers per second.|$|E

This technique has been improved by incorporating subject-specific skeletal elements and passive patellofemoral stabilizers in a dynamic analysis. After trochlear engagement, the volunteers' patellae displaced laterally, whereas tilt was subject specific. Comparison of the tilt and mediolateral position values to in vivo MRI values at 30 ° knee flexion showed a mean accuracy of 84. 4 % and 96. 9 %, respectively. Medial patellofemoral ligament tension decreased with knee flexion, while the patellar tendonquadriceps tendon <b>ratio</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 4 to 1. 2.

5000|$|Toyota is {{offering}} a new Continuously Variable Transmission on the LE, LE Eco and S trims, which they claim is more smooth, and improves fuel efficiency, named the CVTi-S (Continuously Variable Transmission intelligent-shift). The diameter ratio between small and large internal pulleys has been increased without increasing the unit's case size achieving a <b>ratio</b> <b>range</b> of 6.3, improving fuel efficiency and acceleration. Its forward gear <b>ratio</b> <b>range</b> is from 0.396 to 2.480 {{and it has a}} 4.761 final drive ratio. A transmission fluid warmer was added, reducing warm-up time, and lower viscosity CVT fluid improves efficiency. Its new fluid pump reduces parasitic loss at high speeds. The transmission's software creates discrete sequential shift points to emulate traditional transmissions while accelerating. The S trim offers a manual-mode shift gate in the console shifter, or paddle shifters on the steering wheel allowing sequential [...] "shifts" [...] through 7 speeds, addressing complaints that earlier pulley-type CVTs had a [...] "rubber band" [...] feel when accelerating because of the lag as the transmission entered its power band.|$|E
5000|$|Digestion: Crushed {{monazite}} {{is mixed}} with highly concentrated sulfuric acid (93% acid) at feed temperatures of 150 to 180 °C. The ratio of acid to ore varies depending on the concentration of the ore (unable to find <b>ratio</b> <b>range).</b> The digester is stirred vigorously with a robust agitator and operates at temperatures between 200 to 300 °C. Acid is charged into the reactor and heated before the ore. The insoluble product coats the grains of crushed ore. The temperature in the reactor rises due to heat released from the exothermic reactions. After ~15 minutes, the viscosity of the solution has increased and the solution {{is similar to a}} dough. The product reacts for 3 to 4 hours. It is then removed from the digester before the solution hardens. The ratio of sulfuric acid to sand removed is 1.6 to 2.5.|$|E
5000|$|The NuVinci CVT {{gear system}} uses {{a set of}} {{rotating}} and tilting balls positioned between the input and output discs of a transmission. Tilting the balls changes their contact diameters and varies the speed ratio. As a result, the NuVinci CVT system offers seamless and continuous transition to any ratio within its range. The gear ratio is shifted by tilting the axles of the spheres in a continuous fashion, to provide different contact radii, which in turn drive input and output discs. The system has multiple [...] "planets" [...] to transfer torque through multiple fluid patches. The spheres are placed in a circular array around a central idler (sun) and contact separate input and output traction discs. This configuration allows input and output to be concentric and compact.
