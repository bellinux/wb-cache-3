40|$|In {{order to}} improve the strip surface defect {{recognition}} and classification accuracy and efficiency, Rough Set (RS) attribute reduction algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was used on the optimal selection of strip surface defect image decision features, which removed redundant attributes, provided reduction data for the follow-up Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, reduced vector machine learning time, and constructed the SVM classifier, which uses Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) and multikernel Support Vector Machine classification model. Six kinds of typical defects such as rust, scratch, orange peel, bubble, surface crack, and <b>rolled-in</b> <b>scale</b> are recognized and classification is made using this classifier. The experimental {{results show that the}} classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 99. 5 %, which is higher than that of SVM algorithm and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm. And because of using the Rough Set attribute reduction algorithm based on PSO algorithm, the learning time of SVM is reduced, and the average time of the classification and recognition model is 58. 3 [*]ms. In summary, the PSO-RS&SOCP-SVM evaluation model is not only more efficient in time, but also more worthy of popularization and application in the accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The C, Mn and Si impart high {{strength}} to steels through solid solution strengthening. On hardening and tempering, these elements further increase the strength substantially by exploiting hardenability potentials. With {{this point in}} view, a microalloyed C-Mn-Si steel was designed to have elements {{in the range of}} C: 0. 24 - 0. 28, Mn: 1. 30 - 1. 50, Si: 1. 30 - 1. 50, Cr. 0. 10 - 0. 20, Ni: 0. 20 - 0. 40, Mo: 0. 15 - 0. 25, P: 0. 015 max, S: 0. 010 max and H: 2 ppm max. Aiming at this range of chemistry, steel was made in an electric arc furnace, refined in VAD and continuous cast to 170 mm x 1160 mm slabs. Prior to hot rolling of the slabs, hot deformation and dilatation studies were carried out in a Gleeble- 3500 C system for simulating hot rolling and heat treatment schedules. Employing the designed parameters, the slabs were hot rolled to 5 mm x 1135 mm x 4600 mm plates, which were subsequently hardened and tempered to obtain hardness levels> 460 BHN, YS> 1300 MPa, UTS> 1500 MPa, elongation> 8 % and reduction in area> 25 % in the material. The plates contained> 95 % martensite in the microstructure and observed to have adequately smooth surfaces free from defects such as holes, roll marks, scabs and <b>rolled-in</b> <b>scale,</b> etc...|$|E
