5|$|In later years, Wenger's {{training}} <b>regime</b> <b>has</b> {{come under}} criticism, given his squad's poor injury record. From 2004–05 to 2014–15, Arsenal's players lost 13,161 days through injury, {{the most in}} the Premier League, and significantly more than Chelsea in second (7,217). In 2014, Wenger acquired the help of fitness coach Shad Forsythe to solve the problem; statistics revealed a year later that Arsenal's average injury length dropped more than 25% in Forsythe's first season.|$|E
5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's <b>regime</b> <b>has</b> been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E

The film is set in an alternative future where a neo-fascist <b>regime</b> <b>has</b> subjugated the United Kingdom. Hugo Weaving portrays V, an anarchist freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, and Natalie Portman plays Evey, a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission, while Stephen Rea portrays the detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.|$|E

However, distinguishing between union-only voice regimes and dual channel (i. e. union and nonunion) voice regimes reveals that union-only <b>regimes</b> <b>have</b> the lowest incidence and intensity of HRM adoption while dual channel <b>regimes</b> <b>have</b> the highest HRM incidence and intensity.
