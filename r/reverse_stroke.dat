5000|$|An in-line crank slider is {{oriented}} {{in a way}} {{in which}} the pivot point of the crank is coincident with the axis of the linear movement. The follower arm, which is the link that connects the crank arm to the slider, connects to a pin in the center of sliding object. This pin is considered to be on the linear movement axis. Therefore, to be considered an in-line crank slider, the pivot point of the crank arm must be in-line with this pin point. The stroke (...) of an in-line crank slider is defined as the maximum linear distance the slider may travel between the two extreme points of its motion. With an in-line crank slider, the motion of the crank and follower links is symmetric about the sliding axis. This means that the crank angle required to execute a forward stroke is equivalent to the angle required to perform a <b>reverse</b> <b>stroke.</b> For this reason, the in-line slider-crank mechanism produces balanced motion. This balanced motion implies other ideas as well. Assuming the crank arm is driven at a constant velocity, {{the time it takes to}} perform a forward stroke is equal to the time it takes to perform a <b>reverse</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E
50|$|Screen {{printing}} is {{a printing}} technique whereby a mesh {{is used to}} transfer ink onto a substrate, except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking stencil. A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a <b>reverse</b> <b>stroke</b> then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact.

50|$|With an offset {{slider-crank}} mechanism, an {{offset distance}} is introduced. This offset distance {{is referred to}} as L1 and is the fixed distance between the crank arm pivot point and the slider axis. This offset distance means that the slider-crank motion is no longer symmetrical about the sliding axis. In addition, the required crank angles of the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>strokes</b> are no longer equivalent. An offset slider-crank provides a quick return when a slower working stroke is desired.|$|R
50|$|However, two {{different}} basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds {{corresponding to the}} digit being added or subtracted; a 1 moves the accumulator the slowest, and a 9, the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks ("straight gears") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever's pivot. Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot. The rack for 1 is closest to the pivot, of course.For each keyboard digit, a sliding selector gear, much {{like that in the}} Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered.

50|$|The {{design of}} the Brickley Engine differs {{to that of a}} {{standard}} four-cylinder engine because it implements a new force transfer mechanism that eliminates the need of many traditional parts in a standard four cylinder-engine, such as the piston skirts and multiple connecting rods. In this transfer mechanism, there can be two opposing pairs of pistons located on opposite sides where each piston has a forward and a <b>reverse</b> <b>stroke.</b> The strokes of the two opposing pistons in each opposing pair are synchronized in both directions. These pistons can be linked to a single connecting rod at a pivot point to drive a crankshaft. The focus of the design in each of its embodiments is to reduce the distance traveled by the loaded areas of oil being sheared inside the engine.|$|E
50|$|On {{the front}} end of the cranks, there are 30-degree {{inclined}} rods that are connected to the inclined plungers of the pump proper. The unusual diagonal plungers were created in part by the limitation of the existing engine room. The crank configuration is set in a way that the 6 ft stroke is reduced to 4 ft stroke for the inclined rods. Each plunger pumps water in two pump chambers with total of six chambers for the pumping engine. With the reduction of the strokes and the relation of diameters, a higher capacity for pressure can be achieved. The efficiency of the engine also comes from the design of the pump valves by Prof. Riedler. The pump valves which are connected rings that can move up and down to open can close the valves. The pump valve mechanism is controlled by a diagonal rod, powered from a 12 ft stroke horizontal rod which is connected the crank. The valve rods only close the valves on the <b>reverse</b> <b>stroke</b> and leave the valves free to open automatically to increase the speed of the operation.|$|E

5000|$|There {{have been}} only three parts of a hockey stick ever named in the rules: the head, the handle, and the splice. Originally (until 2004) the handle was the part above the bottom end of the splice and the head was the part below the bottom end of the splice. Other terms in common use are [...] "grip", which refers to {{the part of the}} stick held, {{particularly}} that area held with two hands when hitting the ball. Most sticks have a round grip which is covered in a non-slip, sweat absorbent, fabric tape. The handle remains rounded on the reverse, back or right hand-side but becomes gradually flat on the [...] "face" [...] side and also becomes wider, changing from a diameter of approximately 30 mm to a flat width of approximately 46 mm (the permitted maximum was 2 in—now 51 mm).

5000|$|The {{diaphone}} horn {{was based}} {{directly on the}} organ stop {{of the same name}} invented by Robert Hope-Jones, creator of the Wurlitzer organ. Hope-Jones' design was based on a piston that was closed only at its bottom end and had slots, perpendicular to its axis, cut through its sides; the slotted piston moved within a similarly slotted cylinder. Outside of the cylinder was a reservoir of high-pressure air. Initially, high-pressure air would be admitted behind the piston, pushing it forward. When the slots of the piston aligned with those of the cylinder, air passed into the piston, making a sound and pushing the piston back to its starting position, whence the cycle would repeat. [...] A modification of Hope-Jones' design was patented by John Pell Northey, head of the Northey Co. Ltd. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which manufactured pumps and small gasoline engines. [...] Northey added a secondary compressed air supply to the piston in order to power it during both its forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>strokes</b> and thus create an even more powerful sound. The entire horn apparatus was driven by a compressor.|$|R

5000|$|A {{serrated}} edge, such as on a saw or a bread knife, concentrates force {{onto the}} tips of the serrations which increases pressure as well as allowing soft or fibrous material (like wood, rope, bread, vegetables) to be expand into the spaces between serrations. Whereas pushing any knife, even a bread knife, down onto a bread loaf will just squash the loaf as bread has a low elastic modulus (is soft) but high yield strain (loosely, can be stretched or squashed by a large proportion without breaking), drawing serrations across the loaf with little downward force will allow each serration to simultaneously cut the bread with much less deformation of the loaf. Similarly, pushing on a rope tends to squash the rope while drawing serrations across it sheers the rope fibres. Drawing a smooth blade is less effective as the blade is parallel to the direction draw but the serrations of a serrated blade are at an angle to the fibres. Serrations on knives are often symmetric allowing the blade to cut on both the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>strokes</b> of a cut, a notable exception being Veff serrations which are designed to maximise cutting power while moving the blade away from the user. Saw blade serrations, for both wood and metal, are typically asymmetrical so that they cut while moving in only one direction. (Saws act by abrading a material into dust along a narrow channel, the kerf, whereas knives and similar act by forcing the material apart. This means that saws result in a loss of material and the serrations of a saw also serve to carry metal swarf and sawdust out of the cut channel.) ...|$|R

50|$|An Inductive pump is a magnetically {{regulated}} {{positive displacement}} pump used to pump liquids and gases. It is capable of handling many corrosive chemicals as well as solvents and gases.

The piston and housing are constructed of materials that are inert to many liquids and gasses. Because the piston and housing are non-plastic materials the positive displacement chamber does not change in dimension from flexing and distortion thus allowing inductive pumps to remain very accurate with no significant changes over time. Inductive pumps are extremely accurate as each stroke contains the same volume created by a solid piston inside a solid chamber. The number of strokes can be counted or timed to determine the total volume delivered. They can be used in sterile and controlled environments as they will not leak to the outside of the housing even if the piston has experienced wear.|$|R

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} mechanisms employed durng {{the flight}} of the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, have been investigated through smoke visualization studies with tethered moths. Details of the flow around the wings and of the overall wake structure were recorded as stereophotographs and high-speed video sequences. The changes in flow which accompanied increases in flight speed from 0. 4 to 5. 7 m s- 1 were analysed. The wake consists of an alternating series of horizontal and vertical vortex rings which are generated by successive down- and upstrokes, respectively. The downstroke produces significantly more lift than the upstroke due to a leading-edge vortex which is stabilized by a radia flow moving out towards the wingtip. The leading-edge vortex grew in size with increasing forward flight velocity. Such a phenomenon is proposed as a likely mechanism for lift enhancement in many insect groups. During supination, vorticity is shed from the leading edge as postulated in the 'flex' mechanism. This vorticity would enhance upstroke lift if it was recaptured diring subsequent translation, but it is not. Instead, the vorticity is left behind and the upstroke circulation builds up slowly. A small jet provides additional thrust as the trailing edges approach {{at the end of}} the upstroke.

40|$|Lengthening {{of active}} muscle is an {{essential}} feature of animal locomotion, but the molecular processes occurring are incompletely understood. We therefore examined and modelled tension responses to ramp stretches (5 % fibre length, L 0) {{over a wide range}} of velocities (0. 1 – 10 L 0 s− 1) of tetanized intact rat muscle fibre bundles (L 0 ∼ 2 mm) with a resting sarcomere length of 2. 5 μm at 20 °C. Tension rose to a peak during stretch and decayed afterwards to a level which was higher than the prestretch tetanic tension. This residual force enhancement was insensitive to velocity. The tension rise during stretch showed an early transition (often appearing as an inflection) at ∼ 1 ms. Both the stretch (L 1) and the tension rise at this transition increased in proportion to velocity. A second transition, marked by a reduction in slope, occurred at a stretch of ∼ 18 nm per half-sarcomere; the rise in tension at this transition increased with velocity towards a plateau. Based on analyses of the velocity dependence of the tension and modelling, we propose that the initial steep increase in tension arises from increasing strain of all attached crossbridges and that the first transition reflects the tension loss due to the original post-stroke heads executing a <b>reverse</b> power <b>stroke.</b> Modelling indicates that the reduction in slope at the second transition occurs when the last of the heads that were attached {{at the start of the}} ramp become detached. Thereafter, the crossbridge cycle is largely truncated, with prepower stroke crossbridges rapidly detaching at high strain and attaching at low strain, the tension being borne mainly by the prestroke heads. Analysis of the tension decay after the ramp and the velocity dependence of the peak tension suggest that a non-crossbridge component increasingly develops tension throughout the stretch; this decays only slowly, reaching at 500 ms after the ramp ∼ 20 % of its peak value. This is supported by the finding that, in the presence of 10 μmN-benzyl-p-toluene sulphonamide (a myosin inhibitor), while isometric tension is reduced to ∼ 15 %, and the crossbridge contribution to stretch-induced tension rise is reduced to 30 – 40 %, the peak non-crossbridge contribution and the residual force enhancement remain high. We propose that the residual force enhancement is due to changes upon activation in parallel elastic elements, specifically that titin stiffens and C-protein–actin interactions may be recruited...|$|R
