50|$|<b>Ressor</b> Lake became Middleton Lake {{after the}} Middletons bought {{the land from}} the Ressors {{at the turn of}} the century. In 1920, the Middletons sold their land to George and Annie Preston who {{developed}} the lakeshore as a summer tourist resort in the early 1920s. In 1915, Preston built a large red brick, eleven-room farmhouse to the north of lot 13 which still stands today (2008). In 1923, the residence became the first to have electricity in the area, powered by a Delco generator in the basement. Preston's entrepreneurial spirit saw him and his family living in the basement as he used the home for hotel guests during the summers of the 1920s, and since the lane to his house was the only access to the lake, Preston would charge a toll fee of 25 cents for cars and 10 cents for horses and carriages to use the lane for lake access.|$|E
40|$|The l) <b>resSOr</b> {{action of}} tyramine, shown by Carlsson et al. (1957) to he absent in animals treated with reserpine, is {{restored}} by infusion of norepinephrine (Burn and Rand, 1958). These facts led the latter workers {{to advance the}} hypothesis that {{at least part of}} the pressor activity of tyrarnine might he attributed to a release of norepinephrine. Recently it has l) een shown that tyramine can reduce the concen-tration of catecholamines in the heart of the intact rat (Potter et al., 1962). Thus, direct evidence for a catecholamine depleting action of tyramine in the intact animal is provided. Guanethidine is a relatively new drug which selectively interrupts adrenergic nerve trans-mission at the neuroeffector junction (Maxwell et al., 1960). It, like reserpine, can also deplete the stores of norepinephrine in the walls of arteries, in the heart, and in other organs pos-sessing sympathetic innervation (Cass et al. ...|$|E
