500|$|While many Star Trek episodes {{dealt with}} false deities, The Final Frontier {{is one of}} the few that, in the words of {{religious}} scholar Ross Shepard Kraemer, [...] "intentionally confronted and explored theological questions, including the existence of God." [...] Theologian Larry Kreitzer dubbed it the film most preoccupied with religious ideas. According to the film, centuries in the future, beliefs in Eden persist, even among other alien races such as the Klingons and Romulans. Moreoever, the view of God is homogenized— no one disputes Sybok's references to God as a [...] "he". Kreitzer finds that the film's theological interpretation is offered by Kirk's words: [...] "Maybe He [...] is not out there, Bones. Maybe He's <b>right</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human heart." ...|$|E

[...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. <b>Right</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 27, Federal {{prosecutors}} played four recordings {{from among}} the thousands of intercepted calls from Blagojevich's home and campaign offices. Although lawmakers trying to build an impeachment case wanted to hear more, the prosecutors feared further collaboration could jeopardize the criminal case against the governor. The recordings played at the impeachment trial were taped in November and December and revealed efforts by Blagojevich to collect money from a horse track owner in exchange for signing legislation benefiting the racing industry, prosecutors said. State Senator Dan Cronin said hearing the recordings [...] "hits me <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach. It sort of reminds me of some Hollywood movie {{or a couple of}} thugs in a car driving around." [...] Daniel Cain, an FBI agent who investigated Blagojevich for years, also testified on January 27 and answered questions that did not extend to information not presented in the affidavit.|$|E

The last fuel stop was out of sequence and my crew chief put on the pit board that he questioned my gas. ... So I knew we weren't {{going to make it}} to the end without fueling.

40|$|The endemic underuse {{of radio}} {{spectrum}} constitutes a {{tragedy of the}} regulatory commons. Like other common interest tragedies, the outcome results from a legal or market structure that prevents economic actors from executing socially efficient bargains. In wireless markets, innovative applications often provoke claims by incumbent radio users that the new traffic will interfere with existing services. Sometimes these concerns are mitigated via market transactions, a la “Coasian bargaining. ” Other times, however, solutions cannot be found even when social gains dominate the cost of spillovers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> recent “LightSquared debacle,” such spectrum allocation failure played out. GPS interests that access frequencies adjacent to the band hosting LightSquared’s new nationwide mobile network complained that the wireless entrant would harm the operation of locational devices. Based on these complaints, regulators then killed LightSquared’s planned 4 G network. Conservative estimates placed the prospective 4 G consumer gains at least {{an order of magnitude}} above GPS losses. “Win win” bargains were theoretically available, fixing GPS vulnerabilities while welcoming the highly valuable wireless innovation. Yet transaction costs—largely caused by policy choices to issue limited and highly fragmented spectrum usage <b>rights</b> (<b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> GPS band) —proved prohibitive. This episode provides a template for understanding market and non-market failure in radio spectrum allocation...|$|R
