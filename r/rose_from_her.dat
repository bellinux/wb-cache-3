5|$|The other version, {{from the}} Pranatoshini Tantra and {{attributed}} to Svatantra Tantra, is narrated by Shiva. He recounts that his consort Chandika (identified with Parvati) was engrossed in coitus {{with him in}} reverse posture, but became enraged at his seminal emission. Her attendants Dakini and Varnini <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> body. The rest of the tale {{is similar to the}} earlier version, although the river is called Pushpabhadra, the day of Chhinnamasta's birth is called Viraratri, and upon seeing the pale Parvati, Shiva becomes infuriated and assumes the form of Krodha Bhairava. This version is retold in the Shaktisamgama Tantra (c. 16th century), in which Chinnamasta forms a triad with Kali and Tara.|$|E

25|$|Grace Raymond Hebard (July 2, 1861 – October 1936) gained {{prominence}} as a Wyoming historian, suffragist, pioneering scholar, prolific writer, political {{economist and}} noted University of Wyoming educator. Hebard's standing {{as a historian}} in part <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> years trekking Wyoming's high plains and mountains seeking first-hand accounts of Wyoming's early pioneers. Today her books on Wyoming history are sometimes challenged due to Hebard's tendency to romanticize the Old West, spurring questions regarding accuracy of her research findings. In particular, her conclusion after decades of field research that Sacajawea (participant in the Lewis and Clark Expedition) was buried in Wyoming's Wind River Indian Reservation is called into question.|$|E

500|$|On March 30, 1995, Selena {{contacted}} Leonard Wong {{about the}} perfume samples {{he had made}} for her. According to Wong, Selena told him she would be meeting Saldívar {{the next morning to}} pick up the samples that had been stolen from her. The same day, she told another employee at the boutique she was expecting to fire Saldívar. At 7:30a.m. (CST) Friday, March 31, Selena <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> bed, donned green workout sweats, and left for Saldívar's motel room. At the motel, Saldívar told Selena she had been raped in Mexico. Selena took her to Doctors Regional Hospital, where medical staff noticed Saldívar showed [...] "clear symptoms of depression." [...] Saldívar told medical staff she had bled [...] "a little". The staff noticed Selena angrily respond that Saldívar had told her the opposite, that she was bleeding copiously the day before. Nurse Carla Anthony informed Saldívar she needed to travel to San Antonio to obtain a gynecological examination because Saldívar [...] "was a resident of San Antonio, the hospital was in Corpus, and the rape occurred outside the country." [...] While driving back to the motel, Selena told Saldívar it would be best if they stayed apart for a while to avoid upsetting Quintanilla, Jr. According to Dr. Martinez, Selena had tried to contact him that morning but he could not speak on the telephone because he was performing surgery. At 10:00a.m. (CST), Quintanilla, Jr. contacted Pérez to determine the whereabouts of Selena; she was due to record a song at Q-Productions that morning and had not arrived. Pérez called Selena on her cellular telephone and reminded her of the scheduled recording. She told him she had forgotten the session and she was [...] "taking care of one last [...] business" [...] and would be at Q-Productions soon after. This was the last telephone call Selena answered and was the last time Pérez heard her voice.|$|E
