40|$|The {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} point kinetics equations {{in the presence of}} Newtonian temperature feedback has been a challenging issue for analyzing the reactor transients. <b>Reactor</b> point <b>kinetics</b> equations are a system of stiff ordinary differential equations which need special numerical treatments.

40|$|Traditional safety {{performance}} requirements for nuclear reactors {{have been developed}} for critical <b>reactors,</b> whose <b>kinetics</b> characteristics differ significantly from sub-critical, accelerator-driven nuclear reactors. In a critical nuclear reactor, relatively small amounts of reactivity (negative or positive) can produce large changes in the fission rate. In sub-critical reactors, the self-multiplication (k) decreases as the sub-criticality (1 -k) increases, and the responsiveness to small reactivity changes decreases. This makes sub-critical nuclear reactors less responsive to positive reactivity insertions than critical reactors. Also, larger negative reactivity insertions are needed in sub-critical reactors to shut down the fission chain if the neutron source remains. This paper presents the results from a computational analysis of the {{safety performance}} of sub-critical, accelerator-driven nuclear <b>reactors.</b> Coupled <b>kinetics</b> and thermal-hydraulics models are used to quantify the effectiveness of traditional protection and control system designs in sub-critical reactors.

40|$|Interactions of {{reacting}} flows with {{surfaces are}} modeled. In particular, two processes are studied: catalytic oxidation and plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PECVD). In the catalytic oxidation work, detailed reaction mechanisms and multicomponent transport models are considered to predict {{the behavior of the}} reactor and understand long-standing design issues. In the PECVD work, experimental data are analyzed with a detailed reacting-flow model to infer gas-phase kinetics. ^ In particular, the surface ignition and gas-phase ignition of H 2 in air over platinum are studied in a stagnation-point flow geometry. Fuel self-inhibition of the surface ignition and catalyst-induced inhibition of homogeneous ignition of H 2 /air mixtures near platinum are observed, in agreement with experiments. Chemical analysis tools, such as sensitivity analysis at turning points, and reaction path analysis have been developed to gain insight into the oxidation process. Hierarchically reduced models needed for process design and on-line control are subsequently derived. Implications for ignition and selectivity in oxidation of hydrocarbons near catalysts are also discussed. ^ To fully understand the bifurcation behavior and instabilities of oxidation systems, a methodology is developed to perform local stability analysis on-the-fly, as the stationary solutions are computed, for spatially distributive reacting flows. A premixed mixture of H 2 /air impinging onto an inert surface is considered as an application example, and oscillations are predicted for the first time using detailed chemistry. ^ PECVD is also a complex process involving not only neutral transport and reactions (homogeneous and heterogeneous) but also the discharge structure and physics. For PECVD <b>reactors,</b> <b>kinetics</b> data are still scarce. Using a detailed mathematical stagnation-plug-flow model to analyze CH 4 /Ar PECVD experiments, gas-phase kinetics are quantitatively obtained. The rate of CH 4 dissociation by electron impact is deduced, and a logarithmic correlation is observed between the CH 4 rate constant and the mean electron energy. Generalization of this analysis to calculate rate constants of other reactions is also discussed. Spatially nonuniform reaction rates are found caused primarily by entrance effects through the opening for flow of reagents. ...|$|R
