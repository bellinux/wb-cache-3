5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E

5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that {{spends most}} of the day lying still on the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The litter size varies from two to 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen, a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> angel sharks to fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> ecosystems.|$|E

40|$|AbstractResilience is a {{key term}} in {{disaster}} risk management (DRM).

This paper summarises the problems <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> definitions, highlighting the key aspects where there are differences in interpretation. In light of these differences, a conceptual framework for examining multiple interpretations <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> in DRM is presented. The paper suggests that a strict consensus on the definition <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> is not practical or perhaps not even possible. Adopting the concept <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> in a range of contexts inherently requires some flexibility in meaning.

5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings.

Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578.

5|$|The <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> Indonesian Republican {{resistance}} and active international diplomacy set world opinion against the Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony. The second 'police action' was a diplomatic {{disaster for the}} Dutch cause. The newly appointed United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson pushed the Netherlands government into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations but until then defied by the Netherlands. The Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI). It would include all {{the territory of the}} former Dutch East Indies with the exception of Netherlands New Guinea; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. The other issue on which Indonesia gave concessions was Netherlands East Indies debt. Indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of £4.3billion, much of which was directly attributable to Dutch attempts to crush the revolution. Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} variety of {{definitions}} proposed for "resilience" within sustainability science and suggests a typology according to the specific degree of normativity.

Even though increased conceptual vagueness can be valuable to foster communication across disciplines and between science and practice, both conceptual clarity and practical relevance of the concept <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> are critically in danger. The fundamental question is what conceptual structure we want resilience to have. This article argues that a clearly specified, descriptive concept <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> is critical in providing a counterbalance to the use <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> as a vague boundary object.

40|$|International audienceResilience {{thinking}} has many parallels {{in the study}} of geomorphology. Similarities and intersections exist between the scientific discipline of geomorphology and the scientific concept <b>of</b> <b>resilience.</b> Many <b>of</b> the core themes fundamental to geomorphology are closely related to the key themes <b>of</b> <b>resilience.</b> Applications <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> thinking {{in the study of}} natural and human systems have expanded, based on the fundamental premise that ecosystems, economies, and societies must be managed as linked social-ecological systems. Despite geomorphology and resilience sharing core themes, appreciation is limited of the history and development of geomorphology as a field of scientific endeavor by many in the field <b>of</b> <b>resilience,</b> as well as a limited awareness of the foundations of the former in the more recent emergence <b>of</b> <b>resilience.</b> This potentially limits applications <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> concepts to the study of geomorphology. In this manuscript we provide a collective examination <b>of</b> geomorphology and <b>resilience</b> as a means to conceptually advance both areas of study, as well as to further cement the relevance and importance of not only understanding the complexities of geomorphic systems in an emerging world of interdisciplinary challenges but also the importance of viewing humans as an intrinsic component of geomorphic systems rather than just an external driver. The application of the concepts of hierarchy and scale, fundamental tenets of the study of geomorphic systems, provide a means to overcome contemporary scale-limited approaches within resilience studies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to discuss {{conceptual}} frameworks and research models on resilience theory. The constructs <b>of</b> <b>resilience,</b> the history <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> theory, models <b>of</b> <b>resilience,</b> variables <b>of</b> <b>resilience,</b> career resilience, and organizational resilience will be examined and discussed as they relate to leadership development. The literature demonstrates that there is a direct relationship between the stress of the leader’s job and his or her ability to maintain resilience in the face of prolonged contact with adversity. This article discusses resilience theory as it relates to leadership development. The concept associated with resilience, which includes thriving and hardiness, is explored with the belief that resilient leaders are invaluable to the sustainability of an organization. In addition, the constructs <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> and the history <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> studies in the field of psychiatry, developmental psychopathy, human development, medicine, epidemiology, and the social sciences are examined. Survival, recovery, and thriving are concepts associated with resilience and describe the stage at which a person may be during or after facing adversity. The concept of “thriving” refers to a person’s ability to go beyond his or her original level of functioning and to grow and function despite repeated exposure to stressful experiences. The literature suggests a number of variables that characterize resilience and thriving. These variables include positive self-esteem, hardiness, strong coping skills, a sense of coherence, self-efficacy, optimism, strong social resources, adaptability, risk-taking, low fear of failure, determination, perseverance, and a high tolerance of uncertainty. These are reviewed in this article.

25|$|Agriculture {{can be seen}} as a {{significant}} example which the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial ecosystems should be considered. The organic matter (elements carbon and nitrogen) in soil, which is supposed to be recharged by multiple plants, is the main source of nutrients for crop growth. At the same time, intensive agriculture practices in response to global food demand and shortages involves the removal of weeds and the application of fertilisers to increase food production. However, as a result of agricultural intensification and the application of herbicides to control weeds, fertilisers to accelerate and increase crop growth and pesticides to control insects, plant biodiversity is reduced as is the supply of organic matter to replenish soil nutrients and prevent run-off. This leads to a reduction in soil fertility and productivity. More sustainable agricultural practices would take into account and estimate the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> the land and monitor and balance the input and output of organic matter.|$|E

40|$|Background: Resilience {{refers to}} a dynamic process that results in {{adaptation}} {{in the context of}} significant adversity (Margalit 2004). The concept <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> has been <b>of</b> interest to various professional groups for many years; however, it is only recently that the nursing profession has begun to recognise its potential contribution in diverse clinical contexts. Objective: First, to identify current theoretical and operational definitions <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> and second, to identify and describe defining attributes <b>of</b> <b>resilience.</b> Methods: The method of inquiry was guided by Walker and Avant’s (1995) approach to concept analysis. Findings: From this analysis, a conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> postulates that the constructs of self-efficacy, hope and coping are defining attributes <b>of</b> <b>resilience.</b> Discussion: Resilience appears to be a process that can be developed at any time during lifespan, and thus is not an inherent characteristic of personality. Further, the development <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> is based on the synergy shared between individuals and their environments and experiences. Conclusions: Further theoretical clarification {{of the ways in which}} individuals transform stressful experiences into opportunities for increased growth may contribute to nursing knowledge in the form of better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>resilience</b> concept in the context of identifying strategies that build it...|$|R
