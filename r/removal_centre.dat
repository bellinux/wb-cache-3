At {{the end of}} the bypass, the road {{suddenly}} loses the broad expanse of tarmac and looks like a minor B road and becomes Bedford Road; there are speed cameras here. It passes through Milton Ernest, passing the Queen's Head pub and the exit for the notorious Yarl's Wood Immigration <b>Removal</b> <b>Centre.</b> It then carries on for around three miles, passing the Falcon pub near Bletsoe then passes Sharnbrook at a Roundabout. Around a mile later it crosses the border into Northamptonshire and enters the district of East Northamptonshire. It passes through the village of Wymington, and passes the exit to the well known Santa Pod Raceway, bypasses the towns of Rushden and Higham Ferrers, arriving at the Chown's Mill roundabout with the A45. From here the road bridges the River Nene and the Nene Way before bypassing Irthlingborough. The A6 then passes through the village of Finedon and intersects the A510 at a roundabout. Leaving Finedon, the road then passes the Burton Wold Wind Farm and bypasses the town of Burton Latimer, finally arriving at Junction 10 of the A14 at Barton Seagrave.|$|E

40|$|Captive labour: asylum seekers, {{migrants}} {{and employment}} in UK immigration <b>removal</b> <b>centres</b> JON BURNETT and FIDELIS CHEBE Abstract: The steady {{growth in the}} use of immigration detention under the UK’s New Labour government has been, it is argued here, mirrored by the concurrent development of a new form of labour market within immigration <b>removal</b> <b>centres</b> (IRCs). This market has grown out of the long history of what some label as exploitative employment practices used amongst the wider prison population. It relies upon a subtle form of coercion which ensures compliance and discipline and, in so doing, provides a cheap and easily exploitable pool of labour for private sector companies. The research for this article draws on findings from prison inspection reports and the annual reports of independent monitoring boards...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effects of {{confinement}} on the religious subjectivities of migrants who have been held in British <b>removal</b> <b>centres,</b> elaborating connections to broader debates and mobilizations over the boundaries of citizenship and belonging. It draws on geographic scholarship on affect and the emotions to shed {{new light on the}} embodied experiences of detention, its wider socio-political effects and the complex links between intensified religious identities and politics. I argue that <b>removal</b> <b>centres</b> are acting as spaces of religious revival. African ex-detainees' narratives of their confinement dwelt repeatedly on their experiences of religious renewal, and the article explores how Christianity and the Bible provided bodily, narrative and performative ways of coping with, and countering the fraught ‘affective atmosphere’ within detention centres. Faith was a source of energy, hope and strength, created ‘communities of practice’ within and beyond the <b>removal</b> <b>centres,</b> while religious narratives affirmed detainees' humanity. Some expressions of faith underpinned directly political messages, intersecting with ideas about the self as a rights-bearing subject. By including religious responses in debates over {{the effects of}} the restrictive border controls, the discussion not only highlights dimensions of non-citizens’ socio-political agency but also demands a rethinking of the broader socio-political consequences of detention and deportability. The article is based on interviews with ex-detainees, chaplains and members of detainee visitors' groups as well as official inspection reports...|$|R

40|$|This solo {{exhibition}} opened at Belfast Exposed (www. belfastexposed. org), the principal photography gallery in Northern Ireland, on 16 November 2007 and tours UK venues in 2008 / 09. Together with its accompanying publication {{it is the}} outcome of unique access to asylum seekers and migrants detained in Immigration <b>Removal</b> <b>Centres</b> in the UK. Border Country analyses the experience of asylum-seeking through photographs of IRC interiors, landscape images and interviews, and offers a rare insight into the experiences of immigration detainees. Border Country presents photographs of the orderly landscapes and institutional interiors (Visits Rooms) of Immigration <b>Removal</b> <b>Centres,</b> together with soundtracks of voice recordings conveying the complex identities of detainees and the physical, psychological and emotional aspects of life in detention. Dominant representations of asylum seekers and migrants focus on our view of them as undifferentiated and `Other¿. This work focuses on the individual experience of detention in the prison-like conditions of UK Immigration <b>Removal</b> <b>Centres,</b> aiming to deepen and broaden {{our understanding of the}} particularity of immigration and detention. The interview extracts in Border Country's soundtracks employ the asylum seekers¿ and migrants¿ perspectives as a mirror, reflecting both on the immigration system itself and on aspects of British culture. The exhibition is accompanied by a publication with introductory essay by Dr. Mark Durden, (Professor of Photography at the University of Wales, Newport), and a second essay by Dr. Alexandra Hall (Department of Geography, University of Durham), together with 75 minute audio CD of the exhibition soundtrack. Border Country has been presented at the following conferences: Shifts international Photography conference, University of Jyvaskyla, Finland, 19 - 22 October 2006; Migrant Art, Artefacts and Emotional Agency workshop, Queens University, Belfast (Anthropology Department), 8 - 10 February 2007; Global Photographies international conference, Dublin, 26 - 29 June 2007; IMISCOE (International Migration, Integration and Social Cohesion) conference, University of Sussex, 6 - 8 September 2007.
