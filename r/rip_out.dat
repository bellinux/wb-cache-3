5|$|Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a 3D action-adventure {{game with}} {{platforming}} elements. Breaking with {{the style of}} previous Rare platformers, the gameplay is simple in design, utilising the premise of moving through areas of the game's mansion and completing the required beat 'em up challenges in each room. Such challenges include eliminating all ghouls in a room, beating only a specified kind of ghoul while avoiding eliminating the rest or defeating a boss before the player-character, Cooper, can continue. All combat and melee attacks are manoeuvred by the control sticks, whereas the game's camera can be rotated by both triggers. When the player fails a challenge or takes longer than a set time limit to complete one, the Grim Reaper chases after the player-character; the Reaper will <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> Cooper's soul if the character does not leave the room in time. Standard enemies in the game include zombies, mummies, imps, skeletons and zombie pirates. There are also various bosses that must be defeated in order to advance. Many objects in the game with which the character can interact—including chairs, knives, and axes—can be used as weapons.|$|E
25|$|Chilaw Marians {{failed to}} convert 33 for 1 after four overs into an above-average total against Leicestershire Foxes, as David Masters' medium pace bowling shook up the visitors. Masters got a wicket {{in each of}} his first three overs, ending with figures of 4-1-7-3. With the score 57 for 6 after 10.3 overs, Chilaw were forced to consolidate, {{although}} captain Hasantha Fernando hit two straight sixes off Dinesh Mongia. However, Ottis Gibson came back to <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> two wickets at the death, and Chilaw Marians closed on 112 for 9.|$|E
25|$|Symonds and Hussey {{batted out}} 15 overs, but Symonds {{struggled}} to hit runs and eventually smashed {{a drive to}} Andrew Strauss, who took a grateful catch, thus ending Symonds' innings for 29 – off 71 balls, a good innings in Test cricket but in ODI cricket virtually useless. Michael Vaughan then used a strange bowling change, keeping spinner Ashley Giles on for an over more than required and thus borrowing one from Andrew Flintoff who wasn't allowed to bowl a full ten. In the event, it mattered little. Flintoff had ample time to <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, and, with Harmison taking care of Brad Hogg and Glenn McGrath committing batting suicide with a shot not exactly out of the textbook, Australia were all out for 196 – and England were comfortably in the drivers' seat.|$|E

25|$|When the Guardian {{arrives on}} Venus, the Exo Stranger {{describes}} the Vex as an evil so dark it despises other evil. She tells {{them about the}} Black Garden, a city where the Vex are born, and implores the Guardian to find it and <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> its heart, {{as it is the}} only way the Traveler will begin to heal. Ghost says that they need to speak to the Awoken, who lurk out in the Reef and refuse to take sides in the galaxy's wars. The Exo Stranger then leaves as she did not have time to explain things further. Once the Guardian arrives at the Reef, they meet the Queen of the Reef, Mara Sov, and her brother, Prince Uldren Sov, who tells the Guardian that they will help them locate the Black Garden if they bring them the head of a Vex Gate Lord. The Guardian travels back to Venus, where they uncover the Archive, which reveals secrets about the Vex, including the location of a place called the Vault of Glass, and pathways across the galaxy. After defeating Draksis, a Fallen Kell of the House of Winter, the Guardian confronts the Vex Gate Lord, claims its head, and returns to the Queen, who tells them to take its eye to the Meridian Bay on Mars, where it can be used to enter the Black Garden.|$|E

Flagg reveals his plans to climb the Dark Tower, see the room at the top and become the god of all. His ultimate goal is to kill Roland Deschain: [...] "...most of all for the death of his mother, whom I once loved." [...] Flagg believes that he can only achieve these goals by killing Mordred and taking his birthmark-stained foot. Although he tries to befriend Mordred and pledge allegiance to him, Mordred telepathically senses Flagg's true motives and eats him, forcing him to <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> his eyes and tongue first.|$|E
500|$|The Dantons took a {{long time}} to build. Construction was {{prolonged}} by a number of factors, chief of which were the 500 plus changes were made to the original design and in the inability of Gaston to make a timely decision. This meant that the builders sometimes had to <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> already completed sections to incorporate the modifications. Other problems were shortages of necessary infrastructure at the shipyards, lengthy delays in delivery of parts, and labor shortages and a lack of building slips in the naval dockyards. For example, water in the lower end of the newly completed Point-du-Jour slip at Brest meant that building Dantons stern was delayed four months after the bow began and construction of Mirabeau could not begin until the armored cruiser [...] was launched.|$|E

500|$|The largest known Tyrannosaurus rex skull {{measures}} up to [...] in length. Large fenestrae (openings) in {{the skull}} reduced weight and provided areas for muscle attachment, {{as in all}} carnivorous theropods. But in other respects Tyrannosauruss skull was significantly {{different from those of}} large non-tyrannosauroid theropods. It was extremely wide at the rear but had a narrow snout, allowing unusually good binocular vision. The skull bones were massive and the nasals and some other bones were fused, preventing movement between them; but many were pneumatized (contained a [...] "honeycomb" [...] of tiny air spaces) which may have made the bones more flexible as well as lighter. These and other skull-strengthening features are part of the tyrannosaurid trend towards an increasingly powerful bite, which easily surpassed that of all non-tyrannosaurids. The tip of the upper jaw was U-shaped (most non-tyrannosauroid carnivores had V-shaped upper jaws), which increased the amount of tissue and bone a tyrannosaur could <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> with one bite, although it also increased the stresses on the front teeth.|$|E
500|$|The team {{wanted to}} avoid {{punishing}} the player for applying everyday logic in Maniac Mansion. Fox noted that one Sierra game features {{a scene in which}} the player, without prior warning, may encounter a game over screen simply by picking up a shard of glass. He characterized such game design as [...] "sadistic", and he commented, [...] "I know that in the real world I can successfully pick up a broken piece of mirror without dying". Because of the project's nonlinear puzzle design, the team struggled to prevent no-win scenarios, in which the player unexpectedly became unable to complete the game. As a result of this problem, Gilbert later explained, [...] "We were constantly fighting against the desire just to <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> all the endings and just go with three characters, or even sometimes just one character". Lucasfilm Games had only one playtester, and many dead-ends went undetected as a result. Further playtesting was provided by Gilbert's uncle, to whom Gilbert mailed a floppy disk of the game's latest version each week.|$|E

The rabbits are then thrown back into their cage and appear to be stunned and in shock." [...] PETA claimed that 90 percent of the world's angora comes from China, and retailers that carry angora did not initially comment to CBS. Over the next two years, though, because of the investigation, more than 70 retailers, including H, Topshop, and Inditex (the world's largest retailer), discontinued their use of angora. Inditex donated its angora products, valued at $878,000, to Syrian refugees.|$|E

Solicitations of the comics refer to Cannonball as Cable's [...] "old war buddy." [...] Cannonball implies that he, Cable, Bishop, and the baby are the last living mutants, and that he found him with Cerebra, which was rigged for non-psychics to use after the last psychic died. Cannonball allows Cable to escape with the child, opting to stay and {{distract}} Bishop. Bishop pleads with Sam not to fight, but Cannonball persists, harboring a decades-long grudge against the traitorous former X-Man, and after a long fight, Bishop is forced to kill him using a claw-like tentacle from his new bionic arm (stolen from Forge) to <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> Guthrie's heart. As Cannonball dies, he asks Bishop why, to which Bishop responds, with visions of his future, mutants with M's on their faces and herded into concentration camps, [...] "To save you".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the moments}} after Regina {{encouraged}} Zelena {{to pursue a}} relationship with Hades, the move has the outsiders, especially Hook, unhappy with this new development. But before tensions start to reach a boiling point, Hades appears and informs them that Zelena had been kidnapped by Gold and Peter Pan. A note Hades produces makes clear Gold and Pan are using Zelena as leverage in a trade deal for the contract on Gold's unborn child. Hades asks Emma for help by arranging a deal in which she will help him get Zelena back in exchange for Hades erasing the outsiders' names from their gravestones so they can leave the Underworld. At the diner, Hades closes up the place so he can meet with Gold and Pan. Zelena, who has been cuffed and prevented from using magic, is with them. Hades agrees to Gold's demands and rips up the contract, only to have Pan add that he will take Zelena's heart {{as part of his}} plan to return to the living. As Pan attempts to <b>rip</b> <b>out</b> Zelena's heart, Emma breaks in through the back door and blasts him with Light Magic, stopping Pan. Gold and Pan leave separately during the confrontation, and without complete satisfaction. As Hades and Zelena are reunited, Hades frees Zelena by removing the cuff, and the two share a kiss. Suddenly Hades' heart begins to beat once again, resulting in a new level of fulfillment in Hades' vision for a [...] "normal" [...] life and leaving the Underworld with Zelena. As part of the arranged deal with Emma along with Hades' new freedom, a portal to Storybrooke can open which will close at sunset. As promised, Hades wipes the outsiders' names off the gravestones. Before the portal opens, Emma attempts to give half her heart to Hook so he can live again and travel through the portal safely, but the process doesn't work. Hades explains that Hook's soul {{might not be able to}} return to a decaying body, because he has been in the Underworld too long. Emma's insistence on a way to bring Hook back leads to Hades telling of a rumor of the only time when someone was able to bring the dead back to life from the Underworld: the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. According to what worked in that tale, Hook must acquire Ambrosia, the food of the gods, to restore his body and be reunited safely with his body; but in order to get to the Ambrosia, Emma has to go deep into the Underworld, and face a test to determine whether her love for Hook is true, by testing her heart. Before Emma and Hook go on their quest, Hades removes Emma's heart so that she can bring it with her for the test that she and Hook will face. The others promise her that they will wait for their return, but must leave by sunset in case Emma and Hook do not succeed.|$|E
