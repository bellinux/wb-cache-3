5|$|Nash did not <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> {{enlist in}} the Australian armed forces on the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939.

However, following the commencement of the war against Japan, Nash enlisted on 2 February 1942.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Thunderbird 2, Virgil deploys three Elevator Cars, two {{of which}} will be {{remote-controlled}} from his master vehicle. Fireflash will be guided into a controlled landing on top of the cars, touching down with its undercarriage raised. Virgil and the Elevator Cars <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> intercept the inbound Fireflash on Runway 29, but when one of the remote-controlled cars malfunctions and crashes into a Boeing 727, which explodes twice on impact, the rescue attempt is aborted and the operation suspended while Virgil activates a reserve car. Fireflash starts a second run and successfully makes contact with all three vehicles. Applying brakes, Virgil loses control of the master car, which crashes into a trench; he is uninjured, however, and Fireflash comes to a halt before reaching the end of the runway. The bomb is dislodged from its original position but ultimately fails to explode.|$|E
5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them.

They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, Alessandro Farnese, the cardinal-nephew of Paul III, and his faction of four or five {{cardinals}} (including Ranuccio Farnese and Guido Ascanio Sforza), whom Guise had counted among the French faction, began supporting the second choice of the Holy Roman Emperor, Reginald Pole, apparently having received assurances that Ottavio Farnese's claim to the Duchy of Parma would be supported by Charles V. On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé to <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the door of the conclave, demanding that the conclave wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the election of a pope in their absence would be likely to cause a schism.|$|E

5|$|Goldsmith scored The Motion Picture over {{a period}} of three to four months, a {{relatively}} relaxed schedule compared to typical production, but time pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on colleagues to assist in the work. Alexander Courage, composer of the original Star Trek theme, provided arrangements to accompany Kirk's log entries, while Fred Steiner wrote eleven cues of additional music, notably the music to accompany the Enterprise achieving warp speed and first meeting V'Ger. The <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> finish the rest of the film impacted the score. The final recording session finished at 2:00 am on December 1, only five days before the film's release.|$|E

Eventually, upon learning more about Fenix, he decides to have his name changed to 'Talandar'. He becomes the ambassador between the Daelaam and the Purifiers, convincing them to join force. He follows Artanis in battle to reclaim their homeworld.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed to hold his breath as long as he possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E

Bhima defeats and kills Kirmeera, following which the ascetics in the forest come and sing praises to Bhima for killing the demon.|$|R
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Mansur reached Byzantine-held Antioch {{two days}} after his flight, and Basil II ordered the catepan of that city {{to give him an}} honorable reception; {{providing}} refuge to former rulers of Aleppo was a common Byzantine practice because such ex-rulers could be used to pressure or threaten their successors. In his <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> escape Aleppo, Mansur left behind his mother, wives and daughters, who were detained by Fath, then transferred to Salih's custody. Salih then had Mansur's womenfolk safely returned to him in Antioch, {{with the exception of one}} of Mansur's daughters, whom Salih wed per his previous agreement with Mansur.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rekha {{escapes from}} the garage and enters the room where Chandru earlier claimed his mother stays.

Raghunath subdues Chandru, who collapses and reveals that the skeleton is his mother's. Raghunath understands Chandru's love for {{his mother and his}} traumatic childhood, which had made him develop a hatred for women with loose morals. Chandru is arrested, while Rekha and Ravi unite.|$|E
