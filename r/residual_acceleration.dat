This increases the acceleration caused by the radiation forces because they are acting on less mass.

40|$|Adaptive {{feedforward}} broadband vibration (or noise) {{compensation is}} currently used when a correlated measurement with the disturbance (an {{image of the}} disturbance) is available. Most of the active vibration control systems feature an internal "positive" mechanical feedback between the compensation system and the reference source (a correlated measurement with the disturbance). Such systems have often also a feedback control loop for reducing the effect of disturbances. Therefore the adaptive feedforward compensation algorithms should take into account this structure. For stability reasons the adaptation algorithms requires {{the implementation of a}} filter on observed data or a filtering of the <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> in order to satisfy some passivity conditions. The paper proposes new algorithms for the adaptive feedforward compensation in this context with both filtering of data and of the <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> and using an "Integral + Proportional" (IP) adaptation as a means for accelerating the transients as well as for relaxing the positive real conditions required by the stability analysis.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the NASA microgravity fluid physics program is presented. The necessary quality of a reduced-gravity environment in terms of tolerable <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> or g levels is a concern that is inevitably raised for each new microgravity experiment.

Furthermore, a relatively large and growing database of microgravity experiments that have successfully been performed in terrestrial reduced gravity facilities and orbiting platforms exists. Similarity of experimental conditions and hardware, in some cases, lead to new experiments adopting prior experiments g-requirements. Rationale applied to other experiments can, in principle, be a valuable guide to assist new Principal Investigators, PIs, in determining the <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> tolerability of their flight experiments.

40|$|A major {{obstacle}} {{in evaluating the}} <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> environment in an orbiting space laboratory {{is the amount of}} data collected during a given mission: gigabytes of data will be available as SAMS units begin to fly regularly. Investigators taking advantage of the reduced gravity conditions of space should not be overwhelmed by the accelerometer data which describe these conditions. We are therefore developing a data reduction and analysis plan that will allow principal investigators of low-g experiments to create experiment-specific <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> data bases for post-flight analysis. The basic aspects of the plan {{can also be used to}} characterize the acceleration environment of earth orbiting laboratories. Our development of the reduction plan is based on the following program of research: the identification of experiment sensitivities by order of magnitude estimates and numerical modelling; evaluation of various signal processing techniques appropriate for the reduction, supplementation, and dissemination of <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> data; and testing and implementation of the plan on existing acceleration data bases. The orientation of the <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> vector with respect to some set of coordinate axes is important for experiments with known directional sensitivity.

Common spectral representations are the amplitude spectrum which gives the average of the components of the time series at each frequency and the power spectral density which indicates the power or energy present in the series per unit frequency interval. The data reduction and analysis scheme developed involves a two tiered structure to: (1) identify experiment characteristics and mission events that can be used to limit the amount of accelerator data an investigator should be interested in; and (2) process the data in a way that will be meaningful to the experiment objectives.

30|$|Figure  6 {{shows the}} results of the ejecta speed {{measurements}} for PRIME- 1 and PRIME- 3. The 1 - σ error bars for the Gaussian mean determination are shown for the PRIME- 3 data points. COLLIDE- 3 produced ejecta for only one impact, and the target material was JSC Mars- 1. As stated above, JSC Mars- 1 behaved similarly to quartz sand, and we are not including JSC Mars- 1 results here. The plateau formed by the PRIME- 1 microgravity data points (black asterisks representing quartz sand impacts) around 10 cm/s for impact energies below 104 ergs is due to the <b>residual</b> <b>accelerations</b> induced by the parabolic aircraft on the experiment boxes (on the order of 10 − 2 g).

40|$|The {{solution}} was sought of a 2 -D axisymmetric moving boundary {{problem for the}} sensitivity of isothermal and nonisothermal liquid columns and the sensitivity of thermo-capillary flows to buoyancy driven convection caused by <b>residual</b> <b>accelerations.</b> The sensitivity {{of a variety of}} space experiments to <b>residual</b> <b>accelerations</b> are examined. In all the cases discussed, the sensitivity is related to the dynamic response of a fluid. In some cases the sensitivity can be defined by the magnitude of the response of the velocity field. This response may involve motion of the fluid associated with internal density gradients, or the motion of a free liquid surface. For fluids with internal density gradients, the type of acceleration to which the experiment is sensitive will depend on whether buoyancy driven convection must be small in comparison to other types of fluid motion (such as thermocapillary flow), or fluid motion must be suppressed or eliminated (such as in diffusion studies, or directional solidification experiments). The effect of the velocity on the composition and temperature field must be considered, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} melt crystal interface.

40|$|This book {{considers}} {{the behavior of}} fluids in a low-gravity environment with special emphasis on application in PMD (propellant management device) systems. In the compensated gravity environment of a spacecraft, the hydrostatic pressure decreases to very low values depending on the <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and surface tension forces become dominant. Consequently, surface tension {{can be used to}} transport and position liquids if the <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> and the resulting hydrostatic pressure are small compared to the capillary pressure. One prominent application is the use of PMDs in surface-tension satellite tanks. PMDs must ensure that the tank outlet is covered with liquid whenever outflow is demanded. Furthermore, PMDs are used to ensure expulsion and refilling of tanks for liquids and gases for life support, reactants, and experiment supplies. Since most of the PMD designs are not testable on ground and thus rely on analytical or numerical concepts, this book treats three different flow problems with analytical, numerical and experimental means: the transient contour change between two static surface configurations (free surface oscillations), the capillary rise in tubes (capillary rise), and the flow through open capillary channels (choking). These problems are linked together by the same set of equations and boundary conditions which are necessary to model the fluid behavior, and by the same set of characteristic numbers...|$|E

40|$|The <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> (or microgravity) {{of a space}} {{laboratory}} is a perturbation to experiments intended to be executed under weightlessness. Detailed knowledge of the microgravity is therefore indispensable {{for the analysis of}} the experiment results. Measurements of the <b>residual</b> <b>acceleration</b> are required at various locations of the spacecraft. According to the spectral sensitivity of experiments, frequencies from static (0 Hz) to high frequency contributions of the order of 100 Hz has to be detected. The low amplitude levels of the static and quasi-static acceleration (typically 1 #mu#g and below) requires inflight sensor calibration. The Quasi-Steady Acceleration Measurement system (QSAM), developed by DLR, is an instrument especially designed to detect acceleration in the entire range between 0 and 50 Hz. Continuous sensor calibration is achieved by signal modulation. The MSL- 1 mission was the third spaceflight of QSAM. Data analysis started during the mission in the HOSC based on QSAM's real-time data processing capability. Post mission analyses concentrated mainly on investigations of characteristic perturbation pattern like those, induced by crew interaction with the orbiter (exercises), the oscillations of samples in the TEMPUS facility, shuttle induced disturbances (water dumps, thruster firings) and orbit-attitude induced residual accelerations (solar inertial attitude).
