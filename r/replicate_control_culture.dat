40|$|Confluent Swiss mouse 3 T 3 -L 1 {{fibroblasts}} slowly differentiate functionally and morphologically into adipocytes, {{a conversion}} hastened by insulin. The cells are sensitive (although less than L 929 cells) to the antiviral action of mouse fibroblast interferons {{but not to}} interferons from heterologous species (human and chicken). Cultures stimulated with insulin {{in the presence of}} partially purified or electrophoretically pure mouse interferons have a much lower percentage of cells accumulating lipid than do insulin-treated <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> Interferon-treated cell cultures also contain much less triglyceride, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters than do <b>replicate</b> <b>control</b> <b>cultures</b> stimulated by insulin to differentiate. Increased de novo lipid biosynthesis that occurs during differentiation is inhibited, as determined by incorporation of [14 C]acetate into lipids extractable by the Folch method. This incorporation is a sensitive bioassay of the antidifferentiation effect of interferon; less than 1 antiviral unit is inhibitory. Variously inactivated or mock interferon preparations as well as interferons from several heterologous species fail to inhibit 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocyte conversion. Interferon is inhibitory even when applied as long as 3 days after insulin stimulation. The effect of interferon does not appear to depend upon its competition with insulin for cell surface receptors. Because interferon can alter the program of events involved in conversion of 3 T 3 -L 1 fibroblasts into adipose cells, it may be able to affect the regulation of eukaryotic cell differentiation...|$|R

The 10 days post-hatch fish larvae were fed with decapsulated cysts (DC) or newly hatched Artemia urmiana nauplii enriched with saturated lipids and HUFA emulsions containing 0, 10, and 20 % AP.

Ten randomly collected A. persicus and H. huso larvae from each replicate were subjected to different salinities, nitrite, total ammonia concentrations and temperatures. The results showed that feeding with Artemia nauplii enriched with HUFA and higher concentrations of vitamin C induces significantly higher tolerance to shocks in abiotic conditions in fish larvae of both species, as shown by higher survival. Nevertheless the two fish species did not exhibit a similar pattern of response: A. persicus showed higher tolerance compared to H. huso.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether 4 -tert-octylphenol (OP) affects the differentiation of multipotent C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells, a cell line established from mouse embryonic connective tissue, into osteoblast and adipocyte lineages. Conflu-ent C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells were incubated for 7 days with (OP-treated <b>cultures)</b> or without (<b>control</b> <b>cultures)</b> 15 mg/ml of OP. The 7 -day treatment of confluent cells with OP decreased alkaline phospha-tase activity by 81 %, inhibited the expression of transforming growth factor b 2, and inhibited the morphological changes in cells to an osteoblastic appearance. These results indicate that the 7 -day treatment of confluent C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells with OP inhibited their differentiation into osteoblasts. Since this treatment strongly induced the expression of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor r (PPARr) but did not stimulate triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in cells, C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells in the <b>control</b> and OP-treated <b>cultures</b> were incubated for 2 days with a hormone mixture (insulin [INS], dexamethasone, and 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutyl-xanthine) and incubated for an additional 5 days with INS alone.

40|$|Identifying {{external}} {{factors that can}} be used to control neural stem cells division and their differentiation to neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is of high scientific and clinical interest. Here we show that the Nogo- 66 receptor interacting protein LINGO- 1 is a potent regulator of neural stem cell maturation to neurons. LINGO- 1 is expressed by cortical neural stem cells from E 14 mouse embryos and inhibition of LINGO- 1 during the first days of neural stem cell differentiation results in decreased neuronal maturation. Compared to neurons in <b>control</b> <b>cultures,</b> which after 6 days of differentiation have long extending neurites, neurons in cultures treated with anti-LINGO- 1 antibodies retain an immature, round phenotype with only very short processes. Furthermore, neutralization of LINGO- 1 results in a threefold increase in bIII tubulin-positive cells compared to untreated <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> By using BrdU incorporation assays we show that the immature neurons in LINGO- 1 neutralized cultures are dividing neuroblasts. In contrast to <b>control</b> <b>cultures,</b> in which no cells were double positive for bIII tubulin and BrdU, 36 % of the neurons in cultures treated with anti-LINGO- 1 antibodies were proliferating after three days of differentiation.

All treatments showed similar contents of proteins and total lipids with respect to <b>control</b> <b>culture</b> (a fresh culture of R. salina), with mean values of 40. 0 ± 2. 32 % and 12. 0 ± 1. 45 %, respectively. The pheophytin a/chlorophyll a ratio, a general indicator of the chemical status of microalgal concentrates, was similar (0. 09 - 0. 11) between centrifuged pastes and <b>control</b> <b>culture,</b> but was found to be higher in flocculated pastes (1. 28 - 1. 48). The fatty acid profile varied with respect to the <b>control</b> <b>culture,</b> mainly in the proportion of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) : eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Total PUFAs, EPA and DHA contents were statistically similar between centrifuged pastes and <b>control</b> <b>culture</b> (PUFAs: 47 %, EPA: 4 % and DHA: 4. 7 %), whereas values obtained for flocculated pastes were significantly lower. The rotifers grew equally well when fed with centrifuged pastes or <b>control</b> <b>culture</b> (maximum density: 320 rotifers/mL; instantaneous growth rate: 0. 23 rotifers/ day, fecundity: 1. 49 eggs/female and productivity: 43 x 103 rotifers/L/day. No significant effect of vitamin C was found when used as a paste preservative. We concluded that centrifugation is an effective harvesting method, and that freezing to - 20 °C for four weeks (no vitamin added), may help maintain the nutritional quality of R. salina paste, similar to fresh microalgae and can be offered to Brachionus plicatilis...|$|R
30|$|Sigma Plot 11.0 {{was used}} to {{determine}} significant differences between treatments. One-way ANOVA and Post-Hoc test was conducted for comparison of Se treatment to <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> P values lower than 0.05 were considered to be significantly different. Statistical analysis was only done for pigment contents and Se accumulation in microalgae biomass.|$|R
