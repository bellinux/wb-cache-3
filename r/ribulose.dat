25|$|The Calvin cycle starts {{by using}} the enzyme RuBisCO to fix CO2 into five-carbon <b>Ribulose</b> bisphosphate (RuBP) molecules. The result is {{unstable}} six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid, or 3-PGA.|$|E
25|$|RuBisCO {{is usually}} only active {{during the day}} as <b>ribulose</b> 1,5-bisphosphate is not {{regenerated}} in the dark. This {{is due to the}} regulation of several other enzymes in the Calvin cycle. In addition, the activity of RuBisCO is coordinated with that of the other enzymes of the Calvin cycle in several ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} the {{inhibitory}} RuBP, CA1P, and the other inhibitory substrate analogs by activase requires the consumption of ATP. This reaction is inhibited {{by the presence of}} ADP, and, thus, activase activity depends on the ratio of these compounds in the chloroplast stroma. Furthermore, in most plants, the sensitivity of activase to the ratio of ATP/ADP is modified by the stromal reduction/oxidation (redox) state through another small regulatory protein, thioredoxin. In this manner, the activity of activase and the activation state of RuBisCO can be modulated in response to light intensity and, thus, the rate of formation of the <b>ribulose</b> 1,5-bisphosphate substrate.|$|E
25|$|Carboxysomes are {{bacterial}} microcompartments {{found in}} many autotrophic bacteria such as Cyanobacteria, Knallgasbacteria, Nitroso- and Nitrobacteria. They are proteinaceous structures resembling phage heads in their morphology and contain the enzymes of carbon dioxide fixation in these organisms (especially <b>ribulose</b> bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, RuBisCO, and carbonic anhydrase). It is thought that the high local concentration of the enzymes along with the fast conversion of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide by carbonic anhydrase allows faster and more efficient carbon dioxide fixation than possible inside the cytoplasm. Similar structures are known to harbor the coenzyme B12-containing glycerol dehydratase, the key enzyme of glycerol fermentation to 1,3-propanediol, in some Enterobacteriaceae (e. g. Salmonella).|$|E
25|$|In plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and phototrophic and chemoautotrophic proteobacteria, {{the enzyme}} usually {{consists}} of two types of protein subunit, called the large chain (L, about 55,000 Da) and the small chain (S, about 13,000 Da). The large-chain gene (rbcL) is encoded by the chloroplast DNA in plants. There are typically several related small-chain genes in the nucleus of plant cells, and the small chains are imported to the stromal compartment of chloroplasts from the cytosol by crossing the outer chloroplast membrane. The enzymatically active substrate (<b>ribulose</b> 1,5-bisphosphate) binding sites {{are located in the}} large chains that form dimers as shown in Figure 1 (above, right) in which amino acids from each large chain contribute to the binding sites. A total of eight large-chains (= 4 dimers) and eight small chains assemble into a larger complex of about 540,000 Da. In some proteobacteria and dinoflagellates, enzymes consisting of only large subunits have been found.|$|E
2500|$|However, our {{descriptive}} knowledge {{will become more}} usable when we can translate them into quantitative models that can enable us to calculate {{the outcome of the}} reaction under a given condition. [...] Since RubisCO reacts with RuBP (<b>ribulose</b> 1,5 bisphosphate) first to produce enediol and next with [...] that after some intermediate changes produces PGA (3-phosphoglycerate), a biochemical model is developed [...] and C4 photosynthesis from gas exchange | journal=BioSystems | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 265–284 }} to represent the [...] effects of [...] these steps quantitatively. Since carboxylation or fixation of [...] is possible only after the synthesis of enediol, thus it is suggested that the role of RubisCO is to produce enediol that is carboxylase and oxygenase (EnCO). Accordingly, RubisCO is called enolase-phosphglycerase (EPGase) since it is neither carboxylase nor oxygenase.|$|E
2500|$|Methylotrophy {{refers to}} the ability of an {{organism}} to use C1-compounds as energy sources. These compounds include methanol, methyl amines, formaldehyde, and formate. [...] Several other less common substrates may also be used for metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs include the bacteria Methylomonas and Methylobacter. [...] Methanotrophs are a specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use methane (...) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol (...) , formaldehyde (...) , formate (...) , and carbon dioxide [...] initially using the enzyme methane monooxygenase. [...] As oxygen is required for this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are obligate aerobes. [...] Reducing power in the form of quinones and NADH is produced during these oxidations to produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation. [...] Methylotrophs and methanotrophs are not considered as autotrophic, because they are able to incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular carbon before it is completely oxidized to [...] (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the serine pathway (Methylosinus, Methylocystis) or the <b>ribulose</b> monophosphate pathway (Methylococcus), depending on the species of methylotroph.|$|E
2500|$|Monosaccharides [...] are {{the major}} source of fuel for metabolism, being used both as an energy source (glucose being the most {{important}} in nature) and in biosynthesis. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often polysaccharides. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is glycogen, especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, starch is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, cellulose, is a structural component of the cell wall of plants and many forms of algae. Ribose is a component of RNA. Deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Lyxose is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart. <b>Ribulose</b> and xylulose occur in the pentose phosphate pathway. Galactose, a component of milk sugar lactose, is found in galactolipids in plant cell membranes and in glycoproteins in many tissues. Mannose occurs in human metabolism, especially in the glycosylation of certain proteins. Fructose, or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during digestion, and found in semen. Trehalose, a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight.|$|E
2500|$|In {{plants and}} some algae, another enzyme, RuBisCO activase, is {{required}} to allow the rapid formation of the critical carbamate in the active site of RuBisCO. RuBisCO activase is required because the <b>ribulose</b> 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) substrate binds more strongly to the active sites lacking the carbamate and markedly slows down the [...] "activation" [...] process. In the light, RuBisCO activase promotes {{the release of the}} inhibitory (or — in some views — storage) RuBP from the catalytic sites. Activase is also required in some plants (e.g., tobacco and many beans) because, in darkness, RuBisCO is inhibited (or protected from hydrolysis) by a competitive inhibitor synthesized by these plants, a substrate analog 2-Carboxy-D-arabitinol 1-phosphate (CA1P). CA1P binds tightly to the active site of carbamylated RuBisCO and inhibits catalytic activity. In the light, RuBisCO activase also promotes the release of CA1P from the catalytic sites. After the CA1P is released from RuBisCO, it is rapidly converted to a non-inhibitory form by a light-activated CA1P-phosphatase. Finally, once every several hundred reactions, the normal reactions with carbon dioxide or oxygen are not completed, and other inhibitory substrate analogs are formed in the active site. [...] Once again, RuBisCO activase can promote the release of these analogs from the catalytic sites and maintain the enzyme in a catalytically active form. The properties of activase limit the photosynthetic potential of plants at high temperatures. CA1P has also been shown to keep RuBisCO in a conformation that is protected from proteolysis. At high temperatures, RuBisCO activase aggregates and can no longer activate RuBisCO. This contributes to the decreased carboxylating capacity observed during heat stress.|$|E
5000|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{experiments in}} plants {{have shown that}} phosphopentose epimerase localizes to the thykaloid membrane of chloroplasts. [...] This epimerase participates in the third phase of the Calvin cycle, which involves the regeneration of <b>ribulose</b> 1,5-bisphosphate. RuBP is the acceptor of the CO2 in {{the first step of}} the pathway, which suggests that phosphopentose epimerase regulates flux through the Calvin cycle. Without the regeneration of <b>ribulose</b> 1,5-bisphosphate, the cycle will be unable to continue. Therefore, xylulose 5-phosphate is reversibly converted into <b>ribulose</b> 5-phosphate by this epimerase. Subsequently, phosphoribulose kinase converts <b>ribulose</b> 5-phosphate into <b>ribulose</b> 1,5-bisphosphate.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} of 6-phosphogluconate and NADP to <b>ribulose</b> 5-phosphate, carbon dioxide, and NADPH {{is believed to}} follow a sequential mechanism with ordered product release. 6-phosphogluconate is first oxidized to 3-keto-6-phosphogluconate and NADPH is formed and released. Then, the intermediate is decarboxylated, yielding a 1,2-enediol of <b>ribulose</b> 5-phosphate, which tautomerizes to form <b>ribulose</b> 5-phosphate. High levels of NADPH are believed to inhibit the enzyme, while 6-phosphogluconate acts to activate the enzyme.|$|E
5000|$|The Methylococcaceae have {{internal}} membranes in {{the form}} of flattened discs, perpendicular to the cell wall. Methane is oxidized to give formaldehyde, which is fixed by a process called the RuMP cycle (<b>Ribulose</b> Monophosphate Cycle). Here formaldehyde is combined with sugar <b>ribulose,</b> producing hexulose. This, in turn, is broken down to produce glyceraldehyde, which is used to produce new <b>ribulose</b> and other organic compounds. [...] Catabolism does not involve a complete citric acid cycle.|$|E
50|$|Ribose 5-phosphate is both {{a product}} and an {{intermediate}} of the pentose phosphate pathway.
