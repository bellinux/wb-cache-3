5|$|With <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> increasing, {{damage from}} barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many {{have not been able}} to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to <b>river</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{only the}} BX was {{used on the}} upper Fraser River, with the BC Express {{reserved}} for special trips. Despite having a monopoly on <b>river</b> <b>traffic,</b> the BX finished {{the season with a}} $7000 loss.|$|E
5|$|<b>River</b> <b>traffic</b> and {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing <b>river</b> <b>traffic.</b> Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E
50|$|US 101 in Washington {{begins at}} the Astoria-Megler Bridge on the Columbia <b>River,</b> {{carrying}} <b>traffic</b> to and from Astoria, Oregon. The first highway US 101 intersects is SR 401.|$|R
50|$|Prosperity {{continued}} until {{the beginning of}} the 20th century when sediment accumulation on this branch of the <b>river</b> diverted <b>traffic</b> to the Loba Arm passing through Magangué, and the Mompós Arm became standing water.|$|R
50|$|Tharwa Bridge is a four span Allan {{truss bridge}} that {{provides}} a high-level crossing point across the Murrumbidgee <b>River,</b> allowing <b>traffic</b> between Canberra and Tharwa village. It is the oldest surviving bridge in the Australian Capital Territory.|$|R
5|$|It {{took two}} and a half hours to control the fire. Navigation lights used for the heavy barge traffic were being changed at the time of the report. The Coast Guard shut down <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> for about a mile around the bridge because debris was falling off the aging bridge. An {{official}} determination on the cause of the fire was expected in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|Constanța Port {{is both a}} {{maritime}} and a river port. Daily, {{more than}} 200 river vessels are in the port for cargo loading or unloading or waiting to be operated. The connection of the port with the Danube river is made through the Danube–Black Sea Canal, which {{represents one of the}} main strengths of Constanța Port. Important cargo quantities are carried by river, between Constanta and Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Germany. <b>River</b> <b>traffic</b> is very important for the Constanța Port, having a share of 23.3% of the total traffic in 2005, when 8,800 river vessels called to the port.|$|E
5|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. At the time of the race, which {{commenced}} at 10.40am, there was a strong easterly wind. With a higher stroke rate than their opponents, the Light Blues took the lead from the start and by Craven Steps were almost clear. At the Mile Post, Oxford had cut the lead to half a length, but were forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision with <b>river</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The castle was {{acquired}} by Prussia in 1866, and toll collections ceased in 1867. It continued {{to be used as}} a signal station for the <b>river</b> boat <b>traffic</b> for about another century. In 1946, the castle became property of the State of Rheinland-Pfalz.|$|R
50|$|The Georgia-Carolina Memorial Bridge was {{a highway}} {{crossing}} over the Savannah River {{between the states}} of Georgia and South Carolina that was in service from 1927 to 1981. The completion of this bridge {{marked the beginning of}} the end for Savannah <b>River</b> ferry <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sarayaku protested and {{resisted}} CGC activities, as {{they believed}} that petroleum development would threaten the fragile nature of the Amazonian rainforest and their subsistence society. To stop the resistance, the government sent federal soldiers to Sarayaku and closed the Bobonaza <b>River</b> as <b>traffic</b> artery.|$|R
5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Thames twice blocked by ice, {{and it may be that}} the cold weather held back its spread.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in <b>river</b> <b>traffic,</b> which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|Cascade Locks and Canal {{were first}} {{constructed}} in 1896 around the Cascades Rapids, enabling boats to travel safely through the Columbia River Gorge. The Celilo Canal, bypassing Celilo Falls, opened to <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> in 1915. In the mid-20thcentury, {{the construction of}} dams {{along the length of}} the river submerged the rapids beneath a series of reservoirs. An extensive system of locks allowed ships and barges to pass easily from one reservoir to the next. A navigation channel reaching to Lewiston, Idaho, along the Columbia and Snake rivers, was completed in 1975. Among the main commodities are wheat and other grains, mainly for export. As of 2016, the Columbia ranked third, behind the Mississippi and Paraná rivers, among the world's largest export corridors for grain.|$|E
50|$|Car-road Novi Sad-Bačka Palanka; {{rail-road}} Novi Sad-Sombor; and the Danube <b>river</b> {{are important}} <b>traffic</b> directions situated at this location.|$|R
50|$|In Illinois, U.S. Route 24 runs west {{across the}} Quincy Bayview Bridge and east across the Quincy Memorial Bridge over the Mississippi River in Quincy. The {{cable-stayed}} Bayview Bridge brings westbound US 24 over the Mississippi <b>River.</b> Eastbound <b>traffic</b> {{is served by}} the older Quincy Memorial Bridge.|$|R
50|$|During the Great Flood of 1993, {{when the}} Missouri <b>River</b> flooded, I-29 <b>traffic</b> was detoured along US 71 through Maryville and Clarinda.|$|R
5|$|Coalhouse Fort was manned {{during the}} First World War by No. 2 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, which manned the guns, while the 2nd Company London Electrical Engineers {{operated}} the electric searchlights. A minefield {{was installed in}} the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse forts, with mechanically operated mines in the shallower parts {{of the river and}} remotely detonated mines in the navigable channel. Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore-based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel. Coalhouse Fort took on the role of an Examination Battery controlling the <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> in conjunction with the River Examination Service. Incoming vessels were checked by tugs based alongside the old HMS Champion, moored in midriver, and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop, the fort was authorised to fire across its bows.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac Fortress, it is both large and well-preserved. Its placement {{at the head of}} the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of <b>river</b> <b>traffic.</b> It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Major-General Charles George Gordon {{was given}} the job of {{evacuating}} the Egyptian garrison from Khartoum. He arrived on 18 February 1884. Gordon was reluctant to abandon the population of Khartoum to {{the forces of the}} Mahdi, and also felt that by evacuating the city he would open the way for the Mahdi to threaten Egypt. He bombarded the authorities in Cairo with telegrams suggesting alternative courses, and delayed starting the evacuation. On 13 March 1884 the tribes north of Khartoum declared for the Mahdi, cutting the telegraph and blocking <b>river</b> <b>traffic.</b> Khartoum was besieged, falling on 25 January 1885 after a siege of 313 days. A relief column arrived two days after the city had fallen and Gordon had been killed. Despite a short-lived public outcry in Britain over Gordon's death, Britain took no further action in Sudan for several years.|$|E
50|$|Its {{construction}} effectively {{ended the}} Fox-Wisconsin Waterway {{connection to the}} Mississippi <b>River,</b> although commercial <b>traffic</b> had ended decades before completion of the dam.|$|R
50|$|Schönkirchen {{is located}} close to Kiel at the Bundesstraße 502 {{connecting}} Kiel and Schönberg (Holstein) {{and at the}} Kiel-Schönberg-Railroad. The closest main line train station is Kiel Central. Although Schönkirchen {{has access to the}} Schwentine <b>river,</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> (to Gothenburg and Oslo) and freight transport have to use the port of Kiel.|$|R
50|$|In June 1876 Beaver {{was sold}} to Uriah Nelson and taken north to the Stikine <b>River</b> to serve <b>traffic</b> {{generated}} by the Cassiar Gold Rush.|$|R
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, {{it was designed to}} carry the loads required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge. The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day. The location of the bridge was thought to be convenient, as it provided a link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura. It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river. The bridge was built after the decline in commercial <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Murray. Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{begins at}} the old Fort Erie, south of the Peace Bridge, where it is known as Lakeshore Road and connects with the Queen Elizabeth Way and the former Highway 3. East of the Mather Circle, the road becomes known as Niagara Parkway and {{proceeds}} north through downtown Fort Erie, beneath the International Railway Bridge. It gradually curves to the east opposite the southern shore of Grand Island. Houses line the southern side of the parkway along this section. The road curves back northward as it crosses the Black Creek and passes through a sparsely populated stretch. It passes the Willoughby Historical Museum followed by the Legends on the Niagara Golf Course. Shortly thereafter, it enters Niagara Falls and meets the Welland <b>River.</b> <b>Traffic</b> is diverted west to cross the river at Portage Road, where it then resumes on the Niagara Parkway at King's Bridge Park.|$|E
5|$|These sister {{stations}} were of similar design and were built, opened, and closed together. Stella South, with a generating capacity of 300megawatts (MW), {{was built on}} the site of the Blaydon Races, and Stella North, with a capacity of 240MW, on that of the former Lemington Hall. They powered local homes and the many heavy industries of Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and County Durham. The large buildings, chimneys and cooling towers were visible from afar. Their operation required coal trains on both sides of the river to supply them with fuel and <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> by flat iron barges to dump ash in the North Sea. After their closure in 1991, they were demolished in stages between 1992 and 1997. Following the stations' demolition, the sites underwent redevelopment: the North site into a large business and industrial park, the South into a housing estate.|$|E
50|$|At around 10:15 a.m. on Wednesday, September 23, Greenpeace activists hung a banner, {{warning of}} the dangers of {{increased}} CO2 emissions, from the deck of the West End Bridge facing downtown Pittsburgh over the Ohio <b>River.</b> While <b>traffic</b> was held up for a period, all eight activists were placed under arrest after surrendering peacefully.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the N6 {{national}} {{road through}} the Aare river valley required {{a connection to}} the cantonal highway between the districts of Konolfingen and Seftigen. This would have increased the <b>river</b> crossing <b>traffic</b> beyond the old wooden bridge's capacity, so a new concrete bridge was built and after 136 years the wooden bridge became superfluous.|$|R
50|$|Kjalvegur {{takes over}} from Gulfoss {{with the number}} F35 (previously F37). North of Gullfoss, there is a <b>river</b> {{crossing}} where <b>traffic</b> must ford over the river.|$|R
5|$|Until the mid-eighteenth {{century the}} Old London Bridge {{was the only}} {{crossing}} on the Thames in London. It was damaged in a major fire in 1633, but in the fire of 1666 this damage acted as a fire break and prevented the flames from further damaging the bridge and crossing to {{the south side of}} the Thames. With its 19 narrow arches, it impeded <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> and flow. Central piers were removed to create a wider navigational span. Widening and the removal of its houses was completed in 1763, but it remained relatively narrow and needed continual and expensive repairs. In the early nineteenth century it was decided to replace the bridge with a new construction. New London Bridge was opened in 1831 and survived until it was replaced in 1972. It was then transported and reconstructed in Lake Havasu City, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give it much attention. The winter prevented <b>river</b> <b>traffic,</b> and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the river}} reaches the {{outskirts}} of Hull, its course {{is marked by a}} series of bridges, most of which open to allow boats to pass. There are swing bridges, lift bridges and bascule bridges, and the river becomes part of the Port of Hull. The river, which is the dividing line between West and East Hull, bisects the city's industrial area. The bridges can cause traffic delays during high tides, though <b>river</b> <b>traffic</b> is less than it once was. The Beverley and Barmston Drain rejoins the river above Scott Street Bridge. Below North Bridge, an unused dry dock on the west bank marks the former entrance to Queens Dock. Below Drypool Bridge, a muddy basin on the east bank was once the entrance to Drypool Basin and Victoria Dock. The river reaches its confluence with the Humber estuary in the centre of Kingston upon Hull. At its mouth, a tidal barrier has been constructed to prevent tidal surges from entering the river. In the past, these had regularly flooded the town and the flat countryside to the north.|$|E
50|$|After the new Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge {{opened in}} February 2014 across the <b>river,</b> daily <b>traffic</b> {{volume on the}} King bridge had {{decreased}} by 40% by April 2014 to 12,700 daily. This {{was one of the}} goals of construction of the new bridge: to distribute traffic more widely among the bridges and associated roadways, improving traffic patterns.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{known as}} Root Hog, the {{original}} town site was five miles (8 km) south {{at the junction}} of two stagecoach lines (Blackfoot-Wood River and Blackfoot-Salmon). A suspension bridge that crossed the Big Lost <b>River</b> funnelled <b>traffic</b> through the settlement. The town leaders applied to the U.S. Post Office for the town name of [...] "Junction." ...|$|R
50|$|The Intracoastal Waterway {{connects to}} several navigable <b>rivers</b> where {{shipping}} <b>traffic</b> can travel to inland ports, including the Mississippi, Alabama, Savannah, James, Susquehanna, Delaware, Hudson, and Connecticut rivers.|$|R
