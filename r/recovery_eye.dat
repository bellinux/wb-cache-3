40|$|This study {{examined}} eye movements in patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for postconcussion syndrome (PCS) at 3 - 4 months after mild closed head injury (CHI), including 20 PCS patients and 20 controls (i. e., CHI patients of similar injury severity but good recovery, matched for age, gender, education, and time post-injury). Our {{aim was to}} identify disparities in saccadic function and oculomotor smooth pursuit (OSP) between these groups, and compare these with neuropsychological function and self-perceived health condition. The groups differed markedly in postconcussive symptom levels and problems with {{activities of daily living}}. The PCS group had poorer performance on measures of antisaccades, self-paced saccades, and memory-guided sequences, with marginal deficits on OSP. Some neuropsychological group differences were present but smaller than anticipated. Effect sizes of significant oculomotor and neuropsychological differences were equivalent. Whilst oculomotor function and neuropsychological tests partially overlapped in identifying foci of impaired brain function, eye movements suggested impaired function in areas not obvious based on neuropsychological testing. The oculomotor deficit profile of the PCS group was not consistent with that observed in non-trauma patients with major depression disorder. Eye movement assessment may provide additional information about brain function in patients with PCS, offering objective markers of ongoing cerebral impairment. These would be independent of patient self-report and neuropsychological assessment and might be useful in supplementing patient evaluation, providing external confirmation of incomplete <b>recovery.</b> <b>Eye</b> movement testing might be of particular interest in patients who report high symptom levels and cope poorly with activities of daily living but whose neuropsychological test profile is unremarkable. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In human eyes, the at-birth hyperopoic defocus {{gradually}} decreases to mild hyperopia or emmetropia {{at around}} age 6. Studies on refractive development suggest somewhat complex mechanisms at work between eye power and length. Myopia occurs {{as a result}} of failure of normal emmetroipzation. Myopia is linked with various ocular pathologies and is now considered an independent risk factor of a range of ocular diseases. Therefore, myopia research is essential. The substantially increasing prevalence of myopia has particularly attracted researchers’ attention. Any improvement in the understanding of the mechanisms of normal emmeropization and myopia development has the potential to introduce interventions that can limit or prevent myopia incidence and/or progression. The eye power calculation presented is simpler than other approaches and provides an accurate power variation during normal emmetropization without the need for ex vivo measurements. Eye power calculation during normal growth showed a decrease in eye power and that the small difference between the rate of change in eye power and that of dioptric eye length, gives a decrease in MOR. When we modify the eye power calculation with one additional assumption, it can to be applied to myopic eyes. During emmetropization to hyperopoic defocus (LIM) and its <b>recovery,</b> <b>eye</b> power calculations based on different additional assumptions confirm a change in the optics, either in the positions of cardinal points or in the focal length, depending on the assumptions used. Changes in curvatures of the ocular surfaces remain to be assessed. Emmetropization is an active mechanism; it appears to be driven by values of angular blur due to defocus which are above the level of the cone photoreceptor resolution during emmetropization. Angular blur reaches a level similar to cone spacing at the completion of emmetropization. Rates of change in optical axial length (OAL), corneal radius and the lens power are proportional to angular blur, causing blur to reduce significantly. Angular blur varies linearly with MOR and its rate of change. After emmetropization, the constant angular blur and slightly increasing linear blur suggest that eye growth might be relatively uniform. The links between rates of change in OAL, corneal radius and the lens power during and after emmetropizaton may be related to a common signaling molecule or via passive mechanisms. During LIM and recovery from it, VCD is a main contributor to changes in mean ocular refraction. However, the relative change {{in the front of the}} eye (represented by anterior cornea to back lens distance) is proportional to the relative change in OAL and is important to overall OAL changes compared to the control eye. The change in eye power in relation to the change in eye length is important to normal emmetropization. The optics also changes during LIM and the recovery from it. In addition, in normal growth, a direct link between the changes in ocular parameters and retinal blur is shown. Since many of these results are consistent with findings during emmetropization in children, the link between the changes in ocular parameters and retinal blur may be important to understanding normal development and development of myopia in human. 4 month...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Postconcussion {{syndrome}} (PCS) {{can affect}} up to 20 - 30 % {{of patients with}} mild closed head injury (mCHI) and comprises incomplete recovery and persistence of postconcussional symptoms for weeks, {{months or even years}} post-injury, having a potentially devastating effect on a patient's life. Previous studies have identified eye movement function at 1 week post-injury as a possible predictive marker for PCS, showing that mCHI patients who later develop PCS manifest measurable differences in eye movement function at 1 week post-injury compared to mCHI patients of similar injury status who show better recovery. In this study, we examined whether PCS patients continue to show disparities in eye movement function at 3 - 4 months following mCHI compared to patients with good recovery. It was hoped that the assessment of eye movement function might provide sensitive and objective functional markers of ongoing cerebral impairment in patients with PCS, supporting the presence of PCS independently of psychometric assessment and patient self-report. The study is still in progress with this paper presenting preliminary results. Methods: The groups comprised 20 PCS-patients and 20 controls (i. e., CHI patients of similar injury severity but good recovery, individually matched for age, gender, education, and time post-injury). The PCS subjects were recruited amongst CHI patients with persistent symptoms who had been referred to the local Concussion Clinic (Burwood Hospital) for further evaluation. Controls were recruited via a database of mCHI patients with known recovery status at 3 months post-injury. All PCS-patients received a clinical evaluation as part of their standard assessment at the Concussion Clinic. In addition, all participants in the study completed neuropsychological assessment and computerized eye movement tests in combination with the assessment of self-perceived health condition by means of standardized health status questionnaires. Eye movements were assessed using infra-red oculography, including reflexive, antisaccade, memory-guided, and self-paced saccadic paradigms, in addition to sinusoidal and random oculomotor smooth pursuit (OSP) tasks. Neuropsychological assessment included the Digit Span, Similarities, Picture Completion and Digit Symbol subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (3 rd Ed.), Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Rey Complex Figure Test, Trail Making Test, Behavioral Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome (Zoo Map Test), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (Verbal Fluency Test, Colour-Word Interference Test), Wechsler Memory Scale 3 rd Ed. (Logical Memory I&II), and the Beck Depression Inventory (2 nd Ed.). Self-perceived health condition was assessed using the SF- 36 Health Survey version 2, the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire and the Rivermead Head Injury Follow-up Questionnaire. Results: The groups differed markedly in postconcussive symptom levels and problems with activities of daily living. The PCS group had significantly poorer performance on measures of antisaccades, self-paced saccades, and memory-guided sequences, with marginal deficits on OSP. The impaired oculomotor measures in the PCS group included higher numbers of response errors in the antisaccade task, poorer visuospatial accuracy on anti- and memory-guided saccades, smaller number of self-paced saccades, longer saccade duration of self-paced saccades, higher number of eye movements when performing memory-guided sequences of saccades, slower tracking velocity on 60 deg/s OSP and longer lag on random OSP. Neuropsychological functions more affected in the PCS group included executive function, sustained and divided attention, speed of information processing, memory and cognitive flexibility. In addition, the PCS group had substantially poorer scores on the Beck Depression Inventory. Effect sizes of significant oculomotor and neuropsychological differences were equivalent. Discussion: Whilst oculomotor function and neuropsychological tests partially overlapped in identifying foci of impaired brain function, such as stronger impairment of prefrontal function in the PCS group, eye movements suggested impaired function in areas not obvious based on neuropsychological testing, specifically problems in parietal function, deficits in the visuospatial transformation centres in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), impaired communication of the PPC with subcortical/brainstem structures, and potentially problems with cortico-cortical exchange of information between the parietal and frontal cortical areas. Importantly, the oculomotor deficit profile of the PCS group was not consistent with that observed in non-trauma patients with major depression disorder. This finding differentiates PCS from simply being a complex form of depression and suggests that a high incidence of depression amongst PCS patients is a symptom rather than a (premorbid) cause of PCS. Conclusions: Eye movement assessment may provide additional information about brain function in patients with PCS, offering objective markers of ongoing cerebral impairment. These would be independent of patient self-report and neuropsychological assessment and might be useful in supplementing patient evaluation, providing external confirmation of incomplete <b>recovery.</b> <b>Eye</b> movement testing might be of particular interest in patients who report high symptom levels and cope poorly with activities of daily living but whose neuropsychological test profile is unremarkable. status: publishe...|$|E

The system uses a generative eye region model that parameterizes the fine structure and motion of an eye. The structure parameters represent structural individuality of the eye, including the size and color of the iris, the width, boldness, and complexity of the eyelids, the width of the bulge below the eye, and the width of the illumination reflection on the bulge. The motion parameters represent movement of the eye, including the up-down position of the upper and lower eyelids and the 2 D position of the iris. The system first registers the eye model to the input in a particular frame and individualizes it by adjusting the structure parameters. The system then tracks motion of the eye by estimating the motion parameters across the entire image sequence. Combined with image stabilization to compensate for appearance changes due to head motion, the system achieves accurate registration and motion <b>recovery</b> of <b>eyes.</b> Index Terms—Computer vision, facial image analysis, facial expression analysis, generative eye region model, motion tracking, texture modeling, gradient descent. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{builds a}} {{two-dimensional}} linear homeomorphic oculomotor plant mathematical model and assesses {{its ability to}} simulate person-specific oblique saccades on a two-dimensional plane. The proposed model is driven by a simplified pulse-step neuronal control signal and accounts in a linear form for the unique characteristics of the eye globe and the extraocular muscles responsible for horizontal and vertical rotation (the lateral/medial recti and superior/inferior recti respectively). These characteristics include: series elasticity, length tension, passive elasticity, viscosity, eye globe inertial mass, and the force-velocity relationships of agonist/antagonist muscles. Results indicate that the model is capable of producing oblique saccade trajectories with properties resembling those of normal humans. The model can be simplified into two one-dimensional models for quicker signal simulation, making it applicable for time sensitive applications.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the speed of visual recovery in the deprived eye of kittens after a 6 -day period of monocular deprivation imposed at 5 – 9 weeks of age in two postdeprivation conditions. In one condition, binocular <b>recovery</b> (BR), both <b>eyes</b> were open, whereas in the other condition, reverse lid-suture (RLS), the formerly nondeprived eye was closed to force the animal to use the originally deprived eye. In littermate pairs, BR kittens began to recover form vision 12 to 30 h before those subjected to RLS. The vision of the deprived eye of the BR animals remained superior to that of their RLS littermates for 4 – 8 days. Although this finding is difficult to reconcile with competitive mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, it supports a prediction of an alternative model of synaptic plasticity [Bienenstock, E. L., Cooper, L. N. & Munro, P. W. (1982) J. Neurosci. 2, 32 – 48] for slower initial recovery with RLS because of the time required to reset the modification threshold...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – We {{propose a}} system that is capable of {{detailed}} analysis of eye region images including position of the iris, degree of eyelid opening, and shape and texture of the eyelid. The system is based on a generative eye model that defines fine structures and motions of eye. The structure parameters represent structural individuality of the eye, including size and color of the iris, width and boldness of the double-fold eyelid, width of the bulge below the eye and width of the illumination reflection on the bulge. The motion parameters represent movements of the eye, including up-down position of the upper and lower eyelids and 2 D position of the iris. The system first registers the eye model to the input in a particular frame and individualizes the model by adjusting the structure parameters. Then, it tracks motion of the eye by estimating the motion parameters across the entire image sequence. Combined with image stabilization to compensate the head motion, the registration and motion <b>recovery</b> of the <b>eye</b> are guaranteed to be robust...|$|R
