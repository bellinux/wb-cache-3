This paper illustrates the multi-functional capability of a prototype high-voltage (11 kV) conditioner and discusses the practicalities of building such a unit. Initial laboratory testing confirms that the unit can perform {{all four of the}} proposed functions, namely harmonic compensation, ripple control signal injection, and VAr control (static and dynamic). Work continues toward operating the unit closer to <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> (300 <b>kVA)</b> and on improving the quality of the output waveforms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the experimental EMC characterization of a new medium/low voltage (MV/LV) secondary substation, which was developed in the framework of the research project "NEW CAB ELARC". It has two MV/LV transformers, with total <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> of 1000 <b>kVA.</b> To perform the experimental characterization, firstly an analysis was performed of the Italian and European standards recommendations. Different approaches were highlighted and the most appropriate procedures were identified for the measurement of the magnetic fields emissions, at power systems frequency (50 Hz) in steady-state conditions. A dedicated test lab was set up for the secondary substation characterization. The measurement results showed that, thanks to the chosen layout, the emissions of the substation under test are lower than those of typical substations of the same power...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of micro hydropower plant {{is intended for}} providing electricity at Alue Dua village in North Aceh. A problem associated {{with the implementation of}} the micro-hydropower plant in the village is that the water flowrate of the run-of-river is varied at 117 litres per second during the wet season and at 36 litres per second during the dry season. This variation affects the speed of the water turbine and the capacity of power generated by its generator. Therefore to stabilize the output power and voltage of the generator {{during the course of the}} year, this paper aims to regulate the intake water flowing into the water turbine by controlling the opening vent valve from 0 % up to 100 % and controlling the electrical load connected to the generator. The speed of the water turbine was measured using the tachometer. It was found that the generator can produce electricity at its <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> 40 <b>kVA</b> during the wet season by opening the valve at 100 % and at 12 kVA with the opening valve at 30 % during the dry season. Opening the vent valve at 100 % during the dry season can drain the water within 12 minute...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — High power compact IGBT {{half bridge}} modules with a current rating of 300 A and a {{blocking}} voltage of 650 V using ultra thin IGBTs and diodes {{have been successfully}} developed with double-sided cooling capability. The wirebond-less package building block called COOLiR 2 DIETM has a small area of 28. 5 mm x 16 mm with a <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> 200 <b>kVA,</b> This is the most compact IGBT package reported today. A low on-state voltage of 1. 6 V at 300 A is achieved in the wirebond-less package. The combination of lower on-state voltage and larger heat exchange area due to the solderable front metal (SFM), increases the IGBT module current carrying capability by 30 %. I...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} in the university context for Master thesis 30 credits,which is a compulsory exercise {{in order to gain}} a degree in electrical engineering. The thesis main objectives were to investigate how the damping and the stiffness of ahydroelectric generator changed depending on different parameter values, and to testa new mathematical model to calculate the damping and stiffness constants Kd and Ks. The work has been performed at the request of VG Power, but has been performedat the division for electricity at Uppsala University. The reason for undertaking thisthesis was to ensure that generators are robust. But also when building future modelsfor generators, to have a system {{that can be used to}} compute robustness. During this thesis a power cabinet has also been constructed to be able to test thesimulated model on a real generator. Under the first five weeks a power cabinet wasconstructed in the laboratory at the division for electricity. The tests were thenperformed at a generator with a <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> of 75 <b>kVA...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} report aims {{to investigate the}} upper limit of single phase (1 Φ) PV power connection (kWp) the low voltage (LV) electricity distribution system and the single phase (1 Φ) contracted <b>power</b> (<b>kVA)</b> levels in member states of the EU. One of the key goals {{during the process of}} writing this report was to minimize the extent of the provided information with a simultaneous maximization of its efficacy for the end user. The sources used for the creation of this report are all properly referenced in the respective section of this work. Tables summarizing the current state for the upper limit of PV power connection (kWp) to the low voltage (LV) electricity distribution system in the EU are provided. Bar charts visualizing the single phase (1 Φ) contracted <b>power</b> (<b>kVA)</b> levels in the EU member states are also provided. Additionally, {{in order to create a}} macroscopic view of the situation regarding the upper limits of the single phase (1 Φ) PV power (kWp) connection to the low voltage (LV) electricity distribution system and the single phase (1 Φ) contracted <b>power</b> (<b>kVA)</b> levels for the EU Member States, a bar chart and a coloured map, summarizing and visualizing the findings of the research that took place for the needs of this traineeship, are provided too. The significant importance of the website RES LEGAL [1] (Legal sources on Renewable Energy), an initiative of the European Commission, has to be acknowledged. The information provided in the website of RES LEGAL acted as an important starting point during the process of searching the relevant legislative documents of DSOs regarding the situation for single phase (1 Φ) RES penetration (kWp) and single phase (1 Φ) contracted <b>power</b> (<b>kVA)</b> levels in the EU member states. The ratio of installed single phase (1 Φ) PV capacity (kWp) over the single phase (1 Φ) contracted <b>power</b> (<b>kVA)</b> of a consumer is of importance when planning the penetration of RES to the electricity distribution system in the member states of the EU. For the majority of the member states this ratio is explicitly stated in relevant legislative documents. In case of lack of explicit definition of a coefficient that relates maximum allowable RES power injection (kWp) with contracted <b>power</b> (<b>kVA)</b> levels at the consumption side, this ratio can be calculated. In the following pages the reader will find relevant information, with respect to the goals of this literature review, for the member states of the EU. Additionally, work conducted in the laboratory including my involvement with the Elgar TerraSAS ETS 1000 PV Simulator hardware and software tools as well as the simulation of simple power system circuits in the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS Technologies) are also presented in respective chapters of this report. The tools that have been used for the realization of this report were Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Google Search, Google Translate, Map Chart, Elgar TerraSAS PV Simulator Software, RSCAD (software environment for creating power system models to be simulated in the RTDS hardware environment).

40|$|Power factor {{reflects}} how efficiently {{industries and}} organizations use electricity. Power factor compares {{the amount of}} useful work that is extracted from {{the total amount of}} electric energy supplied. This paper proposes a conceptual design of microcontroller based automatic power correction (APFC Relay) for 1 phase and 3 phase circuit with intension to be used in power factor load applications. As can be seen from power factor definition, if PF is near unity, the apparent <b>power</b> (<b>KVA</b> value approaches near actual power (KW). This is possible if, and only if KVAR (reactive power) is kept to a minimum. In practice, this reactive power KVAR is Inductive in nature (major loads are inductive). This reactive power is compensated by countering it with capacitive KVAR in the circuit and can bring system KVAR value near zero. The designing of the power factor correction is to ensure the entire power system always preserving almost unity power factor and thus optimizing the current consumption. Keywords...|$|R
