For instance, the Quran has some law, and it acts {{as a source of}} further law through interpretation, Qiyas (<b>reasoning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy),</b> Ijma (consensus) and precedent. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as Sharia and Fiqh respectively. Another example is the Torah or Old Testament, in the Pentateuch or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The Halakha is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, Israeli law allows litigants to use religious laws only if they choose. Canon law is only in use by members of the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion.|$|E

2500|$|Professor John Makdisi's article [...] "The Islamic Origins of the Common Law", {{published}} in the North Carolina Law Review, curiously suggested that English common law was inspired by medieval Islamic law. Makdisi drew comparisons between the [...] "royal English contract protected {{by the action of}} debt" [...] and the [...] "Islamic Aqd", the [...] "English assize of novel disseisin" [...] (a petty assize adopted in the 1166 at the Assizes of Clarendon) and the [...] "Islamic Istihqaq", and the [...] "English jury" [...] and the [...] "Islamic Lafif" [...] in the classical Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, and argued that these institutions were transmitted to England by the Normans, [...] "through the close connection between the Norman kingdoms of Roger II in Sicily — ruling over a conquered Islamic administration — and Henry II in England." [...] Makdisi also argued that the [...] "law schools known as Inns of Court" [...] in England (which he asserts are parallel to Madrasahs) may have also originated from Islamic law, although they bear more similarity to the much closer-to-home Oxbridge Colleges (at which most students would have previously studied) and arose in concentration in Holborn after the clergy were forbidden to teach common law by the Pope, and law schools were banished from the City of London (their current location being between the old City and the courts at Westminster). He states that the methodology of legal precedent and <b>reasoning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> (Qiyas) are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems, although the English practice arises from the methodology of Bracton, resulting in the subsequent publication of law reports. Other legal scholars such as Monica Gaudiosi, Gamal Moursi Badr and A. Hudson have argued that the English trust and agency institutions, which were introduced by Crusaders, may have been adapted from the Islamic Waqf and Hawala institutions they came across in the Middle East. Paul Brand also notes parallels between the Waqf and the trusts used to establish Merton College by Walter de Merton, who had connections with the Knights Templar, but Brand also points out that the Knights Templar were primarily concerned with fighting the Muslims rather than learning from them, making it less likely that they would imitate Muslim legal institutions. [...] Moreover, the [...] "waqf" [...] concept refers to a charitable designation of property whereas the introduction of trust law was a reaction to the failure of persons to whom crusaders conveyed their lands whilst on crusade to return the lands when the crusaders returned (as opposed to the charitable trust which would be used to found an academic institution and has its origin in Roman law). The conventional accepted view is that English law is a continuation of the Anglo-Saxon law of preceding centuries.|$|E

6000|$|... § 1. The word Analogy, as {{the name}} of a mode of reasoning, is {{generally}} taken for some kind of argument supposed to be of an inductive nature, but not amounting to a complete induction. There is no word, however, which is used more loosely, or in a greater variety of senses, than Analogy. It sometimes stands for arguments which may be examples of the most rigorous induction. Archbishop Whately, for instance, following Ferguson and other writers, defines Analogy conformably to its primitive acceptation, that which was given to it by mathematicians: Resemblance of Relations. In this sense, when a country which has sent out colonies is termed the mother country, the expression is analogical, signifying that the colonies of a country stand in the same relation to her in which children stand to their parents. And if any inference be drawn from this resemblance of relations, as, for instance, that obedience or affection is due from colonies to the mother country, this is called <b>reasoning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy.</b> Or, if it be argued that a nation is most beneficially governed by an assembly elected by the people, from the admitted fact that other associations for a common purpose, such as joint-stock companies, are best managed by a committee chosen by the parties interested; this, too, is an argument from analogy in the preceding sense, because its foundation is, not that a nation is like a joint-stock company, or Parliament like a board of directors, but that Parliament stands in the same relation to the nation in which a board of directors stands to a joint-stock company. Now, in an argument of this nature, there is no inherent inferiority of conclusiveness. Like other arguments from resemblance, it may amount to nothing, or it may be a perfect and conclusive induction. The circumstance in which the two cases resemble, may be capable of being shown to be the material circumstance; to be that on which all the consequences, necessary {{to be taken into account}} in the particular discussion, depend. In the example last given, the resemblance is one of relation; the fundamentum relationis being the management, by a few persons, of affairs in which a much greater number are interested along with them. Now, some may contend that this circumstance which is common to the two cases, and the various consequences which follow from it, have the chief share in determining all the effects which make up what we term good or bad administration. If they can establish this, their argument has the force of a rigorous induction; if they can not, they are said to have failed in proving the analogy between the two cases; a mode of speech which implies that when the analogy can be proved, the argument founded on it can not be resisted.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} {{business}} decisions from a behavioural perspective {{by using a}} cross disciplinary approach to investment decisions and responds to the important {{question of how the}} psychological aspects of decision making influence business decisions that shape business strategy. The first study explores how firms behave in a rapidly changing environment and investigates resource allocation decisions by presenting a framework of capital allocation activeness and firm performance. This study uses firm level investment decisions and finds that capital allocation has an inverted-U shape relationship with firm performance. Results further show that capital allocation is in fact a dynamic capability. These findings present one of the most comprehensive analyses in this literature. This study not only enriches our understanding of microfoundations under dynamic capabilities view, but also presents a new approach of measuring capital allocation. The second study explores analogical reasoning and investigates strategic decisions by focusing on how the use of analogies influences the decision outcome. This study uses individual decisions from experiments and finds that when people use analogies based on successful cases they make more optimistic decisions. This study builds on theories from cognitive psychology and presents a direct link with strategy; therefore it advances theories of <b>reasoning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogies</b> in the strategy context. The last study explores the role of payoff representation on probability assessments and investigates the potential bias that arises from using monetary versus utility returns. This study also uses individual decisions from experiments and finds that people report bolder probability assessments when the payoffs are represented as cash returns. This study presents a new concept of utility illusion and findings expand the existing literature of prospect theory by showing that risk attitudes are also based on different domains of returns.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to develop expert systems where by-analogy {{reasoning}} is used. Knowledge “closeness” problems are known to frequently emerge in such systems if knowledge is represented by different production rules.

Different types of distances between two predicate value distribution functions are considered when predicates are “true”. Asymptotic features and interrelations of distances are studied. Predicate value distribution functions are found by empirical distribution functions, and a procedure is proposed for this purpose. An adequacy of obtained distribution functions is tested {{on the basis of}} the statistical 2 χ –criterion and a testing mechanism is discussed.

This chapter {{claims that}} analogy-making, in {{particular}} the structural mapping ability is a very basic mechanism in human cognition and thus, {{it is also a}} basic mechanism for anticipation. A number of various everyday situations are analyzed that involve anticipation <b>by</b> <b>analogy.</b> Then the role of analogy is discussed in computational term to analyze why using analogy ensures flexible behavior and rapid learning based on a single case. A review of the existing analogy-making models is presented and their limitations are analysed.

This is the first analogy-making model working in the real world extracting features from the environment using a camera, building its own representation, <b>reasoning</b> on them <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> with episodes from long term memory, and acting in the real environment by modeling the process of motor control. The specific model of visual information processing implements a model of active vision with strong top-down pressures arising from the past experience.

The culmination of the eugenic discourse was Nazi Germany, where eugenic concepts were pushed to their most extreme application and, in the process, acquired the ethical repugnancy they retain to this day.
