For all studies, the indoor dry-bulb (db) temperature was 80 ?F (26. 7 ?C) db. The cycling study consisted of twelve transient tests conducted with an outdoor temperature of 95 ?F (35 ?C) db for cycle times of 6, 10, 15, and 24 minutes. Indoor relative humidities of 40 %, 50 %, and 60 % were also considered. The evaporator airflow study consisted of twenty-four steady-state tests conducted with an indoor condition of 67 ?F (19. 4 ?C) wet-bulb (wb) for evaporator airflows ranging from 50 % below to 37. 5 % above <b>rated</b> <b>airflow.</b> Outdoor temperatures of 85 ?F (29. 4 ?C) db, 95 ?F (35 ?C) db, and 105 ?F (40. 6 ?C) db were also considered. The coil fouling study used a total of six condensers that were exposed to an outdoor environment for predetermined amounts of time and tested periodically. Three of the condensers were cleaned and retested during the periodic testing cycles. Testing consisted of thirty-three steady-state tests conducted with an indoor condition of 67 ?F (19. 4 ?C) wb for outdoor exposure times of 0, 2000, 4000, and 8000 hours.

40|$|The {{effect of}} frost {{formation}} {{on the performance}} of a domestic refrigerator-freezer evaporator coil was investigated. A low temperature evaporator test facility was developed to closely simulate refrigerator-freezer conditions. The rate of frost deposition on the evaporator was determined to be constant with respect to time for a ten-hour testing period over a range of air inlet temperatures and relative humidities, refrigerant temperatures, and <b>airflow</b> <b>rates.</b> Higher humidities and air inlet temperatures and lower refrigerant temperatures were found to increase the frosting rate significantly. Varying the <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> was found to slightly affect the frosting <b>rate.</b> Increasing the <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> increased the frosting rate a small amount, while, decreasing the <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> decreased the frosting rate an equally small amount. However, it appears that the actual correlation between <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> and frosting rate is not this straight-forward, but is, instead, the result of the influences of the mass transfer coefficient, the evaporator surface temperature, and the air moisture capacity. How these factors balance one another determines the actual relationship between frost <b>rate</b> and <b>airflow.</b> <b>rate.</b> In addition to these findings, {{it was found that the}} UA-value of the evaporator increased as frost was-deposited on the coil while a constant <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> was maintained through the coil.

A life cycle cost (LCC) computer program for indoor climate systems based on Swedish conditions was developed and used to compare and optimize different indoor climate systems.

However, room air temperature is influenced by natural ventilation <b>airflow</b> <b>rate,</b> and <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> is influenced by room air temperature, so {{it is necessary to}} perform a coupled analysis taking into account both heat balance and ventilation to obtain the correct result. Moreover, when there is marked indoor vertical temperature distribution, as found in large enclosures, or when ventilation <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> is small, significant computation error will occur if the set value of room air temperature differs greatly from the actual value.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to apply MEMS {{techniques}} to manufacture a gas flow sensor that consists with an <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>airflow</b> direction sensing units for detection of airflow states. This study uses a silicon wafer as a substrate which is deposited silicon nitride layers. To form the <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> sensing unit, a micro heater and a sensing resistor are manufactured over a membrane that released by a back-etching process. The airflow direction sensing unit is made of four cantilever beams that perpendicular to each other and integrated with piezoresistive structure on each micro-cantilever, respectively. As the cantilever beams are formed after etching the silicon wafer, it bends up a little due to the released residual stress induced in the previous fabrication process. As air flows through the <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> sensor, the temperature of the sensing resistor decreases and the evaluation of the local temperature changes determines the <b>airflow</b> <b>rate.</b> On the proposed sensor, the airflow direction can be determined through comparing the resistance variation caused by different deformation of cantilever beams at different directions...|$|R

Experimental trials were carried out {{by means of an}} air assisted towed sprayer, equipped with “Albuz ATR” nozzles. To take into account the influence of the development of the trees, the field trials were replicated in two phenological stages with an interval of about one month: “Inflorescences fully developed” (stage 1) and “Beginning of berry touch” (stage 2). A full factorial experiment was carried out for each growth stage, with two <b>airflow</b> <b>rates</b> (3. 9 and 7. 5 m 3 /s), three volume rates (103, 216, and 276 L/ha in the first growth stage and 154, 330 and 432 L/ha in the second growth stage), and four replicates, arranged according to a randomised complete block design. Working pressure (1. 2 MPa) and forward speed (1. 4 m/s) were kept unchanged for all the trials. The foliar deposition was measured by means of a spectrophotometric technique. The leaves were sampled on two depth layers and two or three heights, according to the trees’ development. The results showed that volume rate did not significantly influence the mean foliar deposition in both the two growth stages, while the highest deposits were obtained with the lowest <b>airflow</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> × volume rate interaction, though not statistically significant, showed that low volume rates together with high <b>airflow</b> <b>rates,</b> result in a noticeable reduction in foliar deposition (29 % with respect the grand mean), due to an increase of the spry drift, especially at the first growth stage, when the foliar development is little.

40|$|Barometric {{pressure}} changes affect air density, {{leading to}} change in the mass of the gas in the gob. When the barometric pressure decreases, the volume of gas in the gob expands, while the volume of gas contracts when the barometric pressure increases, causing the gob to breathe out and in. Although the concept of gob breathing is simple, its effect on spontaneous heating of coal in the gob area is not clear. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to model the spontaneous heating of coal in longwall gob area under measured barometric pressure changes. A single longwall panel using a bleederless ventilation system was simulated. If there is no barometric pressure change, the intake <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> is equal to the return <b>airflow</b> <b>rate.</b> When the barometric pressure changes, these two <b>airflow</b> <b>rates</b> are no longer equal, and {{the difference between the two}} <b>airflow</b> <b>rates</b> represents the <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> the gob breathes in and out.

In this study we used occupant exposure to pollutants integrated over time (referred to as 'dose') as the metric to evaluate the effectiveness and air quality implications of demand controlled ventilation in residences. We looked at air quality for two situations. The first is that typically used in ventilation standards: the exposure over a long term.

Firstly, model experiments are conducted to know the natural ventilation characteristics in the Void with respect to <b>airflow</b> patterns, <b>airflow</b> <b>rates</b> and temperature distributions. As the result, it is made clear that the characteristics are influenced by the vertical position of openings for outdoor air supply. Secondly, a simplified calculation model dividing the space into multiple zones is used to calculate the <b>airflow</b> <b>rate</b> and the vertical temperature distribution. The calculated <b>airflow</b> <b>rates</b> were nearly agreed with experimental ones except for the some temperature inconsistency...|$|R
