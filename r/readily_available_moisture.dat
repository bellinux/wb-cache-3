30|$|Crops need {{water during}} growth period, {{and it is}} vital to uphold the amount of <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> in the soil by {{irrigation}} (Modi 1995). Different crops require different quantities of water at different growth stages. The irrigation system may not be designed to supply the total amount of moisture required for crop growth. Both excessive and deficit water applications have negative impacts including retarding of crop performances. As a matter of practicality, depth of water application under traditional surface irrigation practices may exceed or be less than the optimal depth of water required for a given crop. Management of water at field level is relatively low cost, more practicable, and simply workable and can be realized in short duration of time (Tagar et al. 2012). Benefit and hazard assessment of irrigation water has now become a paramount importance not only to point out where the problem lies but also helps to identify alternatives that can be more effective.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of the spatiotemporal behavior of soil moisture can greatly improve hydrological forecasting capability. While ground-based soil moisture measurements are ideal, {{they tend to be}} sparse in space and only available for limited periods. To overcome this, a viable alternative is space-borne microwave remote sensing because of the observational capability it offers for retrieving soil moisture in near real-time at the global scale. However, its direct applications have been limited due to the uncertainty associated, and the coarse spatial resolution these are available at. Therefore, this thesis aims to use satellite soil moisture products for assessing flood risk by redressing their drawbacks in terms of accuracy and spatial resolution. The research consists of three inter-dependent focal areas; evaluation, improvement and application of the soil moisture products. For the first objective, this thesis compared two alternate soil moisture products using spatiotemporally identical passive microwave observations but different retrieval algorithms. Complementarity in the performance of the products was identified and accordingly provided the basis for the improvement in soil moisture. For the second objective, based on the identified complementarity, different formulations of weighted linear combination were proposed as a means of reducing the structural uncertainty associated with each retrieval algorithm. To address the limitation of resulting retrievals existing over coarse grid resolutions, an approach was presented to spatially disaggregate coarse soil moisture by only using a remotely sensed vegetation index product. The method provides a continuous timeseries of disaggregated soil moisture with a persistence structure closer to what is observed. Lastly, for the third objective, a fully remote sensing based flood warning method using <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> soil <b>moisture</b> and rainfall data, open-access topographic and soil data, was developed. This method was applied over a number of anthropogenically unaffected river basins and was shown to have promise for flood warning in ungauged watersheds. Ongoing and future research will form an integrated pathway for producing an improved soil <b>moisture</b> product <b>available</b> at finer spatial resolution, which can be used for various regional applications, along with using this to provide real-time flood warnings using freely available information to rural and remote communities worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Actual {{irrigation}} {{situation in}} a typical upland irrigation district was estimated by the water balance method during the 1993 rainy and the 1994 dry year periods. Soil moisture conditions were analysed for cases where daily district water use was supplied to all the cropped upland farms, and to reduced irrigation area percentages. Consumptive use was obtained through monthly weighted crop coefficients used to reduce penman's potential evapotranspiration. The moisture budget was examined at three levels of total <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>moisture,</b> TRAM, i. e., 20, 30 and 40 mm; the effect of upward capillary rise was also considered. The {{results of this study}} indicated that the actual moisture conditions in upland irrigated farms is influenced by irrigation area, cropping pattern, stage of crop growth and upward capillary rise in the farms. Actual irrigated area was within the range of about 44 to 100 % of cropped area while upward capillary rise was between 0. 1 and 1 mm day- 1, TRAM level of 30 to 40 mm was considered most appropriate for the district. Monthly effective rainfall percentages from the water balance method were fairly close to that determined by the basic irrigation requirement method for some months. Basic irrigation requirement may therefore be considered to incorporate capillary water contribution...|$|E
30|$|The daily crop {{water use}} was {{estimated}} using the Penman–Monteith approach described in Allen et al. (1998). The length of each stage {{was taken from}} the records taken during experiments conducted on soybean in the rainy seasons of 2011 and 2012 in the same area. The estimated peak evapotranspiration during the initial, and development stages was 1.13 and 6.53  mm day− 1 respectively while at mid and late stages, it was 6.69 and 3.83  mm day− 1 respectively. A pressure compensating inline-drip line (Dripworks, Inc., 190 CA, USA) whose capacity was 2.2  l h− 1, pressure of 1  bar was used to apply water to the crop during the growing seasons. The length of each lateral was 5  m and contained 17 point in-line emitters, which were pre-spaced at intervals of 0.3  m. The pressure compensating mechanism ensures even distribution of pressure along the laterals even in hilly and undulating areas (Michael 2008). At the commencement of the experiments, the coefficient of variation of the discharges from the emitters was 0.03 which was described as excellent for a point source emitter (Michael 2008). The statistical uniformity indicator Us, a measure of the uniformity achieved by each emitters was 95  %. The emission uniformity of the drip system was 90.7  % according to the equation in Keller and Bliesner (1990). Volume of water required per plant per day at the initial stage was determined from the ratio of the product of peak evapotranspiration (1.13  mm day− 1) and wetted area of each plant to the emission uniformity. The initial stage was expected to last for 25  days under the conditions in Ile-Ife and the estimated total volume of water to be supplied per plant was 1.50  L. The estimated field water requirement at initial stage was 1530  L. The daily water requirements during the mid (40  days) and late (18  days) seasons were 6.69 and 3.83  mm day− 1 respectively. Using the same procedure, the estimated daily water needs per plant during these stages were 0.36 and 0.21  L respectively. Similarly, the amount of water budgeted for the entire experimental fields during these periods were 14, 700 and 3860  L respectively. At the initial stage, the readily accessible soil moisture was 5.5  mm. Irrigation frequency was determined from the ratio of the <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> to the peak water use of 1.13  mm day− 1 and this gave an average of 5  days. From the calibrated flow rate of the emitter and wetted area of the plant, adding 5.5  mm of water per irrigation would take 0.2  h. Details can be found in Adeboye et al. (2015).|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ecology {{of one of the}} best known Australian marsupials, the Common Brushtail Possum Trichosurus vulpecula, in central Australia. Trichosurus vulpecula is one of few {{medium-sized}} mammal species that persist in arid Australia today. Its distribution within the arid zone has declined markedly since European settlement. Two populations, one within the East MacDonnell Ranges along the Hale River and the other on Irving Creek, a River Red Gum creek in the Petermann Ranges, were studied in the southern Northern Territory. Others locations in the region were visited opportunistically. Trie central Australian Trichosurus is not distinct genetically from populations elsewhere in Australia. The diet of T. vulpecula consisted of a range of leaves, flowers and fruits of perennial dicotyledonous species as well as some ephemeral herbs. Grasses were absent from the diet. Variation in the diet reflected seasonal availability in flowers and fruits. The species preferentially consumed at each site had significantly higher moisture content and dry matter digestibility than species not consumed. Preferred species included Amyema maidenii leaves (a mistletoe), Acacia spp. flowers and fruits, Santalum lanceolatum leaves (a shrub), Marsdenia australis leaves (a vine), Solarium quadriloculatum fruit (shrub) and Euphorbia spp. leaves (herb). Small amounts of invertebrate material were consumed throughout the year. Other non-plant material consumed included honeycomb and unfledged birds eg. Budgerigars. There {{were no significant differences in}} the diet between the sexes. Trichosurus vulpecula were found in six main habitats: Acacia aneura/Callitris glaucophylla on rocky hills; E. camaldulensis sandy creek-lines; mixed Acacia rocky hills, Rocky Eucalyptus creek-lines; Degraded drainage lines; and Wet gullies. Logistic regression modelling revealed a significant correlation between mistletoe species richness, higher levels of soil nitrogen and the presence of T. vulpecula. In habitats occupied by T. vulpecula species richness of mistletoes was associated with the absence of fire and the presence of reliable ground water supplies. Trichosurus vulpecula were highly mobile with mean home ranges at Hale River of 44. 21 ? 22. 76 ha and considerably higher than those recorded in previous studies in Australia. Mean home ranges at Irving Creek were much smaller, at 4. 99 ? 1. 46 ha and VII similar to that recorded in other studies in Australia. At both sites, males had larger home ranges and there was a high degree of overlap with other males and females. At the Hale River study site, T. vulpecula predominantly denned in caves or cavities in rocks, whereas at Irving Creek all den sites were in large Eucalyptus camaldulensis on the drainage line. Adult and pouch young sex ratios were at parity. During this study, T. vulpecula was found to breed continuously, with births recorded in almost all months. Growth of the young were more rapid than previously recorded for Trichosurus in Australia. This is interpreted as an adaptation for living in an arid environment, enabling the young to achieve independence before quality food supplies diminish. No single exotic predator or competitor was solely responsible for the decline of T. vulpecula in arid Australia, implying an interactive impact. Prey switching by dingoes from rabbits to T. vulpecula, macropods and echidnas followed the crash of rabbit populations at Hale River. Predation by dingoes on T. vulpecula was only recorded once, at the Irving Creek study site, where numbers of rabbits remained stable throughout the study. The impact of exotic herbivores occurred through habitat degradation rather than competition. Evaluation of the ecological data collected during this study generally supports current models of decline and extinction in medium-sized mammals in arid Australia, integrating the effects of predators, competitors, drought and fire. However, the importance of each factor on populations of T. vulpecula was found to vary depending on their location in the landscape. This study suggests two separate models to explain the decline of T. vulpecula in arid Australia after the arrival of Europeans. The first operates in the riparian lowlands and the second on the rocky ranges. In both models, prior to European settlement, T. vulpecula occupied refuge habitats characterised by <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> for plant growth (run on areas and/or shallow water tables) and soils with higher soil nutrient concentrations. The impact of fires on these refugia was minimal, as Aboriginal burning practices protected them with mosaic burning generally preventing large-scale fires from developing. Following European settlement, the forces impacting on populations were different in the riparian lowlands from those affecting rocky ranges. In the riparian lowlands, the effects of rabbits and livestock together with predation were found to have the major impact on T. vulpecula populations. Fire was not a significant factor in these areas. In the rocky ranges, fire was the most significant factor affecting T. vulpecula populations. Introduced herbivores did not degrade these habitats as they did in the riparian lowlands because the rugged and steep nature of the ranges acted as a physical barrier. Similarly, predator numbers were lower because of the relative difficulty in moving over rough ground and the generally lower relative abundance of preferred prey such as rabbits. An adaptive management strategy needs to be implemented to determine the effects of different management regimes on T. vulpecula population viability. The key elements of a management strategy in the riparian lowlands involves the manipulation and monitoring of predators, rabbits and livestock numbers. In the rocky ranges, the key management strategy involves the implementation of a patch burning to prevent fires entering habitats occupied by T. vulpecula. Importantly, any management strategies should involve Aboriginal people. Trichosurus vulpecula is an important part of Aboriginal culture. Its decline is of great concern to many people and several of the remaining populations and potential reintroduction locations are on Aboriginal land. Because of their relationship with the land and the animals, people have both the knowledge of the animal and the skills (such as patch burning) to provide information to managers which will assist with management. To achieve these management directions a coordinated national education programme is required to inform and convince the Australian community that conservation of T. vulpecula is deserving of attention in arid and semi-arid Australia. This is particularly important given the perception that T. vulpecula is a common species throughout Australia, despite its massive decline in arid Australia since European settlement...|$|E

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of soil moisture {{during the period}} of summer fallow between successive winter crops of wheat has been examined for a number of localities on the Darling Downs, and for the seasons 1951 - 1954. The moisture gain to a depth of 4 ft between the harvest of one crop and the planting of the succeeding crop ranged from — 0 - 3 to 5. 0 in., with an average of 2. 2 in. representing 17 per cent. of the rainfall. <b>Available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting averaged 42 ̆ 78 in., the excess of 2. 6 in. over fallow gain being due to the <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> already in the soil at the preceding harvest. In this locality, therefore, moisture accumulation commonly occurs prior to harvest, owing to rainfall in excess of crop requirements at this period. The average values for <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting were well below the capacity of these soils for storage to 4 ft. Values following long fallow averaged 6. 5 in., and were as high as 9. 1) in. in one instance. Correlations have been sought between fallow <b>moisture</b> gain and <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting, and the associated soil and climatic factors. The more important findings were:Total rainfall during the fallowing period was not correlated with fallow moisture gain. Fallow <b>moisture</b> gain and <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting were correlated with March-April rain. Fallow moisture gain was correlated negatively with <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at the preceding harvest and positively with <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting. The clay content of the soil and depth of surface mulch were not significantly related to fallow moisture gain nor to <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting. No significant difference in moisture accumulation was observed between sites stubble-mulched and those stubble-bumt. Explanations in terms of climatic and soil characteristics are offered for the results obtained. Features considered important are the characteristics of the rainfall and the high-evaporation conditions, the low rate of moisture penetration in wet soil, and the high moisture-holding capacity of the surface soil layers...|$|R
