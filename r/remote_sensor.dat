40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the space remote sensing, many instruments have been invented. The number of <b>remote</b> <b>sensors</b> and payloads are growing and becoming various increasingly. A mission designer usually has many options and different combinations of <b>remote</b> <b>sensors</b> to achieve their objectives.

Then we made a descriptive statistical study that showed some useful relationship between some parameters. There are some good reasons and interpretations behind these relations that are investigated in this paper.

PRESTO exploits technology trends in storage to build an architecture that emphasizes archival at <b>remote</b> <b>sensors</b> and intelligent caching at proxies. The system also addresses user needs for querying such sensor networks by exposing a unified, easy to use data abstraction across numerous proxies and <b>remote</b> <b>sensors.</b> I...|$|R
