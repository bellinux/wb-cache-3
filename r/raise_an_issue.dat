2500|$|On April 16, 2006, the Toledo Blade {{reported}} that Blackwell had accepted more than $1 million in {{campaign contributions from}} [...] "employees of firms seeking business with the statewide offices he's held over the past 12 years." [...] Furthermore, the same organizations donated $1.34 million to the Ohio Republican Party, $1.29 million of which was forwarded directly to Blackwell's campaign fund. Several of the firms which have been awarded contracts from Blackwell's office have also been hired on to his gubernatorial campaign. The investigators argue that the suggestion of quid pro quo based on the actions of contributors <b>raise</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of a serious conflict of interest. Petro has responded by demanding that a law which bans political contributors from being awarded state contracts. Blackwell has stated that no illegal activity took place. In response to Petro's call for reform, Blackwell stated: [...] "If you are asking me ... 'Am I advocating for campaign spending limits?' No. Never have. Never will." ...|$|E

This will lead to a systematic account of the answerhood conditions and implications of disjunctive questions with different intonation patterns. 1 Preliminaries: basic assumptions and data Syntactic structure. Syntactically, we distinguish between two kinds of disjunctive interrogatives. On the one hand there are those that consist of a single interrogative clause containing a disjunction. On the other hand there are those that consist of two interrogative clauses, conjoined by disjunction. We will refer to the former as narrow-scope disjunctive interrogatives, and to the latter as wide-scope disjunctive interrogatives. Some examples are given in (1) and (2) below...|$|R

50|$|Debates between legal academics. Although {{these debates}} can happen face-to-face—at conferences, for example—these debates {{tend to take}} place in the pages of law reviews. An example might be a law {{professor}} printing an article in a prominent law review, with another law professor offering a rejoinder in a subsequent issue. Sometimes, an academic might <b>raise</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> that is debated throughout the legal academy: for example, Alexander Bickel's book, The Least Dangerous Branch, has been the touchstone for an ongoing debate on the countermajoritarian difficulty.|$|E
5000|$|Some jurisdictions, {{notably the}} United States, but {{prevalent}} {{in many other}} countries, prevent parties from relitigating the facts on appeal, due to a history of unscrupulous lawyers deliberately reserving such issues in order to ambush {{each other in the}} appellate courts (the [...] "invited error" [...] problem). The idea is that it is more efficient to force all parties to fully litigate all relevant issues of fact before the trial court. Thus, a party who does not <b>raise</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of fact at the trial court level generally cannot raise it on appeal.|$|E
