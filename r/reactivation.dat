40|$|Allogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) is used to treat a variety of malignant and non-malignant disorders of the lympho-hematopoietic system in childhood. But allogeneic HSCT is still associated with a high treatment related risk due to serious complications. Those complications are transplant failure, graft-versus host disease, and severe bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) and Adenoviruses (ADV) are very common and dangerous viral <b>reactivations</b> following HSCT. Many studies already documented the influence {{of each of these}} viruses on the outcome of allogeneic transplants. In contrast, this study wanted to analyse the impact of multiple viral <b>reactivations</b> of CMV, EBV and AdV. Therefore, data of 124 children and adolescents have been analysed retrospectively using univariate and multivariate tests in order to assess the prevalence of multiple viral <b>reactivations,</b> the association between different transplantation-related factors and viral <b>reactivations,</b> and the impact of viral <b>reactivations</b> on the outcome of allogeneic HSCT. Multiple viral <b>reactivations</b> occurred in 40 % of all patients after HSCT. Several transplant related factors like viral serology, gender, donor type, and antithymocyte globulin treatment were significantly associated with the occurrence of viral <b>reactivations.</b> On the other side, viral <b>reactivations</b> {{had a significant impact on}} several complications and outcome of HSCT. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) increased when multiple viral <b>reactivations</b> occurred. Among the three viruses AdV had the greatest impact on TRM followed by EBV while CMV did not influence TRM. Furthermore severe acute GVHD was significantly associated with EBV <b>reactivations,</b> and showed a tendency to be related with CMV <b>reactivations</b> and the number of viral <b>reactivations.</b> Severe chronic GVHD was exclusively associated with AdV <b>reactivations.</b> Additionally, specific viral combinations had an impact on the occurrence of different organ damages. In conclusion, risk-adapted surveillance strategies are needed to recognize viral <b>reactivations</b> as soon as possible, and effective antiviral treatment options have to be developed to prevent the fatal risk of multiple viral <b>reactivations.</b> Nevertheless, it must be considered that all results are based on qualitative single-center data and should be confirmed in larger prospective multicenter studies including also quantitative data or kinetics of viral loads...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{natural history}} of HSV- 2 {{infection}} and role of HSV- 2 <b>reactivations</b> in HIV disease progression are unclear. METHODS: Clinical symptoms of active HSV- 2 infection were used to classify 1, 938 HIV/HSV- 2 co-infected participants of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into groups of varying degree of HSV- 2 clinical activity. Differences in plasma HIV RNA and CD 4 + T cell counts between groups were explored longitudinally across three study visits and cross-sectionally at the last study visit. RESULTS: A dose dependent association between markers of HIV disease progression and degree of HSV- 2 clinical activity was observed. In multivariate analyses after adjusting for baseline CD 4 + T cell levels, active HSV- 2 infection with frequent symptomatic <b>reactivations</b> was associated with 21 % to 32 % increase in the probability of detectable plasma HIV RNA (trend p = 0. 004), an average of 0. 27 to 0. 29 log 10 copies/ml higher plasma HIV RNA on a continuous scale (trend p< 0. 001) and 51 to 101 reduced CD 4 + T cells/mm(3) over time compared to asymptomatic HSV- 2 infection (trend p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: HIV induced CD 4 + T cell loss was associated with frequent symptomatic HSV- 2 <b>reactivations.</b> However, effect of HSV- 2 <b>reactivations</b> on HIV disease progression markers in this population was modest {{and appears to be}} dependent on the frequency and severity of <b>reactivations.</b> Further studies will be necessary to determine whether HSV- 2 <b>reactivations</b> contribute to acceleration of HIV disease progression...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this contribution, past process {{activity}} is reconstructed on seven landslide {{bodies of the}} Riou Bourdoux catchment (southeastern French Alps). Based on an unusually dense data set of 3036 tree-ring series extracted from 759 conifers, we provide evidence for 61 landslide <b>reactivations</b> since A. D. 1898. Based on logistic regressions and threshold analyses of monthly rainfall data and temperature anomalies, we determine {{that the combination of}} snow-rich winters and positive temperature anomalies in spring (enhanced snowmelt) seems to have driven landslide <b>reactivations</b> in the past. Since the early 1990 s, however, landslide <b>reactivations</b> clearly have been on the rise and thereby exhibit excessive and unprecedented rates of activity (12. 5 events per 10 yr) at the scale of the Riou Bourdoux catchment. From the data, evidence exists for a shift from snowmelt-induced landslides (controlled by winter precipitation) to <b>reactivations</b> controlled by spring temperatures.

40|$|Background. Systemic <b>reactivations</b> of herpesviruses {{may occur}} in {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) patients, even in those without prior immune deficiency. However, the clinical relevance of these events is uncertain. Methods. In this study we selected patients admitted with septic shock and treated for more than 4 days from a prospectively enrolled cohort of consecutive adults in the mixed ICUs of 2 tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands. We excluded patients who had received antiviral treatment in the week before ICU admission and those with known immunodeficiency. We studied viremia episodes with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6), herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV- 1) and 2 (HSV- 2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) by weekly polymerase chain reaction in plasma. Results. Among 329 patients, we observed 399 viremia episodes in 223 (68 %) patients. Viremia with CMV, EBV, HHV- 6, HSV 1, HSV- 2, and VZV was detected in 60 (18 %), 157 (48 %), 80 (24 %), 87 (26 %), 13 (4 %), and 2 (0. 6 %) patients, respectively; 112 (34 %) patients had multiple concurrent viremia events. Crude mortality in the ICU was 36 % in this latter group compared to 19 % in remaining patients (P <. 01). After adjustment for potential confounders, time-dependent bias, and competing risks, only concurrent CMV and EBV <b>reactivations</b> remained independently associated with increased mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 3. 17; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 41 - 7. 13).

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} the Air Force was reduced from 290to 190fixed-wing aircraft and had five of its twelve bases closed. In 2002, the Armée XXI reforms continued {{the pattern of}} reduction, with bases at Mollis, Turtmann, and Interlaken closed, jets relocated out of Dübendorf (later planned for closing), and the helicopter base at Alpnach placed on the closure list. These closures left Payerne, Sion, and Meiringen as the only combat bases, Emmen as the main helicopter base, and Locarno as a training base.

5|$|As part of {{president}} Ronald Reagan's and Navy Secretary John Lehman's {{effort to create}} a 600-ship Navy, New Jersey was selected for <b>reactivation</b> in the spring of 1981, and she was towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the end of July 1981 for modernization/reactivation. At the time of the <b>reactivation</b> the Navy envisioned using New Jersey and her sister ship Iowa to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as point defense system mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5inch gun mounts on New Jersey {{to make room for the}} armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery.|$|E
40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} {{with a history of}} frequent clinical herpes simplex (HSV) <b>reactivations</b> and 13 HSV seropositive controls were monitored for 6 months.

IgG subclasses directed against HSV- 1 nucleocapsid, membrane and glycoprotein C (gC) antigens were determined after the study period. Anti-HSV IgG 4 directed against gC was found more often in the patients (65 %) than in the controls (8 %, P less than 0. 025).

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude. Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the fault.
