5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation.

5|$|In {{economic}} and environmental fields, the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used {{in the context of}} economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce <b>resource</b> <b>intensity</b> (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.|$|E

In this paper, an emergy-based method is conducted to measure the resources input of Chinese industry from 1997 to 2006.

The efficiency and cost of renewable solar and wind power systems using intermittent resources could significantly be improved by developing low cost, high efficiency and more sustainable energy storage systems. A comparison study between energy storage options is presented in this paper. The energy storage options include: (1) electro chemical storage: lead acid, Li-ions, Nickel-Cadmium, Nickel metal hydride, Sodium Sulfur, and vanadium flow batteries; (2) electro-magnetic energy storage: super capacitors and super conducting magnetic energy storage; (3) hydrogen storage: onboard systems and utility scale; (4) mechanical storage: compressed air, flywheel, pumped hydro, spring (composite and metal), and (5) thermal energy storage. The <b>resource</b> <b>intensities</b> and operational parameters of the energy storage options are compared in this study. The main objective is to review {{the various types of}} storage techniques and their characteristics and to determine the most appropriate technique for solar and wind energy applications: energy storage system with suitable discharge time, lowest <b>resource</b> <b>intensities,</b> best operation performance and lowest cost. Based on the results obtained in this study, super capacitors, super conducting magnetic, and flywheel energy storage systems could be a good option for solar and wind applications: they offer fast discharging/charging times, greater performance (high specific power, high cycle efficiency, high cycle life and they) and are very attractive with respect to the operating costs. dc 201...|$|R

Transitional difficulties include possibly an inadequate appreciation of market failures, fuzzy property rights, reduced central control over local governments, in some cases breakdowns of law and order and capital stock and infrastructure which can only be substantially modified in the long run so as to improve pollution intensities and natural resource-use.
