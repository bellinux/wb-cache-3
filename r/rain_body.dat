50|$|Smudge is {{best known}} for his great fear of water, and because of that, has never, {{throughout}} the entire series, taken a bath. However, he was once illegally portrayed taking a shower in a TV commercial for a Brazilian showerhead manufacturer. He was once also drawn carrying a bundle of clothes and cookies under heavy rain and with water up to his waist in a time when Southern Brazil was suffering a heavy rain season. He fears <b>rain,</b> <b>bodies</b> of water, showers and taps. He also doesn't drink pure water, although he drinks juices and eats soup. To protect himself, he always carries an umbrella with him, for any possible emergency. In some strips, Smudge is even able to fly to run from water.|$|R

5000|$|Active {{from early}} 1945 {{until the end}} of the Second World War, Peter acted as a search and rescue dog in London. Knight wrote of the dog in a report, [...] "I think one of his finest jobs was on Monday. We were called 20 hours after the {{incident}} and after several hours of heavy <b>rain.</b> Three <b>bodies</b> were missing and he very quickly indicated in a most unlikely spot, but he was right, and they uncovered a man and a woman. The next day we were called to another job. There were so many calls for Peter that I worked him 10 hours and he never once refused to give all he had. All his marks revealed casualties. I hated to work him like this - but I also hated to refuse the rescue parties who were asking for him." [...] Peter's rescue efforts were not limited to saving people; on one occasion he indicated a trapped victim which turned out to be an African grey parrot. On another occasion he saved six people in a single attack.|$|R
500|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld is {{a single}} player, action-adventure video game. The game is {{presented}} in third person perspective, where the player takes control of Lara Croft. Lara's environment reproduces a more [...] "interactive world that reacts and remembers", such that footprints left in the mud or mud transferred to Lara's knee from kneeling {{on the ground is}} washed away by <b>rain,</b> the <b>bodies</b> of the foes she encounters remain where she killed them, and any destruction to the environment she causes is permanent. According to creative director Eric Lindstrom, this is [...] "to not only reward the player for the effect they're having on the world, but to give them navigational aids." [...] The game uses an animation blending system that allows Lara to interact dynamically with her environment, such as pushing foliage aside with one or two hands, depending on if she is carrying a weapon. It also features a [...] "hybrid lighting model that combines dynamic lights with carefully created light maps" [...] and a weather system that changes the environment, for example, [...] "If Lara’s negotiating a wet ledge she’s more apt to slip or lose grip," [...] which makes [...] "the environment [...] her adversary" [...] for {{a large part of the}} game.|$|R

30|$|We {{adopted an}} ‘Ecosystem Services Cascade’ {{framework}} that enabled {{the study to}} rationalize importance and significance of ES to human wellbeing. As explained by MA (2005) and Costanza et al. (1997), we considered the tangible and intangible benefits provided by an ecosystem as provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services that people derived from four ecosystems mainly forest, agro-ecosystem, seasonal and perennial water bodies. Because of the seasonal variation affecting the water <b>bodies,</b> we classified <b>rain</b> fed water <b>bodies</b> into seasonal and perennial water <b>bodies.</b> Seasonal <b>rain</b> influencing fresh water bodies like inundation are considered as seasonal water bodies, excluding seasonal influences are considered as perennial water bodies. Survey questions mainly focused on (i) dependency on ES by communities for their livelihood, (ii) community’s perception on state of LULCC and ES and (iii) long term changes over the flow {{of goods and services}} derived from these four ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} sphere is portraiture and its {{embodiment of}} emotion. The series of photographs explores our relation with water and, specifically that most elemental manifestation of water, <b>rain.</b> The <b>body</b> is transformed by rain {{both in terms}} of its physical state but also in the way that we present ourselves when wet to public scrutiny. Rain can be a pleasure or a nuisance. It can refresh but also damage. Using artificial rain this practice based research set out to see how people react and how they present themselves for portraiture when transformed by rain. The experiences were considerably varied and the portraits differ from each other across the poles of ‘braving it out’ to apparent delight to an inability not to register discomfiture. It was important to exhibit them in a watery setting if possible so that some form of inflection with water, however subtle, could take place. The Pump Rooms in Bath proved to be an ideal setting. The photographs were first shown in a group exhibition ‘Taking to Water’ which featured five other artists, Barry Anderson, Roni Horn, Fadrian Pigott and Hiroshi Sugimoto. Rain photographs featured in Portfolio magazine and in ‘Vitamin PH: New Perspectives in Photography', published by Phaidon in 2006, the latter showcasing the work of 122 artists. The brief of ‘Vitamin PH’ was to extend beyond the parameters of ‘straight’ photography to encompass sculptural, painterly and filmic elements and the photographic medium in an expanded sense. ‘Rain’ was reviewed in The Independent [URL] ‘It was also reviewed in Photoworks magazine. ‘Rain’ also featured in a monogram on the researcher published by Steidl/Photoworks...|$|R
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cyathus have fruit bodies (peridia) that are vase-, trumpet- or urn-shaped with {{dimensions}} of 4–8mm wide by 7–18mm tall. Fruit bodies are brown to gray-brown in color, {{and covered with}} small hair-like structures on the outer surface. Some species, like C.striatus and C.setosus, have conspicuous bristles called setae {{on the rim of}} the cup. The fruit body is often expanded at the base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement, which typically becomes tangled and entwined with small fragments of the underlying growing surface, improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by <b>rain.</b> Immature fruit <b>bodies</b> have a whitish membrane, an epiphragm, that covers the peridium opening when young, but eventually dehisces, breaking open during maturation. Viewed with a microscope, the peridium of Cyathus species is made of three distinct layers—the endo-, meso-, and ectoperidium, referring to the inner, middle, and outer layers respectively. While the surface of the ectoperidium in Cyathus is usually hairy, the endoperidial surface is smooth, and depending on the species, may have longitudinal grooves (striations).|$|R
6000|$|In these circumstances, {{it was not}} {{surprising}} that little Tim soon grew {{to be one of the}} pests of his alley. Tim was a weak-eyed boy, and remarkably thin, being, as his friend had said, composed chiefly of legs and arms. There must have been a good deal of brain also, for he was keen-witted, as people soon began to find out to their cost. Tim was observant also. He observed, on nearing the age of ten years, that in the great river of life which daily flowed past him, there were certain faces which indicated tender and kindly hearts, coupled with defective brain-action, and a good deal of self-will. He became painfully shrewd in reading such faces, and, on wet days, would present himself to them with his bare little red feet and half-naked <b>body,</b> <b>rain</b> water, (doing duty for tears), running from his weak bloodshot eyes, and falsehoods of the most pitiable, complex, and impudent character pouring from his thin blue lips, whilst awful solemnity seemed to shine on his visage.

50|$|Also, if powder {{particles}} are sufficiently small, they may become {{suspended in the}} atmosphere {{for a very long}} time. Random motion of the air molecules and turbulence provide upward forces that may counteract the downward force of gravity. Coarse granulars, on the other hand, are so heavy that they fall immediately back to the ground. Once disturbed, dust may form huge dust storms that cross continents and oceans before settling back to the surface. This actually explains why there is relatively little hazardous dust in the natural environment. Once aloft, the dust is very likely to stay aloft until it meets water in the form of <b>rain</b> or a <b>body</b> of water. Then it sticks and is washed downstream to settle as mud deposits in a quiet lake or sea. When geological changes later re-expose these deposits to the atmosphere, they may have already cemented together to become mudstone, a type of rock. For comparison, the Moon has neither wind nor water, and so its regolith contains dust but no mudstone.|$|R

2500|$|Commercial venues {{may provide}} {{amenities}} such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants' safety. Some fields are [...] "BYOP" [...] (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online {{and use it}} at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players. Other times, FPO policies are in keeping with municipal laws for wastewater and runoff; paintballs contain food dyes, and some formulations have metallic flakes and/or cornstarch {{to make them more}} visible, all of which can pose problems in water reservoirs and treatment plants. So, fields that must wash paintball paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial <b>rain</b> runoff into <b>bodies</b> of water that are used as sources of drinking water, are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this is to sell only approved paint and require that field paint be used.|$|R
40|$|Urbanization {{increases}} stormwater run-off volumes {{through the}} widespread use of impervious surfaces. This leads to localized flooding, water pollution and morphologically degraded water <b>bodies.</b> <b>Rain</b> gardens – a shallow, vegetated form of bioretention – are one strategy for mitigating these hydrologic consequences of urbanization. Rain gardens in highly urban areas typically require greater infiltration rates due to their smaller volumes. The application of urban rain gardens in a Mediterranean climate is further challenged by contrasting wet and dry seasons. These have significant implications for run-off, infiltration, treatment and plant survival. Soil selection is critical to all of these, because it performs the necessary and competing functions of drainage and plant-available water retention. An appropriate soil mix will sufficiently infiltrate stormwater to reduce run-off, while also holding some plant-available water to reduce irrigation needs during dry periods. Similarly, an appropriate plant palette will utilize species adapted to drought, well-drained soils and periodic flooding. The San Francisco Bay Area has a number of rain garden soil specifications, with little data on relative performance and minimal monitoring of existing sites. In this research, I will examine current soil specifications by regional agencies and municipalities. Furthermore, I will measure infiltration rates at nine locally sampled rain gardens sites, comparing these to cultivation needs of associated plant species. The implications for other Mediterranean climate regions, particularly southern Europe, are significant. While the Water Framework Directive recommends that stormwater be dealt with at the source, the EU and particularly the Mediterranean member states lag in rain garden implementation. A better understanding of the soil requirements for Mediterranean-climate rain gardens will advance their implementation in California and Mediterranean-climate regions generally...|$|R
40|$|Object Oriented Environs is {{the lively}} archive of a {{critical}} confluence between the environmental turn so vigorous within early modern studies, and thing theory (object oriented ontology, vibrant materialism, the new materialism and speculative realism). The book unfolds a conversation that attempts to move beyond anthropocentrism and examine nonhumans at every scale, their relations to each other, and the ethics of human enmeshment within an agentic material world. The diverse essays, reflections, images and ephemera collected here offer a laboratory for probing the mystery and potential autonomy of objects, in their alliances and in performance. The book is the trace of an event-space crafted over a day of conversation in two seminars at the Shakespeare Association of America meeting in 2014 in St. Louis and offers its nineteen essays as the end to the work-cycle of the collective we crafted that day. It is a noisy collation, full of bees, bushes, laundry, crutches, lists, poems, plague vectors, planks, chairs, <b>rain,</b> shoes, meat, <b>body</b> parts, books, and assorted humans (living and dead), and also a repertoire of dance steps, ways of configuring the relations between subject and object, actors or actants (human and otherwise).

50|$|Decades later, Billy Tuve, a Hopi, {{is arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of burglary and murder based on his presenting a rare diamond for pawn. Tuve's cousin, Cowboy Dashee solicits help from his friend Navajo Tribal Police Sergeant Jim Chee to clear Tuve's name. Retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn recalls that his old acquaintance Shorty McGinnis acquired a similar diamond many years ago from a man whose story matches Tuve's story. Then Louisa Bourebonette relates the stories she has heard from older Havasupais about {{the man with the}} diamonds living {{at the bottom of the}} Grand Canyon, and the flyers from a woman seeking her father's remains from that plane crash, which Leaphorn shares with Chee. Joanna Craig pays the bail for Billy Tuve, asking him to lead her to the place where he received the diamond. Though it will aid his case, Billy is reluctant because the place, the Salt Shrine, is sacred to his religion. Before Joanna can pick Billy up at his own home, Fred Sherman takes Billy away. Joanna trails them, and in a quick maneuver, takes Sherman's gun from him and shoots him in the chest. She and Billy proceed to the trail head on the south rim of the Grand Canyon. Billy takes her part way down, then disappears. Bradford Chandler, hired by Dan Plymale, learns Sherman will not meet him when a police officer answers Sherman's cell phone. Chandler goes on alone, arriving near the sacred spot. Chee, Dashee, and Bernadette Manuelito arrived earlier, looking both for the absent Billy and the man who long ago traded with Billy, a religious hermit wanting people to believe more in Massau’u, to resolve their feelings after the plane crash, with <b>bodies</b> <b>raining</b> down on them. Manuelito stays behind while Chee and Dashee each go a different way along the canyon bottom. She does not stay in one place, but walks and finds the slot (a cave but with an opening to sunlight way above) along the canyon wall where the man had lived, and his body, long dead of natural causes. She sees a human arm bone, and his array of the 70 remaining diamonds. She finds what Chee and Dashee sought.|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} been {{triggered}} {{by the fact that}} stainless steel is being increasingly used in new applications, where possible environmental effects may be a matter of concern. When stainless steel is exposed to a given environment, a key issue is the release of small amounts of the main alloying elements iron, chromium, nickel and molybdenum. Published release rate data of these elements turned out to be sparse. Furthermore, only little was known about the role of different parameters that may affect the release rate, such as degree of alloying, exposure time and surface finish. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} develop methodological means and to provide accurate metal release rates of alloying constituents from different grades of stainless steels- austenitic, ferritic and duplex- when exposed to selected environments: artificial <b>rain</b> and synthetic <b>body</b> fluids. The results and discussion have been summarised in this thesis by formulating and answering ten questions, all believed to be crucial for the understanding of possible environmental effects of stainless steels. Some common conclusions could be drawn, independent of stainless steel grade and exposure condition. Iron was always preferentially released, and the release rates of chromium, nickel and molybdenum (when measured) were significantly lower than of iron, also when considering the bulk proportion of these elements. The release rate of all elements was initially high and decreased with exposure time, mainly because of an observed enrichment of chromium in the passive film formed. The release rates of iron (2 μgcm- 2 week- 1) and nickel (0. 08 μgcm- 2 week- 1) from stainless steel from grades 304 and 316 exposed to artificial rain were much lower than corresponding rates for the pure metals (750 μgcm- 2 week- 1 released Fe and 15 μgcm- 2 week- 1 released Ni), whereas chromium exhibited similar release rates from stainless steel and the pure metal (0. 1 μgcm- 2 week- 1). This implies that the common procedure to calculate release rates, based on the pure metals and the nominal steel composition, significantly overestimates release rates of iron and nickel from stainless steel, but not of chromium. Total release rates from seven stainless steel grades in synthetic body fluid were found to decrease with increasing alloy content in the following release rate order: grade 409 >> grade 430 > grades 316 L ≈ 201 ≈ 2205 ≈ 304 > grade 310. The release rate was highly sensitive to pH of the synthetic body fluid but only slightly sensitive to stainless steel surface finish. QC 2012021...|$|R
