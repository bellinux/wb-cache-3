6000|$|The {{moment he}} finds that the Company has got a scent of any one of his bribes, he comes forward and says, [...] "To be sure, I {{took it as a}} bribe; I admit the party gave me it as a bribe: I {{concealed}} it for a time, because I thought it was for the interest of the Company to conceal it; but I had a secret intention, in my own mind, of applying it to their service: you shall have it; but you shall have it as I please, and when I please; and this bribe becomes sanctified the moment I think fit to apply it to your service." [...] Now can it be supposed that the India Company, or that the act of Parliament, meant, by declaring that the property taken by a corrupt servant, contrary to the true intent of his covenant, was theirs, to give a license to take such property,--and that one mode of obtaining a revenue was by the breach of the very covenants which were meant to prevent extortion, peculation, and corruption? What sort of body is the India Company, which, coming to the verge of bankruptcy by the robbery of half the world, is afterwards to subsist upon the alms of peculation and bribery, to have its strength recruited by the violation of the covenants imposed upon its own servants? It is an odd sort of body to be so fed and so supported. This new constitution of revenue that he has made is indeed a very singular contrivance. It is a <b>revenue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> by any officer of the Company, (for they are all alike forbidden, and all alike permitted,)--to be collected by any person, from any person, at any time, in any proportion, by any means, and in any way he pleases; and to be accounted for, or not to be accounted for, at the pleasure of the collector, and, if applied to their use, to be applied at his discretion, and not at the discretion of his employers. I will venture to say that such a system of revenue never was before thought of. The next part is an exchequer, which he has formed, corresponding with it. You will find the board of exchequer made up of officers ostensibly in the Company's service, of their public accountant and public treasurer, whom Mr. Hastings uses as an accountant and treasurer of bribes, accountable, not to the Company, but to himself, acting in no public manner, and never acting but upon his requisition, concealing all his frauds and artifices to prevent detection and discovery. In short, it is an exchequer in which, if I may be permitted to repeat the words I made use of on a former occasion, extortion is the assessor, in which fraud is the treasurer, confusion the accountant, oblivion the remembrancer. That these are not mere words, I will exemplify as I go through the detail: I will show you that every one of the things I have stated are truths, in fact, and that these men are bound by the condition of their recognized fidelity to Mr. Hastings to keep back his secrets, to change the accounts, to alter the items, to make him debtor or creditor at pleasure, and by that means to throw the whole system of the Company's accounts into confusion.|$|E

(2) It will be a more expensive fiscal agent. (3) It will be a less secure depository of the public money. To show {{the truth of the}} first proposition, let us take a short review of our condition under the operation of a national bank. It was the depository of the public revenues. Between the collection of those revenues and the disbursement of them by the government, the bank <b>was</b> permitted <b>to</b> and did actually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large amount of money actually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other plan would have been idle a great portion of the time, was kept almost constantly in circulation. Any person who will reflect that money is only valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device which will keep the government revenues in constant circulation, instead of being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage. By the subtreasury the <b>revenue</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> and kept in iron boxes until the government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the use of it, while the government does not itself need it, and while the money is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes.

When a fixed level of tax <b>revenue</b> has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> from the tariff alone, no adjustment in tariff rates can achieve an efficient resource allocation, {{even in a}} small open economy. Hence, the optimal tariff problem arises under a revenue constraint.

This provides a theoretical explanation for the finding in empirical studies that the efficiency loss from a uniform tariff structure is negligible.

60|$|I {{have already}} said that the subtreasury will reduce the {{quantity}} of money in circulation. This position is strengthened by the recollection that the <b>revenue</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> in Specie, so that the mere amount of revenue {{is not all that}} is withdrawn, but the amount of paper circulation that the forty millions would serve as a basis <b>to</b> <b>is</b> withdrawn, which would be in a sound state at least one hundred millions. When one hundred millions, or more, of the circulation we now have shall be withdrawn, who can contemplate without terror the distress, ruin, bankruptcy, and beggary that must follow? The man who has purchased any article--say a horse--on credit, at one hundred dollars, when there are two hundred millions circulating in the country, if the quantity <b>be</b> reduced <b>to</b> one hundred millions by the arrival of pay-day, will find the horse but sufficient to pay half the debt; and the other half must either be paid out of his other means, and thereby become a clear loss to him, or go unpaid, and thereby become a clear loss to his creditor. What I have here said of a single case of the purchase of a horse will hold good in every case of a debt existing at the time a reduction in the quantity of money occurs, by whomsoever, and for whatsoever, it may have been contracted. It may be said that what the debtor loses the creditor gains by this operation; but on examination this will be found true only to a very limited extent. It is more generally true that all lose by it--the creditor by losing more of his debts than he gains by the increased value of those he collects; the debtor by either parting with more of his property to pay his debts than he received in contracting them, or by entirely breaking up his business, and thereby being thrown upon the world in idleness.|$|R

[...] In addition to this, Mr. Silas Wright, Senator from New York, and the political, personal and confidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and introduced into the Senate the first subtreasury bill, and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the revenue in specie. It is true, I know, that that clause was stricken from the bill, but it {{was done by the}} votes of the Whigs, aided by a portion only of the Van Buren senators. No subtreasury bill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by Congress, some with and some without the specie clause; so that I admit there is room for quibbling upon {{the question of whether the}} administration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it that the fact that the President at first urged the specie doctrine, and that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it, warrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head as publicly recants it as he at first espoused it. I repeat, then, that by the subtreasury the <b>revenue</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> in specie. Now mark what the effect of this must be. By all estimates ever made there are but between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the United States. The expenditures of the Government for the year 1838--the last for which we have had the report--were forty millions. Thus it is seen that if the whole revenue <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> in specie, it will take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it. By this means more than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the whole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public office-holders, and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps not more than one quarter of a million, leaving the other fourteen millions and three quarters to get along as they best can, with less than one half of the specie of the country, and whatever rags and shinplasters they may <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> put, and keep, in circulation. By this means, every office-holder and other public creditor may, and most likely will, set up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the specie-men have of it,--each specie-man, upon a fair division, having to his share the fleecing of about fifty-nine rag-men.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> assess the financial viability of selected urban and rural municipalities in the Eastern Cape. Municipalities that are not financially viable and sustainable will always struggle to deliver basic services to communities. Without sound financial management systems, municipalities will <b>be</b> forced <b>to</b> discontinue their operations. Municipalities, particularly small and rural ones, are not self-sufficient and often rely on grants and transfers to satisfy their immediate short-term goal of providing basic services to satisfy {{the needs of their}} communities. Therefore, finance is regarded as an overriding and decisive factor for determining the viability of municipalities. The study seeks to investigate the financial viability of selected urban and rural municipalities in the Eastern Cape. Its key research questions are: • Are municipalities able to provide sufficient funds to provide a range of services at an acceptable service level? • To what extent do municipalities rely on external funding? • Do municipalities have revenue collection capacity and revenue policies? The study asserts that most municipalities lack the required financial resources. They depend mainly on transfers from Provincial Government and equitable share and conditional grants from National Government. Section 152 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 8 of 1996, states, amongst other things, that Local Government should ensure the provision of services to communities in a sustainable manner. The constitution further states that a municipality must strive, within its financial and administrative capacity, to achieve its objectives. The Municipal Finance Management Act, Act 56 of 2003, creates a framework for municipalities to borrow money and determine the conditions for short- and long-term borrowing. The Act assigns clear roles and responsibilities to the various role players involved in local government financial management. According to the Act, an annual budget for a municipality may only be funded from realistically anticipated <b>revenues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>collected.</b> As <b>revenue</b> projections in the budget must be realistic, the Municipal Property Rates Act, Act 6 of 2004, facilitates the collection of revenue in municipalities and establishes a uniform property rating system across South Africa. Property tax is the biggest element of local government tax <b>revenue</b> and <b>is</b> central <b>to</b> municipal finance. The Municipal Systems Act, Act 32 of 2000, amongst its objectives, provides for the manner in which municipal powers and functions are exercised as well as establishes a simple framework for the core processes of planning, performance management and resource mobilisation. The Act also provides a framework for public administration and human resource development. Finally, it also empowers the poor and ensures that municipalities put in place service tariffs and credit control policies that take their needs into account. The research contends that, whilst there is legislation and structures to assist and direct municipalities, it has been established that municipalities do not properly collect rates and taxes due to them <b>to</b> augment their <b>revenue.</b> The study has shown nevertheless that metropolitan municipalities have the capacity <b>to</b> collect <b>revenue</b> for municipal services. This is confirmed by their collection rate which ranges between 94 &# 37; and 97 &# 37;. There is also the culture of non-payment by communities for services rendered by the municipalities. Rural municipalities are exempted from property tax, while other rural municipalities who have an urban component, have <b>to</b> <b>collect.</b> There <b>is</b> also the question of unemployment and poverty. Consequently, municipalities are not self-sufficient and rely on grants and equitable share to survive. As a result of this lack of self-sufficiency, it <b>is</b> difficult <b>to</b> implement service delivery and also difficult to attract skilled personnel. The study has investigated why some municipalities fail <b>to</b> collect <b>revenue</b> and depend on national grants. The study employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings of the quantitative paradigm have been presented in the form of graphs and charts. The major findings include: All municipalities have limited borrowing capacity; have not exceeded their budgets in terms of their spending; small municipalities have households as their main contributor of revenue collected; metropolitan municipalities get the big slice of their revenue from business; small and rural municipalities rely on grants and transfers and are therefore not financially viable; metropolitan municipalities <b>are,</b> <b>to</b> a great extent, financially viable but lack skills and capacity to utilize their resources for effective service delivery; and all municipalities underspend their budgets.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. South Africa {{is still}} feeling {{the effects of}} the forced inequalities the {{apartheid}} system introduced and the resulting wide-spread poverty. Inequalities are particularly evident in the quality of services provided to different areas, which are in the majority still defined by race. The majority of White households have very good service provision, with water piped directly into the home. A great number of Black and Coloured households, by contrast, have very low levels of service where family members have to walk to collect water from communal taps. To this day, there are households in South Africa that {{do not have access to}} water infrastructure at all relying on rivers, streams or boreholes, with an increased risk of experiencing water borne diseases. With the end of apartheid and the beginning of democracy in 1994, the new government prioritised the redress of inequalities and sought to better the lives of the poor by providing them with improved services. This meant building or upgrading infrastructure as well as ongoing maintenance; whilst the initial costs were high, it became very quickly apparent that <b>revenue</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> in order <b>to</b> cover costs. Between 2008 and 2009, 26. 3 % of South Africans were living below the food poverty line of R 305 per person, and 52. 3 % were living below the upper bound poverty line, and this meant that many households <b>were</b> not able <b>to</b> afford the upgraded services. In recognising this challenge the Free Basic Water Policy (FBWP) was established in 2001, which provided a limited “lifeline” supply of water to every household for free, while any additional water usage would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid for. When the FBWP was conceptualised, it <b>was</b> designed <b>to</b> meet certain implementation and supply quality goals and standards. However, over time criticism rose that these goals had not been achieved and that in some cases the policy proved counterproductive. The objective of this dissertation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine the implementation of FBWP thus far, and to assess whether or not it is achieving the originally intended goals and standards. Quantitative data was gathered and used to compare the progress of the implementation of the FBWP to the implementation goals in order to assess whether or not the goals are being met. Overall there were six major goals for the implementation of the FBWP, with specific targets and standards pertaining to each goal. For the purpose of this study, the data for each goal was analysed and discussed so that the progress in achieving each goal could be assessed. The findings show that significant progress and improvement has been made in supplying Free Basic Water (FBW]. Although access to water supply and FBW, the level of service provided and the quality of the water have improved, there are still households who are not receiving FBW at the required standards. From the rate of progress made it can be seen that the original intention of providing FBW for all by 2014 was over-optimistic. A second finding was that the FBWP is not financially sustainable at present and that there is currently a lack of asset management and maintenance planning in many municipalities in South Africa, which has resulted in substantial revenue losses. It was also found that the monitoring of the FBWP is currently not sufficient. Aspects such as appropriateness of the allocated amount can only be resolved with improved monitoring mechanisms. The effectiveness of education programmes on water usage requires assessment in order to understand how increased awareness can impact on households’ ability to safe water...|$|R
