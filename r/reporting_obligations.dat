40|$|This {{research}} examines an attorney’s <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> {{in terms}} of section 29 of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act 38 of 2001 (FICA) to report suspicious and unusual transactions, which {{are not subject to}} legal professional privilege. In order to contextualise this <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> and to understand its application, terminology such as the proceeds of crime and money laundering is explained. Global best practice anti-money laundering guidelines, as manifested in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, are evaluated as well as typologies related to attorneys as targets for money laundering purposes. The establishment and development of the domestic regulatory and legislative frameworks to address the challenges around the proceeds of crime and money laundering are discussed, with specific reference to the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 121 of 1998, which inter alia criminalised money laundering, and the FICA. Special focus is placed on section 29 of FICA and terminology such as “transaction” and “suspicion” is evaluated as well as section 37 of the FICA, which acknowledges the legal professional privilege. The research explains the principles around the legal professional privilege and the requirements for the privilege to sustain and also indicates that there are clear limitations to the application of the legal professional privilege, as mere confidential information is not privileged and the right to confidentiality can be limited by legislation. The research also evaluates contradictory views around the section 29 FICA <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> by attorneys and addresses possible reasons for low reporting. As attorneys have a definite <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> {{in terms of}} section 29 of FICA, ramifications of non-reporting may include an attorney being the subject of a criminal investigation for possible association with predicate offences, offences under POCA as well as FICA non-reporting offences. Relevant role players will therefore need to partner towards assisting the profession in understanding and discharging this <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation.</b> Recommendations addressing the role of the provincial law societies as well as the Financial Intelligence Centre in assisting towards maturing the regulatory regime are also discussed. The research concludes with an ethical and positivistic approach towards discharging the <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> and suggestions regarding the way forward {{in order to protect the}} reputation of an elite profession.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 2001, Congress has provided the Department of Defense (DOD) with $ 888 billion in supplemental and annual appropriations, as of June 2009, primarily for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DOD's <b>reported</b> annual <b>obligations</b> for OCO have shown a steady increase from about $ 0. 2 billion in fiscal year 2001 to about $ 162. 4 billion in fiscal year 2008. For fiscal year 2009 OCO, Congress provided DOD with about $ 65. 9 billion {{in the fiscal year}} 2009 DOD Appropriations Act and about $ 80. 0 billion in a supplemental appropriation enacted in June 2009. A total of $ 59. 6 billion has been obligated through the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 through March 2009. The United States' commitments to OCO will likely involve the continued investment of significant resources, requiring decision makers to consider difficult trade-offs as the nation faces an increasing long-range fiscal challenge. The magnitude of future costs will depend on several direct and indirect cost variables and, in some cases, decisions that have not yet been made. DOD's future costs will likely be affected by the pace and duration of operations, the types of facilities needed to support troops overseas, redeployment plans, and the amount of equipment to be repaired or replaced. DOD compiles and reports monthly and cumulative incremental obligations incurred to support OCO in a monthly report commonly called the Contingency Operations Status of Funds Report. DOD leadership uses this report, along with other information, to advise Congress on the costs of the war and to formulate future OCO budget requests. DOD <b>reports</b> these <b>obligations</b> by appropriation, contingency operation, and military service or defense agency. DOD has prepared monthly <b>reports</b> on the <b>obligations</b> incurred for its involvement in OCO since fiscal year 2001. Section 1221 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 requires us to submit quarterly updates to Congress on the costs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom based on DOD's monthly cost-of-war reports.

DOD's reported annual costs for GWOT have shown a steady increase from about $ 0. 2 billion in fiscal year 2001 to about $ 98. 4 billion in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2007, Congress provided DOD with about $ 161. 8 billion in annual and supplemental appropriations for GWOT. To continue its GWOT operations, DOD has requested $ 141. 7 billion in appropriations for fiscal year 2008. The United States' commitments to GWOT will likely involve the continued investment of significant resources, requiring decision makers to consider difficult trade-offs as the nation faces an increasing long-range fiscal challenge. The magnitude of future costs will depend on several direct and indirect cost variables and, in some cases, decisions that have not yet been made. DOD's future costs will likely be affected by the pace and duration of operations, the types of facilities needed to support troops overseas, redeployment plans, and the amount of equipment to be repaired or replaced. Future cost variables for other U. S. government agencies include the efforts to help form national and provincial governments and build management capacity as well as capable and loyal security forces in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Reconstruction activities to restore, sustain, and protect critical infrastructure will also impose costs. Also, healthcare costs will likely increase as more servicemembers require treatment from injuries and mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. DOD compiles and reports monthly and cumulative incremental obligations incurred to support GWOT in a monthly Supplemental and Cost of War Execution Report. DOD leadership uses this report, along with other information, to advise Congress on the costs of the war and to formulate future GWOT budget requests. DOD <b>reports</b> these <b>obligations</b> by appropriation, contingency operation, and military service or defense agency.
