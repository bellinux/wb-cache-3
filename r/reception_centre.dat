25|$|According {{to persons}} interviewed at the Pansio <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> by {{national}} broadcaster Yle, the main suspect arrived to the centre in December 2016 and displayed radicalist behaviour during his stay, such as asking {{how he could}} join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), listening to radicalist sermons on his phone and considering Finns to be infidels. The interviewees warned the <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> management of this behaviour in January 2017. Helsinki Times published similar interviews afterwards.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to find out}} what are the {{concerns}} that different asylum seeker mothers from different nationalities in the <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> in Norway hold in relation to their children’s’ needs, particularly, to explore how past and present stressors as asylum seekers affect the mothers’ daily relationship with their children and how they still manage to cope. Also, the thesis aims at exploring if life in <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> affects mothers’ concerns. Finally, the thesis aims at uncovering if there is any task that <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> and social services can carry out to help to empower asylum-seeking mothers in their relationship with their children. In order to achieve these aims subjects have been interviewed in semi-structured qualitative interviews. The interviewees consisted of three asylum seekers mothers from different nationalities who live in <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> in Norway. In addition, the staff {{and the head of the}} same <b>reception</b> <b>centres,</b> two volunteers from Save the Children Norway and two experts from R-BUP have been interviewed. The thesis is a result of the analysis of those interviews and an investigation of the relevant psychological and cultural theories related to this subject. The main theories used in this thesis have been attachment theory, theories related to parental presence as a key influence in the child’s way of coping, the theory on a “family’s sense of coherence”, social learning theory in relation to the social construction of parenting, Harris’ theory on the importance of peer groups and Seligman et al. 's theory on positive psychology. The findings have shed light on the fact that <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> are in need of more resources in several areas in order to help mothers and children better. Nevertheless, in spite of their difficulties, the mothers interviewed have shown remarkable resilience in their current situation. Also, their children seem to be well adapted. Nonetheless, it is possible that the effects of their difficult current situation may show in the long term...|$|R

25|$|Along {{with the}} rest of the Great Eastern Railway, the branch became part of the Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway when the various British railway {{companies}} were grouped into four large companies in 1923. The line was heavily used during World War I and World War II, with extra Air Ministry sidings provided at Dereham in 1943.

Customs services for private aircraft are available at the two fixed-base operators (FBO), Shell Aerocentre and Esso, on the south field. There are also a number of aviation component repair facilities on airport grounds, mostly in the Esso Avitat complex.

25|$|In 1949 the {{training}} ship HMS Conway was moored in the Menai Strait near Plas Newydd. The ship was supported {{from the small}} dock in {{the grounds of the}} estate. The ship was wrecked after running aground in 1953, and the school built temporary facilities in the grounds near the current <b>reception</b> <b>centre.</b> These were used for teaching and housing the senior cadets. The younger cadets were accommodated in the eastern wing of the house. The former stables building was used for teacher accommodation, classrooms and a laboratory. These arrangements continued until 1964 when the entire school moved into a new purpose-built building in the grounds of the estate. The school was closed in 1974 but the buildings and the grounds were subsequently acquired by Cheshire County Council. It was renamed the Conway Centre and is now managed by a stand-alone organisation, Quality Learning Partners, with the support of Cheshire West and Chester Council, and is used as an outdoor adventure centre.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an empirical research carried out within Italian <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> for asylum seekers. The article shows how <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> can become a trap from which asylum seekers are no longer able to escape as they become victims of a process of social disempowerment making them dependent on the 'humanitarian government'. This reproduction of dependence enables the reception system to carry out a subtle social control function, achieving the effect of confining asylum seekers within a concentrated place that can easily be controlled by the police. But this form of control is exercised even though the law does not provide any explicitly repressive means for keeping them under surveillance. So-called <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> exert a centripetal force which is hard to resist, and which in a sense has an ability to trap asylum seekers more than any wall. The Italian reception system amounts to a form of 'humanitarian confinement', in that provide hospitality for asylum seekers, while subjecting them to a form of control enacted through humanitarian agents...|$|R
25|$|The Bell Homestead period {{began with}} the arrival of the Bell family in the summer of 1870 from their native Scotland, where two of their sons had died of {{tuberculosis}} and their middle son, Alexander Graham Bell, was additionally stricken and being consumed by disease. The Bell Homestead complex in the present day consists of several buildings with their own origins. The principal building at the site is Alexander Melville Bell's farmhouse, Melville House, along with its related greenhouse conservatory, outbuildings and fruit orchard. The farmhouse and its farmland were acquired for preservation as a museum in 1909. The Henderson Home, which had served as Canada's first telephone business office in downtown Brantford, was later moved to the site in 1969 and renovated extensively in 1970, to convert it into a separate telephone museum under the principal sponsorship of the county's largest telephone carrier, Bell Canada. As well, a tea house, a visitor <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> with a mini audio-video theatre and related facilities were also added to the homestead to accommodate visitors and tour groups.|$|E

After the coronation, Long was taken to the That Son region in Châu Đốc, in the far south of the Mekong Delta. There the peasants built a temple for him. They used a small restaurant in a nearby village as a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for the temple, as the temple was increasingly used as a military base, where fighters, weaponry and munitions were being assembled for an uprising. In the village of Tan Thanh, a local leader recruited his peasants for Long's revolt. The village chieftain predicted that a new Vietnamese monarch would descend from the sky at Cholon in March 1913, and that only the royalists would survive this miracle.|$|E

The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|R
