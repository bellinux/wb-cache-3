40|$|Quantitative {{approaches}} {{to the design of}} incentives in business firms are surveyed by drawing on writings from management science, finance, decision analysis, and mathematical economics. Two general incentive design situations are considered: How should incentives for the company president be designed, so that he or she will be induced to act {{in the interest of the}} ownership group or some other controlling syndicate? And how should incentives for divisions be designed, so that they will be induced to act in accordance with the interest of the whole firm? With respect to the first question, the following topics are discussed: the construction of an objective function for the firm derived through <b>die</b> <b>stock</b> market or directly from the preferences of the members of the controlling syndicate, the principal-agent situation, and the moral hazard situation. With respect to the second question, two topics are treated: the Soviet incentive scheme, and resource allocation. organization design, corporate incentives, divisonalized incentives...|$|R

50|$|Ratchet was {{eventually}} killed in The Transformers: The Movie {{in an attack}} by the Decepticons on an Autobot shuttle. The Decepticons penetrated the hull of the shuttle that he, Ironhide, Prowl, and Brawn were flying in. Ironhide and Ratchet attacked the invaders together after Prowl and Brawn's death. The two suffered {{the same amount of}} fire from the Decepticons; due to Ironhide's strong armor, he survived the first strike but ultimately <b>died.</b> <b>Ratchet,</b> on the other hand, was killed easily.

50|$|Prowl {{discovers the}} dead body of Shearbolt (a trader he spoke to earlier), but <b>Ratchet</b> determines Shearbolt <b>died</b> long before Prowl spoke to him, so they suspect {{there may be a}} Shifter (a Transformer able to {{transform}} into anything and anyone) hiding among the crew. Prowl interrogates Axer (a Decepticon who became stranded on Junkion after a Space Bridge malfunction), and from the information given, Optimus and Jazz deduce that Hound is the Shifter. Sure enough, Hound is revealed to be 777 - whose true identity is the Decepticon spy Makeshift - and he is responsible for sabotaging the Arks repairs on Velocitron.

50|$|The {{process of}} tube bending {{involves}} using mechanical force to push stock material pipe or tubing against a die, forcing the pipe or tube {{to conform to}} the shape of the <b>die.</b> Often, <b>stock</b> tubing is held firmly in place while the end is rotated and rolled around the die. Other forms of processing including pushing stock through rollers that bend it into a simple curve. For some tube bending processing, a mandrel is placed inside the tube to prevent collapsing. The tube is also held in tension by a wiper die to prevent any creasing during stress. A wiper die is usually made of a softer alloy i.e. aluminum, brass to avoid scratching or damaging the material being bent.|$|R

50|$|Form bound bending {{procedures}} like “press bending” or “rotary draw bending” {{are used}} to form the work piece {{into the shape of}} a <b>die.</b> Straight tube <b>stock</b> can be formed using a bending machine to create a variety of single or multiple bends and to shape the piece into the desired form. These processes can be used to form complex shapes out of different types of ductile metal tubing. Freeform-bending processes, like three-roll-pushbending, shape the workpiece kinematically, thus the bending contour is not dependent on the tool geometry.|$|R

Four workers of the Colwell Construction Company who were installing fiberglass wallboard in the room where the fire broke out were injured, one with burns over 15 percent of his body. While none of the foundation strains were lost, 300,000 production mice (about 50% of their <b>stock)</b> <b>died,</b> resulting in a national shortage of laboratory mice and the layoff of 60 employees.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{available}} historical documentation, {{the liturgical}} feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel did not originally {{have a specific}} association with the Brown Scapular or the tradition of Stock's vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This tradition grew gradually, as did the liturgical cult of St. Simon. The latter has been documented in Bordeaux, where <b>Stock</b> <b>died,</b> from the year 1435; in Ireland and England, from 1458; and {{in the rest of}} the Order, from 1564. Historians have long questioned whether Stock had the vision of Mary and the scapular. Although Simon Stock was never officially canonized, his feast day was celebrated in the church.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the lack}} of formal {{secondary}} and tertiary level education, Nobel gained proficiency in six languages: Swedish, French, Russian, English, German and Italian. He also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in English. His Nemesis, a prose tragedy in four acts about Beatrice Cenci, partly inspired by Percy Bysshe Shelley's The Cenci, was printed while he was <b>dying.</b> The entire <b>stock</b> except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous.

50|$|After a {{historical}} gap, references are noted from the 17th century {{of the land}} being {{in the possession of}} Robert Duncombe, an ancestor of the Lords Feversham. In 1773, Arnold Duncombe built a new house, Stocks House. The estate then passed successively to the Hayton, Whitbread and Gordon families. An heir to the Stocks estate, James Adam Gordon (d.1854), was a friend of the Scottish author Sir Walter Scott, and it is reputed that the writer visited Gordon at Stocks House. Gordon's widow, Emma Katherine, afterwards married the politician Richard Bright, who <b>died</b> at <b>Stocks</b> in 1878. Emma Katherine died in 1891, and left the estate to Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, as descendant of Samuel Whitbread. He shortly afterwards sold the house, as all that remained, to the author Mary Augusta Ward, whose husband was also a writer, Thomas Humphry Ward. While the Wards lived at Stocks, it became a bustling literary salon, welcoming leading intellectuals and writers of the day, including their nephews Aldous and Julian Huxley, their son-in-law George Macaulay Trevelyan, and George Orwell. Mary Ward died in 1920 and Stocks was inherited by her son, politician Arnold Ward.|$|R
