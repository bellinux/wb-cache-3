50|$|The {{first point}} of {{divergence}} is how states distinguish their registrants. At one end are the states operating single-tier systems that treat registrants equally {{with respect to}} reporting, <b>registration</b> <b>duration,</b> notification, and related factors. Alternatively, some states use multi-tier systems, usually {{with two or three}} categories that are supposed to reflect presumed public safety risk and, in turn, required levels of attention from law enforcement and the public. Depending on state, registration and notification systems may have special provisions for juveniles, habitual offenders or those deemed “sexual predators” by virtue of certain standards.|$|E
40|$|Addressing the {{increasingly}} unmet demand for transplantable kidneys in the U. S. requires creativity due to legislation that prohibits {{buying and selling}} organs. In order {{to increase the number}} of successful transplants that take place, transplant centers have begun to implement kidney exchange programs. A patient in need of a kidney trans-plant and a willing but incompatible living donor can enter into an exchange program, where an incompatible donor from one pair is matched to a recipient in a second pair, and vice versa. These arrangements can extend to three or more pairs in self-contained groups, indefinitely through the use of donor chains started by altruistic donors, or simply between a single pair and a patient on the waiting list in exchange for increased priority. In this paper, I first estimate the number of additional transplants gener-ated by kidney exchanges by analyzing how the probability of receiving an exchange transplant affects the probability that a patient experiences other transplant outcomes, including death while waiting. To do this, I create a novel measure of exchange preva-lence that exploits variation in exchange activity across time and transplant centers, as well as the importance of patient proximity to centers performing exchanges. I find that 6. 2 of every 10 exchange transplants represent living donor transplants that would not have occurred in the absence of exchange. Using the same approach, I find a small negative but insignificant effect on tissue type match quality. However, I also find that a ten percentage point increase in the probability of receiving an exchange transplant increases one-year graft survival by 2 percentage points, two-year graft survival by 1. 9 percentage points, and reduces waiting time by 59. 2 days, relative to an average over-all one-year graft survival rate of 93 percent, two-year rate of 88 percent, and 597 day <b>registration</b> <b>duration.</b> ∗I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Stacy Dickert-Conlin for her guidance throughout thi...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{predict the}} demand for a marriage-like status—registered {{domestic}} partnership–among same-sex couples. Domestic partnership {{in the state of}} California now comes with almost all of the rights and responsibilities of marriage that a state can provide. We use the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) Tobacco Use Survey conducted by the California Department of Health and the Field Research Corporation in 2003. From this telephone survey, we use a probability sample of 1, 002 lesbian and gay individuals in California. Using multinomial probit models of partnership status (single, not cohabiting, cohabiting, or registered), we find limited evidence of economic motivations in the choice to register. Gay men’s likelihood of registration rises with income; lesbians’ probability of registration rises with age. Couples with longer duration are more likely to register, suggesting that <b>registration</b> and <b>duration</b> are complementary signals of commitment and possibly of the need for rights and benefits of registration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBody {{balance is}} defined as the {{capacity}} that allows you to be aware and control your body posture in the air in order to maintain orthostatic position in statics and dynamics. Posture reflects general body balance, therefore it {{can be used as a}} balance assessment instrument. Our paper focuses on the aspects regarding static balance manifestation in sporty and unsporty children, aged 10 to 12. Assessing this ability with the help of posturography revealed differences in values between the two groups included in the study. The research was based on protocols with <b>registrations</b> of standard <b>duration</b> postural stability, with and without visual control. Following the interpretation of the results, we underline the fact that the subjects in the sporty group obtained higher values compared to the unsporty group, due to an increased muscular development and to the balance improvement exercices during the specific training...|$|R
40|$|First-year {{students}} in transition from hometown to campus are generally confronted by intellectual and social challenges {{as well as}} disruption {{and the formation of}} the place attachments associated with relocation. Understanding the variables affecting student place attachment helps address the widespread concern about student transition. Interactions between place attachment to hometown and campus, and the effects of endogenous and exogenous variables on place attachments, were analysed using covariance analysis, based on questionnaire data gathered at a Chinese university. Campus identity acts as a predictor for the other three dimensions of place attachment to hometown and campus: hometown identity, hometown dependence and campus dependence. Place attachment to campus exerts a direct effect on place attachment to hometown, while the latter indirectly impacts on the former through mediators including academic self-efficacy and peer relationships. Gender, household <b>registration</b> record and <b>duration</b> of dormitory stay were also identified as statistically significant predictors of student place attachment...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} flow of new antituberculosis chemical entities entering the tuberculosis drug development pipeline. Although this is encouraging, the current number of compounds is too low to meet the demanding criteria required for <b>registration,</b> shorten treatment <b>duration,</b> treat drug-resistant infection, and address pediatric tuberculosis cases. More new chemical entities are needed urgently to supplement the pipeline and ensure that more drugs and regimens enter clinical practice. Most drug discovery projects under way exploit enzyme systems deemed essential in a specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis biosynthetic pathway or develop chemical scaffolds identified by phenotypic screening of compound libraries, specific pharmacophores or chemical clusters, and natural products. Because {{the development of a}} compound for treating tuberculosis is even longer than for treating other infection indications, the identification of selective, potent, and safe chemical entities early in the drug development process is essential to ensure that the pipeline is filled with new candidates that have the best chance to reach the clinic...|$|R
40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) offset {{mechanism}} {{which is}} a part of the Kyoto Protocol. It allows developed countries to reduce GHGs in developing countries. Since the marginal cost of GHG reduction is lower in developing countries, this mechanism contributes to effective GHG reduction for developed countries. At the same time, according to the Kyoto Protocol, it should assist sustainable development in developing countries. However, many argue that this potential win-win mechanism is not working effectively, and will need some improvement after Kyoto expires. Given GHG emissions from developed countries will surpass those from developing countries around 2015, it is important for CDM not only to retain an offset scheme, but to also assist in decarbonization of developing countries. In this project, current CDM projects which have already been registered or rejected by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as of January 4 th, 2010 are examined by using linear and logistical regression models to detect significant factors with respect to successful <b>registration,</b> project <b>duration,</b> project scale and project efficiency. Each analysis is conducted for all CDM projects and for Japanese CDM projects. The results from the models show CDM projects with particular characteristics (sector, host countries, validator) are less risky in terms of investment. This means research and development for CDM schemes are beneficial for improvement of GHG reduction in developing countries. However, it is still difficult to assess how much each CDM project contributes to the sustainable development of a given host country...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the characterization of solar regime of Łódź and the surroundings e. g. the daily, the annual, the long-term variability of sunshine duration and total and UV solar radiation, the structure of sunshine duration with a special consideration of sunless and very sunny days, the relationship between solar components of climate, the influences of clouds on solar radiation income to an active surfaces, etc. The experimental materials for the study constituted of the daily totals of actual and relative sunshine duration in the period 1951 - 2000, the daily sums of total solar radiation in the period 1991 - 2002, measured in the Łódź-Lublinek station (S-W part of the city), 5 -year data series of 10 -minutes averages of intensity (in Wm- 2) of total (305 - 2800 nm) and UV (290 - 400 nm) solar radiation in the period 1997 - 2001, registered in the city center of Łódź. The long-term tendencies of sunshine duration were analyzed by means of linear regression method and sequential version of the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. All months excluding March, June and September are distinguished by a growing tendency of actual and relative sunshine duration. The number of sunny hours increases in spring, summer and winter, and decreases in autumn. An increase of annual sunshine duration totals (3. 5 h/year) within the 50 -year period was stated. Transformation of the annual course of sunshine duration within 50 -year period was detected. The annual maximum of sunshine duration during the first 25 -year period occurred in June and September. The second 25 -year period was characterized by increase of the number of sunny hour in May and August and by decrease of sunshine duration in June and September. The time of <b>registration</b> of sunshine <b>duration</b> extended in the morning hours and before the Sun set as a consequences of low cloudiness negative trend. The structure of sunshine duration in Łódź was presented in 5 classes of possible sunshine duration (0 - sunless days, 0. 1 - 25 % - cloudy days, 25. 1 - 50 % - moderately sunny days, 50. 1 - 75 % - sunny days, > 75 % - very sunny days). Only very sunny days were distinguished by a positive annual totals trend, on average 4 days per 10 years. The tendencies of sunshine duration recorded in Łódź within fifty last years are representative for Poland and result from the macroscale factor (atmospheric circulation) not only from the influences of local (anthropogenic) conditions. The regular fluctuations in the time series of sunshine duration and solar radiation were investigated by Blackman-Tukey classical spectral analysis method. The weak periodicity (statistical insignificance) amounted 8. 3, 2. 5, 2. 8, 3. 8 years and the significance short oscillations amounted 182. 5, 91. 2, 73 days were detected in sunshine duration time series. The total and UV solar radiation time series were characterized by 182. 5, 121. 7, 73 days significance periodicities. The values of transmission coefficient of total and UV solar radiation were investigated. The daily values of transmission coefficient varied from 25 % (total radiation) and 14 % (UV) in December to 50 % (total radiation) and 26 % (UV) in May.

The aim {{of study}} is to {{evaluate}} the fulfillment of the expectations of patients of a clinic while solving their health problems. Methods. The anonymous questionnaire-type poll {{has been carried out}} in the N family clinic during February 4 - 8 in 2008, patients aged 18 years old and older participated in the poll. 385 of questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 83, 9 percent. The statistical data analysis has been accomplished with SPSS version statistical package. Results. Respondents state that information about health and health care is very important (40, 6 - 62, 8 percent) and important (34, 7 - 51. 6 percent). The majority of medical information aspects are more relevant for women and for respondents with higher education. The expectations for medical information for 71, 3 - 86, 3 percent of respondents are fully satisfied. Respondents living in the city are satisfied with the level of information about the diagnosis of a disease, treatment ways, effect of medicine, medical tests and risk much more. More than a half of respondents (55, 9 percent) prefer partnership communication model, especially residents who live in the city (64 percent). Partnership model is used during the consultations of general practitioners the most often (53, 7 percent). The majority of respondents consider the communication with general practitioner positively. Doctor is attentive and observant during the consultations, she/he ensures confidentiality, moreover a doctor makes sure that the patients understand his/her guidelines and provides emotional support. Older people who are employed and have a higher education state that a doctor makes sure whether the patient understands his/her guidelines. Respondents with special high school education and people with disabilities state that material conditions do matter. Women, people from countryside and young people receive more emotional support. 66, 3 - 93, 5 percent of respondents claim that their expectations for the quality of health care and its accessibility are fully satisfied and satisfied. Every sixth responded is not satisfied with the possibility to consult a general practitioner over the phone. Men are more satisfied with the order of <b>registration,</b> the <b>duration</b> of waiting in the registration hall. Middle aged people with primary education are satisfied with the possibility to have a doctor’s consultation at home. Women are more satisfied with the duration of waiting by the doctor’s office; young people are satisfied with the treatment and tests quality, while people living in the city are satisfied with the possibility to consult the doctor over the phone. Conclusions. Two thirds and more of the respondents are satisfied with the medical information, communication with a general practitioner, quality of health care services and their accessibility. The majority of medical information aspects are more interesting for women and respondents with higher education. In the meantime, respondents living in the city are more satisfied with the information about the diagnosis of the disease, effect of medical tests and risk. Emotional support is more often provided for women, people from the countryside and young people...|$|R
