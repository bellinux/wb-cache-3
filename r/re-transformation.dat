50|$|The {{transformation}} from austenite to martensite is mostly accomplished through quenching, {{but in general}} it is driven farther and farther toward completion as temperature decreases. In higher-alloy steels such as austenitic stainless steel, the onset of transformation can require temperatures much lower than room temperature. More commonly, an incomplete transformation occurs in the initial quench, so that cryogenic treatments merely enhance the effects of prior quenching. However, since martensite is a non-equilibrium phase on the iron-iron carbide phase diagram, {{it has not been}} shown that warming the part after the cryogenic treatment results in the <b>re-transformation</b> of the induced martensite back to austenite or to ferrite plus cementite, negating the hardening effect.|$|E

Insertional and replacement constructs were compared and {{the superiority of the}} latter could be shown. In case of replacement constructs it was found that remaining terminal parts of the vector at one side of the construct do not reduce the gene targeting efficiency. This allows more simple production of transformation DNA. In extensive phototropism studies of dark adapted caulonematic protonemata clear phenotypes were found. The most distinct phenotype could be seen in the PP 4 knockout missing any positive phototropic response. In Ceratodon a homolog of PP 4 could be cloned. This will allow the study of phytochrome action in this different model system. In cooperation with Gerhard Brücker efficient gene targeting was demonstrated in Ceratodon. For this approach a heme oxygenase gene from Ceratodon was cloned and sequenced. In two aphototropic class I lines of Ceratodon a mutation of this gene was found a deletion in ptrP 14 and a point mutation in ptr 116. This point mutation could be efficiently repaired by gene targeting. Up to now only one single phytochrome effect has been analysed and this was done only in single knockout lines. However, it could be demonstrated that double knockouts can be produced. This was done by <b>re-transformation</b> of knockout lines with knockout constructs for different genes.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} is described that targets specific populations of transcripts for homology-based gene silencing using transitive RNAi. This approach {{is designed to}} target {{a subset of the}} transcriptome in order to identify genes involved in a particular localized process, such as photosynthesis. As a proof-of-concept approach, mesophyll cells from Arabidopsis thaliana were laser-microdissected from whole leaves to generate a focused cDNA library that was bi-directionally cloned into a transitive RNAi vector that had been designed to induce silencing of homologous, endogenous genes. Approximately 15 % of the transformant plants identified from both sense and antisense libraries exhibited visible phenotypes indicative of photosynthetic defects. Amplification from the genome and sequencing of cDNA inserts identified candidate genes underlying the phenotypes. For 10 of 11 such mutants, <b>re-transformation</b> with an RNAi construct corresponding to the candidate gene recapitulated the original mutant phenotype, and reduction of corresponding endogene transcripts was confirmed. In addition, one of the re-transformed transgenes also silenced transcripts of closely related family members, thereby demonstrating the utility of this approach for mutagenesis of redundant gene functions. Preliminary results using tissue-specific transitive RNAi forward mutagenesis of the Arabidopsis vegetative shoot apical meristem demonstrate the broad applicability of this forward mutagenesis technique for a variety of plant cell types.

Clones containing DYZ 3 or DYZ 5 sequences were found in libraries at about the frequency anticipated {{on the basis of}} their abundance in the genome, but clones containing DYZ 1 sequences were under-represented and the three clones examined contained junctions between DYZ 1 and DYZ 2. One DYZ 3 clone was quite stable and had a long-range structure corresponding to genomic DNA. All other clones had long-range structures which either did not correspond to genomic DNA, or were too unstable to allow a simple comparison. The effects of the transformation process and host genotype on YAC structural stability were investigated. Gross structural rearrangements were often associated with <b>re-transformation</b> of yeast by a YAC. rad 1 -deficient yeast strains showed levels of instability similar to wild-type for all YAC clones tested.

The significant errors {{inherent in}} existing approaches and the improved {{results that are}} possible {{have led to the}} development of a new numerical grid methodology for simulating complex and non-complex reservoir systems. The technique transforms the unstructured Cartesian coordinates ([...] x, [...] y, [...] z) of the reservoir into a locally structured dimensionless curvilinear coordinates [ξ([...] r [...]),ξ([...] θ),ξ([...] z [...])] using a transformation triangular coordinates system that renders the grid systems dimensionless to unity in domain [0, 1]. The transformed flow reservoir model was numerically solved using orthogonal collocation method. The <b>re-transformation</b> to the original plane in Cartesian coordinates also uses an inverse transformation model. The inaccuracy and difficulty in modeling and simulating multiphase flow of complex reservoirs has been significantly reduced through the use of a transformed reservoir model, which was solved in the triangular curvilinear dimensionless plane that can only have spatial coordinates [0, 1]. The unique attribute of the proposed model in this study is that it uses the ten collocation grid points to transform into triangular coordinates instead of multiblocks cells. This has significantly reduced the complexity of the various attributes of the reservoir into a simple grid collocation points with coordinates in triangular plane that cannot exceed one or be less than zero.|$|E

The bulk of the primary historical research is based upon two separate spheres of homosexual-related criminal cases, adult and juvenile homosexual 'criminal' cases. The Archivo Histórico houses adult crime cases adjudicated by Mexico City's Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Distrito Federal. The AGN, meanwhile, houses juvenile cases brought to the officials at the Tribunal Administrativo para Menores, a court established in 1927 to adjudicate cases involving troubled youths and delinquents. The criminalization of homosexuality embodied the contradictory and exclusionary nature of modernization in Mexico. More precisely, criminological discourse of turn-of-the-century Mexico, born {{in the name of}} modern science, did not aim to extend benefits of progress of the entire population. Rather, it served as an acceptable justification for the exclusion of vast segments of Mexican society from the progress of modernization.

40|$|Plant proteomes show {{remarkable}} plasticity {{in reaction}} to environmental challenges and during developmental transitions. Some of this adaptability comes from ubiquitin-mediated protein destruction regulated by cullin-RING E 3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). CRLs are activated through modification of the cullin subunit with the ubiquitin-like protein RUB/NEDD 8 by an E 3 ligase called defective in cullin neddylation 1 (DCN 1). Here we show that tobacco DCN 1 binds ubiquitin and RUB/NEDD 8, and associates with cullin. When knocked down by RNAi, tobacco pollen formation stopped and zygotic embryogenesis was blocked around the globular stage. Additionally, we found that RNAi of DCN 1 inhibited the stress-triggered reprogramming of cultured microspores from their intrinsic gametophytic mode of development to an embryogenic state. This stress-induced developmental switch is a known feature in many important crops and leads ultimately {{to the formation of}} haploid embryos and plants. Compensating the RNAi effect by <b>re-transformation</b> with a promoter-silencing construct restored pollen development and zygotic embryogenesis, as well as the ability for stress-induced formation of embryogenic microspores. Overexpression of DCN 1, however, accelerated pollen tube growth and increased the potential for microspore reprogramming. These results demonstrate that the biochemical function of DCN 1 is conserved in plants and that its activity is specifically required for transitions during pollen development and embryogenesis, and for pollen tube tip growth...|$|E

Naturally transformable cells of Acinetobacter baylyi were exposed to DNA from integron-carrying strains of the genera Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella to determine the nature and frequency of transfer. Exposure to the various DNA sources resulted in acquisition of antibiotic resistance traits as well as entire integrons and transposons, over a 24 h exposure period. DNA incorporation was not solely dependent on integrase functions or the genetic relatedness between species. DNA sequence analyses revealed that several mechanisms facilitated stable integration in the recipient genome depending {{on the nature of}} the donor DNA; homologous or heterologous recombination and various types of transposition (Tn 21 -like and IS 26 -like). Both donor strains and transformed isolates were extensively characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, integron- and cassette-specific PCRs, DNA sequencing, pulsed field gel electrophoreses (PFGE), Southern blot hybridizations, and by <b>re-transformation</b> assays. Two transformant strains were also genome-sequenced.

40|$|I {{found that}} SV 40 {{transformation}} induced {{the loss of}} several specific growth factor requirements. In particular, SV 40 transformed 3 T 3 fibroblasts had a significantly reduced growth requirement for insulin. A reduced insulin requirement was also observed in several other transformed cell lines. Dose response studies with insulin and insulin-like growth factors indicated that the mitogenic response to insulin is in all probability mediated by IGF-I receptors, and that the reduced insulin requirement observed in transformed fibroblasts actually reflects {{the loss of a}} strong IGF-I requirement. IGF-I is under strict pituitary-growth hormone control in vivo, and mediates many if not all of the growth promoting effects of growth hormone. A reduced IGF-I requirement may allow transformed fibroblasts to escape from this major humoral regulatory system. SV 40 transformed cells also displayed a significantly diminished requirement for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The loss of this particular growth factor requirement was found to be closely associated with the loss of density-dependent growth inhibition. Cell lines transformed by temperature sensitive mutants of SV 40 exhibited a temperature sensitive loss of the PDGF requirement, indicating that SV 40 T-antigen mediates this effect. Results pertaining to the temperature sensitivity of the insulin requirement were inconclusive. I found that SV 40 could directly reduce the insulin requirement of 3 T 3 cells in a transformation assay based upon the stringent insulin requirement of 3 T 3 cells for colony formation. Several such insulin-transformants were isolated and characterized. Although all of these transformants expressed SV 40 T-antigen, some of them retained anchorage-dependence and/or a partial PDGF requirement, unlike transformants obtained in the standard density of anchorage assays. A revertant of SV 40 transformed 3 T 3 cells was found to have regained a very strong dependence upon insulin. This dependence was not overcome by <b>re-transformation</b> with Kirsten Murine Sarcoma virus, although retransformation did obviate both its density-dependent growth inhibition and PDGF requirement. Kirsten transformed 3 T 3 normally display a greatly reduced insulin requirement, indicating that this particular revertant may have suffered a cellular mutation that prevents transforming viruses from induced the reduced insulin requirement...|$|E
40|$|In the {{transformation}} of multiple genes, gene fusion is an attractive alternative to other methods, including sexual crossing, <b>re-transformation,</b> and co-transformation, among others. The 2 A peptide from the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes the co-translational "cleavage" of polyprotein and operates {{in a wide variety}} of eukaryotic cells. LP 4, a linker peptide that originates from a natural polyprotein occurring in the seed of Impatiens balsamina, can be split between the first and second amino acids in post-translational processing. LP 4 / 2 A is a hybrid linker peptide that contains the first nine amino acids of LP 4 and 20 amino acids of 2 A. The three linkers have been used as a suitable technique to link the expression of genes in some transgenic plants, but to date the cleavage efficiency of three linkers have not been comprehensively demonstrated in the same transformation system, especially in the staple crop. To verify the functions of 2 A, LP 4, and LP 4 / 2 A linker peptides in transgenic maize, six fusion protein vectors that each encoded a single open reading frame (ORF) incorporating two report genes, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and β-glucuronidase (GUS), separated by 2 A (or modified 2 A), LP 4 or LP 4 / 2 A were assembled to compare the cleavage efficiency of the three linkers in a maize transient expression system. The results demonstrated the more protein production and higher cleavage splicing efficiency with the polyprotein construct linked by the LP 4 / 2 A peptide than those of the polyprotein constructs linked by 2 A or LP 4 alone. Seven other fusion proteins that each encoded a single ORF incorporating two different genes GFP and Red Fluorecent Protein (RFP) with different signal peptides were assembled to study the subcellular localization of genes linked by LP 4 / 2 A. The subcellular localization experiments suggested that both types of signal peptide, co-translational and post-translational, could lead their proteins to the target localization in maize protoplast transformed by LP 4 / 2 A polyprotein construct and it implied the LP 4 / 2 A linker peptide could alleviate the inhibition of 2 A processing by the carboxy-terminal region of upstream protein of 2 A when translocated into the ER...|$|E
40|$|Site Specific Recombination systems, such as FLP-FRT and Cre-lox, {{have been}} {{successfully}} used for site-specific gene integration and marker-gene deletion in plant systems. They are very useful tools in the integration of single-copy full-length transgene cassettes into the genome because the transgene integration via conventional methods often generate multi-copy locus. Such complex locus containing direct and inverted repeats of full-length and truncated copies of the transgene cassette generate aberrant RNA resulting in gene silencing. Therefore, for stable gene expression, a single copy transgene locus is preferred. However, even single copy locus sometimes succumbs to gene silencing. Although the mechanism is not very well understood, {{it is thought that}} transgene expression above a threshold level triggers gene silencing. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of transgene copy number on gene expression, and to control the locus structure and integrate full-length copies. In the present study, Cre-lox site-specific recombination system was used for integration of 1 - 3 C of green fluorescent protein (GFP) or beta-glucuronidase (GUS) genes into a pre-determined integration locus in rice cells. Expression analyses revealed a clear 2 - 4 times increase in GFP and GUS productions correlated with transgene copy numbers (1 - 3 C). As a next step towards the practical implementation of this technology, a molecular strategy was developed for generating marker-free site-specific gene integration. This strategy relies on Cre-lox-mediated gene integration followed by FLP-FRT-mediated marker excision. The molecular strategy is designed to generate an integration locus consisting of strategically-placed FRT sites to remove marker genes. In the original strategy, an inducible FLP-FRT system was included to control the marker excision step. This strategy was tested on two integration lines resulting in poor to undetectable excision of marker genes. In the subsequent modifications involving <b>re-transformation</b> of the integration lines with the improved version of FLP gene, called FLPe, marker excision was detected in the retransformed lines.

Keeping this objective in mind, we set out to screen the custom made 18 day old mouse testes cDNA library in pGAD 10 vector available in the laboratory, to hunt for novel interacting partners of PTB using the Clontech’s Matchmaker Gal 4 yeast two hybrid system III. PTB 1, the prototype of PTB was chosen and the above mentioned cDNA library was screened for novel PTB interacting partners. Twenty five large scale library transformations (spanning 8 * 106 independent clones) were performed and 99 putatives were obtained. By <b>re-transformation</b> of these library plasmids with bait construct to check for the interaction phenotype and eliminating bait independent activation of reporter genes and elimination of known false positives, only 5 clones were consistent with the interaction phenotype. All these library plasmids were sequenced with vector specific primers, ORF was identified and BLAST analysis for the identification of insert was done. Two of these clones encoded the partial CDS of mouse Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT 3 -PIAS 3. One of these encoded the partial CDS of mouse TOLL Interacting Protein-TOLLIP. The other two encoded the partial CDS of mouse importin-α and mouse hnRNP K, both of which were already known interacting partners of PTB. GST pull down assay and mammalian matchmaker co-immunoprecipitation was used for confirming the in vitro one to one physical interaction between PTB and these newly identified protein partners. Indirect Immunofloresence was used for demonstrating the co-localization of PTB and PIAS 3 in Gc 1 Spg mouse spermatogonial cell line. The fact that PIAS 3 an E 3 SUMO ligase was picked up as an interacting partner of PTB was interesting and we hypothesized that PTB might be a sumoylation substrate. Towards this, we first resorted to the prediction of sumoylation consensus motif by using SUMOPLOT. PTB indeed was found to have sumoylation consensus sites. Subsequently, in vivo sumoylation of PTB was demonstrated, where in over expression of donor protein [SUMO- 1] and acceptor protein [PTB] in RAG- 1 mouse kidney cell line had resulted in the identification of an approximately 67 kDa slow moving SUMO modified myc tagged PTB band apart from the bulk of unmodified 57 kDa myc-PTB. This confirmed the fact that PTB is SUMO modified only at a single consensus target site in vivo and attempts are made to map this site of modification. SUMOylation regulates diverse biological processes in vivo ranging from nucleo- cytoplasmic shuttling, alteration of protein-protein interaction, DNA protein interaction etc. PTB shuttles rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a transcription sensitive manner and the translocation of PTB to the cytoplasm, happens under the conditions of cell stress, viral infections, apoptosis and exposure of cells to genotoxic agents like doxorubicin. Phosphorylation of PTB at Ser- 16 residue has been shown to modulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of PTB, albeit shuttling can also occur irrespective of this modification. Interaction of PTB with an E 3 SUMO ligase-PIAS 3 {{and the fact that it}} is SUMOylated in vivo, we hypothesize that K- 47 residue present in the NLS/NES might be the most probable site of this SUMO modification and SUMOylation of PTB by PIAS 3 might regulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of PTB...|$|E
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{the most}} well {{characterized}} eukaryote, the preferred microbial cell factory for the largest industrial biotechnology product (bioethanol), and a robust commercially compatible scaffold to be exploited for diverse chemical production. Succinic acid is a highly sought after added-value chemical which is not overproduced in native S. cerevisiae strains. The genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of S. cerevisiae enabled in silico gene deletion predictions. First, a multi-gene, non-intuitive, genetic engineering strategy guided by an evolutionary programming method to couple biomass formation through glycine/serine amino acid requirements to succinate production was proposed. Pursuing these targets, a multi-gene deletion strain was constructed, and directed evolution with selection was used to identify a succinate producing mutant. Physiological characterization coupled with integrated data analysis of transcriptome data in the metabolically engineered strain were used to identify 2 nd-round metabolic engineering targets – overexpression of ICL 1. The resulting strain represents a 30 -fold improvement in succinate titer, and a 43 -fold improvement in succinate yield on biomass, with only a 2. 8 -fold decrease in the specific growth rate compared to the reference strain. Further genome-scale metabolic modeling supplemented with pathway visualization, flux balance analysis, and model modifications to better simulate batch glucose conditions was performed. Identification of the top single and double gene deletion strategies, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, resulted in three predictions with a 10 -fold improvement in succinate yield on glucose compared to the reference: MDH 1, OAC 1, and DIC 1. While &#x 22 BF;mdh 1 and &#x 22 BF;oac 1 strains failed to produce more succinate relative to the reference, &#x 22 BF;dic 1 produced 0. 02 C-mol C-mol-glucose- 1, {{in close agreement with}} model predictions (0. 03 C-mol C-mol-glucose- 1). Pathway visualization, coupled with transcriptional profiling, suggested that succinate formation was coupled to mitochondrial redox balancing, and more specifically, reductive TCA cycle activity. The aforementioned metabolic engineering strategies were designed based on glucose supplementation and metabolism. Future S. cerevisiae microbial cell factories capable of fast and efficient xylose consumption for biorefinery compatibility, and succinic acid overproduction would be highly desirable. Metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for consumption of xylose aerobically without redirection of some carbon flux to overflow metabolites (ethanol, glycerol, acetate, xylitol) was accomplished by expression of PsXYL 1, PsXYL 2, and PsXYL 3 from the native xylose-metabolizing Pichia stipitis, and subsequent, directed evolution. The resulting S. cerevisiae strain showed xylose consumption at a specific rate of 0. 31 g g-cell- 1 h- 1, a specific growth rate of 0. 18 h- 1, and a biomass yield of 0. 62 C-mol C-mol-xylose- 1. Plasmid isolation and <b>re-transformation</b> confirmed the conferred phenotype resulted from a chromosomal modification. Transcriptional profiling confirmed a strongly up-regulated glyoxylate pathway enabling sustained respiratory metabolism. A proof-of-concept study was performed to determine if whole high-throughput genome sequencing {{could be used as a}} tool in metabolic engineering for direct identification of genotype to phenotype correlations. Therefore, whole genome sequencing of S. cerevisiae S 288 C and CEN. PK 113 - 7 D resulted in identification of 13, 787 filtered SNPs in CEN. PK 113 - 7 D, with a total of 939 SNPs detected across 158 unique metabolic genes, 85 of which contained a total of 219 nonsilent SNPs. S. cerevisiae CEN. PK 113 - 7 D exhibited significantly higher ergosterol content correlating with non-silent SNPs identified in ERG 8 and ERG 9. The flux through the galactose uptake pathway was much lower in S 288 C compared with CEN. PK 113 - 7 D, correlating with the non-silent SNP enrichment in GAL 1 and GAL 10. Inspection of the significantly differentially expressed genes between strains did not reveal an obvious gene cluster that would explain the significant physiological differences, strongly suggesting that genotype to phenotype correlation is manifested post-transcriptionally or post-translationally...|$|E
40|$|Substance use data such as alcohol {{drinking}} often {{contain a}} high proportion of zeros. In studies examining the alcohol consumption in college students, for instance, many students may not drink in the studied period, resulting in a number of zeros. Zero-in ated continuous data, also called semi- continuous data, typically consist of a mixture of a degenerate distribution at the origin (zero) and a right-skewed, continuous distribution for the positive values. Ignoring the extreme non-normality in semi-continuous data may lead to substantially biased estimates and inference. Longitudinal or repeated measures of semi-continuous data present special challenges in statistical inference because of the correlation tangled in the repeated measures on the same subject. Linear mixed-eects models (LMM) with normality assumption that is routinely used to analyze correlated continuous outcomes are inapplicable for analyzing semi-continuous outcome. Data transformation such as log transformation is typically used to correct the non-normality in data. However, log-transformed data, after the addition of a small constant to handle zeros, may not successfully approximate the normal distribution due to the spike caused by the zeros in the original observations. In addition, the reasons that data transformation should be avoided include: (i) transforming usually provides reduced information on an underlying data generation mechanism; (ii) data transformation causes diculty in regard to interpretation of the transformed scale; and (iii) it may cause <b>re-transformation</b> bias. Two-part mixed-eects models with one component modeling the probability of being zero and one modeling the intensity of nonzero values have been developed over the last ten years to analyze the longitudinal semi-continuous data. However, log transformation is still needed for the right-skewed nonzero continuous values in the two-part modeling. In this research, we developed Bayesian hierarchical models in which the extreme non-normality in the longitudinal semi-continuous data caused by the spike at zero and right skewness was accom- modated using skew-elliptical (SE) distribution and all of the inferences were carried out through Bayesian approach via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The substance abuse/dependence data, including alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms (AADS) data and marijuana abuse/dependence symptoms (MADS) data from a longitudinal observational study, were used to illustrate the pro- posed models and methods. This dissertation explored three topics: First, we presented one-part LMM with skew-normal (SN) distribution under Bayesian frame- work and applied it to AADS data. The association between AADS and gene serotonin transporter polymorphism (5 -HTTLPR) and baseline covariates was analyzed. The results from the proposed model were compared with those from LMMs with normal, Gamma and LN distributional assump- tions. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. We concluded that the LMM with SN distribution not only provides the best model t based on Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), but also oers more intuitive and convenient interpretation of results, because it models the original scale of response variable. Second, we proposed a exible two-part mixed-eects model with skew distributions including skew-t (ST) and SN distributions for the right-skewed nonzero values in Part II of model under a Bayesian framework. The proposed model is illustrated with the longitudinal AADS data and the results from models with ST, SN and normal distributions were compared under dierent random- eects structures. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. Third, multivariate (bivariate) correlated semi-continuous data are also commonly encountered in clinical research. For instance, the alcohol use and marijuana use may be observed in the same subject and there might be underlying common factors to cause the dependence of alcohol and marijuana uses. There is very limited literature on multivariate analysis of semi-continuous data. We proposed a Bayesian approach to analyze bivariate semi-continuous outcomes by jointly modeling a logistic mixed-eects model on zero-in ation in either response and a bivariate linear mixed-eects model (BLMM) on the positive values through a correlated random-eects structure. Multivariate skew distributions including ST and SN distributions were used to relax the normality assumption in BLMM. The proposed models were illustrated with an application to the longitudinal AADS and MADS data. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed models...|$|E

40|$|Potato is {{the most}} {{important}} non-cereal crop in the world. Late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, {{is the most}} devastating disease of potato. In the mid- 19 th century, P. infestans attacked the European potato fields and this resulted in a widespread famine in Ireland and other parts of Europe. Late blight remains the most important pathogen to potato and causes a yearly multi-billion US dollar loss globally. In Europe and North America, late blight control heavily relies on the use of chemicals, which is hardly affordable to farmers in developing countries and also raises considerable environmental concerns in the developed countries. The structure of P. infestans populations can change quickly by migration, sexual recombination and sub-clonal variation. Migration and the reconvening of the two mating types considerably raised the level of genetic diversity in the global P. infestans population, leading to a more variable population with a presumed higher level of adaptability as compared to the previously, purely asexually, reproducing population. How can the P. infestans population efficiently be monitored with such diverse genotypes? A high-throughput, high-resolution and easy-handled set of markers would be favorable for this purpose. Few genetic markers, if any, have found such widespread use as SSRs. Sequencing allows the identification of large numbers of microsatellites by bioinformatics. So far, however, {{only a limited number of}} informative microsatellite loci had been described for P. infestans and none have been mapped. This thesis first describes the development and mapping of SSR markers in P. infestans and integration with other SSRs to generate a multiplex SSR set and its application in the population analysis of P. infestans from four countries are described with the developed multiplex SSRs. Finally, the use of this knowledge in resistance breeding of potato is shortly indicated and discussed. Chapter 1 describes the historic population changes of P. infestans at the global level and the current population trends. It summarizes microsatellite as favorite molecular markers for studying pathogen population diversity and assesses monitoring of population dynamics in more detail for resistance breeding in potato. The selection and identification of new SSR markers is presented in Chapter 2. From EST and genomic sequences from P. infestans we identified 300 non-redundant SSR loci by a bioinformatic screening pipeline. Based on the robustness, level of polymorphism and map position eight SSR markers were selected, which were assembled in two multiplex PCR sets and labeled with two different fluorescent dyes to allow scoring after single capillary electrophoresis. This successful multiplex SSR approach encouraged the development of fast, accurate and high-throughput genotyping, in an one-step multiplex PCR method to facilitate worldwide screening of P. infestans populations. Published SSRs and the 8 new SSRs were integrated. All these SSR markers were re-evaluated and the 12 most informative SSRs were selected to set up a standard set for global application (Chapter 3). The 12 -plex SSRs are distributed over different chromosomes, significantly increasing the resolution of genotyping compared to the previous set of 8 SSRs. The 12 -plex SSRs were integrated to one-step fluorescence-based multiplex reaction, which plays a key role to facilitate highly paralleled genotyping and efficient dissection of the more complex P. infestans populations. This multiplex PCR for P. infestans populations is (i) simple, as only one PCR is needed to perform multi-locus typing with twelve markers; (ii) rapid, as the genotyping results can be available in 1 day; and (iii) reproducible and adapted to different laboratories. The genotyping data from different geographic populations were submitted to the Euroblight database. With the same SSR set and the bin set, a comparable global database can easily be achieved. As indicated earlier, more recent analyses of P. infestans populations highlight the appearance of many new genotypes via migration and/or sexual recombination. To practice the newly developed 12 -plex SSR set and dissect the current population structure, several P. infestans populations from 4 different continents were selected for analysis. These include Chinese (Chapter 4), Dutch (Chapter 5), Ecuadorian (Chapter 6) and Tunisian (Chapter 7) populations. China has become the largest potato producing country not only for potato cultivation area but also in Megaton potato production. Interprovincial trade of consumption and seed potatoes is very important and frequent in China. Although both, the A 1 and A 2 mating types are found in China, to this date, no evidence of an active sexual cycle based on changes in allele frequency was found. With the ten SSRs, a large genotypic survey of in nation-wide collection of 228 P. infestans isolates was performed (Chapter 4). One of the three dominant clonal lineages CN- 04 (A 2) in this Chinese population was genetically similar to a major clonal lineage identified in Europe, called “Blue_ 13 ” with A 2 mating type. It was not possible to critically assess the origin of this clonal lineage. This study is the first report of “Blue_ 13 ” outside Europe. The virulence spectrum of selected Chinese P. infestans isolates showed seven different virulence spectra varying from 3 to 10 differentials. The CN 04 genotypes were identified as more aggressive and more virulent genotypes, one of whom had the full virulence pattern after using the potato differential set. Within the Chinese P. infestans population, the genotypes strongly clustered according to their six sampling provinces, which seems not to be influenced by the frequent interprovincial trading activities of seed potatoes. The mating type ratio and the SSR allele frequencies indicate that in China the contribution of the sexual cycle to P. infestans on population dynamics is minimal. It was concluded that the migration through asexual propagules and the generation of sub-clonal variation are the dominant driving factors behind the Chinese P. infestans population structure. The Netherlands has a long history of population studies on local P. infestans isolates and a substantial amount of commercial potato varieties growing in the field. One decade (2000 - 2009) of isolate sampling in 5 different regions provided the basis for a good understanding of the population dynamics in the Netherlands (Chapter 5). The surveyed population revealed the presence of several clonal lineages and a group of sexual progenies. The major clonal lineage with A 2 mating type is known as “Blue_ 13 ”, but also two distinct clonal lineages with A 1 mating type in this study have been identified. This survey witnesses that the Dutch population was undergoing dramatic changes in the ten years under study. The most notable change was the emergence and spread of A 2 mating type strain “Blue_ 13 ”. The results emphasize the importance of the sexual cycle in generating genetic diversity and the importance of the asexual cycle as the propagation- and dispersal mechanism for successful genotypes. In addition to the neutral SSR markers a molecular marker for the virulence of isolates on potato lines that contain the Rpi-blb 1 R-gene has been developed. Using this Avr-blb 1 marker and the corresponding virulence assay we report, for the first time, the presence of Rpi-blb 1 breaker isolates in the Netherlands even before a Rpi-blb 1 containing resistant variety was introduced. The 12 breaker isolates only occurred in sexual progeny. So far the asexual spread of such virulent isolates has been limited because of the absence of Rpi-blb 1 containing varieties in the field. Remarkably, on the other end of the world in the Andes, the region of potato origin, the situation is far less complex as far as P. infestans is concerned. There are more than 400 potato landraces in Ecuador and the planting habit by local farmers by traditional cultivation at small scale in the highlands is different from potato cultivation in other potato countries in North America or Europe (Chapter 6). Phytophthora isolates in Ecuador belong to two closely related species, P. infestans (on potato and tomato) and P. andina (on non-tuber bearing host), but SSR analysis of 66 isolates indicated that the two species are separated in two clearly distinguished genetic groups. Two ancient clonal lineages of P. infestans appeared to be dominant in Ecuador one is found only on tomato the other one only on potato. Within the potato isolates, but not in the tomato isolates, there is a large sub-clonal variation caused by (partial) polyploidization and loss of alleles. In Tunisia, potato is cultivated in three to four partly overlapping seasons while tomato is grown either in greenhouses or as aerial crop in most potato producing regions. Chapter 7 revealed, among 165 isolates of five regions, the presence of a major clonal lineage (NA- 01, A 1 mating type, Ia mtDNA haplotype) that seems to consist of races that are relatively simple. Another highly genetic diverse group of isolates was found containing more complex races and isolates with both mating types. Season clustering indicated that at least some of the new genotypes generated by sexual reproduction overlapped between seasons and such a sexual progeny may play an important role in the next season epidemics. On tomato, mostly asexual progeny was identified with two mtDNA haplotypes but less nuclear genotypes, compared to potato. This study shows that the P. infestans population is currently changing, and the old clonal lineage is being replaced by a more complex, genetically diverse and sexually propagating population in two sub-regions in Tunisia. Despite the massive import of potato seeds from Europe, the P. infestans population in Tunisia is still clearly distinct from the European population. Chapter 8 discusses the application of microsatellites in monitoring genetic diversity of late blight and the potential use in resistance breeding. Monitoring of the local P. infestans population for new virulent genotypes with the differential potato set in combination with screening for effector variation, allows early detection of adaptation of certain genotypes within the P. infestans population to particular resistance genes in a specific region. This provides the possibilities to determine which broad spectrum R-genes are still useful in order to adapt the control strategy by resistance breeding to the new situation. One way of doing that is to replace the existing varieties by other varieties with stacked non-broken R-genes obtained by marker assisted selection or to add additional R-genes to existing (R-gene containing) varieties by transformation. In a transgenic or cisgenic approach, additional broad spectrum R-genes could be added by <b>re-transformation.</b> As we have shown, the right R-gene management strategy in potato breeding, but also in potato production, should include the direct monitoring of local pathogen populations by using the differential set and the 12 -plex SSR set.  ...|$|E
