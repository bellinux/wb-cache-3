25|$|Gambler's fallacy/positive <b>recency</b> bias.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of interference, there are two factors at play when recalling a list of items: the <b>recency</b> and the primacy effects. The <b>recency</b> effect occurs when the {{short-term}} memory is used to remember the most recent items, and the primacy effect occurs when the long-term memory has encoded the earlier items. The <b>recency</b> effect can be eliminated {{if there is a}} period of interference between the input and the output of information extending longer than the holding time of short-term memory (15–30 seconds). This occurs when a person is given subsequent information to recall preceding the recall of the initial information. The primacy effect, however, is not affected by the interference of recall. The elimination of the last few items from memory is due to the displacement of these items from short term memory, by the distracting task. As they have not been recited and rehearsed, they are not moved into long-term memory and are thus lost. A task as simple as counting backwards can change memory recall; however an empty delay interval has no effect. This is because the person can continue to rehearse the items in their working memory to be remembered without interference. Cohen (1989) found that there is better recall for an action in the presence of interference if that action is physically performed during the encoding phase. It has also been found that recalling some items can interfere and inhibit the recall of other items. Another stream of thought and evidence suggests that the effects of interference on <b>recency</b> and primacy are relative, determined by the ratio rule (retention interval to inter item presentation distractor rate) and they exhibit time-scale invariance.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>recency</b> {{discrimination}} task {{participants are}} shown two trials of image presentation {{and then a}} third trial containing a mixture of images from {{the first and second}} trial. Their task is to determine whether the image was from the most recent presentation or the previous one.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that people younger than 40 years also show a reminiscence bump. It was initially hidden {{because of the}} possibility of the <b>recency</b> effect. When researchers examined the encoding values, it showed a progressive increase with participant age around the reminiscence bump for participants older than 50. This proves that the reminiscence bump is stronger for older adults than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|AMEs {{retain their}} <b>recency</b> by {{completing}} maintenance or related work. The Canadian Aviation Regulations require {{that once the}} holder's licence is {{more than two years}} old that they complete six months worth of work in the previous two years performing or supervising aircraft maintenance, act in an executive capacity in a maintenance organization, or teach or supervise teaching of aviation maintenance at an approved training organization.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{intensity}} of aphasia treatment {{is an area}} that requires more research. Current research suggests that intense treatment is effective, but {{people are more likely to}} drop-out of high intensity treatments. Most importantly, {{intensity of}} treatment should be determined on a case by case basis and should depend upon <b>recency</b> of stroke and the patient’s stamina, tolerance for therapy, motivation, overall health status, and treatment goals.|$|E
25|$|The blogdex {{project was}} {{launched}} by {{researchers in the}} MIT Media Lab to crawl the Web and gather data from thousands of blogs in order to investigate their social properties. Information was gathered by the tool for over four years, during which it autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community, ranking it by <b>recency</b> and popularity. It can, therefore, be considered the first instantiation of a memetracker. The project was replaced by tailrank.com {{which in turn has}} been replaced by spinn3r.com.|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as Mr. van Heerwarden's account of Orang Pendek, people have speculated that the animal {{may in fact be}} a hominin. In October 2004, {{scientists}} published claims of the discovery of skeletal remains of a new species of human (Homo floresiensis) in caves on Flores (another island in the Indonesian archipelago) dating from perhaps as recently as 12,000 years ago (later revised to 50,000 years ago). The species was described as being roughly one meter tall. The <b>recency</b> of Homo floresiensis continued existence and the similarities between its physical description and the accounts of Orang Pendek have led to renewed speculation in this respect.|$|E
25|$|Intensity of {{treatment}} should be individualized {{based on the}} <b>recency</b> of stroke, therapy goals, and other patient-specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation. Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity {{and is able to}} tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke. Some patients cannot tolerate therapy directly after a stroke due to confusion or exhaustion, but may tolerate therapy better later. Intensity {{of treatment}} after a stroke should be dependent on the patient’s motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy. Level of intensity also depends on therapy goals; for certain goals non-intensive therapy is more beneficial. For example, non-intensive therapy {{has been found to be}} more effective than intensive therapy when targeting naming accuracy in patients with anomia. This is because more time in between sessions allows for rehearsal and reinforces long term learning.|$|E
25|$|Research on priming and {{practice}} use single word tests to assess {{for the presence}} of TOT states. The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word. Evidence that comes from the usefulness of priming {{and practice}} in reducing TOT states is that most information in TOT states is low-frequency; that is, it has not been used or recalled for some time. The <b>recency</b> of information use can influence the retrieval process of that information. The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate TOT state resolution. Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall, {{they are more likely to}} overcome their TOT state. When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter, an interesting effect occurs: When the prime word has similar phonology to the target word, an increase in the frequency of TOT states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the TOT state is resolved is observed. Incorrect words come to mind involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word. Thus, phonological similarity can both decrease and increase TOT states. However, it is possible to fix this problem by changing the syntactic class of the priming word. Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in TOT state resolution. The TOT state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words. If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words, then the position is of importance. The earlier in the list the priming word is, the less likely it is to help resolve the TOT state.|$|E
2500|$|... 2. Primacy and <b>recency</b> effects: Primacy effects {{refer to}} better recall of items {{earlier in the}} sequence, while <b>recency</b> effects refer to better recall {{of the last few}} items. [...] <b>Recency</b> effects are seen more with {{auditory}} stimuli rather than verbal stimuli as auditory presentation seems to protect the end of lists from output interference.|$|E
2500|$|Free recall {{describes}} {{the process in}} which a person is given a list of items to remember and then is tested by being asked to recall them in any order. [...] Free recall often displays evidence of primacy and <b>recency</b> effects. Primacy effects are displayed when the person recalls items presented {{at the beginning of the}} list earlier and more often. The <b>recency</b> effect is when the person recalls items presented at the end of the list earlier and more often.|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{modality}} {{is important}} in determining {{the strength of the}} memory. [...] For instance, auditory creates stronger memory abilities than visual. [...] This is shown by the higher <b>recency</b> and primacy effects of an auditory recall test compared to that of a visual test. Research has shown that auditory training, through instrumental musical activity or practice, can help preserve memory abilities as one ages. [...] Specifically, in Hanna-Pladdy and McKay's experiment, they tested and found that the number of years of musical training, all things equal, leads to a better performance in non-verbal memory and increases the life span on cognition abilities in one's advanced years.|$|E
2500|$|Intensity {{of therapy}} is also {{dependent}} on the <b>recency</b> of stroke. Patients react differently to intense treatment in the acute phase (0–3 months post stroke), sub-acute phase (3–6 months post stroke), or chronic phase (6+ months post stroke). Intensive therapy {{has been found to}} be effective for patients with nonfluent and fluent chronic aphasia, but less effective for patients with acute aphasia. Patients with sub-acute aphasia also respond well to intensive therapy of 100 hours over 62 weeks. [...] This suggests patients in the sub-acute phase can improve greatly in language and functional communication measures with intensive therapy compared to regular therapy. Research suggests that intense treatment is most beneficial in the sub-acute or chronic phase, rather than directly post stroke. More research needs to be done to examine the optimal time for providing intense therapy to all aphasic patients.|$|E
2500|$|Atkinson and Shiffrin's 1968 model {{consists}} of separate components for {{short and long}} term memory storage. It states that short term memory is limited by its capacity and duration. Research suggests that musical short term memory is stored differently from verbal short term memory. Berz (1995) found dissimilar results for the correlation between modality and <b>recency</b> effects in language versus music, suggesting that different encoding processes are engaged. Berz also demonstrated different levels of interference on tasks as a result of language stimulus vs. musical stimulus. Finally Berz provided evidence for a separate store theory through the [...] "Unattended Music Effect", stating [...] "If there was a singular acoustic store, unattended instrumental music would cause the same disruptions on verbal performance as would unattended vocal music or unattended vocal speech; this, however, [...] not the case".|$|E
2500|$|The Encyclopædia Britannica {{has been}} {{compared}} with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A well-known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister, who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the Britannica with two comparable encyclopaedias, Collier's Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia Americana. For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random—circumcision, Charles Drew, Galileo, Philip Glass, heart disease, IQ, panda bear, sexual harassment, Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan—and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and <b>recency.</b> In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between B− and B+, chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the Britannica received one [...] "D" [...] and seven [...] "A"s, Encyclopedia Americana received eight [...] "A"s, and Collier's received one [...] "D" [...] and seven [...] "A"s; thus, Britannica received an average score of 92% for accuracy to Americanas 95% and Collier's 92%. In the timeliness category, Britannica averaged an 86% to Americanas 90% and Collier's 85%.|$|E
2500|$|An {{accumulation}} of literature across decades has lent strong {{support to the}} theory of phonological STS. In a 1971 study, Stephen Madigan demonstrated that a larger <b>recency</b> effect is seen during forward serial recall when people are presented a list auditorally as opposed to visually. (A smaller effect is seen in backwards serial recall.) In his study, auditory presentation led to greater recall of the most recently studied items. Catherine Penney expanded on this discovery to observe that modality effects can also be found in the case of free recall tasks. In 1965, Dallett had discovered that this observed modality effect is greatly reduced by the addition of a [...] "suffix" [...] item to the presented list; this suffix is a distractor item that is not to be recalled. Robert Greene utilized this observation in 1987 to discover that this suffix effect has a larger impact on lists learned auditorally as opposed to visually. The culmination of all of these findings results in strong support of the theory that there is a short-term store that phonologically stores recently learned items. In addition, Bloom and Watkins found that the suffix effect is greatly diminished when the suffix is not interpreted as linguistic sound, which agrees with the phonological short term store theory as it would be largely unaffected by non-linguistic distractors.|$|E
2500|$|Serial {{recall in}} {{long-term}} memory (LTM) differs from serial recall in short-term memory (STM). [...] To store a sequence in LTM, the sequence is repeated over time {{until it is}} represented in memory as a whole, {{rather than as a}} series of items. [...] In this way, {{there is no need to}} remember the relationships between the items and their original positions. [...] In STM, immediate serial recall (ISR) has been thought to result from one of two mechanisms. [...] The first refers to ISR as a result of associations between the items and their positions in a sequence, while the second refers to associations between items. [...] These associations between items are referred to as chaining, and is an unlikely mechanism, according to research. [...] Position-item relationships do not account for <b>recency</b> and primacy effects, or the phonological similarity effect. [...] The Primacy Model moves away from these two assumptions, suggesting that ISR results from a gradient of activation levels where each item has a particular level of activation that corresponds to its position. Research has supported the fact that immediate serial recall performance is much better when the list is homogenous (of the same semantic category) than when they are heterogeneous (of different semantic category). This suggests that semantic representations are beneficial to immediate serial recall performance. Short-term serial recall is also affected by similar-sounding items, as recall is lower (remembered more poorly) than items that do not sound alike. This is true when lists are tested independently (when comparing two separate lists of similar-sounding and not similar-sounding items) as well as when tested using a mixed list. Alan Baddeley first reported such an experiment in which items within a list were either mutually dissimilar or highly similar.|$|E
60|$|At this impatience she smiled. She {{urged the}} old story of decorum--that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the {{opportunity}} for bliss has forever gone by. I had most imprudently made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her acquaintance--thus that I did not possess it--thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other. And then she adverted, with a blush, to the extreme <b>recency</b> of this date. To wed immediately would be improper--would be indecorous--would be outre. All this {{she said with a}} charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me. She went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness--of imprudence. She bade me remember that I really even know not who she was--what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society. She begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an infatuation--a will o' the wisp--a fancy or fantasy of the moment--a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart. These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us--and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>recency</b> and (to a Shakespearian critic) the {{importance}} of these forgeries obscures the humble merit of Surtees, with his ballads of the 'Slaying of Antony Featherstonhaugh,' and of 'Bartram's Dirge.' Surtees left clever lacunae in these songs, 'collected from oral tradition,' and furnished notes so learned that they took in Sir Walter Scott. There are moments when I half suspect [...] "the Shirra himsel" [...] (who blamelessly forged so many extracts from 'Old Plays') of having composed 'Kinmont Willie.' To compare old Scott of Satchell's account of Kinmont Willie with the ballad is to feel uncomfortable doubts. But this is a rank impiety. The last ballad forgery of much note was the set of sham Macedonian epics and popular songs (all about Alexander the Great, and other heroes) which a schoolmaster in the Rhodope imposed on M. Verkovitch. The trick was not badly done, and the imitation of [...] "ballad slang" [...] was excellent. The 'Oera Linda' book, too, was successful enough to be translated into English. With this latest effort of the tenth muse, the crafty muse of Literary Forgery, we may leave a topic which could not be exhausted in a ponderous volume. We have not room even for the forged letters of Shelley, to which Mr. Browning, being taken in thereby, wrote a preface, nor for the forged letters of Mr. Ruskin, which occasionally hoax all the newspapers.|$|E
6000|$|This {{author is}} in most {{particulars}} the worst qualified for an historian that ever I met with. His style is rough, full of improprieties, in expressions often Scotch, and often such as {{are used by}} the meanest people.[1] He discovers a great scarcity of words and phrases, by repeating the same several hundred times, for want of capacity to vary them. His observations are mean and trite, and very often false. His secret history is generally made up of coffeehouse scandals, or at best from reports at the third, fourth, or fifth hand. The account of the Pretender's birth, would only become an old woman in a chimney-corner. His vanity runs intolerably through the whole book, affecting to have been of consequence at nineteen years old, {{and while he was}} a little Scotch parson of forty pounds a year. He was a gentleman born, and, in the time of his youth and vigour, drew in an old maiden daughter of a Scotch earl to marry him.[2] His characters are miserably wrought, in many things mistaken, and all of them detracting,[3] except of those who were friends to the Presbyterians. That early love of liberty he boasts of is absolutely false; for the first book that I believe he ever published is an entire treatise in favour of passive obedience and absolute power; so that his reflections on the clergy, for asserting, and then changing those principles, come very improperly from him. He is the most partial of all writers that ever pretended so much to impartiality; and yet I, who knew him well, am convinced that he is as impartial as he could possibly find in his heart; I am sure more than I ever expected from him; particularly in his accounts of the Papist and fanatic plots. This work may be more properly called [...] "A History of Scotland during the Author's Time, with some Digressions relating to England," [...] rather than deserve the title he gives it. For I believe two thirds of it relate only to that beggarly nation, and their insignificant brangles and factions. What he succeeds best in, is in giving extracts of arguments and debates in council or Parliament. Nothing recommends his book but the <b>recency</b> of the facts he mentions, most of them being still in memory, especially the story of the Revolution; which, however, is not so well told as might be expected from one who affects to have had so considerable a share in it. After all, {{he was a man of}} generosity and good nature, and very communicative; but, in his ten last years, was absolutely party-mad, and fancied he saw Popery under every bush. He hath told me many passages not mentioned in this history, and many that are, but with several circumstances suppressed or altered. He never gives a good character without one essential point, that the person was tender to Dissenters, and thought many things in the Church ought to be amended.|$|E
50|$|Potential {{explanations}} either then {{explain the}} <b>recency</b> effect as occurring through a single, same mechanism, or re-explain {{it through a}} different type of model that postulates two different mechanisms for immediate and long-term <b>recency</b> effects. One such explanation is provided by Davelaar et al. (2005), who argue that there are dissociations between immediate and long-term <b>recency</b> phenomena that cannot be explained by a single-component memory model, and who argues for the existence of a STS that explains immediate <b>recency,</b> and a second mechanism based on contextual drift that explains long-term <b>recency.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{major problem}} with this model, however, is that it cannot predict the {{long-term}} <b>recency</b> effect observed in delayed recall, when a distractor intervenes between each study item during the interstimulus interval (continuous distractor task). Since the distractor is still present after the last study item, it should displace the study item from STS such that the <b>recency</b> effect is attenuated. The existence of this long-term <b>recency</b> effect thus {{raises the possibility that}} immediate and long-term <b>recency</b> effects share a common mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. Primacy and <b>recency</b> effects: Primacy effects {{refer to}} better recall of items {{earlier in the}} sequence, while <b>recency</b> effects refer to better recall {{of the last few}} items. <b>Recency</b> effects are seen more with {{auditory}} stimuli rather than verbal stimuli as auditory presentation seems to protect the end of lists from output interference.|$|E
50|$|Overall, an {{important}} empirical observation regarding the <b>recency</b> effect {{is that it}} is not the absolute duration of retention intervals (RI, the time between end of study and test period) or of inter-presentation intervals (IPI, the time between different study items) that matters. Rather, the amount of <b>recency</b> is determined by the ratio of RI to IPI (the ratio rule). As a result, as long as this ratio is fixed, <b>recency</b> will be observed regardless of the absolute values of intervals, so that <b>recency</b> can be observed at all time scales, a phenomenon known as time scale invariance. This contradicts dual-store models, which assume that <b>recency</b> depends on the size of STS, and the rule governing the displacement of items in the STS.|$|E
50|$|The primacy {{effect is}} related to {{enhanced}} remembering. In a study, a free recall test was conducted on some lists of words and no test on other lists of words prior to a recognition test. They found that testing led to positive <b>recency</b> effects for remembered items; on the other hand, with no prior test, negative <b>recency</b> effects occurred for remembered items. Thus, both primary and <b>recency</b> effects {{can be seen in}} remember responses.|$|E
50|$|One theorised {{reason for}} the <b>recency</b> effect is that these items are still present in working memory when recall is solicited. Items that benefit from neither (the middle items) are {{recalled}} most poorly. An additional explanation for the <b>recency</b> effect is related to temporal context: if tested immediately after rehearsal, the current temporal context {{can serve as a}} retrieval cue, which would predict more recent items to have a higher likelihood of recall than items that were studied in a different temporal context (earlier in the list). The <b>recency</b> effect is reduced when an interfering task is given. Intervening tasks involve working memory, as the distractor activity, if exceeding 15 to 30 seconds in duration, can cancel out the <b>recency</b> effect. Additionally, if recall comes immediately after test, the <b>recency</b> effect is consistent regardless of the length of the studied list, or presentation rate.|$|E
50|$|RFM-I - <b>Recency,</b> Frequency, Monetary Value - Interactions is {{a version}} of RFM {{framework}} modified to account for <b>recency</b> and frequency of marketing interactions with the client (e.g. to control for possible deterring effects of very frequent advertising engagements).|$|E
50|$|Amnesiacs {{with poor}} ability to form {{permanent}} long-term memories {{do not show}} a primacy effect, but do show a <b>recency</b> effect if recall comes immediately after study. People with Alzheimer's Disease exhibit a reduced primacy effect but do not produce a <b>recency</b> effect in recall.|$|E
5000|$|The cache {{is divided}} into a Low Inter-reference <b>Recency</b> (LIR) and a High Inter-reference <b>Recency</b> (HIR) {{partition}}. The LIR partition is to store the most highly ranked pages (LIR pages) and the HIR partition is to store {{some of the other}} pages (HIR pages).|$|E
50|$|The suffix {{effect is}} an effect that removes the <b>recency</b> effect by adding in a {{meaningless}} item {{at the end}} of the original memory set. The belief is that this meaningless item will be remembered instead of the second-to-last item which was originally remembered due to the <b>recency</b> effect. However, the suffix effect varies based on the similarity of the item to the set. For visual stimuli, adding in the meaningless item, whether or not it is visually similar to the original memory set, will remove the <b>recency</b> effect. For auditory stimuli, adding in the meaningless item will only remove the <b>recency</b> effect if it is phonologically similar. Adding an item that is phonologically different (e.g. A, Q) will not have this effect.|$|E
50|$|The {{usefulness}} of the SAM model and in particular its model of the short-term store is often demonstrated by its application to the <b>recency</b> effect in free recall. When serial-position curves are applied to SAM, a strong <b>recency</b> effect is observed, but this effect is strongly diminished when a distractor, usually arithmetic, is placed in between study and test trials. The <b>recency</b> effect occurs because items {{at the end of}} the test list are likely to still be present in short-term store and therefore retrieved first. However, when new information is processed, this item enters the short-term store and displaces other information from it. When a distracting task is given after the presentation of all items, information from this task displaces the last items from short-term store, resulting in a substantial reduction of <b>recency.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two {{traditional}} {{classes of}} theories explain the <b>recency</b> effect.|$|E

50|$|<b>Recency</b> effects {{show how}} well {{subjects}} {{can remember the}} last items relative to how well they remember the other items. Glenberg's theory {{can be used to}} determine the magnitude of the <b>recency</b> effect, depending on how effective the retrieval cues are for the last item relative to the other items. Several types of experiments can be done to test the <b>recency</b> effect for free recall. One experiment that is commonly used is the distractor-recall paradigm, as done by Rundus (1980). Another study that exhibits the <b>recency</b> effect during free recall is when subjects learn several different lists followed by recall tests, and then a final unexpected recall test {{at the end of the}} experiment where they are required to recall as many items as possible from all of the lists. Results show that participants tend to recall items from the more recent lists.|$|E
50|$|Outside {{immediate}} free recall, {{these models}} can also predict {{the presence or}} absence of the <b>recency</b> effect in delayed free recall and continual-distractor free-recall conditions. Under delayed recall conditions, the state of test context would have drifted away with an increasing retention interval, leading to an attenuated <b>recency</b> effect. Under continual distractor recall conditions, while the increased interpresentation intervals reduces the similarities between the given study contexts and test context, the relative similarities amongst items remains unchanged. As long as the recall process is competitive, recent items will win out, so a <b>recency</b> effect is observed.|$|E
