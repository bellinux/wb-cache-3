50|$|The {{more recent}} {{inverter}} circuit {{was invented by}} Hitachi electronics in Japan. It has come into world wide use as the so-called three-times or third harmonic <b>resonance</b> <b>circuit,</b> shown in the figure as the “advanced technology“. The resonance frequency of the secondary side circuit is three {{times that of the}} primary side. A step-up transformer with a greater short-circuit inductance value is suitable for use in this case.|$|E
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{which is}} actually used in the so-called three-times <b>resonance</b> <b>circuit</b> has a flat shape. Although the magnetic path structure is closed, the leakage of the magnetic flux is considerably more {{than that of the}} conventional type. The transformer therefore has a larger short circuit inductance value. The design (refer to figure of the “past generation of technology“) is such that the short circuit inductance value of the step-up transformer is increased to some degree, whereby a <b>resonance</b> <b>circuit</b> is created by the short circuit inductance (Lsc in the figures) and a capacitance component obtained on the secondary side of the step-up transformer. The resonance frequency of the circuit is set to a frequency three times as high as the operating frequency of the inverter circuit in order to generate a third-order harmonic in the secondary side circuit. The lamp current waveform has a trapezoid shape. The ballast capacitor Crb also functions as a resonance capacitor. As a result the conversion efficiency of the inverter circuit is considerably improved, and the step-up transformer is further miniaturized.|$|E

40|$|Ultra-sensitive {{detectors}} and readout devices {{based on the}} radio frequency single electron transistor (rf-SET) combine near quantum-limited sensitivity with fast operation. Here we describe a twin rf-SET detector that uses two superconducting rf-SETs to perform fast, real-time cross-correlated measurements in order to distinguish sub-electron signals from charge noise on microsecond time-scales. The twin rf-SET makes use of two tuned <b>resonance</b> <b>circuits</b> to simultaneously and independently address both rf-SETs using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and a single cryogenic amplifier. We focus on {{the operation of the}} twin rf-SET as a charge detector and evaluate the cross-talk between the two <b>resonance</b> <b>circuits.</b> Real time suppression of charge noise is demonstrated by cross correlating the signals from the two rf-SETs. For the case of simultaneous operation, the rf-SETs had charge sensitivities of δ q_SET 1 = 7. 5 μ e/√(Hz) and δ q_SET 2 = 4. 4 μ e/√(Hz). Comment: Updated version, including new content.

50|$|DCF77 is {{controlled}} by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany's national physics laboratory and transmits in continuous operation (24 hours). It is operated by Media Broadcast GmbH (previously a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG), on behalf of the PTB. With Media Broadcast GmbH, a temporal transmission availability of at least 99.7% per year or under 26.28 hours of annual downtime has been agreed upon. Most service interruptions are short-term disconnections of under two minutes. Longer lasting transmission service interruptions are generally caused by strong winds, freezing rain or snow induced T-antenna movement. This manifests itself in electrical detuning of the antenna <b>resonance</b> <b>circuit</b> and hence a measurable phase modulation of the received signal. When the maladjustment is too large, the transmitter is taken temporarily out of service. In the year 2002 almost 99.95% availability or just over 4.38 hours of downtime was realized. The timestamp sent is either in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)+1 or UTC+2 depending on daylight saving time.|$|E
50|$|Resonant {{inductive}} coupling or magnetic phase synchronous coupling is the phenomenon that the coupling is enhanced when the secondary {{side of the}} loosely coupled coil resonates. The most basic resonant {{inductive coupling}} consists of one drive coil on the primary side and one <b>resonance</b> <b>circuit</b> on the secondary side. In this case, when the resonant state on the secondary side is observed from the primary side, two resonances as a pair are observed. One of them is called the antiresonant frequency (parallel resonant frequency 1), {{and the other is}} called the resonant frequency (serial resonant frequency 1'). The short-circuit inductance and resonant capacitor of the secondary coil are combined into a resonant circuit. When the primary coil is driven with a resonant frequency (serial resonant frequency) of the secondary side, the phases of the magnetic fields of the primary coil and the secondary coil are synchronized. As a result, the maximum voltage is generated on the secondary coil due to the increase of the mutual flux, and the copper loss of the primary coil is reduced, the heat generation is reduced, and the efficiency is relatively improved. The resonant inductive coupling is the near field wireless transmission of electrical energy between magnetically coupled coils, which is part of a resonant circuit tuned to resonate at the same frequency as the driving frequency. This process occurs in a resonant transformer, an electrical component which consists of high Q coil wound on the same core with capacitors connected across the coils to make coupled LC circuit. Resonant transformers are widely used in radio circuits as bandpass filters, and in switching power supplies. Resonant inductive coupling is also being used in wireless power systems. Here the LC circuit is in different devices; a transmitter coil in one device transmits electric power across an intervening space to a resonant receiver coil in another device. This technology is being developed for powering and charging portable devices such as cellphones and tablet computers at a distance, without being tethered to an outlet. The WiTricity type magnetic resonance is that the primary side resonant is added to the basic resonant inductive coupling system in order to increase the power transmission intensity of the resonance. Thus, the WiTricity type magnetic resonance is characterized in that the resonant coils on the primary side and the resonant coils on the secondary side are paired.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of why an individual acts {{the way he does}} has been debated for years within political theory and is also a cornerstone to international relations theory.

40|$|The {{properties}} {{and the structure}} of biodegradable polymers alter during degradation. The conventional way to study material {{properties and}} degradation requires direct contact with the material. For example monitoring the degradation of biodegradable implants inside a human body is challenging. Changes in the biodegradable polymers can be wirelessly monitored using <b>resonance</b> <b>circuits.</b> However, the circuits have to be protected from the surrounding environment {{in order for them to}} work properly. A protective layer around the circuit prevents water penetration to the circuits and enables observing the material changes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of three biodegradable polymers for encapsulating <b>resonance</b> <b>circuits.</b> The circuits were encapsulated by poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA 80 / 20), poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA 85 / 15), and poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA 10 / 90) using compression molding. The resonance behaviors of the encapsulated circuits were wirelessly measured in order to evaluate the success and the duration of the encapsulation. In addition, a degradation test series was carried out to compare the resonance behavior and the degradation. The comparison was done in order to find out if changes in material properties could be obtained by measuring wirelessly the resonance behavior of the encapsulated circuits. The study revealed that the encapsulation using compression molding was possible with PLGA 80 / 20 and PDLGA 85 / 15 materials. The PLGA 80 / 20 capsules worked even for 14 weeks and the PDLGA 85 / 15 capsules for 7 weeks. The PLGA 10 / 90 capsules lasted only few days and failed due to rapid degradation of the capsules. The degradation test showed that the properties and the appearance of the PLGA 80 / 20 hardly changed. The properties of the PDLGA 85 / 15 decreased continuously during the degradation test and were weaker than the properties of the PLGA 80 / 20. The structure of the PDLGA 85 / 15 samples changed significantly due to autocatalysis. The study also revealed that the properties of the PLGA 10 / 90 samples were the weakest and the samples were totally fragmented after six weeks. The visual characterization of the encapsulated circuits and the degradation test samples suggested that water absorption could have caused the characteristic resonance behavior of each material. However, the results from the degradation test series do not explain the resonance behavior even though some similarities could be obtained. Consequently further studies are needed to solve the reason for the resonance behavior...|$|R
