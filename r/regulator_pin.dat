40|$|SummaryThe mitotic <b>regulator</b> <b>Pin</b> 1 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in protein quality control and age-related medical conditions such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Although its cellular role has been thoroughly investigated during the past decade, the molecular mechanisms underlying its function remain elusive. We provide evidence for interactions between the two domains of Pin 1. Several residues displayed unequivocal peak splits in nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, indicative of two different conformational states in equilibrium. Pareto analysis of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data demonstrates that the two domains approach each other upon addition of a nonpeptidic ligand. Titration experiments with phosphorylated peptides monitored by fluorescence anisotropy and chemical shift perturbation indicate that domain interactions increase Pin 1 ’s affinity toward peptide ligands. We propose this interplay of the domains and ligands to be a general mechanism for a large class of two-domain proteins...|$|E
40|$|Polarized tip {{growth is}} a {{fundamental}} cellular process in many eukaryotic organisms, mediating growth of neuronal axons and dendrites or fungal hyphae. In plants, pollen and root hairs are cellular model systems for analysing tip growth. Cell growth depends on membrane traffic. The regulation of this membrane traffic is largely unknown for tip-growing cells, in contrast to cells exhibiting intercalary growth. Here we show that in Arabidopsis, GBF 1 -related exchange factors for the ARF GTPases (ARF GEFs) GNOM and GNL 2 play essential roles in polar tip growth of root hairs and pollen, respectively. When expressed from the same promoter, GNL 2 (in contrast to the early-secretory ARF GEF GNL 1) is able to replace GNOM in polar recycling of the auxin efflux <b>regulator</b> <b>PIN</b> 1 from endosomes to the basal plasma membrane in non-tip growing cells. Thus, polar recycling facilitates polar tip growth, and GNL 2 seems to have evolved to meet the specific requirement of fast-growing pollen in higher plants...|$|E
40|$|The F-box {{proteins}} are {{the substrate}} recognition subunits of the SCF (Skp 1 -Cul 1 -Rbx 1 -F- box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes {{that control the}} stability of numerous regulators in eukaryotic cells. Here we show that dimerization of the F-box protein Fbx 4 is essential for SCFFbx 4 (the superscript denotes the F-box protein) ubiquitination activity toward the telomere <b>regulator</b> <b>Pin</b> 2 (also known as TRF 1). The crystal structure of Fbx 4 in complex with an adaptor protein Skp 1 reveals an antiparallel dimer configuration in which the linker domain of Fbx 4 interacts with the C-terminal substrate-binding domain of the other protomer, whereas the C-terminal domain of the protein adopts a compact α/β fold distinct from those of known F-box proteins. Biochemical studies indicate that both the N-terminal domain and a loop connecting the linker and C-terminal domain of Fbx 4 are critical for the dimerization and activation of the protein. Our findings {{provide a framework for}} understanding the role of F-box dimerization in the SCF-mediated ubiquitination reaction...|$|E

Results demonstrated that the in vitro response of shoots type (B) was superior to shoots type (A) for all the evaluated variables, even when last shoot type was used with 35 days of sprouting. Shoots type (B) presented a 90 % of survival, the smallest percentage of damaged shoots (13. 3 %) and 96. 3 % of developed shoots. Effect of different concentrations of 6 -BAP (0. 0; 2. 22; 4. 44; 6. 66 and 8. 88 μM) with shoots type (B) in the in vitro establishment phase was evaluated. Results showed that using 6. 66 μM 6 -BAP the biggest longitudes in shoots (2. 58 cm) and the best percentage of them with augmented axillary buds (70 %) were achieved.

40|$|The {{constitution}} and ring size of peptide-derived macrocycles directly influence target binding affinity and physicochemical properties. Here, we describe means to recapitulate key features of peptide-protein interaction linear motifs (LM) in diverse, macrocyclic small molecules. Large ring-forming reactions of exceptional substrate scope are achieved using latently reactive templates that engage peptide side chain functional groups. The template is activated to transiently generate either a cinnamyl carbocation or a palladium(π-cinnamyl) complex, which rapidly form carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bonds. Cyclizations occur {{at room temperature}} and are typically insensitive to peptide composition or ring size. Multiply reactive templates couple macrocyclization with additional annulation reactions to further restrict conformation, to mask polar groups, and to access complex polycyclic structures of reduced peptidic character {{in two or three}} synthetic steps. Divergent Friedel-Crafts macrocyclization reactions are of special utility for exploring multiple ring connectivities within a given peptide sequence. This method has been coupled to standard solid-phase peptide synthesis to prepare a pilot library of 1000 - 1700 template-bridged macrocycles, which derive from 384 sequences that mimic the aryl-rich consensus substrate LM of the mitotic <b>regulator</b> <b>Pin</b> 1. A new fluorescence polarization assay has been developed to support mixture-based screening of this library in 96 -well format. Hit validation, mixture deconvolution, and structure elucidation has led to the identification of two series of non-phosphorylated, macrocyclic ligands which bind the Pin 1 prolyl isomerase domain (Kd = 24 or 35 nM) with similar avidity to existing phosphorylated inhibitors. We show that binding affinity is directly influenced by core ring size and connectivity, in one example leading to a greater than seven-fold difference in affinity between isomeric macrocycles of identical ring size. These findings suggest that template-based methods should be useful for surveying the pharmacological properties of composite peptide macrocycles and for identifying new bioactive chemotypes by targeting protein surfaces via cognate consensus binding motifs...|$|E

For this reason, the present research aimed to achieve in vitro multiplication of Pinus caribaea var. caribaea from apical shoots obtained from donor plants. It was determined that in the multiplication phase, the 6 -BAP influenced the development of in vitro plants and the highest number (6. 75) and length of shoots by plants (2. 70 cm) and a multiplication rate of 2. 38 were obtained with 6. 66 μM. When comparing the effect of sun light y artificial light in the development in vitro plants it was observed that with sun light the plants showed a better in vitro response and improved multiplication rate. It was shown that the gelling agent and concentration were factors that influenced in the in vitro development of plants in the multiplication phase. With Gelrite as gelling agent were obtained better results that with Agar. With 4. 0 g l- 1 Gelrite the multiplication rate reached its highest value (2. 87).

40|$|SummaryThe {{pattern of}} plant organ {{initiation}} at the shoot apical meristem (SAM), termed phyllotaxis, displays regularities {{that have long}} intrigued botanists and mathematicians alike. In the SAM, the central zone (CZ) contains a population of stem cells that replenish the surrounding peripheral zone (PZ), where organs are generated in regular patterns. These patterns differ between species and may change in response to developmental or environmental cues [1]. Expression analysis of auxin efflux facilitators of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family combined with modeling of auxin transport has indicated that organ initiation is associated with intracellular polarization of PIN proteins and auxin accumulation [2 – 10]. However, <b>regulators</b> that modulate <b>PIN</b> activity to determine phyllotactic patterns have hitherto been unknown.

40|$|In plants, cell {{polarity}} {{and tissue}} patterning are connected by intercellular {{flow of the}} phytohormone auxin, whose directional signaling depends on polar subcellular localization of PIN auxin transport proteins. The mechanism of polar targeting of PINs or other cargos in plants is largely unidentified, with the PINOID kinase being the only known molecular component. Here, we identify PP 2 A phosphatase as an important <b>regulator</b> of <b>PIN</b> apical-basal targeting and auxin distribution. Genetic analysis, localization, and phosphorylation studies demonstrate that PP 2 A and PINOID both partially colocalize with PINs and act antagonistically on the phosphorylation state of their central hydrophilic loop, hence mediating PIN apicalbasal polar targeting. Thus, in plants, polar sorting by the reversible phosphorylation of cargos allows for their conditional delivery to specific intracellular destinations.

40|$|Signaling systems {{regulate}} {{the flow of}} cellular information by organizing proteins {{in space and time}} to coordinate a variety of cellular activities that are critical for the proper development, function, and maintenance of cells. Signaling molecules can exhibit several levels of complexity through the utilization of modular protein interactions, which can generate simple linear behaviors or complex behaviors such as ultrasensitivity. Protein modularity also serves {{as the basis for the}} vast protein networks that form the regulatory networks that govern several biological activities. My work focuses on the importance of protein modularity in complex biological systems, in particular the regulatory pathways of spindle positioning. 	The first part of my work involves the construction of a synthetic regulatory network using modular protein interactions in an effort to understand the complex behavior of the natural spindle orientation <b>regulator</b> <b>Pins.</b> Utilizing well-characterized protein domains and their binding partners, I built an autoinhibited protein switch that can be activated by a small protein domain. We found that the input-output relationship of the synthetic protein switch could be tuned by the simple addition of "decoy" domains, domains that bind and sequester input signal, thereby impeding the onset of the output response to generate an input threshold. By varying the number and affinities of the decoy domains, we found that we could transform a simple linear response into a complex, ultrasensitive one. Thus, modular protein interactions can serve as a source of complex behaviors. 	The second part of my work focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle positioning in the Drosophila neuroblast. I found that Pins orients the mitotic spindle by coordinating two opposite-polarity microtubule motors Dynein and Kinesin- 73 through its multiple domains. Kinesin- 73 also relies on its modular domain architecture to perform its duties in Pins-mediated spindle positioning, where its N-terminal half functions in coordinating cortical-microtubule capture while its C-terminal half functions as a region necessary for the activation of Dynein. Thus, modular protein design allows for the organization of spindle orientation regulators in space to achieve the complex biological activity that is spindle positioning.

40|$|The {{intended}} {{use of a}} magnetic material, from information storage to power conversion, depends crucially on its domain structure, traditionally crafted during materials synthesis. By contrast, we show that an external magnetic field applied transverse to the preferred magnetization of a model disordered uniaxial ferromagnet is an isothermal <b>regulator</b> of domain <b>pinning.</b> At elevated temperatures, near the transition into the paramagnet, modest transverse fields increase the pinning, stabilize the domain structure, and harden the magnet, until {{a point where the}} field induces quantum tunneling of the domain walls and softens the magnet. At low temperatures, tunneling completely dominates the domain dynamics and provides an interpretation of the quantum phase transition in highly disordered magnets as a localization/delocalization transition for domain walls.

40|$|Initiation {{of leaves}} at the flanks of the shoot apical {{meristem}} occurs at sites of auxin accumulation and pronounced expression of auxin-inducible PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN) genes, suggesting a feedback loop to progressively focus auxin in concrete spots. Because PIN expression is regulated by auxin response factor activity, including MONOPTEROS (MP), it appeared possible that MP affects leaf formation {{as a positive}} <b>regulator</b> of <b>PIN</b> genes and auxin transport. Here, we analyze a novel, completely leafless phenotype arising from simultaneous interference with both auxin signaling and auxin transport. We show that mp pin 1 double mutants, as well as mp mutants treated with auxin-efflux inhibitors, display synergistic abnormalities not seen in wild type regardless of how strongly auxin transport was reduced. The synergism of abnormalities indicates {{that the role of}} MP in shoot meristem organization is not limited to auxin transport regulation. In the mp mutant background, auxin transport inhibition completely abolishes leaf formation. Instead of forming leaves, the abnormal shoot meristems dramatically increase in size, harboring correspondingly enlarged expression domains of CLAVATA 3 and SHOOTMERISTEMLESS, molecular markers for the central stem cell zone and the complete meristem, respectively. The observed synergism under conditions of auxin efflux inhibition was further supported by an unrestricted PIN 1 expression in mp meristems, as compared to a partial restriction in wild-type meristems. Auxin transport-inhibited mp meristems also lacked detectable auxin maxima. We conclude that MP promotes the focusing of auxin and leaf initiation in part through pathways not affected by auxin efflux inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Stem cells divide asymmetrically to {{give rise}} to one {{daughter}} cell that inherits the self-renewal potential and another daughter cell that is committed to differentiate. Hence, an impairment of the asymmetric cell division (ACD) process could render daughter cells with altered cell fates, unable to respond to cell growth control mechanisms. Indeed, {{over the past years}} an intriguing connection between ACD, stem cells and cancer biology has emerged. We previously showed that the PDZ protein Canoe (Cno) regulates ACD in embryonic neuroblasts (NBs), the neural stem cells of Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). In this work, we wanted to investigate whether the loss of cno in asymmetrically dividing NBs could lead to tumor-like overproliferation. We show that Cno is expressed in NBs and Intermediate Progenitors (IPs) of Drosophila larval brain type II NB (NBII) lineages. In cno mutant clones the ACD <b>regulators</b> aPKC, <b>Pins</b> and Dlg fail to form crescents and they accumulate all around the cortex or are mislocalized. Other defects such as size-reduced NB and abnormal morphology of the cno mutant clone are observed. Despite these failures, cno mutant clones do not show overgrowth. In fact, fewer IPs and Ganglion Mother Cells (GMCs) are detected. In addition, we have found that type II NB mutant clones of scribble (scrib), a well-known tumor suppressor gene, do not overgrow either. Moreover, most scrib mutant clones die. Intriguingly, the simultaneous loss of function of cno and scrib synergistically interacts displaying an overproliferation of progenitor cells that show disrupted cell polarity and {{give rise to}} a tumor-like overgrowth. Removing Ras signaling in the cno, scrib double mutant background rescues the overgrowth phenotype. In addition, the ectopic activation of Ras in cno, scrib double mutant clones does not seem to signal through the Raf-MAPK cascade in Drosophila brain NBs. Our data reveal a novel synergistic interaction between cno and scrib loss of function in NBII lineages that lead to tumor formation by, at least in part, an up-regulation of Ras signaling...|$|R
40|$|All {{eukaryotic}} cells {{present at}} the cell surface {{a specific set of}} plasma membrane proteins that modulate responses to internal and external cues and whose activity is also regulated by protein degradation. We characterized the lytic vacuole-dependent degradation of membrane proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana by means of in vivo visualization of vacuolar targeting combined with quantitative protein analysis. We show that the vacuolar targeting pathway is used by multiple cargos including PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers for the phytohormone auxin. In vivo visualization of PIN 2 vacuolar targeting revealed its differential degradation in response to environmental signals, such as gravity. In contrast to polar PIN delivery to the basal plasma membrane, which depends on the vesicle trafficking <b>regulator</b> ARF-GEF GNOM, <b>PIN</b> sorting to the lytic vacuolar pathway requires additional brefeldin A-sensitive ARF-GEF activity. Furthermore, we identified putative retromer components SORTING NEXIN 1 (SNX 1) and VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 29 (VPS 29) as important factors in this pathway and propose that the retromer complex acts to retrieve PIN proteins from a late/pre-vacuolar compartment back to the recycling pathways. Our data suggest that ARF GEF- and retromer-dependent processes regulate PIN sorting to the vacuole in an antagonistic manner and illustrate instrumentalization of this mechanism for fine-tuning the auxin fluxes during gravitropic response...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fascinating}} aspects of plant morphology is the regular geometric arrangement of leaves and flowers, called phyllotaxy. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) determines these patterns, which vary depending on species and developmental stage. Auxin acts as an instructive signal in leaf initiation, and its transport has been implicated in phyllotaxy regulation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Altered phyllotactic patterns are observed in a maize (Zea mays) mutant, aberrant phyllotaxy 1 (abph 1, also known as abphyl 1), and ABPH 1 encodes a cytokinin-inducible type A response regulator, suggesting that cytokinin signals are also involved in the mechanism by which phyllotactic patterns are established. Therefore, we investigated the interaction between auxin and cytokinin signaling in phyllotaxy. Treatment of maize shoots with a polar auxin transport inhibitor, 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid, strongly reduced ABPH 1 expression, suggesting that auxin or its polar transport is required for ABPH 1 expression. Immunolocalization of the PINFORMED 1 (PIN 1) polar auxin transporter revealed that PIN 1 expression marks leaf primordia in maize, similarly to Arabidopsis. Interestingly, maize PIN 1 expression at the incipient leaf primordium was greatly reduced in abph 1 mutants. Consistently, auxin levels were reduced in abph 1, and the maize PIN 1 homolog was induced not only by auxin but also by cytokinin treatments. Our results indicate distinct roles for ABPH 1 as a negative regulator of SAM size and a positive <b>regulator</b> of <b>PIN</b> 1 expression. These studies highlight a complex interaction between auxin and cytokinin signaling in the specification of phyllotactic patterns and suggest an alternative model for the generation of altered phyllotactic patterns in abph 1 mutants. We propose that reduced auxin levels and PIN 1 expression in abph 1 mutant SAMs delay leaf initiation, contributing to the enlarged SAM and altered phyllotaxy of these mutants.

40|$|Auxin is {{the plant}} hormone that {{coordinates}} plant development and more, by a directional {{flow through the}} plant tissues, it mediates the polarity of tissues and organs. The directional auxin flow (polar auxin transport) is achieved by the subcellular localization of auxin influx and efflux carriers. The PINFORMED (PIN) proteins have been identified and characterized as key regulators of a multitude of auxin-mediated developmental processes. Five of them are plasma membrane proteins that act as auxin efflux carriers and have mainly a polar localization that correlates with, and {{is required for the}} direction of auxin flow. The polar targeting of PIN proteins has a clear developmental output, because the polarity of PIN localization at the single cell level determines the direction of intercellular auxin transport and the directional signalling to neighbouring cells. Hence, the importance of PIN proteins for plant development and the necessity of studying the PINs on different aspects in order to better understand their functionality. Research performed over the past years has shown that PIN activity is controlled at different levels, such as transcription, constitutive cycling, phosphorylation and degradation. However, little is still known about the regulatory mechanisms, therefore, the purpose of this PhD study was to contribute to the elucidation of two features of PIN proteins: polarity and trafficking. Questions such as, how PIN polarity is established and maintained and how is PIN trafficking regulated, have been addressed and we tried to answer them by using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches. In the review entitled “PIN polar targeting” (Chapter 1) we discuss about the PIN proteins as polarity markers that play essential role in auxin-dependent regulation of plant growth and development and make an update on the role of phosphorylation, sterol composition of plasma membrane, secretion, recycling and transcytosis in the regulation of PIN polar targeting. Two prominent mechanisms were shown so far to be crucial for PIN polar targeting: ARF GEF GNOM-dependent constitutive recycling and PINOID/PP 2 A-dependent phosphorylation /dephosphorylation. Thus, to identify novel molecular components of PIN targeting, and especially of the mechanisms that regulate the establishment and maintenance of PIN polarity we performed a forward genetic screen for the identification of <b>PIN</b> polarity <b>regulators</b> in Arabidopsis. We used PIN 2 ::PIN 1 -HA in the pin 2 mutant background, a transgenic line that has PIN 1 mis-localized predominantly at the basal side of the epidermal cells {{and as a result of}} the defective PIN 1 localization 95 it shows agravitropic growth. We screened for mutants that restored the gravitropic growth to PIN 2 ::PIN 1 -HA;pin 2, considering that the rescue will be possible only if PIN 1 will (re) localize in PIN 2 -like manner and functionally replace PIN 2 in its basipetal auxin transport activity. In the research article entitled “PIN polarity maintenance by the cell wall in Arabidopsis” (Chapter 2) we show the identification of a cell wall component (CESA 3) as a <b>regulator</b> of <b>PIN</b> polarity and present insights into the cell wall-dependent maintenance of PIN polarity in plant cells. Since plant cells lack tight junctions that define polar domains in animal cells, and the mechanism that keeps the PINs at the correct plasma membrane domains is largely unknown, the role of cell wall in polarity maintenance opens new directions of research regarding the polarity of PIN proteins. In another complementary project, we aimed to investigate the subcellular trafficking of PIN 1 protein and to identify novel regulators at different endosomal compartments along the endocytic pathway. By performing a PIN 1 -GFP fluorescence imaging-based forward genetic screen we looked for abnormal intracellular accumulation of PIN 1 -GFP in the root cells and identified pat (protein affected trafficking) mutants. The research article entitled “The AP- 3 β adaptin mediates the biogenesis and function of lytic vacuoles in Arabidopsis” (Chapter 3) presents the identification and characterization of pat 2, a mutant defective in the putative β subunit of the AP- 3 complex. pat 2 shows abnormal protein accumulation in mis-shaped lytic vacuoles, aberrant vacuolation of prevacuolar complexes (PVCs), abnormal morphology of protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) and impaired transition from storage to lytic vacuoles. It also shows arrested growth on medium lacking sucrose, indicating defects in trafficking from PVC to lytic and/or storage vacuoles. Hence, we identified PAT 2 /AP- 3 β as a novel regulator of lytic vacuole biogenesis and function in Arabidopsis. PIN 1 constitutive cycling between plasma membrane and endosomes is crucial for polar auxin transport. PIN 1 is internalized from the plasma membrane by clathrin-dependent endocytosis and recycled back to the plasma membrane by the fungal brefeldin A (BFA) -sensitive ARF GEF GNOMdependent exocytosis. In order to identify new components of PIN 1 constitutive cycling machinery we performed a PIN 1 -GFP fluorescence imaging-based forward genetic screen and looked for mutants that showed abnormal BFA-induced PIN 1 -GFP intracellular accumulation after long treatment. In the manuscript entitled “Genetic dissection of PIN constitutive cycling in Arabidopsis identifies BEX 1 /RabA 1 b regulator of protein recycling” (Chapter 4) we show the identification and partial characterization of bex 1 (BFA-visualized exocytic trafficking defective 1) mutant. bex 1 - 1 shows intracellular ectopic accumulation of constitutively endocytosed plasma membrane proteins into abnormal BFA compartments, indicating defective exocytosis and transcytosis. BEX 1 encodes for the 96 small GTP binding protein, RabA 1 b that localizes at domains of TGN and seems to play role in trafficking of proteins to the plasma membrane. All together, this PhD research brings novel insights into the mechanisms of PIN polarity maintenance and vesicle trafficking. We identified and characterized several mutants that will definitely contribute to the elucidation of PIN polarity and trafficking pathways in Arabidopsis. Although we wished for the identification of specific <b>regulators</b> of <b>PIN</b> trafficking and this was not the case, we found so far unknown regulators of vacuole biogenesis and function, and protein recycling. Furthermore, finding the cell wall as an essential component required for the maintenance of the PIN polarity opens indeed novel directions in studying cell polarity in plants...|$|R
