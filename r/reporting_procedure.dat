25|$|In {{response}} to state frustration over the workload in preparing these reports, the HRC in July 2010 proposed a new optional <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure</b> called the ‘List of Issues Prior to Reporting’ (LOIPR). The LOIPR system implements a new procedure whereby the committee sends the state {{a list of}} issues to address and the resulting report satisfies the requirements of Article 40 of the ICCPR. This system remains in the pilot stage until 2015 where the procedure will be reviewed “in terms of its practicality, effectiveness and capacity to improve {{the examination of the}} human rights situation in the State parties”. It is intended LOIPR will allow for time to be used more efficiently and provide focus to the report. A further advantage of the procedure will be that a state will not have to submit both a periodic report and LOIPR report (though initial reports will be required). LOIPR remains an optional report and states may elect to continue with the periodic reports system or may be required by the committee to prepare a full report.|$|E

The Regional Carbon Initiative launched on June 16th, 2009 with the announcement of its first three Pledging Partners, Veriform Inc., Athena Software and Enermodal Engineering, who have voluntarily committed to a carbon reduction target under Sustainable Waterloo's framework.

50|$|There {{are some}} risks {{involved}} in bringing self-disclosure {{into the classroom}} when students begin sharing information with the teacher. As the student is more open with the teacher, there is the chance that the student could share information {{that would require the}} teacher to follow a <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure.</b> If a student reveals information about themselves in confidence to the teacher that implies that the students life is potentially at risk, or other matters of equal seriousness that would need to be reported to the school guidance counselor. Revealing this information although confidentiality was implied would inevitably break the trust the teacher has built with the student, ultimately harming their relationship. This hurt relationship could negatively impact that students ability to learn in the classroom. In another scenario, students may not fully understand the differences between public and private discourse. This would lead students to have conversations of self-disclosure in the classroom when the timing is not appropriate, therefore, taking away from the educational matters at hand.|$|E

50|$|COPERT is an MS Windows {{software}} program aiming at {{the calculation of}} air pollutant emissions from road transport. The technical development of COPERT is financed by the European Environment Agency (EEA), {{in the framework of}} the activities of the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. Since 2007, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre has been coordinating the further scientific development of the model. In principle, COPERT has been developed for use from the National Experts to estimate emissions from road transport to be included in official annual national inventories. The COPERT methodology is also part of the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. The Guidebook, developed by the UNECE Task Force on Emissions Inventories and Projections, is intended to support reporting under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU directive on national emission limits. The COPERT methodology is fully consistent with the Road Transport chapter of the Guidebook. The use of a software tool to calculate road transport emissions allows for a transparent and standardized, hence consistent and comparable data collecting and emissions <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure,</b> in accordance with the requirements of international conventions and protocols and EU legislation.|$|E

40|$|In May 2000, a {{firework}} factory {{exploded in}} a residential area in the Netherlands, resulting in 22 death, 947 wounded people, 500 destroyed houses, and 1. 500 severely damaged houses. Following the explosion, a large-scale monitoring study was implemented to investigate disaster-related health consequences of both {{the residents of the}} neigbourhood and the rescue workers involved {{in the aftermath of the}} explosion. The purpose of this monitoring study is to longitudinally monitor the health impact of this explosion. Methods: Data is gathered at general practitioners' (GPs) practice through a standardised <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure,</b> in which the GPs register each contact with their clients in a computerised format. The monitoring provides information about the number of medical consultations and the type of health complaints patients present to their GPs. In addition, information is available on demographic characteristics (such as gender, age, ethnicity), and on the degree of exposure to the explosion. Health complaints are coded by the GPs according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). Since the <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure</b> was already operational one year prior to the disaster, baseline information is available as well. In addition, since 1996 a large number of GPs in other cities in the Netherlands use the same standardised <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure.</b> There fore, information on the health status of a control group, not exposed to the disaster, is available. Results and Conclusions: The monitoring is still in process. Final results are expected by December 2002. So far, data of 6. 754 persons directly exposed to the explosion is available. At the conference, the authors will present a ranking of the most prevalent health complaints in both the exposed and the control group, during the pre- and postdisaster period. In addition, risk factors for the development of health problems will be presented. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|The copy {{of record}} is {{available}} at IET Digital Library: [URL] Copyright IET [Full text {{of this paper is}} not available in the UHRA]The Gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON) has become an attractive and promising solution for the broadband access network. In this paper a novel dynamic bandwidth assignment protocol is proposed to both facilitate the efficient sharing of the upstream channel resource and support differentiated services over GPON. A new concept for the optical network unit bandwidth <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure</b> is developed instead of the conventional reporting of current queue status. The development of a balance transferring enables a bandwidth register and transfer mechanism in which the reported but bandwidth-unassigned requirements from previous allocations can be tracked and manipulated at the optical line termination. Dynamic bandwidth compensation is achieved through the balance transferring mechanism. The combination of the new <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure</b> and the balance transferring mechanism is incorporated into a prioritised resource allocation to accommodate differentiated services. It also efficiently supports the operation of the GPON encapsulation method. Fairness is supported by a proportional allocation scheme among various demands from different customers. The proposed MAC protocol is implemented using the OPNET Modeler platform. Simulated performance characteristics are presented and the GPON dynamic protocol is analysed under varying self-similar traffic loads...|$|E

A comparison with other previously <b>reported</b> <b>procedures</b> is also made by using both benchmark functions and a set of randomly generated functions, thus ensuring that results with statistical relevance are obtained. ...|$|R

This study follows on from those carried out in 1990 / 1991 and 1995 / 1996, which investigated euthanasia and other medical end-of-life decisions (assisted suicide, termination of life without the patient's explicit request, treatment of pain and symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect, and forgoing potentially life-prolonging treatment). The study consists of an analysis of cases of death (in which the numbers and nature of various medical end-of-life decisions will be established), physician interviews (to gain insight into the context in which medical end-of-life decisions are made), a study of reported cases (to give an overview of doctors' experiences with the review committees), and a study carried out amongst the general public (around 1, 500 Dutch adults will be given a written questionnaire about their opinions concerning medical end-of-life decisions and the <b>reporting</b> <b>procedure).</b> In addition to this Dutch study, a European study subsidized by the European Commission is being carried out which will examine attitudes and experiences regarding medical end-of-life decisions in six European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland).
