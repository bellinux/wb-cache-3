Sandel concludes that [...] "a market in refugees changes our view of who refugees are and how they should be treated.

Luc Bovens and Anna Bartsch write that regardless of the wider debate over whether a quota system is justified or not, {{it is vital that}} the ‘distribution key’ determining how many refugees are assigned to each state is fair. They argue that the distribution key proposed by the European Commission is ill-conceived and regressive, and that a fairer system with recalculated quotas may go some way toward convincing the dissenting states to support the system...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand {{is one of}} the 26 {{nations of}} the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) who {{participate}} in a regular refugee resettlement program (“New Zealand <b>Refugee</b> <b>Quota</b> Programme”). It {{is also one of the}} few countries to have a refugee orientation program upon arrival and dedicates a centre especially to host the incoming refugees. The current <b>refugee</b> <b>quota</b> system in New Zealand provides a 6 week orientation and assessment period followed by dispersal into 6 different cities across New Zealand for permanent resettlement. Refugees develop friendships and a sense of comfort over the 6 weeks program with all the facilities available at the Resettlement centre. The transition from the centre into the independent housing in suburban locations therefore becomes more challenging due to the lack of induction of refugees into their host communities. Refugees are alienated in their new communities with the locals equally as oblivious to the new settlers. As a result, post settlement engagement with the host society becomes difficult for refugees. The community relations between the refugees and host society is neglected with refugees generally connecting with the same ethnic group (ii, Gray); limiting cross-cultural connections. This research investigates the role of architecture as a facilitator of social interaction between the refugees and local community to create a strong sense of belonging in the host society. The aim is to explore architectural solutions which can ease the process of resettlement for refugees into the different regions around New Zealand. It seeks to develop a design which offers social engagement that can extend into the society and cross-cultural interaction can be encouraged...|$|R
5000|$|On 31 May 1953, Senator Watkins, {{chairman}} of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee introduced a bill for the Refugee Relief Act, largely based on Eisenhower's proposal and recommendations. The two crucial elements of the bill were that it made <b>refugee</b> <b>quotas</b> distinct from visa quotas and it defined the terms [...] "refugee" [...] (a person facing persecution residing a non-communist country), [...] "escapee" [...] (a person facing persecution who currently resided in a community, country, or area dominated by communists) and [...] "expelee" [...] (a refugee of German heritage who {{had been removed from}} a Soviet-controlled country or area).

CSU leader and Bavarian State Premier Horst Seehofer criticised Merkel's decision to allow in migrants: [...] "We’re now in a state of mind without rules, without system and without order because of a German decision."

40|$|The actual {{refugee crisis}} in Europe was {{triggered}} by the violent events following the so-called Arab Spring that started in 2011. Faced with large masses of immigrants and refugees, EU member states implemented a <b>refugee</b> <b>quota</b> system in order to distribute refugees across EU. This paper is questioning the general belief that all immigrants and refugees within EU live in better conditions than in their origin areas. Furthermore, this paper tries to answer at the following question: Why some migrants prefer to come to Europe {{if there is a}} high probability that they will live in worse conditions in refugees camps than in their home countries? Studying this question has at least two main important implications: firstly, the reader will understand better the reasons which determine migrants to leave their origin areas {{despite the fact that they}} can be caught in a death trap; secondly, the answer provided for this question may give future solutions in the field of policy-making for EU’s member states...|$|R
