They began playing melodic metal and {{released}} the cassette The Return in 1987. Later, Believer changed its style to thrash metal, as the band said: ”We <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could write thrash better than we could write anything else”.|$|E

500|$|Daft Punk {{produced}} the tracks included in Homework without {{a plan to}} release an album. Bangalter stated, [...] "It {{was supposed to be}} just a load of singles. But we did so many tracks over a period of five months that we <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had a good album." [...] The duo set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP. De Homem-Christo remarked, [...] "There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album." [...] The name Homework, Bangalter explained, relates to [...] "the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|While Vitalogy {{had shifted}} away from the earlier albums' {{accessible}} compositions and polished production, No Code represented a deliberate break from Tens stadium sound, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rock songs. It stood out {{with its emphasis on}} subtle harmony ("Off He Goes"), Eastern influences ("Who You Are"), and spoken word ("I'm Open"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs [...] "Who You Are" [...] and [...] "In My Tree". Irons stated, [...] "To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys have been really supportive of me doing it, and we've worked some things into a few songs." [...] Vedder said, [...] "We <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had an opportunity to experiment." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{initial set}} release date was late 2004, {{and the band}} had to delay the album to January 2005. But as the new target date was approaching, the band again {{discarded}} songs, which they deemed [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "passionless". Sixty songs were written during these sessions, fifty-two of which were ditched. The band started rehearsing the songs for a planned tour, but felt the songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions: [...] "We <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't really have the right songs {{and some of them}} were starting to sound better because we were playing them than they did on record, so we thought we better go back and record them again." [...] Guitarist Jonny Buckland has said that the band had pushed themselves [...] "forward in every direction" [...] in making the album, but they felt it sounded like they were going backwards compared to their earlier works.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] we <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to {{take a good look at}} one of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E

500|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of the first season of [...] on Fox, Warner Bros. {{assigned}} Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at Arkham Asylum and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea's concept, however, was considered [...] "too brainy", as it required Batman to be inmobile during a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode [...] "Trial", which was aired after the movie's release. Although the Joker does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular rogues gallery. Burnett also cited he [...] "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head." [...] In reality, the creative team had said that they originally didn't want to use the Joker in the film. Conversely, Paul Dini stated that the Joker was always part of the film from the beginning of its production. The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, but writer Michael Reaves said, [...] "We then <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could make his appearance serve the story {{in a way that we}} never could in live-action." [...] In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, Bruce Timm and Burnett convinced frequent Animated Series writer Paul Dini to not use Harley Quinn in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously [...] used in the episodes [...] "Joker's Wild" [...] and [...] "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".|$|E

2500|$|After the Secret of the Runes tour, {{the band}} had amassed 55 {{unreleased}} songs {{which included the}} ones Johnsson had shelved as well as contributions from the Niemann brothers. Johnsson remarked that [...] "we went through the songs and <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had enough good material for three albums. Recording one after the other, promoting, and touring each one separately would have taken several years {{and would have been}} a bad idea; and being so productive, we would have had another 55 songs waiting when we finally came to the end of it." [...] In 2004, the band released 21 tracks on two albums: Lemuria and Sirius B. The albums were released simultaneously and were available as separate albums or a twin-pack. 171 musicians participated, including the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and a 32-member choir. Contributing to lead vocals were Mats Levén and a returning Piotr Wawrzeniuk.|$|E

2500|$|Former {{legislative}} colleague Ron Gomez described Gunter {{as having}} what urban people call [...] "street smarts, that innate ability, also common to many rural folk, to smell a phony an acre away, {{to be suspicious}} of everyone who didn't dress or talk like him and to cut {{to the heart of}} a matter with cold precision. His politics were populist in nature. He was regularly graded high by organized labor and low by business and professional associations", such as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Gomez said that he and Gunter did not become friends but [...] "shared a mutual respect. Whether I shared Carl's beliefs or he disliked the way I talked, we <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> both got to the House the same way and for the same reason: we were there to represent the people of our respective districts. I hoped that all {{the other members of the}} House practiced that philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody seemed right. For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't get it together, so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so we <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E
