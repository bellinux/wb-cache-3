5|$|Before {{we see a}} {{full shot}} of Tracy, we see {{individual}} shots of her upraised right and left arms. This is <b>reminiscent</b> of our first views of Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford) in the 1932 film Rain.|$|E
5|$|Bleed Like Me is {{the fourth}} studio album by American-Scottish {{alternative}} rock band Garbage. It was released on April 11, 2005 by A Records and Warner Bros. Records. The group chose a straight rock sound <b>reminiscent</b> of Garbage's live performances instead of the electronica that permeated the previous album, Beautiful Garbage (2001).|$|E
5|$|China Tang {{is owned}} by the {{businessman}} David Tang and was opened in 2005. The restaurant is luxuriously designed, with an art deco lounge bar <b>reminiscent</b> of 1930s Shanghai. The Spatisserie is an informal restaurant, which specialises in light snacks and afternoon tea, serving cakes, biscuits and pastries.|$|E
5|$|During the Pittsburgh Penguins' 2009 Stanley Cup {{championship}} run, when National Hockey League winger Tyler Kennedy {{scored a}} goal, the Mellon Arena public address team would announce his family name twice, {{and the local}} crowd would chant {{it in a way}} <b>reminiscent</b> of Anderson's wrestling persona.|$|E
5|$|During the {{extensive}} research Hergé carried out for The Blue Lotus, he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts. This is especially noticeable in the seascapes, which are <b>reminiscent</b> {{of works by}} Hokusai and Hiroshige.|$|E
5|$|However, {{many of the}} {{features}} introduced in Alpha Centauri were carried over into subsequent Civilization titles; in fact, upon its release, Civilization III was compared negatively to Alpha Centauri, whose Civilization characteristics were <b>reminiscent</b> of faction bonuses and penalties.|$|E
5|$|In the Tokyo Woman's Christian College, {{commenced}} in 1924, Raymond's architecture {{can be seen}} {{to still}} be heavily influenced by Wright. Its low, hipped roof and overhanging eaves are <b>reminiscent</b> of Wright's Prairie Houses. This early work also demonstrates his interest in Czech Cubism and the work of Auguste Perret.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} removal, called Brumby running, is <b>reminiscent</b> of Banjo Paterson's iconic poem, The Man from Snowy River where expert riders rope the Brumbies and remove {{them to a}} new location.|$|E
5|$|There is {{display of}} rock and roll memorabilia {{focusing}} mainly on Elvis Presley in an exhibit in a separate structure on the same lot. The exhibit includes a set of The Beatles statues <b>reminiscent</b> of their Abbey Road album cover.|$|E
5|$|Zeno's paradoxes, {{particularly}} {{the paradox of}} the runner, are <b>reminiscent</b> of the apparent paradox that 0.999... and 1 are equal. The runner paradox can be mathematically modelled and then, like 0.999..., resolved using a geometric series. However, {{it is not clear}} if this mathematical treatment addresses the underlying metaphysical issues Zeno was exploring.|$|E
5|$|According to Ryan Book of the Music Times, {{the media}} form {{utilized}} in the montage contradicted the song's title. Kreps {{stated that the}} video was <b>reminiscent</b> of , a documentary film about Nirvana front man and 1990s rock icon Kurt Cobain. According to Kreps, the private life of both artists in their youth were revealed through real home videos.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del método, 1974), is a {{synthesis}} of several historical figures from Latin American, most prominently Gerardo Machado, dictator of Cuba. This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half {{of his life in}} Europe, perhaps <b>reminiscent</b> of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.|$|E
5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because {{of the impact of}} previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. Some thought the cancellation was because of the recent swine flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, <b>reminiscent</b> of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste <b>reminiscent</b> of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
5|$|Arachnophobia is a {{specific}} phobia—it is the abnormal fear of spiders or anything <b>reminiscent</b> of spiders, such as webs or spider-like shapes. It {{is one of the}} most common specific phobias, and some statistics show that 50% of women and 10% of men show symptoms. It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive, or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone with the Wind, first published in 1936, the fictional character Rhett Butler warns a group of upper-class secessionists of the folly of war with the North in terms very <b>reminiscent</b> of those Sherman directed to David F. Boyd before leaving Louisiana. Sherman's invasion of Georgia later plays {{a central role in}} the plot of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Behind the Devil's Back (2015) {{was noted}} for a heavier use of {{electronics}} {{than in the}} past, said by some critics to be <b>reminiscent</b> of Westaway and Haigh's side project Gunship. The Edge and Rocksins.com reviewers remarked in particular the album's 1980s-style synths, while NE:MM writer David Smith drew comparisons to American alternative rock supergroup Angels & Airwaves.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions of Imogen as a {{small child}} {{indicate}} that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face <b>reminiscent</b> of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, {{at the age of}} five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Holidays were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{version of}} Puyo Puyo and replaces its {{characters}} {{with those from}} the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, being primarily based on the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog animated series. The gameplay is <b>reminiscent</b> of Tetris, in which the player must organise different coloured shapes as they fall down a board. The game received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, while criticising the difficulty and overuse of the falling block puzzle genre.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{erroneous}} use of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) {{and other}} routing technology to redirect the {{connections to the}} filtering proxies, users of some networks were temporarily prevented from accessing or editing any content hosted by Wikimedia, a problem <b>reminiscent</b> of Pakistan's accidental blocking of YouTube {{for much of the}} world instead of only their own citizens.|$|E
5|$|During his consulship he {{advocated}} for the accused in court, {{which was a}} popular move, <b>reminiscent</b> of when he formerly used to plea for his defendants directly to Augustus. He also appealed to the people by ministering the Ludi Martiales (games of Mars), where he let loose two hundred lions in the Circus Maximus. Pliny the Elder mentions the games in his Historia Naturalis.|$|E
5|$|Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon {{are played}} using the side-scrolling view {{introduced}} in , while Zelda's Adventure has a top-down view <b>reminiscent</b> {{of the original}} The Legend of Zelda. All the CD-i Zelda games begin with animated FMVs to illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} CD-ROM format, save Zelda's Adventure, which begins with a live-action video.|$|E
5|$|Film critic Ben Zipper {{believes}} that Kiarostami’s {{work as a}} landscape artist {{is evident in the}} composition of distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films. He points out that Kiarostami’s use of rural locations and remote settings is <b>reminiscent</b> of Sohrab Sepehri’s attention to landscape as represented in his poems such as Golestaneh, in which the poet treats the rural environment realistically and imbues it with a poetic aura.|$|E
5|$|Five {{companies}} did {{the visual}} effects – Industrial Light & Magic, Double Negative, Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and Peerless – {{under the supervision}} of Steve Begg. The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital touches on the vehicles, and crumbling buildings. A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. It took four months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif <b>reminiscent</b> of the Spectre logo, along with images of love and relationships.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design <b>reminiscent</b> of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is {{commonly}} known as pig's ears, alluding to the violet underside and yellowish cap of the fruit bodies, although this vernacular name is also used for Discina perlata. Other English common names for this species include clustered chanterelle and violet chanterelle. Gray coined the name clubbed gomphe. In the Sherpa language of Nepal the fungus is known as Eeshyamo ("mother-in-law"), as its imposing fruit body is <b>reminiscent</b> of a mother-in-law, who has a dominant role in the Sherpa family.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 and 1934, Stackpole {{took part}} in the Public Works of Art Project {{assignment}} to paint murals for Coit Tower. Many of the murals were executed in styles <b>reminiscent</b> of Rivera, and Stackpole himself was portrayed in five of them; in one he is shown reading a newspaper announcing the destruction of a Rivera mural in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} antigenic similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot {{and members of the}} genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms <b>reminiscent</b> of Newcastle disease. Like other members of the genus, the turquoise parrot is highly sensitive to avian paramyxovirus infection. It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{an outfit}} worn by model Karlie Kloss, which was <b>reminiscent</b> of Native American attire, sparked {{controversy}} {{due to its}} alleged stereotypical depiction of Native Americans. Victoria's Secret released a statement of apology shortly after, saying that they will remove it from future advertisements and the broadcast. Kloss apologized on her Twitter account for the outfit and expressed her support for the outfit's removal in the broadcast.|$|E
5|$|In Mesopotamian iconography, the {{crescent}} {{was the primary}} symbol of Nanna-Sîn. The Moon goddess Selene was represented as wearing a crescent on her headgear in an arrangement <b>reminiscent</b> of horns. The star and crescent arrangement also {{goes back to the}} Bronze Age, representing either the Sun and Moon, or the Moon and planet Venus, in combination. It came to represent the goddess Artemis or Hecate, and via the patronage of Hecate came {{to be used as a}} symbol of Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rich dinosaur fossils, {{there are also}} plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is <b>reminiscent</b> of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.|$|E
