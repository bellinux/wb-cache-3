25|$|The {{expectation}} {{of the secular}} ruling elite that {{the policies of the}} 1920s and 1930s would diminish the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in public life did not materialize. As early as 1925, religious grievances were one of the principal causes of the Şeyh Sait rebellion, an uprising in southeastern Turkey that may have claimed as many as 30,000 lives before being suppressed.|$|E
25|$|On 11 August 1930, Mustafa Kemal {{decided to}} try a multiparty {{movement}} once again and asked Ali Fethi Okyar {{to establish a new}} party. He insisted on the protection of secular reforms. The brand-new Liberal Republican Party succeeded all around the country. Without the establishment of a real political spectrum, once again, the party became the center to opposition of Atatürk's reforms, particularly in regard to the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in public life.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{antisemitism}} {{replaced the}} hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In {{the context of}} the Industrial Revolution, following the Jewish Emancipation, Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing nationalism, the rise of eugenics, and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.|$|E

25|$|Another {{group of}} {{scholars}} {{tend to focus}} on ideological differences. Among this group the prevailing theory places the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in core of the growing conflict within Carlism, pointing that while Nocedal clearly aimed at reducing monarchical, dynastical and fuerista threads to secondary roles, Carlos VII intended to keep balance between all components of the Traditionalist ideario. Both parties present their variants here: according to the Carlists, Nocedal intended to disfigure the party into “acción eminente apostolica”, according to the Integrists, it was the claimant who deviated from principles of Traditionalism.|$|E
25|$|While Ellis' {{personal}} atheism and humanism remained consistent, {{his views}} about the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in mental health changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions and at his institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and often with characteristically acerbic delivery stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In The Case Against Religiosity, a 1980 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition of religiosity as any devout, dogmatic and demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers and aggressive atheists.|$|E
25|$|The Warren Court (1953–69) {{dramatically}} {{expanded the}} force of Constitutional civil liberties. It held that segregation in public schools violates equal protection (Brown v. Board of Education, Bolling v. Sharpe and Green v. County School Bd.) and that traditional legislative district boundaries violated {{the right to vote}} (Reynolds v. Sims). It created a general right to privacy (Griswold v. Connecticut), limited the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in public school (most prominently Engel v. Vitale and Abington School District v. Schempp), incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the States—prominently Mapp v. Ohio (the exclusionary rule) and Gideon v. Wainwright (right to appointed counsel),—and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police (Miranda v. Arizona); At the same time, however, the Court limited defamation suits by public figures (New York Times v. Sullivan) and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories.|$|E

In particular, certain features of the experimental approach as used by economists such as incentive compatibility are particularly appropriate for studying the effect <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> on individual behaviour.

25|$|The {{year after}} his release in 1309 saw a change of power to a new Sultan in Egypt, Baibars al-Jashnakir whose reign was marked by {{economical}} and political unrest. His hold on power was short lived and lasted only a year. During this time, in August 1309, Ibn Taymiyyah {{was taken into custody}} and placed under house arrest for seven months in the new sultan's palace in Alexandria. He was freed when Al-Nasir Muhammad retook the position of sultan on 4 March 1310. Having returned to Cairo a week later, he was received by the sultan Al-Nasir. The sultan would sometimes consult Ibn Taymiyyah on religious affairs and policies during the rest of his three-year stay in Cairo. During this time he continued to teach and wrote his famous book Al-Kitab al-Siyasa al-shar'iyya (Treatise on the Government of the Religious Law), a book noted for its account of the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in politics.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table {{his experience as a}} senior officer in the Air Force Reserve. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the Christian right on the Republican Party so conflicted with Goldwater's views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such as abortion, gay rights, and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in public life. After narrowly winning re-election to the Senate in 1980, he chose not to run for a sixth term in 1986, and was succeeded by fellow Republican John McCain. A significant accomplishment in his career was the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the Pentagon by placing the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{into the}} new millennium, the {{conversation}} on a National level turned to the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in ritual. In 1968, Theta Phi opened its doors to women of all faith and replaced the crucifix used in ritual to a cross. In 1988, there was discussion of removing the cross in ritual. The discussion was tabled during convention but {{it was decided that}} the cross would have a less prominent role in ritual In 1990, Theta Phi Alpha surveyed the sisters about the Catholic influences in the ritual. The most positive response was to adjusting the ritual to match the current views of the national fraternity, while the most negative response was to removing all references to God in the ritual. This dissonance between the sisters is still discussed today. However, Theta Phi Alpha is slowly removing religious aspects, in 1990 the Lord's Prayer was removed from the ritual. In 1992, the Theta Phi Alpha Prayer was removedand the following year a less religious ritual for deceased members and a nonreligious national philanthropy, The House that Theta Phi Alpha Built were introduced.|$|E

40|$|Ralph Burhoe's {{ideas have}} not been well {{received}} in European Protestant theology. His approach has been {{at odds with the}} dominant resistance to natural theology on the Continent, and it has not fit well with reconciling attempts from the United Kingdom either. However, Burhoe's interest in the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> in the emergence of human nature and culture, including the interest in noncognitive functions <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> should be taken to heart. Besides, he has set an example for Europeans with respect to method in dealing with first-rate science...|$|R
5000|$|The book deals {{fundamentally}} with cosmology although {{throughout the}} text several sciences are mentioned, such as: physics, mathematics, neurology, and philosophy. It {{deals with a}} wide variety of philosophical problems, such as the nature of God, miracles, free will, time, and consciousness. Davies seeks to explain the changing <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and science, and the way in which physics is giving insights into what were once considered solely religious or philosophical questions.|$|R
25|$|The most heated {{controversy}} {{was over}} {{the status of the}} Catholic Church. From a dominant position in 1788, it was almost destroyed in less than a decade, its priests and nuns turned out, its leaders dead or in exile, its property controlled by its enemies, and a strong effort underway to remove all influence of Christian religiosity, such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies. The movement to dechristianise France not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious. Napoleon's Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Catholic Church's traditional roles but not its power, its lands or its monasteries. Priests and bishops were given salaries as part of a department of government controlled by Paris, not Rome. Protestants and Jews gained equal rights. Battles over the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in the public sphere, and closely related issues such as church-controlled schools, that were opened by the Revolution have never seen closure. They raged into the 20th century. By the 21st century, angry debates exploded over the presence of any Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as the headscarves for which Muslim girls could be expelled. J. Christopher Soper and Joel S. Fetzer explicitly link the conflict over religious symbols in public to the French Revolution, when the target was Catholic rituals and symbols.|$|E
500|$|The {{sociology}} of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles {{of religion in}} society. There is particular emphasis on the recurring <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in all societies and throughout recorded history. The {{sociology of}} religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what Peter L. Berger has described as a position of [...] "methodological atheism". It may {{be said that the}} modern formal discipline of sociology began with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates among Roman Catholic and Protestant populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of economic sociology and social stratification: The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), [...] (1915), [...] (1915), and Ancient Judaism (1920). Contemporary debates often centre on topics such as secularization, civil religion, the intersection of religion and economics and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in a context of globalization and multiculturalism.|$|E
500|$|The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> {{has been}} a {{controversial}} debate over {{the years since the}} formation of Islamist parties. For many decades, the wearing of the hijab was banned in schools and government buildings because it was viewed as a symbol of political Islam. However, the ban was lifted from universities in 2011, from government buildings in 2013, from schools in 2014, and from the Armed Forces in 2017. The government of Tayyip Erdoğan and the Justice and Development Party (AKP) pursue the explicit policy agenda of Islamization of education to [...] "raise a devout generation" [...] against secular resistance, in the process causing lost jobs and school for many non-religious citizens of Turkey.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> cultures {{in developing a}} positive work ethic. The paper starts with {{the identification of the}} factors that inhibit improving work ethic in the public service. It further focuses on the factors that may advance positive work ethic in the public service. These factors are parental education, educational institutions, religious influences and societal values. The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> in developing a positive work ethic is divided into five sub-categories. These subcategories are African traditional religions, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity. It needs the concerted efforts of all interested members of the society to develop a positive work ethic...|$|R
40|$|Sociologists {{for many}} years have {{identified}} the family, the school, the peer group, the mass media and political movements as agents of socialization. Majority of sociologists do not consider religion as a potent agent of socialization. The conservative <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in perpetuating social and cultural values are often ignored. This paper seeks to correct such mistake and to present religion as a veritable platform for socialization and social control. The study reveals that religion exercises a pervasive influence on all other social institutions thereby moderating {{the activities of the}} above-mentioned agents of socialization...|$|R
