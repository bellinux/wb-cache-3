5|$|Menzies became prime {{minister}} again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should be {{promoted to the}} rank of field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945. The recommendation went via the Governor-General, William McKell, to the War Office in London, which replied that a dominion officer could not be promoted to the rank. Menzies pointed out that Jan Smuts already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not be promoted to field marshal because he was a <b>retired</b> <b>officer,</b> which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly promoted to field marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.|$|E
