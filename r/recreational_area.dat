The 3-floor 15-room mansion was built in 1921 {{according}} to the Golden Gate National <b>Recreational</b> <b>Area</b> signpost, although some sources say it was built in 1926 or 1929 and had 17 or 18 rooms.|$|E
5|$|Kanthaugen has {{traditionally}} {{served as a}} <b>recreational</b> <b>area</b> for Lillehammer, and has in particular been used for alpine skiing. In 1946, Norway's then-largest ski lift was installed between Stampesletta and Kanthaugen. It remained in use until the late 1970s. At {{the time of the}} closing, a local businessman proposed that it be renovated and that a tobogganing slide be built from Kanthaugen to Stampesletta. The plans were met by local opposition and were not carried through.|$|E

The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the National Archival Services of Norway is served by Sognsvann Station. The station also serves the <b>recreational</b> <b>area</b> Nordmarka and the lake Sognsvann.|$|E
5|$|The line {{opened on}} 10 October 1934 {{as a light}} rail. In 1993, it was {{upgraded}} to metro standard as the first light rail west of Oslo, with two stations being closed. The Ring Line opened in 2003. Forskningsparken has transfer to the Oslo Tramway and serves Rikshospitalet. Forskningsparken and Blindern both serve the University of Oslo, while Ullevål stadion serves Norway's largest football venue. North of there the line mainly serves residential areas.

5|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} {{considered as a}} <b>recreational</b> <b>area</b> for visitors offering multiple leisure activities – the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human–animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered {{an integral part of}} the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the tenders were submitted, it turned out only NSB, DSB and Veolia had chosen bid. The tender was won by NSB Anbud on 30 May 2005, wanting NOK 70 million {{annually}} for the contract, ten million less than with the former agreement. After the contract was won, NSB Anbud announced the schedule for the Gjøvik Line. The number of train services would increase by 40%. Three stations serving the <b>recreational</b> <b>area</b> Nordmarka outside Oslo would be dropped—Elnes, Stryken and Bjørgeseter. Skogsholm tried to make an agreement with NSB to not abandon all the stations, but since this had not {{been part of the}} PSO tender, an agreement could not be made and the service was canceled.|$|E

40|$|This Master`s {{thesis is}} {{focusing}} on studying, arranging and understanding open public space with emphasis on sports and <b>recreational</b> <b>areas</b> in Ribnica, a small Slovenian town. Small towns are predominant in Slovenia and they {{play an important role}} in the polycentric urban network and also offer an opportunity for a quality life outside large urban centers. We presented in detail the role and importance of sports and <b>recreational</b> <b>areas</b> in public spaces and related legislation regarding the process of spatial planning. Sports and <b>recreational</b> <b>areas</b> are the basis for successful participation in various sports activities and represent an important part of the sports infrastructure. The latter includes both open and covered sports facilities and areas. Studies and analyses of space reveal that a small Slovenian town Ribnica does not have sufficiently arranged sports and <b>recreational</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on the criteria and standards for planning of those areas, examples of good practice and analyses of the area, we presented a plan for sustainable arrangement of old and new sports and <b>recreational</b> <b>areas</b> in Ribnica. We have made a proposal, made in appropriate scale, for the detailed municipal spatial plan for sports and <b>recreational</b> <b>areas</b> in the town. The new planned areas will provide the town with an up-to-date, attractive, suitable, functional and sustainable use of sports facilities...|$|R

5|$|The area {{may have}} been settled during the Mesolithic period: locally {{manufactured}} flints of the Horsham Culture type {{have been found to}} the southwest of the town. Tools and burial mounds from the Neolithic period, and burial mounds and a sword from the Bronze Age, have also been discovered. Crawley is on {{the western edge of the}} High Weald, which produced iron for more than 2,000years from the Iron Age onwards. Goffs Park—now a <b>recreational</b> <b>area</b> in the south of the town—was the site of two late Iron Age furnaces. Ironworking and mineral extraction continued throughout Roman times, particularly in the Broadfield area where many furnaces were built.|$|E
5|$|The city cemetery, the Kilden {{park and}} the modern art museum, Kunsten, are in the modern {{commercial}} and administrative area around the railway station to the west. Beyond this, Hasseris has become a residential district {{with a number of}} large villas and detached houses. The city's main development area is now to the east of the centre although in addition to the university and new areas of housing, it still contains the shipping harbor, Østhavnen, and the cement factory. The waterfront to the northeast of the centre is being transformed from a harbour into a <b>recreational</b> <b>area</b> with the Utzon Center and Musikkens Hus.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the Holmenkollen Line {{was opened}} to Besserud. One of the line's main revenue sources was {{transporting}} city-dwellers to the <b>recreational</b> <b>area</b> of Nordmarka {{where they would}} go skiing. An alternative activity was tobogganing down the hill back to Majorstuen. The operator Holmenkolbanen immediately started plans to extend the line. There were two proposals: {{a continuation of the}} line past Holmenkollen and a branch from Midtstuen up Korketrekkeren to Frogneseteren. However, the latter required the use of a rack railway, as it would give a 1:8 gradient. The former route was selected and the line was extended to Frogneseteren in 1916. Holmenkolbanen started renting out sleds at Frogneseteren, which could be returned at most stations. To save the return ticket, many chose to continue the tobogganing ride to Majorstuen.|$|E

5|$|The Merced River and {{its tributaries}} are a popular <b>recreational</b> <b>area</b> {{in part because of}} Yosemite National Park. There are many {{activities}} within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley to the entrance of Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV, mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River {{and its tributaries}} include ones at Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} given to the creek by Spanish explorers in the 18th century, {{although}} there are now many places in California that use the name. Historically, the creek served as the boundary between the Juaneño (Acjachemem) and Gabrieleño (Tongva) Indians. The creek's watershed then became a major portion of the 1842 Rancho Niguel Mexican Land Grant to Juan Avila, later purchased by two American ranchers. Although attempts to use the creek and its watershed as a municipal water source date to the early 20thcentury, the water it provided was of poor quality and erratic occurrence. As a result, the creek became neglected throughout the late part of the century, eventually becoming little more than an open wastewater drain. Despite this general decline, the Aliso Creek watershed still supports some biodiversity, and it remains a popular <b>recreational</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
