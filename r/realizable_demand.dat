40|$|The chosen tool of {{this thesis}} is an extremal type approach. The lesson {{drawn by the}} theorems proved in the thesis is that {{surprisingly}} small compromise is necessary on {{the efficacy of the}} solutions to make the approach work. The problems studied have several connections to other subjects and practical applications. The first part of the thesis is concerned with orthogonal art galleries. A sharp extremal bound is proved on partitioning orthogonal polygons into at most 8 -vertex polygons using established techniques in the field of art gallery problems. This fills in the gap between already known results for partitioning into at most 6 - and 10 -vertex orthogonal polygons. Next, these techniques are further developed to prove a new type of extremal art gallery result. The novelty provided by this approach is that it establishes a connection between mobile and stationary guards. This theorem has strong computational consequences, in fact, it provides the basis for an $\frac 83 $-approximation algorithm for guarding orthogonal polygons with rectangular vision. In the second part, the graph theoretical concept of terminal-pairability is studied in complete and complete grid graphs. Once again, the extremal approach is conductive to discovering efficient methods to solve the problem. In the case of a complete base graph, the new demonstrated lower bound on the maximum degree of <b>realizable</b> <b>demand</b> graphs is 4 times higher than previous best results. The techniques developed are then used to solve the classical extremal edge number problem for the terminal-pairability problem in complete base graphs. The complete grid base graph lies {{on the other end of}} the spectrum in terms density amongst path-pairable graphs. It is shown that complete grid graphs are relatively efficient in routing edge-disjoint paths.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{adaptive}} antenna based asynchronous multi-user orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems are developed over fading channels. Although multi-user multiplexing {{is essential for}} spectrally efficient communications, synchronous operation may not be practically <b>realizable</b> given the <b>demand</b> for high-speed services with portability. In addition, multiple access interference deteriorates the quality of signal detection. Thus, an asynchronous multiuser OFDM signal model is developed, and a space-time minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalization scheme is proposed to suppress the asynchronous interference. Furthermore, in order to amplify the performance gain from channel coding, a low-complexity iterative soft interference cancellation scheme is developed. The channel information required for effective equalization can be obtained via a novel subspace based semi-blind channel identification scheme. An inherent property of asynchronous OFDM signals is exploited so that the subspace decomposition method can separate the desired user 2 ̆ 7 s channel vector from the interfering user 2 ̆ 7 s channel vector, determining it uniquely up to a multiplicative scalar ambiguity. The proposed subspace based semi-blind algorithm improves the estimation performance under practical conditions and guarantees estimation of each user 2 ̆ 7 s channel vector. Symbol-timing and carrier-frequency offset estimation in asynchronous multiple access OFDM channels is also studied. The proposed joint method simplifies a complex multiple parameter estimation problem by assigning {{a unique set of}} pilot symbols to each user. Finally, the performance of asynchronous multi-user multiple input multiple output (MIMO) OFDM systems is investigated along with various transmit diversity techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|Secure multi-party {{computation}} is {{a conceptual}} framework in which distrusting parties engage in a protocol to securely perform a computational task. Depending on the precise model of security, different sets of tasks admit secure protocols. We take a complexity-theoretic approach to studying the inherent difficulty of securely realizing tasks in various standard security models. * We give the first alternate characterization of secure realizability {{in the framework of}} universally composable (UC) security. This is the first characterization in any model to consider completely arbitrary computational tasks and completely arbitrary communication channels. * The most long-standing class of computational tasks studied are those in which two parties evaluate a deterministic function. For these tasks, we give the first complete, combinatorial characterizations of secure realizability in the passive, standalone, and universally composable security models, against computationally unbounded adversaries. * Say that a task G has ``as much cryptographic complexity'' as another task F if there is a secure protocol for F that uses access to a secure implementation of G. We show that there is an infinite hierarchy of tasks with strictly increasing cryptographic complexities, with respect to computationally unbounded security. We also show that there exist tasks whose cryptographic complexities are incomparable. * In contrast, we show that under a standard cryptographic assumption, there exist only two distinct levels of cryptographic complexity with respect to polynomial-time security. Every task either has a trivial protocol using plain communication channels, or is complete (i. e., given access to a secure implementation of this task, there are secure protocols for all other tasks). This is the first result to derive a characterization of completeness for a class of arbitrary interactive tasks. In light of these characterizations, the only tasks which are securely <b>realizable</b> in the <b>demanding</b> framework of universal composition are those related to secure communication. Indeed, the framework has been used to define the security of encryption schemes, which has allowed for modular design and analysis of protocols. We consider a similar approach for homomorphic encryption schemes. A homomorphic scheme is one in which anyone can obtain an encryption of f(m_ 1, [...] ., m_n), given only the encryptions of unknown messages m_ 1, [...] ., m_n, for a specific set of functions f. * We give a construction of a homomorphic encryption scheme in which the allowed homomorphic operation is as full-featured as possible [...] - namely, one can derive a correctly-distributed encryption of f(m) given an encryption of unknown message m, for some functions f [...] - yet it is computationally infeasible to generate a ciphertext that is related to other ciphertexts in any other way. Our contributions involve developing new appropriate security definitions as well as new constructions. * We show that schemes with such powerful security guarantees can be used to build conceptually simple, efficient, UC-secure protocols for verifiable computations on encrypted data. We show protocols for two tasks related to aggregating encrypted data. unpublishe...|$|R
