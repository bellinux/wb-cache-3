40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is intended}} to study the stochastic optimization of a dynamical currency <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> process and presents a sampling-based scenario aggregation algorithm {{which can be used}} to solve the optimal currency <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> model. First, we review various financial applications of stochastic programming modeling techniques in the literature and examine traditional <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> and valuation methods in finance. Next, we analyze the uncertain factors in currency exchange and discuss how to generate scenarios and scenario tree for financial optimization methods. We examine the advantages of using short-term derivative securities in portfolio hedging and give valuation models for the short term derivative securities traded in the exchange market. We provide three types of optimal currency <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> models to satisfy various hedging environment and risk management needs. To solve the currency <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> model, we propose a sampling-based stochastic programming algorithm which is based on its corresponding deterministic algorithm. The sample frequencies and a sampled scenario tree will be used to approximate the scenario probabilities and the true scenario tree respectively in the algorithm. We prove that the iteration points will converge with probability one to the true optimal solution asymptotically and show that the accuracy and speed of the algorithm depend on the sample size and error tolerance for each sampled problem in the iterations. Finally, we present the results of numerical experiments of our <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> models and sampling-based scenario aggregation algorithm. The computational results for the <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> models show that our optimal hedging method generates better cost-profit hedging performance compared with traditional hedging methods. The experiments of the sampling algorithm shows that the algorithm can generate good solutions effectively, especially for extremely large-scale stochastic programming problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{properties of}} discretely rebalanced <b>option</b> <b>hedges</b> {{have been studied}} extensively beginning with Black and Scholes (1973). In each analysis hedges were "delta-neutral" after rebalancing. We argue that the distributional properties of discretely rebalanced hedges are such that delta-based hedging is not the variance minimizing strategy. This paper obtains analytical expressions for the variance minimizing <b>option</b> <b>hedge</b> ratios. We also evaluate the hedge variance to assess {{the magnitude of the}} variance reduction over delta-based hedges. For representative parameter values, we show that systematic departures from delta-based hedges can yield significant reductions in hedge variance even for one day rebalancing intervals. <b>hedge,</b> <b>option,</b> delta, discrete rebalancing...|$|R

40|$|When {{options are}} traded, {{one can use}} their prices and price changes to draw {{inference}} about the set of risk factors and their risk premia. We analyze tests for the existence and {{the sign of the}} market prices of jump risk that are based on <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> errors. We derive a closed-form solution for the <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> error and its expecta- tion in a stochastic jump model under continuous trading and correct model specification. Jump risk is structurally different from, e. g., stochastic volatility: there is one market price of risk for each jump size (and not just the market price of jump risk). Thus, the expected hedging error cannot identify the exact structure of the compensation for jump risk. Furthermore, we derive closed form solutions for the expected <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> error under discrete trading and model mis-specification. Compared to the ideal case, the sign of the expected hedging error can change, so that empirical tests based on simplifying assumptions about trading frequency and the model may lead to incorrect conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{theoretical}} {{work has}} been devoted to the problem of <b>option</b> pricing and <b>hedging</b> with transaction costs. A variety of methods have been suggested and are currently being used for dynamic <b>hedging</b> of <b>options</b> in the presence of transaction costs. However, very little was done on the subject of an empirical comparison of different methods for <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> with transaction costs. In a few existing studies the different methods are compared by studying their empirical performances in hedging only a plain-vanilla short call option. The reader is tempted to assume that the ranking of the different methods for hedging any kind of option remains the same as that for a vanilla call. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} show that the ranking of the alternative hedging strategies depends crucially on the type of the <b>option</b> position being <b>hedged</b> and the risk preferences of the hedger. In addition, we present and implement a simple optimization method that, in some cases, improves considerably the performance of some <b>hedging</b> strategies. <b>Option</b> <b>hedging,</b> transaction costs, simulations, risk-return tradeoff, optimization...|$|R
40|$|Background: In an {{increasingly}} globalized environment, corporations perform transactions across borders {{on a day-to-day}} basis. As multinational corporations expand their businesses the number of currencies in their operations increases. The consequence of operating with several currencies is the risk associated with currency fluctuations. Sandvik AB is a worldwide corporation where activities are conducted through representation in more than 130 countries. Currency exposures are controlled through risk management where financial derivatives are applied to protect the corporation from potential losses caused by fluctuations. Sandvik AB recently implemented a hedging strategy entitled Layered Basket <b>Option</b> <b>hedging.</b> The strategy {{is a combination of}} a layered- and a basket option approach to maximize the effect of the hedge. There is a limited amount of previous research regarding Layered Basket <b>Option</b> <b>hedging</b> and Sandvik AB is the first corporation to actively practice this strategy. Purpose: The purpose is to investigate and provide information about how currency risk most effectively is hedged for the multinational corporation Sandvik AB. Furthermore, we want to evaluate if Sandvik’s recently implemented hedging strategy, Layered Basket <b>Option</b> <b>hedging,</b> is the best-suited strategy for them and if there are any improvements to be made. This thesis will further investigate the importance of currency hedging for multinational corporations, which are dependent on reporting to their stakeholders. Hopefully, this thesis will also facilitate the communication of Sandvik’s currency strategies throughout the organization and make it more comprehensible. Method: Exchange rates on daily basis for the period 2002 - 2012 were collected from Bank of Canada and Reuters database. The collected data was thereafter used as a basis to perform calculations to determine if Layered Basket <b>Option</b> <b>hedging</b> is the optimal solution for Sandvik AB. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight the benefits from applying a Layered Basket <b>Option</b> <b>hedging</b> strategy and the strategy succeeds to reduce the volatility caused by currency fluctuation. The results indicate that the combination of a layered- and a basket option approach successfully creates a suitable strategy for Sandvik AB. Furthermore, this thesis has recognized that there exists room for improvement by actively allocating currencies according to their weights and correlations to fully exploit the effects from the strategy...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} approaches to <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> with transaction costs is the utility-based approach, pioneered by Hodges and Neuberger [Rev. Futures Markets, 1989, 8, 222 - 239]. Judging against the best possible trade-off between the risk and the costs of a hedging strategy, this approach seems to achieve excellent empirical performance. However, this approach has one major drawback that prevents the broad application of this approach in practice: the lack of a closed-form solution. We overcome this drawback by presenting a simple yet efficient analytic approximation of the solution. We provide an empirical testing of our approximation strategy against the asymptotic and some other well-known strategies and find that our strategy outperforms all the others. <b>Option</b> <b>hedging,</b> Transaction costs, Approximation methods, Simulations,...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the {{performance}} of volatility <b>options</b> as <b>hedging</b> instruments for hedging volatility risk. We investigate (a) the relative hedging performance of volatility and European options, (b) the relative hedging performance of volatility index and straddle options, and (c) the impact of model misspecification on hedging effectiveness. Our focus is on exotic options as the <b>options</b> to be <b>hedged,</b> because they are more sensitive to volatility risk and model risk and practically more relevant when the effectiveness of different hedging strategies is examined. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that volatility options are especially useful for <b>hedging</b> <b>options</b> with a severe exotic feature and there is {{no significant difference between the}} performances of volatility index and straddle options. Furthermore, our results indicate that model misspecification has an important impact on the hedging performance.

Extending known results this work gives analytical formulas {{for the price of}} American, Asian and general European options. Moreover, for all these <b>options</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies are presented.

40|$|In the {{complete}} market model of geometric Brownian motion, {{all kinds of}} exotic options can be priced and hedged perfectly using a delta hedging strategy which duplicates the option's payoff. If trading {{takes place in a}} frictionless market, this delta hedging strategy is said to eliminate the option writer's risk completely. It will be shown that for certain contingent claims, for example digital <b>options,</b> the <b>hedge</b> can fail completely if the underlying risky asset does not follow the assumed geometric Brownian motion. Indeed, the hedging error may diverge and delta hedging can actually increase the risk of the option writer. Option pricing, digital <b>option</b> <b>hedging,</b> hedging error...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> in the {{presence}} of proportional transaction costs can be formulated as a singular stochastic control problem. Hodges and Neuberger [1989. Optimal replication of contingent claims under transactions costs. Review of Futures Markets 8, 222 - 239] introduced an approach that is based on maximization of the expected utility of terminal wealth. We develop a new algorithm to solve the corresponding singular stochastic control problem and introduce a new approach to <b>option</b> <b>hedging</b> which is closer in spirit to the pathwise replication of Black and Scholes [1973. The pricing of options and corporate liabilities. Journal of Political Economy 81, 637 - 654]. This new approach is based on minimization of a Black-Scholes-type measure of pathwise risk, defined in terms of a market delta, subject to an upper bound on the hedging cost. We provide an efficient backward induction algorithm for the problem of cost-constrained risk minimization, whose associated singular stochastic control problem is shown to be equivalent to an optimal stopping problem. This algorithm is then modified to solve the singular stochastic control problem associated with utility maximization, which cannot be reduced to an optimal stopping problem. We propose to choose an optimal parameter (risk-aversion coefficient or Lagrange multiplier) in either approach by minimizing the mean squared hedging error and demonstrate that with this "best" choice of the parameter, both approaches have similar performance. We also discuss the different notions of risk in both approaches and propose a volatility adjustment for the risk-minimization approach, which is analogous to that introduced by Zakamouline [2006. European <b>option</b> pricing and <b>hedging</b> with both fixed and proportional transaction costs. Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 30, 1 - 25] for the utility maximization approach, thereby providing a unified treatment of both approaches. <b>Option</b> <b>hedging</b> Singular stochastic control Optimal stopping Backward induction Transaction costs Volatility adjustment...|$|R
