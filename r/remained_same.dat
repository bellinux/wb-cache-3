With March 2009 Local Elections, İzmir Greater (Metropolitan) Municipality now have 21 district municipalities, since new municipalities had established due to high population of some major second-tier municipalities like Karşıyaka and Konak. Now, İzmir Greater (Metropolitan) Municipality has several smaller municipalities in terms of land area coverage, however, Güzelbahçe still remains as the smallest municipality within the metropolitan area in terms of population. March 2009 Local Elections of Turkey has also resulted of mergers of villages and town municipalities with their respective second-tier / district municipalities in all greater municipalities. Therefore, parallel to this regulation and changes, Yelki town municipality and Çamlık Villages become part of Güzelbahçe Municipality in 2009. Although the population of Güzelbahçe Municipality increased little, the land area increased greatly. The population and land borders of Güzelbahçe County/District however <b>remained</b> <b>same.</b> Güzelbahçe is part of the İzmir Greater (Metropolitan) Area and Municipality since the establishment of İzmir Greater Municipality in 1984.

5000|$|Dublje (/du:blye/) is {{well known}} in the region for having its own unique {{language}} which is still spoken in some households today. The Dubljanski language is a mixture of Bulgarian and Serbian language with plenty of Turkish words. Dublje is about two hundred years old, and the settlers came running away from the Turkish people who decapitated many of the former who primarily lived as villagers in Veliki Izvor near todays Zaječar and a few kilometers away from Bulgarian border. So, with their village burned to the ground for the fourth time, the survived villagers became frightened and decided to flee to the west, deeper ( [...] Serbian: dublje [...] )and deeper into the woods (which is how Dublje got its name) and founded a settlement on a high plain near the river Resava and todays Svilajnac. The settlers i.e. the people who came from Veliki Izvor entirely preserved their language, customs, family names and even personal names in spite of the new environment and people who surrounded them. The families which kept the same names also kept same slava and even zavetina (slava of the village) <b>remained</b> <b>same</b> in both villages. This instinct for self-preservation went so far that they preserved something better than their ancestors in the primary village. Apart from the language they preserved various rites and other customs and cultural products (songs, legends etc.). Today, some customs, such as Lazarice, still last whereas the same custom in Veliki Izvor disappeared even 50 years ago. In Dublje the repeated Lazarice are completely normal for the young girls, who are dressed in their nicest dresses for that occasion, that is on Lazarus Saturday (which is one week before Easter) when they carry a basket and go from house to house collecting eggs and sweets for the approaching Easter; formerly they were dressed in national clothing garment (known as Lazarice) but as the time passed they felt more comfortable with ordinary clothes because Lazarice has a lot of garments with golden coins sown into material and particularly includes heavy wreath for the head with lots of decorated flowers on it. National clothing also includes other various garments which only the Dubljani (people of Dublje) and the Velikoizvorci (people of Veliki Izvor) wear, like:zabratka (womens cap), takanici (mens and womens girdle), na prestilki (womens summer clothing; prestilka means apron), na vlnenik (womens clothing of the recent date), fusta (womens summer clothing), eleče (traditional vest), etc. These clothing are also included when performing line dancing by which the Dubljani are very famous and have several dances on their own; back in the recent past these line dances were extremely popular and were main means of entertainment and making friendships. There are also many folk songs which testify how people lived back in the past. As for the Velikoizvorci (who are the Dubljani’s ancestors), there is one folk song (Djurdjevdan) recorded about how they used to sacrifice people. Namely, this song tells us how a host, who had no lamb to sacrifice, decided to sacrifice his own first-born son (but fortunately, a lamb appeared in the last moment and the child was saved). Then, there are various customs and ceremonies performed on weddings, deaths and mainly christenings. In the village, elderly people speak Dubljanski while the young speak Serbian, though they mainly know and understand Dubljanski. Today, it is unthinkable for some parents to teach their children Dubljanski for they are ashamed of it, hence they do not speak Dubljanski at all or at least not in front of their children. Gradually, the times changed and the language and many customs started dying out, so eventually the Dubljanski will become a legend.|$|E
