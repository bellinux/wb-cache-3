Such a situation arises, for example, in the Bayesian analysis of finite mixture models. Adaptive MCMC algorithms such as adaptive Metropolis (AM), which self-calibrates its proposal distribution using an online {{estimate of the}} covariance matrix of the target, are no exception. To address the label-switching issue, <b>relabeling</b> algorithms associate a permutation to each MCMC sample, trying to obtain reasonable marginals.
