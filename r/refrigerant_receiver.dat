50|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} flash-gas in the liquid line include a {{cautious}} {{design of the}} cooling system and its piping, but also the incorporation of gear that might help solve this type of difficulty. The inclusion of a <b>refrigerant</b> <b>receiver</b> is a common, cheap and simple way of decreasing the gas ratio in the liquid line. The incorporation of a subcooling stage after the receiver reduces even more the chances to observe flash gas. This subcooling may {{be done in a}} reserved portion of the main condenser, or separately with a heat exchanger. Some receivers may incorporate an internal heat exchanger that draws heat form the subcooled liquid to superheat the gas compressors suction. There are also many kinds of independent subcooling displays and applications such as refrigeration cycle optimizers; these help avoiding flash-gas in the liquid line by lowering the temperature away from the refrigerantâ€™s saturation curves. Some systems deal with flash-gas by separating it from the refrigerant that goes to the evaporator, as that portion of the refrigerant alrealdy evaporated and will only increase superheating.|$|E
