50|$|The mall {{eventually}} {{went into}} further decline {{with the construction}} across Johnston Road of a new power centre called the Pacific Rim Shopping Centre, which opened in early-2005 with Wal-Mart and Extra Foods as its anchors, followed by {{the closure of the}} Liquidation World store in May 2006 (several months after Safeway's lease on the location expired), which led to a further exodus of retailers. From a high of about 45 stores and services in the 1980s, Alberni Mall approached dead mall status near the end of its function as an indoor mall as its tenant list dropped to just 4 businesses by the time of its closure - Canadian Tire, The Source, Mark's Work Wearhouse, and Solda's Restaurant, with all other businesses either relocating to the new Pacific <b>Rim</b> <b>Centre</b> or elsewhere in Port Alberni, or closing their doors altogether.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOften blood pools {{are found}} on crime scenes which may provide {{information}} concerning the events that {{took place on the}} scene. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge concerning the drying dynamics of blood pools. This study focuses on the drying process of blood pools to determine what relevant information can be obtained for the forensic application. We recorded the drying process of blood pools with a camera while measuring the mass. We found that the drying process can be separated into five different stages: coagulation, gelation, <b>rim</b> desiccation, <b>centre</b> desiccation, and final desiccation. Moreover, by normalizing the mass and drying time we show that the mass of the blood pools diminish similarly and in a reproducible way for blood pools created under various conditions. In addition, we verify that the size of the blood pools is directly related to its volume and the wettability of the surface. Our study clearly shows that blood pools dry in a reproducible fashion. This preliminary work highlights the difficult task that represents blood pool analysis in forensic investigations, and how internal and external parameters influence its dynamics. We conclude that understanding the drying process dynamics would be advancement in time line reconstitution of events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{the impact}} {{cratering}} process on icy bodies has been largely based on the most abundant ice, water. However {{little is known about}} the influence of other relatively abundant ices such as ammonia. Accordingly, data are presented studying the influence on cratering in ammonia rich ice using spherical I turn diameter stainless steel projectiles at velocities of 4. 8 +/- 0. 5 km s(- 1). The ice target composition ranged from pure water ice, to solutions containing 50 % ammonia and 50 % water by weight. Results for crater depth, diameter, volume and depth/diameter ratio are given. The results showed that the presence of ammonia in the ice had a very strong influence on crater diameter and morphology. It was found that with only a 10 % concentration of ammonia, crater diameter significantly decreased, and then at greater concentrations became independent of ammonia content. Crater depth was independent of the presence of ammonia in the ice, and the crater volume appeared to decrease as ammonia concentration increased. Between ammonia concentrations of 10 and 20 % crater morphology visibly changed from wide shallow craters with a deeper central pit to craters with a smoothly increasing depth from the crater <b>rim</b> to <b>centre.</b> Thus, a small amount of ammonia within a water ice surface may have a major effect on crater morphology...|$|R
40|$|Soil surface characteristics, such as albedo, {{moisture}} content and porosity are important factors {{of the energy}} balance and therefore critical to the ground thermal condition of permafrost regions. These surface characteristics alternate over distances of a few meters within the polygonal tundra, where water saturated peat soils are surrounded by elevated dry rims. The presented results are based upon data collected during the July and August 2007 expedition on Samoylov Island in the Lena River Delta. This study focuses upon spatial variations of the energy balance components occurring within low centre polygons which are the most dominant surface features of the investigation site. Energy balance components were recorded {{over a wide range}} of scale to gather general information about the magnitude of energy flux variations between surface units such as polygon <b>rims</b> and <b>centres.</b> Those measurements include calculations of ground heat fluxes from a dense network of continual temperature and moisture measurements immediately below the surface; variations of surface temperatures measured with a 10 m long infrared scanner system; and spectrometer measurements used to gain information about the reflectance characteristics of the different surface elements. Sensible and latent heat fluxes were detected on a larger scale of several hundreds of meters by Eddy covariance method and standard climate tower. The energy flux measurements in combination with soil thermal models give us a more detailed view of the small scale energy balance variations. First results indicate that energy balance componentssuch as ground heat flux or long wave emission can vary by a factor of two over a distance of only 5 - 10 m. These small scale variations of the energy balance should be taken into account when considering permafrost processes at regional scales...|$|R
60|$|Reconciled in the rococo, {{they now}} called a carriage, {{and went to}} visit the palace of the prince-bishops who had so well known {{how to make the}} heavenly take the image and superscription of the worldly; and they were jointly indignant to find it shut against the public in {{preparation}} for the imperialities and royalties coming to occupy it. They were in time for the noon guard-mounting, however, and Mrs. March said that the way the retiring squad kicked their legs out in the high martial step of the German soldiers was a perfect expression of the insolent militarism of their empire, and was of itself enough to make one thank Heaven that one was an American and a republican. She softened a little toward their system when it proved that the garden of the palace was still open, and yet more when she sank down upon a bench between two marble groups representing the Rape of Proserpine and the Rape of Europa. They stood each in a gravelled plot, thickly overrun by a growth of ivy, and the vine climbed the white naked limbs of the nymphs, who were present on a pretence of gathering flowers, but really to pose at the spectators, and clad them to the waist and shoulders with an effect of modesty never meant by the sculptor, but not displeasing. There was an old fountain near, its stone <b>rim</b> and <b>centre</b> of rock-work green with immemorial mould, and its basin quivering between its water-plants under the soft fall of spray. At a waft of fitful breeze some leaves of early autumn fell from the trees overhead upon the elderly pair where they sat, and a little company of sparrows came and hopped about their feet. Though the square without was so all astir with festive expectation, there were few people in the garden; three or four peasant women in densely fluted white skirts and red aprons and shawls wandered by and stared at the Europa and at the Proserpine.|$|R

On her unwounded arm the baby slept. In front of them, and unregarded, filed one by one those shadows who had drunk the day before too deeply of the waters of forgetfulness. To-day, instead, they were to drink the water of remembrance, poured out for them with no uncertain hand. And somewhere very far away, it may have been that Justice sat with her ironic smile watching men judge their shadows. She had watched them so long about that business. With her elementary idea that hares and tortoises should not be made to start from the same mark she had a little given up expecting to be asked to come and lend a hand; they had gone so far beyond her. Perhaps she knew, too, that men no longer punished, but now only reformed, their erring brothers, and this made her heart as light as the hearts of those who had been in the prisons where they were no longer punished.|$|R
40|$|Arctic {{permafrost}} {{regions are}} postulated {{to be most}} strongly affected by the on-going global warming resulting in longer summer seasons and higher temperatures. This may cause the degradation of permafrost and increase {{the thickness of the}} annual superficial thawing layer (active layer) of permafrost soils. Thereby permafrost soils may turn from carbon sinks into carbon sources for the atmosphere as large, previously frozen carbon pools become available for microbial degradation, a key factor in the soil organic matter (OM) degradation. The aim of this thesis was to investigate soil organic matter of permafrost soil to identify stabilization mechanisms, soil bacterial communities and carbon pools preferably metabolised by soil bacteria using bulk, molecular lipid-biomarker, physical fractionation and radiocarbon analysis. In temperate soils stabilization mechanism of OM, mainly organo-mineral associations and soil aggregations, are well studied by separating the OM into functional pools with different turnover rates, which are determined by their chemical properties and bioavailability. However, {{little is known about the}} quality of the soil OM, its stability and its accessibility for the microbial community in permafrost soils. The most important location for microbial metabolic activity in permafrost soils is the active layer. Therefore, this thesis concentrated on investigating different soil horizons of the active layer and the still frozen permafrost top layer of the polygonal tundra in the Siberian Lena Delta, Russia. Soil samples were predominantly taken from Samoylov Island and for the characterisation of soil bacterial communities additional samples from Kurungnakh Island were also analysed. The results show that the OM of both different cryogenic structures (polygon <b>rim</b> and <b>centre)</b> on Samoylov Island is dominated by little-decomposed, higher plant-derived material as indicated by the dominance of long-chain lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes and n-fatty acids) and high C/N ratios (16 - 51). The bulk soil OM of the active layer of the water saturated polygon centre is very young (0 to 43 cm depth: modern to 300 yrs BP) indicating that plant roots introduce modern carbon into deeper soil horizons. In contrast, the 14 C age of the bulk OM of the polygon rim increases strongly with depth in the active layer (0 to 32 cm depth: modern to 1950 yrs BP) and even further in the permafrost top layer (32 - 37 cm depth: 3050 yrs BP) suggesting a slow microbial OM degradation in this cold environment. Soil organic carbon in the polygon rim is mainly stored in the clay and fine silt sized fractions (< 6. 3 μm). These fractions are surprisingly ‘young’ with 14 C contents similar to the bulk soil values suggesting that organo-mineral associations are of little importance in the OM stabilization. Particular OM occluded in soil aggregates has increased carbon contents with depth and higher 14 C ages (55 - 3080 yrs BP) than free light particular OM (modern- 1240 yrs BP). This indicates that soil aggregation seems to be of a stabilization mechanism occurring only at greater soil depth. The living microbial soil biomass is dominated by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as indicated by the dominance of their phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers (PLFAs, membrane lipids of living microbial cells). Another bacterial biomarker are bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs), which are almost exclusively produced by bacteria. In different soil horizons on Samoylov and Kurungnakh Island the soil horizons differed in the abundances of methanotrophs, cyanobacteria, soil-marker BHP-producing bacteria and unknown BHP-producing bacteria. The greatest structural diversity and highest BHP concentrations probably indicating a great bacterial diversity and biomass were observed in the uppermost organic soil horizons (Oi) of the polygon <b>rim</b> and <b>centre.</b> It seems that several soil properties as high organic carbon content and relatively low soil pH have a positive influence on the diversity of the BHP-producing bacterial community. Microorganisms seem to predominantly metabolise the youngest, presumably labile OM pools available, as the 14 C ages of individual PLFA biomarkers were always lower than the 14 C ages of the bulk OM from which the biomarkers were isolated. It can be further suggested that the microbial utilized labile OM pools are plant-derived as the microbial PLFA biomarkers have similar 14 C ages the as long-chain (plant-derived) lipid biomarkers and the free particular organic matter (fPOM). The increasing 14 C age of microbial PLFAs with soil depths suggested that microorganisms metabolise older carbon sources in greater soil depth. However, these sources are most likely still the most labile and plantderived OM pools available as fPOM has similar 14 C ages as the PLFAs. Therefore, it is possible either that ‘old’, presumably more stable carbon pools are not in favour to microbial decomposition or are not bioavailable or are degraded by microorganism other than (aerobic) soil bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous mammary tumours {{of the rat}} {{with various}} degrees of {{malignancy}} exhibit similar tissue pH distributions. The mean pH (+/- s. d.) of dysplasia is 7. 05 +/- 0. 20. In benign tumours the mean pH is 6. 95 +/- 0. 19 and in malignant tumours it is 6. 94 +/- 0. 19. In contrast, tumours with {{the same degree of}} malignancy but different histologies show different pH distributions. Benign tumours with a higher percentage of fibrous tissue exhibit less acidic pH values than those with larger portions of epithelial cells (delta pH = 0. 38 pH units). The pH distribution in the benign tumours is independent of the tumour wet weight up to stages of very advanced growth. In the malignant tumours, a trend towards more acidic pH values is observed as the tumour mass enlarges. However, in tissue areas within a malignant tumour with gross, long-established necrosis the pH distribution is shifted towards more alkaline pH values. The pH distributions in spontaneous rat tumours are not significantly different from those obtained in isotransplanted Yoshida sarcomas (6. 87 +/- 0. 21). In the Yoshida sarcomas, mean pH values do not correlate with tumour size.

40|$|Darwin (1842) first {{described}} coral microatolls, with further accounts by various other early reef scientists (e. g., Dana, 1872; Semper, 1880). Guppy’s (1889) description of "miniature atolls" from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands first compared the living coral annulus on microatolls to the circular reef rim of coral atolls, followed by Agassiz (1895) and Krempf (1927) who referred to microatolls as "diminutive atolls" and "dwarf atolls" respectively. The specific term microatoll was coined by Wood-Jones (1910) {{who argued that}} microatolls resemble coral atolls and form because sedimentation restricts coral growth to their peripheral rim, as he proposed in his largely discounted theory of atoll formation. Abe (1937) referred to microatolls as "table-forming corals", emphasizing their flat dead tops. Patch reefs composed of multiple coral colonies with raised <b>rims</b> and sand-filled <b>centres</b> have {{been referred to as}} microatolls (e. g., Kornicker and Boyd, 1962; Larkum and Steven, 1994), but are better described as "mini-atolls" (Scheer, 1971). Thirty years ago, Scoffin and Stoddart reviewed "the nature and significance of microatolls" and recommended that only single coral colonies be described as microatolls (Scoffin and Stoddart, 1978; Stoddart and Scoffin, 1979). This has been applied with only rare exceptions. The focus of these earlier investigations was almost entirely on microatolls as high quality sea-level indicators (see Chapter Sea-Level Indicators), an application improved further by recent technological advances that have increased the resolution of elevation survey and radiometric dating. Further, exceptional palaeoenvironmental records preserved in the geochemistry and structure of microatoll skeletons are being discovered, and represent exciting new areas for research...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In prion disease, the {{peripheral}} expression of PrP(C) {{is necessary for}} the transfer of infectivity to the central nervous system. The spleen is involved in neuroinvasion and neural dissemination in prion diseases but the nature of this involvement is not known. The present study undertook the investigation of the spatial relationship between sites of PrP(Sc) accumulation, localisation of nerve fibres and PrP(C) expression in the tissue compartments of the spleen of scrapie-inoculated and control sheep. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Laser microdissection and quantitative PCR were used to determine PrP mRNA levels and results were compared with immunohistochemical protocols to distinguish PrP(C) and PrP(Sc) in tissue compartments of the spleen. In sheep experimentally infected with scrapie, the major sites of accumulation of PrP(Sc) in the spleen, namely the lymphoid nodules and the marginal zone, expressed low levels of PrP mRNA. Double immunohistochemical labelling for PrP(Sc) and the pan-nerve fibre marker, PGP, was used to evaluate the density of innervation of splenic tissue compartments and the intimacy of association between PrP(Sc) and nerves. Some nerve fibres were observed to accompany blood vessels into the PrP(Sc) -laden germinal centres. However, the close association between nerves and PrP(Sc) was most apparent in the marginal zone. Other sites of close association were adjacent to the wall of the central artery of PALS and the outer <b>rim</b> of germinal <b>centres.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The findings suggest that the degree of PrP(Sc) accumulation does not depend on the expression level of PrP(C). Though several splenic compartments may contribute to neuroinvasion, the marginal zone may {{play a central role in}} being the compartment with most apparent association between nerves and PrP(Sc) ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: A new {{software}} approach uses separately acquired CT images for attenuation correction after retrospective fusion with the SPECT data. This study evaluates {{the effect of}} this CT-based attenuation correction on indium- 111 -pentetreotide-SPECT images. Methods: Indium- 111 -pentetreofide-SPECT imaging using a dual-head gamma camera e. cam (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) as well as separate spiral computed tomography (CT) was performed in 13 patients. After fusion of SPECT and CT data, the bilinear attenuation coefficients were calculated for each pixel in the CT image volume using their Hounsfield unit values and attenuation-corrected images were reconstructed iteratively (OSEM 2 D). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on 24 suspicious foci and background, and target to background ratios were calculated for corrected (TBAC) and uncorrected (TBAC) images. The shortest distance from the centre of the lesion {{to the surface of the}} body (DS) was measured on the corresponding CT slice. Furthermore, ROls were drawn over the <b>rim</b> and the <b>centre</b> of the liver. Ratios of hepatic count rates for corrected (LRAC) and uncorrected (LRNAC) images were also compared. Results: In lesions located more centrally, TBAC was up to 52 % higher, whereas in peripherally located lesions, TBAC was up to 63 % lower than TBNAC. The TBAC/TBNAC quotient was linearly correlated with DS. In the liver, attenuation correction resulted in a 35 % increase of LRAC compared with LRNAC. Conclusions: Attenuation correction of SPECT images performed by separately acquired CT data is quick and simple. It improves the contrast between target and background for lesions located more centrally in the body and improves homogeneity of the visualisation of tracer uptake in the liver...|$|R
40|$|Structural and {{compositional}} data {{as well as}} 57 Fe Mössbauer parameters were determined on a natural Mn-rich monoclinic ilvaite crystal (ideal composition CaFe 22 +Fe 3 +Si 2 O 8 (OH)) which was used for electrical conductivity and thermopower measurements (part 2 of this paper). A zonar structure was found by electron microprobe analysis with a strong decrease in Mn concentration from the <b>rim</b> to the <b>centre</b> of the crystal in a plane perpendicular to the [001] direction. X-ray powder diffraction analysis of the most Mn-rich composition was performed. Mn 2 + cations populate preferentially M 2 sites of the ilvaite unit cell (space group P 21 /a), to a lower extent they reside on M 1 and a reduced part is on Ca sites. The monoclinic angle was determined to β= 90. 178 (4) °. The structural results are compared to literature data for other natural Mn-rich as well as low-impurity ilvaites; this concerns in particular the lattice b parameter and the undecided issue of the varying β angle. In the literature, the order parameter σ, which describes the varying degree of ordering of Fe 2 +-Fe 3 + pairs on M 11 and M 12 sites in chains running parallel to the [001] direction, and structural defects {{are thought to be}} related to β. The interrelationship between β and σ with respect to a possible twin domain structure is discussed. Various 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra were recorded between 151 K and 327 K.
