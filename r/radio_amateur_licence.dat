5000|$|The U.K. Government {{eventually}} legalised C.B. Radio, and on 2 November 1981 a C.B. {{service was}} introduced on a frequency band and offset {{that is incompatible}} with the imported American radios. At {{the same time the}} ownership of non-UK approved 27 MHz transceivers was made illegal except for those obtained by UK radio amateurs holding a UK [...] "A" [...] (HF) licence, for conversion to the 28 MHz (10 metre) amateur allocation. Given that virtually all illegal C.B. radios were contraband, this concession required the licensed amateur to pay outstanding import duty and VAT. A licence to operate these new radios became compulsory, and this could be purchased from most Post Office counters for £15. Unlike that required to qualify for a <b>radio</b> <b>amateur</b> <b>licence,</b> no proof of technical competence was needed. As of 8 December 2006, a licence is no longer required to own or operate a C.B. Radio providing it complies with one of the 3 type approval conditions currently permitted by Ofcom: FM only, 4 watts power output and operating on either or both UK and CEPT (EU) 27 MHz bands only.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the rules of}} the sport, ARDF competitions must also comply with radio regulations. Because the transmitters operate on frequencies assigned to the <b>Amateur</b> <b>Radio</b> Service, a <b>radio</b> <b>amateur</b> with a license that is valid for the country in which the competition is taking place must be present and responsible for their operation. Individual competitors, however, are generally not required to have <b>amateur</b> <b>radio</b> <b>licences,</b> as the use of simple handheld radio receivers does not typically require a license. Regulatory prohibitions on the use of <b>amateur</b> <b>radio</b> frequencies for commercial use generally preclude the awarding of monetary prizes to competitors.

5000|$|Many {{have argued}} [...] that the {{proprietary}} codec constitutes {{a form of}} encryption, and encryption is prohibited by almost every country's <b>amateur</b> <b>radio</b> <b>licence</b> conditions. According to FCC rules, if the algorithm is publicly published or otherwise widely available enough that transmissions are not secret, it is considered encoding rather than encryption. Unfortunately D-STAR uses AMBE, a non public codec. However, French regulators, in April 2010, have issued a statement that rules D-STAR illegal in France, due {{to the ability to}} create a connection to the internet with it and the proprietary nature of the codec used. The French <b>Amateur</b> <b>Radio</b> society, DR@F - Digital Radioamateur France has an online petition against this ruling, calling for the government to allow the mode, as to ban it would deny them 'fundamental rights'.|$|R
