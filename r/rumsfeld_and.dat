5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>and</b> his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2005, Brown, {{together}} with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald <b>Rumsfeld,</b> <b>and</b> Marine Corps Commandant General Michael Hagee announced {{the creation of}} the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). Prior to the creation of MARSOC, the Marine Corps had not been involved in special operations, which were conducted by Army, Navy and Air Force units assigned to U.S. Special Operations Command. After the September 11 attacks, the Secretary of Defense had directed the Marine Corps and Brown's predecessor to work closer together in the Global War on Terror. This culminated in the creation of MCSOCOM Detachment One on June 19, 2003, shortly before Brown took command of USSOCOM. It was nearly three years later on February 24, 2006, when MARSOC was activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|In House Armed Services Committee hearings, Taylor was sharply {{critical}} of Secretary of Defense Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>and</b> other administration witnesses, particularly regarding shortages of armor for troops and vehicles in Iraq.

25|$|Because Powell {{was seen}} as more {{moderate}} than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>and</b> Paul Wolfowitz. At times, infighting among the Powell-led State Department, the Rumsfeld-led Defense Department, and Cheney's office {{had the effect of}} polarizing the administration on crucial issues, such as what actions to take regarding Iran and North Korea.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{assuming}} office, Ford inherited Nixon's Cabinet, although Ford quickly replaced Chief of Staff Alexander Haig with Donald Rumsfeld, who {{had served}} as Counselor to the President and ambassador to NATO under Nixon. <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>and</b> Deputy Chief of Staff Dick Cheney quickly became among the most influential people in the Ford administration. Ford also appointed Edward H. Levi as Attorney General, charging Levi with cleaning up a Justice Department that had been politicized to unprecedented levels during the Nixon administration.|$|E

500|$|Kirchner took {{a pragmatic}} {{approach}} to Argentine foreign policy, and Argentina–United States relations did not continue the special {{relations of the}} 1990s. Chancellor Rafael Bielsa called {{the relationship between the}} countries [...] "cooperation without cohabitation" [...] in contrast to that of the Menem era, which was known as [...] "carnal relations". Kirchner opposed the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas, as it was based on majority rule among all the countries of the Americas, whereas he preferred a proportional representation system that would have given the Mercosur bloc more influence. The 4th Summit of the Americas, hosted in Mar del Plata, ended with violent protests against U.S. President George W. Bush; negotiations stalled, and the FTAA was not implemented. Kirchner told the United Nations that, although he opposed terrorism, he did not support the War on Terror. He refused to receive U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald <b>Rumsfeld,</b> <b>and</b> sent forces to the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti.|$|E
