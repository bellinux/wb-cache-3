When he had a test, he would take it twice and then turn it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student <b>rolls.</b> <b>In</b> 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered Burdell membership.|$|E

Honour <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> Canada were very popular, particularly immediately after the end of the war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the number of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E

5|$|DeVeber did {{not serve}} long either as {{minister}} or Member of the Legislative Assembly: having received word {{that he was to}} be appointed to the Senate, he resigned from cabinet on March 1, 1906—exactly four months after his appointment—and from the legislature March 7. He formally began his term as Senator the next day. His time as an MLA was so short he did not sign the <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> the Alberta Legislature and was never sworn in.|$|E
5|$|In the book's opening, {{the title}} {{character}} and her mate ambush a herd of Astrodon, which are large herbivorous sauropods. The Astrodon are surprised, thinking that their bulk deters smaller predators. Utahraptor, however, are much larger than any resident raptor, and proceed to take down an Astrodon with teamwork. When Red's mate climbs onto the dead Astrodon, the corpse <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> the mud, trapping the male under {{the bulk of the}} animal. Despite Red's best efforts, her mate suffocates. Despondent, Red wanders around the floodplain, nearly starving since a Utahraptor cannot successfully hunt big game on its own.|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{were done}} at round gold wires of 0, 9 mm in diameter, used in jewelry making, from Au 585 alloy (58, 5 %Au, Ag, Cu and Zn). These cold drawn wires was cold <b>rolled</b> <b>in</b> two rolling {{programmes}} to various heights without any intermediate annealing on a two-high rolling stand with plain rolls of 180 mm in diameter. In first programme, the wires were <b>rolled</b> <b>in</b> several passes, with single height reductions of about 30 %, while in second one the rolling {{was carried out}} with maximal reduction only. Rolling speed was constant at all passes. It vas noted that more significant increase in widening, at samples <b>rolled</b> <b>in</b> a single pass, was at height reductions over 70 %, while at samples <b>rolled</b> <b>in</b> several passes significant increase in widening took place at high reductions of 80 % and over. Greater widening was obtained at rolling wires with maximal reduction only in comparison to wires <b>rolled</b> <b>in</b> several passes with small single reductions...|$|R

The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to search through <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> search of better specimens.

These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
5|$|First, the High Court held, upon an {{examination}} of section 3 of the UPA and section 24(1) of the SA, {{that there was no}} express requirement for the Minister to have given the affected parties a right to be heard before the orders were made. Further, {{there was no room for}} the appellants' contention that the principles of natural justice had to be complied with fully. The orders had been made with respect to both the public interest and the public order, and their objective was clearly the preservation of national security. The Court affirmed the conclusion of Lord Denning, the Master of the <b>Rolls,</b> <b>in</b> R. v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex parte Hosenball (1977) that in such situations the ordinary principles of natural justice have to be modified to accommodate the public interest.|$|E

5|$|Gotland, {{as a free}} {{republic}} loosely {{associated with}} the Swedish crown, had already borne a ram with a banner (Agnus Dei) as a well-known city seal by 1280. Although the island belonged to Denmark at the time, its arms were present at Gustav Vasa's funeral procession in 1560; the arms of Gotland disappeared from the Swedish <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> 1570 but returned with the transfer of Gotland to Sweden in 1645.

5|$|From {{an early}} period, the Court was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees {{of the court}} and orders; their books documented the legal precedent set by the court. At the same time, two Examiners were appointed to assist the Master of the <b>Rolls</b> <b>in</b> examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of the court. In 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court. With the backlog growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, there could be no replacements. With the dissolution of the Court in 1873, the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{was named}} Lord Chancellor of England on 17 May 1226. The {{appointment}} {{was made by}} the great council during the minority of King Henry III, and Neville obtained a grant of the office for life. Unlike Hubert de Burgh, who lost his offices when Henry III attained his majority and took control of the government, Neville remained chancellor with only slight disagreements until 1238, although a confirmation of the lifetime nature of his tenure was made in 1232. Under Neville, the first signs that the chancery was becoming a department of the government, rather than just a royal department {{that was part of the}} royal household, began to emerge. The contemporary writer Matthew Paris praised Neville for his actions as chancellor, claiming that he treated all equally and was transparent in discharging his duties, which was important, as the chancellor's office controlled access to the king. Neville oversaw a number of changes in chancery procedures, splitting off the liberate rolls from the letters close in 1226 and reviving the keeping of the Charter <b>Rolls</b> <b>in</b> 1227. He also issued writs on his own authority, the so-called writs de cursu. Neville received a number of gifts and privileges from the king while chancellor, including the right of exemption from the seizure of his possessions by any royal or other secular official. The king also agreed not to interfere with the execution of Neville's last will and testament.|$|E
