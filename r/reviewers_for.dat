5|$|Mango Yellow {{received}} several awards at various film festivals, both in Brazil and abroad, including Festival de Brasília and the Berlin Film Festival. The film was generally praised by domestic <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> its characters, soundtrack, cinematography, and depictions of Brazil, while English-speaking critics were more mixed in their response.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E

5|$|MediEvil 2 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release. The game was mostly praised for its rich, detailed graphics but was criticised by many <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> its bad camera angles, easy difficulty and {{for being too}} similar to the first game. The game received an aggregate score of 79% from GameRankings, slightly lower than its predecessor. At the 2000 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, MediEvil 2 won the best console game category.|$|E
5|$|The King's Speech premiered on 6 September 2010 at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States, and was {{released}} in the UK on 7 January 2011. The film grossed a worldwide total {{at the box office}} of over $414 million on a production budget of £8 million ($15 million). After five weeks on UK release, it was identified as the most successful independent British film ever. It appeared in the Top Ten lists of more than twenty <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> the best films of 2010.|$|E
5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>reviewer</b> <b>for</b> The Guardian {{praised the}} Festival d'Avignon production, {{describing}} it as [...] "electrifying theatre". A <b>reviewer</b> <b>for</b> La Croix praised the writing, acting, and staging. Reviews of the Avignon production for Le Monde and Les Echos were also positive. The <b>reviewer</b> <b>for</b> Télérama gave a negative review to the Avignon production, calling the source material inferior and {{complaining about the}} use of video screens on the set. A review for La Terrasse complimented the staging and acting of the Odéon production.|$|R
5|$|The soundtracks {{for both}} {{releases}} {{of the game}} were well received by critics. Uematsu's mix of orchestral and rock tracks for XIV were praised, though the delayed release of a full album drew criticism. Soken's work on A Realm Reborn, including both his original tracks as well as themes carried over from XIV and previous Final Fantasy games, were heavily praised by <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> the game. Music from the initial release of the game has been played in the international Distant Worlds Final Fantasy concert series, and books of sheet music for piano arrangements of music from the game have been produced.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting {{stemmed from}} the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would they use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> uniqueness and detail.|$|E
5|$|Yotsuba&! {{has been}} popular with readers {{as well as}} <b>reviewers.</b> <b>For</b> example, on Amazon.co.jp, volume six was the third best-selling comic in Japan {{for the first half}} of 2007 and volume eight was the second best-selling comic in Japan for 2008; volumes seven and eight both were number two on the Tohan comics chart the week they debuted. Volume eight sold more than 450,000 copies in 2008, making it one of the top 50 bestselling manga volumes on the Oricon chart for the year. The first five volumes of the English {{translation}} were each among the top 100 selling graphic novels in the United States in the month of release. Volume six of the English edition reached number 3 on the New York Times best seller list for manga, and it stayed on the list for four weeks. Volume 8 debuted at No. 2 on the manga best seller list.|$|E

5|$|Starship Troopers {{brought to}} an end Heinlein's series of {{juvenile}} novels. It became one of his best-selling books, and is considered his most widely known work. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and garnered praise from <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military, an aspect described as propaganda and likened to recruitment. The ideology of militarism {{and the fact that}} only military veterans had the right to vote in the novel's fictional society led to it being frequently described as fascist. This description is disputed, some commentators arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein's depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers have said that the terms used to describe the aliens were akin to racial epithets.|$|E
25|$|The Challenger {{design has}} been criticized by <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> its landing gear, which is a rigid cable-braced type and is subject to being bent during hard landings. A number of {{after-market}} suppliers have designed steel gear legs as replacements for the stock landing gear {{in an attempt to}} rectify this problem. The improved factory-designed Light Sport Special (LSS) model incorporates revised landing gear to address this deficiency.|$|E

I have pruned the double-epithets with no sparing hand; and used my best efforts to tame the swell and glitter both of thought and diction.|$|E

500|$|The {{tutorial}} {{was criticized}} by <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> different reasons. Tom Hoggins for The Telegraph described the tutorial as being [...] "mind-numbing". The <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> Metros Game Central {{wrote that the}} tutorial was the most notable part of the game, though ultimately nonessential. They wrote that because of its length {{it may have been}} an [...] "attempt to protect [...] from the awful reality of the real game". Ellie Gibson of Eurogamer described it as being [...] "the most boring tutorial sequence {{in the history of the}} world". Jamin Smith of VideoGamer.com criticized the tutorial for [...] "insisting on explaining each and every move in the game before forcing you to repeat it three times".|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} {{praise from}} <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> its cartoon-like style, its colorful, outlandish opponents, simple gameplay controls, and replay value. The game also featured colorful, detailed graphics, {{which included the}} usage of transparency that facilitates the game's [...] "behind the back" [...] perspective. Other reviewers had said that this game lacked the overall appeal, gameplay, or audience of its predecessor.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>reviewer</b> <b>for</b> PC World {{stated that}} [...] "overall, the game looks terrific" [...] {{and had the}} [...] "typical alpha bugs" [...] of an alpha release, with the game holding promise. A <b>reviewer</b> <b>for</b> Joystiq praised the {{character}} personalization, saying there were more options than they expected and the gameplay would be easy for experienced gamers to understand. Another <b>reviewer</b> <b>for</b> Joystiq commented {{that one of the}} game's biggest dangers comes from other players, with the game currently not having any rules or policing regarding the PvP element and hacking.|$|R
500|$|Since airing, [...] "Homer The Whopper" [...] has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Steve Fritz of Newsarama called the episode [...] "amazing" [...] and {{commented that the}} [...] "overall comic book theme was perfect." [...] <b>Reviewers</b> <b>for</b> TV Guide cited Matt Groening's cameo, the dinner table scene, Homer {{trying to lose weight}} at the Kwik-E-Mart, and the opening scene where Bart questions Comic Book Guy about Spider-Man as the highlights of the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} well {{received}} and was praised by <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> its clarity.

500|$|The album {{confirmed}} Harrison's {{status as}} the most commercially successful ex-Beatle, but it drew criticism from some <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> the number of slow songs among its eleven tracks, {{as well as the}} perceived preachy tone of Harrison's lyrics. According to author Michael Frontani, lines such as [...] "My life belongs to me" [...] in [...] "Who Can See It" [...] "betrayed sentiments of a man increasingly at odds … with fans and critics who wanted him to be 'Beatle George,' or at least to be less fixated on his spirituality".|$|E
