40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the channel utilization ratio (CUR) on the performance of ad hoc wireless networks. Given that a node can hold a multi-hop route for a time interval defined as reserved channel utilization interval (RCUI), we assume that the node effectively utilizes the <b>reserved</b> <b>route</b> for an interval defined as effective channel utilization interval (ECUI), the duration of which corresponds to the duration of the message to be transmitted. This models a realistic scenario, where a node may use the shared radio medium for only a portion of the reservation interval. Defining the CUR as the ratio between the RCUI duration and the ECUI duration, we develop an analytical framework which leads to the evaluation of the “optimal ” CUR for the maximization of the effective transport capacity, a concept recently introduced by the authors and representing the actual bandwidth-distance product carried by the network.

Given that a node can hold a multi-hop route for a time interval defined as reserved channel utilization interval (RCUI), we assume that the node effectively utilizes the <b>reserved</b> <b>route</b> for an interval defined as effective channel utilization interval (ECUI), the duration of which corresponds to the duration of the message to be transmitted. This models a realistic scenario, where a node may use the shared radio medium for only a portion of the reservation interval. Defining the CUR as the ratio between the durations of the RCUI and the ECUI, we develop a combinatorial framework which leads to the optimization of the CUR for maximizing the effective transport capacity, which represents the actual bandwidth-distance product carried by the network. We also show that the way, either continuous or discontinuous, in which a node transmits its message entails minor performance differences, indicating clearly that the CUR is a meaningful network performance indicator. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA general {{approach}} is presented for handling the following inverse optimization problem: given solutions to {{each member of}} a family of combinatorial optimization tasks on a common underlying set, find a positive linear objective function (weighting) on the common underlying set that simultaneously makes each solution optimal in its own optimization task. Our motivation stems from the inverse shortest path problem that is made practically important in high-speed telecommunication networks by the Asynchronous Transfer Mode Forum's Private Network–Network Interface architecture, in which route finding can be based on administrative weights. Different variants of the problem are investigated, including uniqueness requirements and <b>reserve</b> <b>routes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, a newly bolted {{route is}} {{considered}} [...] "red tagged," [...] and ethics dictate {{that the person}} who bolted the route should be the only climber to attempt it until they have made a free ascent (a continuous roped ascent, made using only hands and feet, unaided - yet protected - by the bolts, quickdraws or rope). This is because equipping a new route is an expensive & time-consuming endeavor for the person who finds it. Other times, the bolter will allow the route they developed to become an [...] "open project" [...] that anyone can try. Ascents of <b>reserved</b> <b>routes</b> have led to a number of controversies in the sport climbing world.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the bandwidth reservation {{problem in a}} mobile ad hoc network (MANET) to support QoS (quality-of-service) routing. We approach this problem by assuming a common channel shared by all hosts under a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) channel model. Existing solutions have addressed this problem by assuming a stronger multi-antenna model [3], [6], where the bandwidth of a link is independent of the transmitting/receiving activities of its neighboring links, or a less stronger CDMA-over-TDMA channel model [7], where {{the use of a}} time slot on a link is only dependent of the status of its one-hop neighboring links. While more practical and less costly, using a TDMA model needs to face the challenge of radio interference problems. In this paper, we propose a new protocol that can <b>reserve</b> <b>routes</b> by addressing both the hidden-terminal and exposed-terminal problems. The protocol can conduct accurate bandwidth calculation while performing route discovery. Simulation results are presented to verify how this new protocol performs...|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} reasons for {{constructing}} the railway. The original main line {{to the north of}} Sweden ran relatively near the east coast, but inland communications were poor to non-existent; the inland regions, rich in natural resources (mainly timber) needed opening up. However, there was a strategic aspect to be considered; should Sweden be invaded from the east (which at the time was a serious possibility) the belligerents would certainly try to cut the main line to the north as quickly as possible; thus a second <b>reserve</b> <b>route</b> further inland was deemed highly important. In 1907 the Riksdag decided that the first link between Östersund and Ulriksfors was to be built. The next stage Ulriksfors-Volgsjö (today Vilhelmina) was conceived in 1911; the year after that the Sveg-Brunflo stage was given the go ahead. The northernmost stage Vilhelmina-Gällivare was given the go-ahead in 1917. Finally, by purchasing the private railway lines between Sveg and Kristinehamn the entire 1288 km stretch stood clear.|$|R
