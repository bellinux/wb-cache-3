40|$|According to the Paris Agreement, China has the {{ambition}} to develop non-fossil energy which {{will account for}} 20 % of the total energy consumption in 2030. China has abundant biomass potential implying the bioenergy should be an important option of non-fossil energy. In this analysis, we present an representative biogas project (the Deqingyuan project, DQY) in Beijing and conduct a cost-benefit analysis for the whole value chain. DQY is the first large-scale biogas project in China that utilizes 100 % chicken manure as a feedstock and integrates biogas production with ecological agriculture using advanced technologies. DQY uses 80, 000 t of chicken manure and 100, 000 t of sewage each year to produce biogas, which generates 14 million KWh of power annually, and obtains an additional revenue of RMB 8 million yuan each year through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Operating {{as an example of}} a sustainable bioenergy model, DQY accomplishes the full use of a <b>recycled</b> <b>resource</b> while showing consideration for animal welfare during the entire production, which is a fundamental component of the new rural energy strategy. The circular economy model of DQY plays a prominent role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating pollution, and increasing employment, among other benefits. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the typical demonstration model (DQY) in utilization of agricultural waste in China, and further proposes a general development model of Chinese biogas in the future...|$|E
40|$|Proper {{utilization}} of livestock manure {{is a major}} environmental concern. Livestock manure has typically been considered a ‘waste product’ of livestock production. A more accurate name for this material is a ‘recycled resource’ from the production of livestock. By managing livestock manure, the producer has {{a second chance to}} utilize the nutrients that have already been paid for but not fully utilized by the animal. Collecting, containing, and properly spreading livestock manure will incur additional costs for the producer. However, these costs can be offset or justified by the producer in terms of the yield enhancement and nutrient credits that occur when manure is utilized as a resource. This book covers the land application part of manure management. With increasing regulations, the livestock producer needs to understand the scientific principles that affect manure transformations and how to use these principles to manage the manure for maximum fertilizer value with minimal environmental impact. Improved land application of manure is one part of the solution, but we suggest that the producer evaluate the quantity of nutrients arriving on the farm as feed, animals, and fertilizer compared to the total that is exported. Achieving a nutrient balance will reduce potential environmental hazards often associated with animal agriculture. As the producer begins to think of manure as a resource, rather than as a waste product, it is critical that one understands what quantities of nutrients are available and what effect different manure storage and handling practices have on the nutrient availability of the <b>recycled</b> <b>resource.</b> This publication explains the basic principles related to manure nutrient utilization. In addition, sources and management of odors generated on livestock facilities will be discussed. While odors from livestock production are unavoidable and currently unregulated by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ), they have been the driving force behind recent changes in environmental laws. Nebraska state law and regulations require specific plans and recordkeeping in order to operate a permitted livestock feeding operation. This book explains land application principles and procedures and is a companion publication to a series of workbooks that contain suggested worksheets, forms, and other publications that assist with compliance of Nebraska land application regulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{questions for the}} thesis were: How the existing economic models based on Romer's (1990) endogenous research and development (R&D) growth model could be extended {{to be able to}} research the optimal allocation of R&D resources? What are the most significant factors affecting on the R&D sector investment allocation? A literature review on the existing resource economics and backstop substitution models was introduced. In order to put this thesis in context {{a closer look at the}} historical development of the substitution technologies, theoretical concepts and resource economics theory was taken from the early 1900 century to this day. In focus was especially recent literature with economic models with similar characteristics as in the model constructed here, most notably models derived from Romer (1990). Some of the literature was also used as a reference for the results part of the thesis. The purpose of this thesis was to construct a framework for economic model with four sectors. The model is a discrete time model that is constructed so that the primary resources (non-renewable and renewable) are competitors for the secondary <b>recycled</b> <b>resources</b> as the input for the final production. The use of each resource is determined by the marginal cost of production. As the non-renewable resource becomes scarcer and their price increases, the investments in R&D sector increases as the possibilities for substitution increases as the increasing capital base increases the resource utilization level which increases the possibilities for substitution for backstop resources. Meanwhile the increasing technological level decreases efficiency of technological improvement. We have four resource stocks that can be utilized at different steps of the production process as raw materials for the production. These include the non-renewable resources that can be substituted with renewable resources as raw materials to the system. There are the waste and resources-in-use stocks that are dependent on the production volumes. The model is structured on the basis of four sectors, two industrial sectors and two technology sectors. This approach is different from commonly used three sectors model with two industries and one technology. The non-renewable resources can be substituted by renewable resources through substitution technology R&D. On the other hand the waste associated with depreciation of resources-in-use, which also causes harm to renewable resources, can be substituted by <b>recycled</b> <b>resources</b> through recycling technology R&D. The <b>recycled</b> <b>resources</b> are secondary resource base that can replace a part of primary natural virgin resources consumption. The model has intermediate sector producing intermediate goods from natural resources. The intermediate sector is using technology licenses bought from the substitution technology sector to replace a part of non-renewable resource use. The final product sector is producing the final goods for consumption and capital by utilizing labor, capital and intermediate sector production and <b>recycled</b> <b>resources</b> for which the recycling technology sector sells licenses. The basic inputs for the system are capital, resources and labor. The questions of sustainable steady state growth path and optimal resource allocation are only discussed but not solved in this thesis. The most remarkable results from the model are that the R&D resource allocation in equilibrium is mainly dependent on the volumes and the price changes in different sectors...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 Production {{and use of}} {{bio-based}} products offer {{a number}} of advantages over conventional petrochemicals, yet the relatively high cost of production has restricted their mainstream adoption. Optimization of waste treatment processes could reduce capital expenditures, lowering the barrier to market entry for lignocellulosic biorefineries. This paper characterizes waste production from lignocellulosic ethanol production and analyzes potential wastewater treatment operations. It is found that organic material is intrinsic to bioconversion wastes, supplying up to 260 kilograms of biological oxygen demand per tonne of feedstock. Inorganic material, however, is largely added to waste streams throughout the bioconversion process {{as a result of}} pretreatment and pH adjustment operations which increase the inorganic loading by 44 kilograms per tonne of feedstock. Adjusting unit operations to limit addition of inorganic material can reduce the demands and therefore cost of waste treatment. Various waste treatment technologies – including those that take advantage of ecosystem services provided by feedstock production – are evaluated in terms of capital and operating costs, as well as technical feasibility. It is concluded that waste treatment technologies may be better integrated with conversion processes and even feedstock production. In general, there should be an effort to <b>recycle</b> <b>resources</b> throughout the bioenergy supply chain through application of ecosystem services provided by adjacent feedstock plantations and recovery of resources from the waste stream to reduce overall capital and operating costs of bioconversion facilities...|$|R

40|$|Superscalar {{architectures}} {{have been}} proposed that exploit control independence, reducing the performance penalty of branch mispredictions by preserving the work of future mispredictionindependent instructions. The essential goal of exploiting control independence is to completely decouple future mispredictionindependent instructions from deferred misprediction-dependent instructions. Current implementations fall short of this goal because they explicitly maintain program order among misprediction-independent and misprediction-dependent instructions. Explicit approaches sacrifice design efficiency and ultimately performance. We observe it is sufficient to emulate program order. Potential misprediction-dependent instructions are singled out a priori and their unchanging source values are checkpointed. These instructions and values are set aside as a “recovery program”. Checkpointed source values break the data dependencies with comingled misprediction-independent instructions – now long since gone from the pipeline – achieving the essential decoupling objective. When the mispredicted branch resolves, recovery is achieved by fetching the self-sufficient, condensed recovery program. Recovery is effectively transparent to the pipeline, in that speculative state is not rolled back and recovery appears as a jump to code. A coarse-grain retirement substrate permits the relaxed order between the decoupled programs. Transparent control independence (TCI) yields a highly streamlined pipeline that quickly <b>recycles</b> <b>resources</b> based on conventional speculation, enabling a large window with small cycle-critical resources, and prevents many mispredictions from disrupting this large window. TCI achieves speedups as high as 64 % (16 % average) and 88 % (22 % average) for 4 -issue and 8 -issue pipelines, respectively, among 15 SPEC integer benchmarks.
