[...] He also recommended against the creation of a government program to investigate UFO reports. He also described the problem that confronts the scientific community, that each scientist must evaluate the record for himself, and that the Reports recommendation against further research [...] "may not be true for all time." [...] He advised that government agencies and private foundations [...] "ought to be willing to consider UFO research proposals...on an open-minded, unprejudiced basis....ach individual case ought to be carefully considered on its own merits."

40|$|Abstract—In IEEE 802. 16 j networks, <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> {{interference}} between wireless links must {{be taken}} into account when radio resources are assigned to network links. The protocol model, which defines the transmission and interference ranges as circles, is well-known as one of the major radio interference models. Although a lot of related studies on IEEE 802. 16 j networks use the protocol model, they do not consider the presence of obstacles. In this paper, we first investigate the performance of IEEE 802. 16 j networks considering the effect of obstacles. For that purpose, we define an obstacle model and extended protocol model for accommodating obstacles, where <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> <b>propagation</b> is obstructed by obstacles. Next, the performance of IEEE 802. 16 j networks is evaluated through simulation experiments using the obstacle model and the extended protocol model. Additionally, we present a method for estimating the performance of IEEE 802. 16 j networks with obstacles. Then, we use multiple regression analysis based on simulation results and construct regression equations for network service ratio and power-to-throughput ratio. By evaluating the accuracy of the developed equations based on real-world environment, we confirm that the service ratio can be estimated with a high degree of accuracy when the distribution density of obstacle is small.

40|$|Present {{framework}} is established {{to deal with}} the refractivity variations normally affected the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> <b>propagation</b> at different frequencies, ranges and different environments. To deal such kind of effects, many researchers proposed several methodologies. One method is to use the parameters from meteorology to investigate these effects of variations in refractivity on propagation. These variations are region specific and we have selected a region of one kilometer height over the English Channel. We have constructed different modified refractivity profiles based on the local meteorological data. We have recorded more than 48 â¯million received signal strength from a communication links of 50 â¯km operating at 2015 â¯MHz in the Ultra High Frequency band giving path loss between transmitting and receiving stations of the experimental setup. We have used parabolic wave equation method to simulate an hourly value of signal strength and compared the obtained simulated loss to the experimental loss. The analysis is made to compute refractivity distribution of standard (STD) and ITU (International Telecommunication Union) refractivity profiles for various evaporation ducts. It is found that a standard refractivity profile is better than the ITU refractivity profiles for the region at 2015 â¯MHz. Further, it is inferred from the analysis of results that 10 â¯m evaporation duct height is the dominant among all evaporation duct heights considered in the research.

30|$|The {{techniques}} {{based on}} the transionospheric <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> <b>propagation,</b> in particular satellite navigation signals, are effectively used for monitoring and investigation of the main parameters of the ionospheric plasma irregularities. It is known that radio signals passing through the ionosphere suffer varying degrees of rapid variations of their amplitude and phase signal fluctuations, referred to as scintillations, created by random fluctuations of the medium’s refractive index, caused by plasma density gradients inside the ionosphere (e.g., Tsunoda et al. 1985; Basu et al. 1988; Aarons 1997; Prikryl et al. 2012). At high latitudes, these gradients are mostly caused by plasma processes associated with dynamic auroral processes, such as energetic particle precipitation and high-speed plasma convection (Keskinen and Ossakow 1983). Many researchers have used GPS signals to study ionospheric processes (e.g., Pi et al. 1997; Aarons and Lin 1999; Valladares et al. 2004; Jakowski et al. 2008, 2012; Tiwari et al. 2013; Prikryl et al. 2014; Cherniak and Zakharenkova 2015; van der Meeren et al. 2014; Jacobsen and Andalsvik 2016).

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the Doppler frequencies, eikonal acceleration, and refractive attenuations of the direct and reflected signals are established for bistatic and radio occultation experiments. These connections allow recalculating the Doppler shifts and the phase delays to the refractive attenuation (reflectivity cross section) and open {{a new avenue for}} potentially measuring the total absorption in the atmosphere at low elevation angles. The fundamental characteristics of bistatic remote sensing of the atmosphere and Earth&# 039;s surface such as the phase delay, reflection coefficient, reflectivity cross section, and Doppler shift of the reflected signals relative to the direct signals are obtained in analytical forms by taking into account the refraction and absorption effects in the atmosphere. Difference in the Doppler frequencies of the reflected and direct signals is proportional to the difference of the modified refractive index at the radio ray perigee and at the Earth&# 039;s surface. The obtained analytical results are in good agreement with the measurements data obtained during the MIR/GEO (wavelengths 2 and 32 cm), and CHAMP (wavelengths 19 and 24 cm) radio occultation experiments. Detecting the reflected signals in radio occultation data has opened new perspectives for bistatic monitoring of the atmosphere and Earth&# 039;s surface at low elevation angles.
