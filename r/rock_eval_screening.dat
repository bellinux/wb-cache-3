However, to decode this information {{it is necessary to}} know how the lake in question and its catchment area function. In this study we propose to highlight the different factors that govern sedimentation by studying different core samples covering the Holocene taken from lake Ossa, Cameroon. To do this we chose to use organic matter as a tracer of changes in sedimentation by coupling two complementary methods : spectrophotometry for color measurement and <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> pyrolysis for bulk geochemical analysis. Spectrophotometry is used classically to quantify color and obtain data very rapidly, at very high resolution and non-destructively. <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> data give geochemical indication on organic matter composition. Thus, it was possible to highlight different types of organic matter at different stages of transformation, including different sources that can be responsible of this transformation (distal, proximal, autochtonous). The synthesis of this information led to the formulation of a scenario of how Lake Ossa was filled. Although this lake had already been used for paleoclimatic/environmental purposes, we show here that most of the forcing responsible for the sedimentation in the lake was due to the paleotopography and the rise in the lake level during the Holocene.

This should reconsider the sequence stratigraphic framework and its associated paleoenvironmental setting. The palynological and geochemical aspects of the organic rich beds from the Duwi Formation conducted on six phosphate mines in the Eastern Desert of Egypt are reported in the present study and they were used to investigate the paleoenvironmental settings that existed during its deposition. The palynomorph assemblages were dominated by moderately diverse and abundant dinoflagellates and in El-Nakheil, Wasif, Umm Hueitat and Mohamed Rabah mines and generally scarce palynomorph assemblages were generally detected at El-Beida and Younis mines. The dinoflagellates are mainly peridinioids, namely; Alterbidinium acutulum, Cerodinium obliquipes, Palaeocystodinium australinum and Phelodinium tricuspis, in addition to some gonyaulacoid such as Kleithriasphaeridium readei, Hystrichosphaeridium sp. A, Hystrichosphaeridium sp. B and Spiniferites supparus. These dinoflagellate assemblages are indicating Late Campanian–Early Maastrichtian age. The palynofacies analysis revealed enrichments with amorphous organic matter (AOM) at El-Nakheil and El-Beida mines, while the phytoclasts enrichments were found to be at the Younis mine. The enriched AOM samples are of Type I and II oil prone kerogen while the enriched phytoclasts are of Type III gas prone kerogen.

The most probable cause of these variations is a great instability of the lake level during this period.

Using a 25 ml Hastalloy vessel, the source rocks were pyrolysed at low (180 and 245 bar) and high (500, 700 and 900 bar) water pressure hydrous conditions at 350 °C and 380 °C for between 6 and 24 h.

However, oil yield and VR were reduced by 47 % and 0. 3 % Ro respectively, and <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> HI was also higher by 28 mg/g at 900 bar compared with 245 bar at 12 h. The huge decrease in gas and oil yields and the VR observed with an increase in water pressure at 350 °C for 24 h and 380 °C for 12 h (maximum oil generation) were also observed for all other times and temperatures investigated for the KCF and the Monterey shale. This shows that high water pressure significantly retards petroleum generation and source rock maturation. The retardation of oil generation and expulsion resulted in significant amounts of bitumen and oil being retained in the rocks pyrolysed at high pressures, suggesting that pressure is a possible mechanism for retaining petroleum (bitumen and oil) in source rocks. This retention of petroleum within the rock provides a mechanism for oil-prone source rocks to become potential shale gas reservoirs. The implications from this study are that in geological basins, pressure, temperature and time will all exert significant control on the extent of petroleum generation and source rock maturation for Type II source rocks, and that the petroleum retained in the rocks at high pressures may explain in part why oil-prone source rocks contain the most prolific shale gas resources...|$|R

These two findings demonstrate that sulphurization of organic matter may also occur in lacustrine sediments provided that sulphate is supplied by external sources. Data on the third kerogen sample (Cerdanya) suggest that the freshwater alga Pediastrum may contain a (partly) aromatic biomacromolecule that is selectively preserved upon diagenesis. These findings testify to the large variability in palaeodepositional conditions in lacustrine environments. A comparison of the biomarker composition of the extract of the Ribesalbes oil shale with the kerogen composition indicate that biomarkers often cannot be {{used to assess the}} major sources of organic matter in such settings. A similar conclusion can be drawn from a comparison of literature data concerning the Messel Oil Shale...|$|R

GEOCHEMICAL METHODS ARE APPLIED FOR THE DETERMINATIONS, AS <b>ROCK</b> <b>EVAL</b> PYROLYSIS, MICROSCOPIC DETERMINATION OF THE VITRINITE REFLECTANCE (RO), EXTRACTION-HYDROCARBON SEPARATION, GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY OF SATURATED HYDROCARBONS, BIOMARKERS AND CARBON 'ISOTOPES' DETERMINATION, AND BASIN MODELS FOR MATURITY DETERMINATION. FROM THE STUDY 5 SOURCE ROCK HORIZONS ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE ALPINE FORMATIONS OF IONIAN ZONE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ARE THE TRIASSIC SHALES, THE LOWER POSIDONIA BEDS (TROARCIAN-AALENIAN) AND THE VIGLA SHALES (CENOMANIAN-TURONIAN). ONE SOURCE HORIZON THERE IS UPPER JURASSIC OF PREAPOYLIAN, WHILE IN GAVROVO NO SOURCE ROCKS ARE FOUND. THE ORGANIC MATTER MATURATION IS LOCATED IN GREAT DEPTHS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL PARTS ΟF THE BASINS, DUE TO LOW GEOTHERMAL GRADIENTS. AS A RESULT,RELATIVELY LOW OIL QUANTITIES ARE GENERATED IN SOME BASINS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT FAVORS THE OIL PRESERVATION IN REASONABLE DEPTHS UNDER THE EVAPORITES. THE OIL GENERATION FOR THE MAIN SOURCE ROCK HORIZONS BEGINS AFTER THE OROGENETIC MOVEMENTS AND FAVORS THE MIGRATION- ACCUMULATION OF THE OIL.

40|$|The Arabian Sea {{represents}} {{a prime example}} of an open ocean extended oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) with low oxygen concentrations (down to less than 2  µM) between 200 and 1000  m water depth. The OMZ impinges on the ocean floor, affecting organic matter (OM) mineralization. We investigated impact of oxygen depletion on the composition of macromolecular OM (MOM) along a transect through the OMZ on the slopes of the Murray Ridge. This sub-marine high in the northern Arabian Sea, with the top at approximately 500  m below sea surface (mbss), intersects the OMZ. We analyzed sediments deposited in the core of OMZ (suboxic conditions), directly below the OMZ (dysoxic conditions) and well below the OMZ (fully oxic conditions). The upper 18  cm of sediments from three stations recovered at different depths were studied. MOM was investigated by <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> and flash pyrolysis techniques. The MOM was of a predominant marine origin and inferred from their pyrolysis products, most biomolecules (tetra-alkylpyrrole pigments, polysaccharides, proteins and their transformation products, and polyphenols including phlorotannins), showed a progressive relative degradation with increasing exposure to oxygen. Alkylbenzenes and, in particular, aliphatic macromolecules increased relatively. The observed differences in MOM composition between sediment deposited under various bottom water oxygen conditions (i. e. in terms of concentration and exposure time) was much larger than within sediment cores, implying that early diagenetic alteration of organic matter depends largely on bottom water oxygenation rather than subsequent anaerobic degradation within the sediments, even at longer time scales...|$|R
40|$|Neogene sediments {{from three}} {{areas of the}} Northern Indian Ocean (Indus Fan, Owen Ridge, Oman Margin, ODP Leg 117) were studied in order to {{determine}} the amount, type, and preservation of organic matter as functions of the environments encountered. The work consisted of geochemical analyses on whole sediment (Total Organic Content and <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> pyrolysis) and of petrographic studies on isolated organic matter by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In Indus Fan sediments, organic matter is present in low amounts, mainly as lignaceous fragments. A contrasting situation exists in Oman Margin sediments which are generally rich in amorphous autochtonous organic matter. Owen Ridge, located between Indus fan and Oman Margin areas, shows two phases of organic sedimentation as a consequence of the uplift of the ridge. The older phase (Oligocene to early or middle Miocene) is strongly influenced by detrital supply from the Indus, while the younger phase (middle Miocene to Pleistocene) is characterized by relatively high amounts of autochtonous organic matter. From a general point of view it appears that high amounts of organic matter are mainly due to good preservation of marine amorphous organic matter, such as in Oman Margin sediments and in upper pelagic levels of Indus Fan and Owen Ridge deposits. Low total organic carbon contents are correlated with low proportions of amorphous material in the total organic matter due to oxidizing conditions. This leads to a relative enrichment in components derived from resistant materials (lignin, chitin, or other resistant biopolymers) such as lignaceous fragments (Indus Fan) and/or fragments from benthic organisms and alveolate microplankton (Oman Margin) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Late Cretaceous La Luna Formation is {{the main}} {{hydrocarbon}} source-rock formation in Venezuela. In the Lake Maracaibo area, the formation shows a steep maturation gradient affecting sedimentary organic matter (OM) and clay minerals, related to local burial history and thrusting events. The influence of the gradient is examined through geochemical (organic and inorganic) and mineralogical investigations carried out on samples from five cored boreholes in the Maracaibo Basin. The analytical procedure comprises <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance measurement, palynofacies observation, major- and trace-element content determination, performed on bulk-rock samples or after a sequential leach protocol (DOP calculation) and the examination and analysis of clay-mineral assemblages. The maturation gradient {{seems to have had}} no effect upon the distribution of the trace elements referred to as proxy indicators for palaeodepositional conditions of OM-rich sediments (Ba, P, V, Mo, Ni, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr and Mn). Consequently, trace elements appear to be reliable palaeoenvironmental markers. They indicate that, during the La Luna Fm. deposition, the water column must have had variable conditions, with high primary production near the surface and the correlative development of euxinic conditions at the bottom. This provides further arguments for an upwelling system affecting the northern platform of South America during Late Cretaceous time. The relative scarcity of reactive iron in the depositional environment must have taken an active part in a process involving sulphur and acting on the environmental conditions as well as on OM (vulcanisation). This process favours aliphatic OM storage and may be relevant for many other OM-rich facies or hydrocarbon source rocks...|$|R
40|$|Lake Ohrid (Macedonia/Albania) is {{the oldest}} extant lake in Europe and {{exhibits}} an outstanding degree of endemic biodiversity. Here, we provide new high-resolution stable isotope and geochemical data from a 10 m core (Co 1262) through the Late Glacial to Holocene and discuss past climate and lake hydrology (TIC, δ 13 Ccalcite, δ 18 Ocalcite) {{as well as the}} terrestrial and aquatic vegetation response to climate (TOC, TOC/N, δ 13 Corganic, <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> pyrolysis). The data identifies 3 main zones: (1) the Late Glacial-Holocene transition represented by low TIC and TOC contents, (2) the early to mid-Holocene characterised by high TOC and increasing TOC/N and (3) the Late Holocene-Present which shows a marked decrease in TIC and TOC. In general, an overall trend of increasing δ 18 Ocalcite from 9 ka to present suggests progressive aridification through the Holocene, consistent with previous records from Lake Ohrid and the wider Mediterranean region. Several proxies show commensurate excursions that imply the impact of short-term climate oscillations, such as the 8. 2 ka event and the Little Ice Age. This is the best-dated and highest resolution archive of past Late Glacial and Holocene climate from Lake Ohrid and confirms the overriding influence of the North Atlantic in the north-eastern Mediterranean. The data presented set the context for the International Continental scientific Drilling Program Scientific Collaboration On Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid project cores recovered in spring-summer 2013, potentially dating back into the Lower Pleistocene, and will act as a recent calibration to reconstruct climate and hydrology over the entire lake history...|$|R
40|$|Crude oils (20) and sediments (435) {{from the}} Southern Indus Basin have been geochemically studied. The {{analytical}} techniques {{used in this}} study are TOC analysis, <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval,</b> and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Chapter 1 of this thesis presents an introduction of sedimentary OM, kerogen, aliphatic and aromatic biomarkers and their applications in geochemical evaluation. Chapter 2 describes samples and background geology of the study area, lithological description, petroleum systems and source rocks of the Southern Indus Basin. The experimental procedures and techniques for data collection and analysis are explained in Chapter 3. In chapter 4, distribution and relative abundances of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons have been applied to distinguish different oil families. Biomarker parameters divide the samples into three groups on the basis of source, depositional environment and lithology, thermal maturity of organic matter and in reservoir mixing study. Group I (BN, Palli, Sono, Thora, Dhamrkhi, BJ, T Alam, BMD, and BH) shows high Pr/Ph (3. 26 - 4. 46), bimodal n-alkane distribution and high abundance of C 20 + n-alkanes. High concentration of 1, 2, 5 -TMN, 1, 7 -DMP, high 1 -MP/ 9 -MP, presence of retene and low C 27 /C 29 steranes support their likely origin from terrestrial source (coniferous plant). Group II (BS, BA, T A Yar and Resham) has moderate to high Pr/Ph (2. 84 - 3. 67), bimodal n-alkane distribution, presence of retene, low 1 -MP/ 9 -MP and moderate concentration of 1, 2, 5 -TMN, 1, 7 -DMP. These samples probably have mixed (terrestrial and marine) source of organic matter. Group III of condensates (Baloch, Unnar, Shah, Pasahki East, Pakhro, Chandio and Gopang) is extremely low in biomarkers. The source rocks, probably marine oxic clastics having terrestrial OM have generated these waxy condensates under high thermal conditions. Marine oxic clastic source rocks for these condensates are also reflected from plots: DBT/P versus Pr/Ph, C 29 H/C 30 H versus C 29 -dia/(dia+Reg) steranes, Pr/Pr+Ph versus C 29 -dia/(dia+Reg) steranes and C 27 /C 29 sterane versus C 27 /C 29 -diaseranes. The maturity parameters, TMNr, TeMNr and PMNr, MPI, Rc MDR and Rcs show a wide range of thermal maturities. Palli crude oil has the lowest maturity among the sample suit while condensates have highest maturity. A novel maturity parameter 4 -MDBT/ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 -PMN has been proposed in this chapter which correlates very well with other established maturity parameters. Ternary plot of TMNr, TeMNr and PMNr reflects that majority of the analyzed crude oils are indigenous in nature with the exception of Palli, Pakhro and Sono which may have some in-reservoir mixing. Chapters 5 - 7 are dedicated to geochemical evaluation of sedimentary sequences: Ranikot (Paleocene); Laki (Eocene); Parh, Goru and Sembar (Cretaceous) and Datta and Chiltan (Jurassic) using <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> and aliphatic and aromatic biomarkers. In chapter 5, aliphatic and aromatic biomarkers along with TOC and <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> study have been used to evaluate geochemistry of sediments from Ranikot (Paleocene) and Laki (Eocene) Formations. Low values of Tmax, biomarkers and aromatics maturity parameters and high abundance of hopenes and Ã¢Ã¢-hopanes support highly immature nature of organic matter in both Laki and Ranikot sediments. Bimodal n-alkane distributions, marked predominance of C 27, C 29 and C 31 n-alkanes, high abundance of C 29 steranes compared to C 27 and C 28 homologues, presence of oleanene suggest that the organic matter in these sediments is predominantly of terrestrial origin, while cadalene and its intermediate like calamenene and tetrahydrocadalene specify drought resistant low land plants. The occurrence of C 30 steranes and high concentration of fungal derived perylene supports the contribution of fungal organic matter and specific warm and humid climatic conditions supporting low land or marshy conifers on which wood degrading fungi flourish. It is most likely that raise in sea level and increased salinity sea waters may have inundated these low lands and shortage of oxygen and minerals resulted in death and preservation of fungal colonies along with wood debris. Marine anoxic to sub-oxic conditions (Pr/Ph 0. 43 - 2. 01) in water columns favored peryloquinones formation and finally conversion to perylene and preservation in Laki and Ranikot Formations in high abundance. A thin section within the Laki Formation (460 - 490 m) has mixed type II, III kerogen, reflected from HI: 224 - 540 mgHC/gTOC and Pr/n-C 17 versus Ph/n-C 18 plot. Therefore, despite good to excellent organic richness, these sediments are highly immature and far from hydrocarbons generation. The main objective of chapter 6 is geochemical characterization of Parh, Goru and Sembar Formations sediments using TOC, <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Most of the sediments of Parh, and Upper Goru Formations are lean in organic matter (TOC 435 Â�â€¹C). The upper 430 m section of Sembar Formation shows high TOC (1 - 3. 2 %) and maturity status from peak oil to overmature (Tmax: 442 - 487 oC), while lower 190 m including Jurassic sediments are poor to fair in organic matter (TOC: 0. 5 - 1. 5 %), however, Tmax mostly lies in the mature zone with the exception of some bottom sediments. S 2 /S 3 values in the range of 0. 06 - 9. 35 suggest gas generation potential of Sembar Formation. Modified Van-Krevlen diagram and plot of Tmax versus TOC suggest type III kerogen in the Lower Goru and Sembar shales. Biomarker data support <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval</b> results. Molecular maturity parameters like MPI, Rc, MDR, Rcs, TMNr and TeMNr and plots of 20 S/(20 S+ 20 R) versus Æ’Ã€Æ’Ã€/(Æ’Ã€Æ’Ã€+Æ’Â¿Æ’Â¿) for C 29 steranes indicate low maturity of Parh, Upper Goru, Upper Shale and Lower section of Sembar Formation and medium to high maturity of Lower Shale, Talhar Shale and most of the samples of Sembar Formation. n-Alkanes distributions, sterane ternary plot, presence of retene, high abundance of 1, 2, 5 -TMN and 1, 2, 5, 6 -TeMN suggest predominant contribution from terrestrial organic matter in Parh, Upper and Lower Goru Formations and mixed marine and terrestrial organic matter in Sembar Formation. Values of Pr/Ph, C 35 /C 34, C 31 R/C 30, C 29 /C 30 hopanes suggest marine sub-oxic to oxic depositional environment for Parh, Upper Goru and Sembar Formations and oxic to sub-oxic nearshore marine or shallow marine environment for the Lower Goru Formation. Chapter 7 is dedicated to characterization of previously unexplored Jurassic sediments of Datta and Chiltan Formations. Maturity parameters, 20 S/(20 S+ 20 R), Æ’Ã€Æ’Ã€/(Æ’Ã€Æ’Ã€+Æ’Â¿Æ’Â¿), 22 S/(22 S+ 22 R), moretane/hopane, Ts/Ts+Tm, MPR- 1, MPR- 3, MPI, PhDBF, TrPr- 1 and TrPr- 2 reveal immature to early maturity status of Datta and comparatively higher maturity level of the Chiltan sediments. Palynological data by Ministry of Petroleum Pakistan on BB well show the presence of Cheirolepidiacean spore classes Classopollis torosus and Spheripollenite along with Araucariacites australis in Datta Formation which are important palynomorphs of conifers. Since conifers appeared in the fossil record of the Permian; it indicates coniferous source and Permian or younger age of sequence. A notable feature of both Datta and Chiltan sediments is the presence of relatively high proportions of alkylcyclohexanes and alkylcyclopentanes series. As these compounds are characteristic of marine organic sources, they provide an indication for the marine algal incursion for these Jurassic sediments. The major contribution of organic matter in Chiltan Formation is from terrestrial source shown by high abundance of C 27, C 29, C 31 n-alkanes and C 29 steranes and low sterane/hopane ratio, with some contribution from marine algal source as shown above. Datta Formation has mixed marine algal and terrestrial organic matter on the basis of high abundance of C 16, C 18, C 20 n-alkanes, presence of C 30 steranes, ratios of sterane/hopanes, tricyclicterpanes/hopanes and high abundances of alkylcyclohexanes and alkylcyclopentanes. The presence of coniferous spores and woody tissues in Datta Formation also support terrestrial organic matter input. Paleoclimatic interpretation of Datta Formation has been {{made on the basis of}} high abundance of combustion derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as a result of wild forest fires during Jurassic times. Classopollis torosus along with Spheripollenite which are associated with warm and humid climatic conditions may have initiated the wildfires and the subsequent deposition of pyrolytic aromatic hydrocarbons in these sediments. Presence of vitrinite and phenyl substituted aromatics like phenylnaphthalenes, phenyldibenzofurans and benzonaphthofurans also supports wild forest fires during deposition of Datta Formation. In chapter 8 diamondoid hydrocarbons have been proposed as maturity indicators of condensates. Both waxy and non-waxy condensates originated from terrestrial organic matter deposited under marine oxic conditions have been examined. High level of thermal maturity is indicated by the values of diamondoid based maturity parameters, like methyladamantane index ranging from 54. 1 - 75. 8 % and methyldiamantane index ranging from 34. 9 - 56. 3 % which corresponds to vitrinite reflectance 1. 1 - 1. 6 %. Methyladamantanes/adamantane 3. 99 - 5. 52 and methyldiamantanes/diamantane 2. 16 - 2. 99 indicate non-biodegradation nature of these samples. The data are supported by absence of unresolved complex mixture (UCM) ...|$|R

BP). The chronology of the sequence is constrained by varve counting and AMS C- 14 measurement of terrestrial plant macrofossils. Multiproxy analyses (magnetic susceptibility, grain size, TOC, TN, TS, <b>Rock</b> <b>Eval,</b> pollen and macrofossils) imply that cold and dry regional climatic conditions with sparse Arctic vegetation prevailed prior to 11500 cal. BP. Coincident with {{the transition to the}} Holocene at 11500 cal. BP, air temperatures and lake productivity increased and Betula pubescens and Populus tremula started to migrate into the area, followed by Picea abies at 10750 cal. BP. Although lake productivity decreased at around 11000 cal. BP and remained low until 9600 cal. BP, pollen-based climate reconstructions imply variable climatic conditions in the region over time. Drier and colder summers prevailed from similar to 11200 to 10900 cal. BP, followed by an interval of higher annual temperatures and precipitation from 10900 to 10750 cal. BP. Lower annual temperatures and drier conditions existed from 10750 to 10200 cal. BP, and higher temperatures and precipitation are inferred between 10200 and 10000 cal. BP. Finally, declining temperatures and precipitation occurred from 10000 cal. BP onwards, with a minimum at around 9600 cal. BP. These climatic shifts are temporally coincident with those recorded in North Atlantic terrestrial, marine and ice-core archives and indicate that relatively minor climate signals were transmitted further to the east...|$|R
