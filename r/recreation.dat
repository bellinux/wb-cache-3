5|$|Eleven U.S. {{national}} parks – Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Petrified Forest, Rocky Mountain, Saguaro, and Zion – {{are in the}} watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and <b>recreation</b> areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple <b>recreation</b> opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado's major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming, and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding Glen Canyon National <b>Recreation</b> Area received more than twomillion visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9million people visited Lake Mead and the Lake Mead National <b>Recreation</b> Area in 2008. Colorado River <b>recreation</b> employs some 250,000 people and contributes $26billion each year to the Southwest economy.|$|E

5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, with her baby due in the summer or early fall of 2010. The Parks and <b>Recreation</b> producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a continuous production after the season ended to bank episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of Parks and <b>Recreation</b> was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and <b>Recreation,</b> and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no effect on the show's momentum, but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced Parks and <b>Recreation</b> would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E
40|$|Many {{issues and}} {{challenges}} are faced by the managers and professionals in sports and <b>recreations</b> today. However, the {{issues and challenges}} in managing sports and <b>recreations</b> programmes particularly in hotels and resorts are more focused on service quality provided by the organizations. This study aims to assess customers' perceptions of service quality in sports and <b>recreations</b> programmes and to determine the differences based on gender and nationality {{in terms of their}} perceptions of service quality provided by hotels and resorts located in coastal areas of the northern Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 450 customers who participated in the survey {{were asked to respond to}} a series of the adapted SERVQUAL items. Results from this study revealed that the customers' perceptions of the overall service and facilities in sports and <b>recreations</b> programmes provided by the hotels and resorts were satisfactory. It was also indicated that there was no significance difference between male and female customers' perceptions of service quality in sports and <b>recreations</b> programmes. Conversely, the results revealed that there was a significance difference between local and foreign customers' perceptions of sports and <b>recreations</b> services provided. These findings had implications on sports and <b>recreations</b> programmes in order to design effective management and marketing strategies at hotels and resorts...|$|R

40|$|Tato diplomová práce se zabývá problematikou odborových rekreací pořádaných Revolučním odborovým hnutím v Československu mezi lety 1945 - 1989. Teoretickými východisky práce jsou koncept volného času, ROH a odborových rekreací, a to včetně všech jejich typů (výběrové domácí a zahraniční rekreace, závodní rekreace, pionýrské tábory ROH). Práce získává své poznatky jednak z archivních pramenů a rozhovorů s pamětníky, jednak na základě studia sekundární literatury. Práce popisuje odlišnosti mezi jednotlivými typy rekreací a představuje jejich proměny v čase. Zároveň celou problematiku odborových rekreací vztahuje ke konceptu volného času, jakožto předpokladu pro vznik odborových rekreací. Detailně se také věnuje roli ROH v samotném organizování rekreací. Cílem práce je zpracovat základní trendy, směry a změny odborových rekreací a jejich typologii.
