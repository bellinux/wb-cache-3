500|$|Dental caries, if left untreated, {{follows a}} {{predictable}} natural history as it nears the pulp of the tooth. [...] First it causes reversible pulpitis, which transitions to irreversible pulpitis, then to necrosis, then to necrosis with periapical periodontitis and, finally, to necrosis with periapical abscess. [...] Reversible pulpitis can be stopped by {{removal of the}} cavity and the placement of a sedative dressing of {{any part of the}} cavity that is near the pulp chamber. [...] Irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis are treated with either root canal therapy or extraction. [...] Infection of the periapical tissue will generally resolve with the treatment of the pulp, unless it has expanded to cellulitis or a radicular cyst. [...] The success rate of restorative treatment and sedative dressings in reversible pulpitis, depends on the extent of the disease, as well as several technical factors, such as the sedative agent used and whether a <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> was used. [...] The success rate of root canal treatment also depends on the degree of disease (root canal therapy for irreversible pulpitis has a generally higher success rate than necrosis with periapical abscess) and many other technical factors.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{evaluated}} {{knowledge of}} {{technical aspects of}} non-surgical root canal treatment among general dentists in private dental clinics in Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was distributed randomly to 70 general dental practitioners who were working in private dental centers. The response rate was 88. 6 %. Results: The results showed that only 3 % of dentists were using <b>rubber</b> <b>dams</b> for isolation during endodontic treatment.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{compliance}} of general dental practitioners (GDPs) in the private sector in North Jordan with infection control measures. A pilot-tested questionnaire about infection control measures was distributed in March 2004 to 120 private practices. The response rate was 91. 66 percent. About 77 percent of dentists usually ask their patients about medical history, 36 percent were vaccinated against hepatitis B, 81. 8 percent wear and change gloves during treatment and between patients, and 54. 5 percent wear and change masks during treatment and between patients. Most dental practitioners (95. 4 percent) reported that they changed extraction instruments and burs between patients. All dental practitioners reported that they changed saliva ejectors between patients, but only 41. 8 percent changed handpieces between patients. Approximately 63 percent (69 / 110) used autoclaves for sterilization, 47. 3 percent (52 / 110) used plastic bags to wrap sterilized instruments, and only 18 percent (20 / 110) disinfected impressions before sending them to dental labs. Fourteen percent used <b>rubber</b> <b>dams</b> in their clinics, and only 31. 8 percent had special containers for sharps disposal. Based on these responses, approximately 14 percent of general dentists in this sample were considered to be compliant with an inventory of recommended infection control measures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Latex {{sensitisation}} is recognised as {{a health}} problem among health care workers (HCWs) using latex products. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify specific latex allergens in latex devices used in South African academic dental schools. The current study also compared the total protein content and the levels of specific allergens in these products. METHODS: Fourteen latex examination gloves (powdered and non-powdered) and five dental <b>rubber</b> <b>dams,</b> representing 6 brands, from five dental academic institutions were analysed for latex allergens and total protein. Total protein content was determined using the BioRad DC protein assay kit and natural rubber allergen levels using a capture enyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for Hev b 1, Hev b 3, Hev b 5 and Hev b 6. 02. RESULTS: Hev b 6. 02 was found in higher concentrations than other natural rubber latex (NRL) allergens in the products analysed. Hev b 5 content ranged from 0 to 9. 2 microg/g and Hev b 6. 02 from 0. 09 to 61. 5 microg/g of sample. Hev b 1 levels were below the detection limit (DL) for 79 % of the samples (15 / 19). Dental dams showed higher allergen levels (median 80. 91 microg/g) than latex gloves (median 11. 34 microg/g). Powdered rubber samples also showed higher allergen levels (median 40. 54 microg/g) than non-powdered samples (median 5. 31 microg/g).

5000|$|A dental dam or <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> (sometimes termed [...] "Kofferdam"—from German), {{designed}} in the United States in 1864 by Sanford Christie Barnum, is a thin, 6 in square sheet, usually latex or nitrile, used in dentistry to isolate the operative site (one or more teeth) {{from the rest of}} the mouth. It is used mainly in endodontic, fixed prosthodontic (crowns, bridges) and general restorative treatments. Its purpose is both to prevent saliva interfering with the dental work (e.g. contamination of oral micro-organisms during root canal therapy, or to keep filling materials such as composite dry during placement and curing), and to prevent instruments and materials from being inhaled, swallowed or damaging the mouth.
