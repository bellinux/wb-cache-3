2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw only minor changes that {{included}} new color choices, a softer grain pattern on interior surfaces, {{and a slight}} increase {{in the size of the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> tips. The 340 option was replaced with a 360 4-bbl as the small block performance engine. All other engine options remained the same, including the 360 2-bbl designated by a K in the fifth symbol in the vehicle identification number. Several performance rear end ratios, including a 3.23 [...] "Sure Grip" [...] rear end were still available. A four speed transmission was still an option except with the 440 engine.|$|E
2500|$|Matador hardtop, sedan, and {{station wagon}} body styles came {{in only one}} trim model for 1973, with {{numerous}} appearance and comfort options. The 1973 model year brought new U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a [...] front and a [...] rear impacts without damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment. Matadors gained stronger front and rear bumpers. The front bumper included self-restoring telescoping shock-absorbers and more prominent vertical rubber guards, while the rear bumper gained vertical black <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> guards that replaced a pair of similar and previously optional chrome bumper guards. Aside from the changes to the bumpers, {{the design of the}} 1973 model was identical to the 1972 model with the exception of new tail light lens assemblies. The full-width bench seat was standard with 50/50 individually adjustable and reclining seats were optional on all body styles. The station wagons came with [...] "Uganda" [...] vinyl upholstery, while the two-door hardtops offered optional front bucket seats.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, {{motoring}} press {{applied the}} name of statuesque British actress Sabrina to oversized pairs of protruding <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> blocks added to MG MGB, MG Midget, Triumph Spitfire and Triumph TR6 sports cars to meet strengthened US auto safety regulations. The term lingered {{at least to the}} mid-'90s in some areas.|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, the British {{motoring}} press {{gave the}} name [...] "Sabrinas" [...] to the oversized pairs of protruding <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> blocks {{added to the}} MG MGB, Midget and Triumph TR6 sports cars, when US auto safety regulations mandated sturdier impact protection. The name stuck and is used worldwide. See Dagmar bumpers.|$|E
50|$|When {{leaving the}} factory, all non-V8 MGBs were {{originally}} fitted with Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67). Cross-ply tyres (560-14) were standard until 1972 with radials being optional. From 1972 {{there were two}} different radial sizes factory-fitted to new cars, {{depending on whether the}} car was a roadster,(155/80x14) or a GT,(165/80x14). With the 1974.5 arrival of the <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> cars the factory-fitted tyre size was simplified to 165/80x14 for all cars, irrespective of whether the car was a roadster or a GT, and also irrespective of the wheel type (wire or RoStyle). Later on during the <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> production period, alloy wheels were introduced on several different limited edition models - with the final one-thousand LE models being the last cars to leave the factory with alloy wheels which, although the same 5”x14” rim size as the RoStyle, had 185/70x14 radials fitted. This wider tyre was not factory fitted to wire wheels. The factory built V8s were fitted with full profile 175HR14 tyres.|$|E
50|$|Chaiseri got {{its start}} as a {{specialist}} in rubber and rubber-to-metal bonded parts such as torque rods and <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers</b> for commercial cargo trucks. They then moved to producing track shoes and road wheels for Royal Thai Army tracked armoured vehicles.|$|R
25|$|The American market Spitfire 1500 {{is easily}} {{identified}} by the big plastic over-riders and wing mounted reflectors {{on the front and}} back wings. The US specification models up to 1978 still had chrome bumpers, but on the 1979 and 1980 models these were replaced by black <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers</b> with built-in over-riders. Chassis extensions were also fitted under the boot to support the bumpers.|$|R
25|$|Externally, {{the most}} obvious changes over the SII were the thicker and more {{incorporated}} <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers</b> with decorative chrome only on the top edge, flush door handles for increased safety, a one-piece front door glass without a separate 1/4 light, a grille with only vertical vanes, reverse lights moved from the boot plinth to the larger rear light clusters and a revised roofline with narrower door frames and increased glass area.|$|R
50|$|Simms {{acquired}} some of {{the foreign}} patent rights to the petrol engine. In 1900 he set up Simms Manufacturing Company Ltd in Bermondsey and moved the business in 1902 to Welbeck Works in Kimberley Road, Kilburn. There they made Simms-Welbeck cars, lorries and marine engines, fire engines, agricultural vehicles, military vehicles and guns, and aeronautical devices until about 1908. Simms invented the first <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> and a prototype indicator.|$|E
5000|$|To meet impact regulations, 1974 US models had {{the chrome}} bumper over-riders {{replaced}} with oversized rubber ones, nicknamed [...] "Sabrinas" [...] after the British actress. In {{the second half}} of 1974 the chrome bumpers were replaced altogether. A new, steel-reinforced black <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> at the front incorporated the grille area as well, giving a major restyling to the B's nose, and a matching rear bumper completed the change.|$|E
50|$|The metal {{floor is}} usually {{set up as}} a {{rectangular}} or oval track, and graphite is sprinkled {{on the floor to}} decrease friction. A <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> surrounds each vehicle, and drivers ram each other as they travel. The controls are usually an accelerator and a steering wheel. The cars can be made to go backwards by turning the steering wheel far enough in either direction, necessary in the frequent pile-ups that occur.|$|E
50|$|The Corniche {{received}} a mild restyling {{in the spring}} of 1977. Difference included rack-and-pinion steering, alloy and <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers,</b> aluminium radiator, oil cooler and a bi-level air conditioning system was added. Later changes included a modified rear independent suspension in March 1979. In March 1981, after the Silver Spirit had gone on sale, the Coupé version of the Corniche and its Bentley sister were discontinued. For 1985 there were also cosmetic and interior changes.|$|R
50|$|Bensinger experimented and {{researched}} improved {{billiard tables}} and gear, leading to significant patents for <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers</b> and other innovations. In 1880 Bensinger, as {{part owner of}} J. M. Brunswick & Balke Company, set up a branch in San Francisco for manufacturing billiard tables, making his company the only American coast-to-coast manufacturer and distributor of these tables. He was involved in setting up tournaments for establishments that had his billiard tables and issued cash prizes and trophies.|$|R
50|$|The MGB {{achieved}} a 0-60 mph (96 km/h) time {{of just over}} 11 seconds. The three-bearing 1,798 cc B-Series engine produced 95 hp (71 kW) at 5,400 rpm — upgraded in October 1964 to a five-bearing crankshaft. The majority of MGBs were exported to the US. In 1975 US-market MGB engines were de-tuned to meet emission standards, ride height was increased by an inch (25 mm), and distinctive <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers</b> were fitted to meet bumper standards.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, a new [...] "L" [...] (Luxus) Package was {{introduced}} including, among other items, twin map pockets, dual rear ashtrays, full carpeting, a passenger-side visor vanity mirror, and <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> moldings. The optional 1500 cc engine now came with an engine lid having {{two rows of}} cooling louvers, while the convertible's engine lid gained two additional sets {{for a total of}} four. For North America, the 1500 cc engine was enlarged to 1600 cc engine and produced ...|$|E
50|$|Automodello {{vehicles}} are finely detailed, especially their 1:8 scale reproductions which can cost thousands of dollars. Still, even their smaller offerings are intricate. The Cunningham C-3, for example, can be displayed with soft top or top boot. Its carpet is flocked and wire wheels have deeply laser cut spokes (McCourt 2014a, p. 16). Only 154 of the Cunninghams {{were made by}} Automodello. The Avanti R2 offered in 1:43 scale was likewise detailed with accurate windshield wipers, instrument panel and <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> tips (McCourt 2014b, p. 15).|$|E
50|$|The ThinkPad 11e is a Chromebook {{that has}} a matte black chassis with {{reinforced}} hinges and corners, a sturdy lid, and a <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> protecting its display {{in order to help}} it survive accidental dropping, spills, and general rough handling. It uses a quad-core Intel Celeron CPU, has 4 GB of RAM which can not be upgraded, an 11.6 inch screen, and 16GB or eMMC flash storage. Reviewers claim it is somewhat heavier than a typical Chromebook with a weight of 3.1 pounds. This is likely because of its ruggedized and reinforced chassis.|$|E
50|$|The ThinkCentre line of desktop {{computers}} {{was introduced by}} IBM in 2003. The first three models in this line were the S50, the M50, and A50p. All three desktops were equipped with Intel Pentium 4 processors. The chassis was made of steel and designed for easy component access {{without the use of}} tools. The hard disk was fixed in place by a 'caddy' without the use of screws. The caddy had <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers</b> to reduce vibration and operational noise.|$|R
5000|$|The Siemens M65 is {{a robust}} mobile phone. It is made shock {{resistant}} by its metal frame and <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers.</b> The device is dust and splash water resistant complying with IP54 standard. The phone features a VGA camera, {{which can be}} used to record both still images and video, and a 65k colour display 2.1" [...] with 132x176 px resolution. The photo resolution is 640x480 and video is 128x96. It also came with several action based games pre-installed.|$|R
5000|$|On March 16, 2005, a 4-year-old boy broke {{a finger}} and severed {{the tip of}} his thumb when the child's fingers were crushed between the boat and the dock while {{passengers}} were unloading. The ride was closed for nearly two days while state authorities investigated the accident. Authorities directed Disneyland to lower and repair <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers</b> along the dock's edge, and to make sure ride operators inform passengers to keep their hands in the boat while it docks.|$|R
50|$|Cars for the US market were {{fitted with}} large {{projecting}} <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> over-riders (in 1973 these were on front, in 1974 both front and rear) to meet local 5 mph impact regulations, but those on European models were considerably smaller. US models also have side indicator repeats {{on the front}} wings. There were also a very limited number of six-cylinder Series 3 E-Types built. These were featured in the initial sales procedure {{but the lack of}} demand stopped their production. When leaving the factory the V12 Open Two Seater and V12 2 ± 2 originally fitted Dunlop E70VR − 15 inch tyres on 15 × 6K wire or solid wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw only minor changes that {{included}} new color choices, a softer grain pattern on interior surfaces, {{and a slight}} increase {{in the size of the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> tips. The 340 option was dropped and the 360 4-bbl replaced the 340 as the small block performance engine. All other engine options remained the same, including the 360 2-bbl designated by a K in the fifth symbol in the vehicle identification number. Several performance rear end ratios, including a 3.23 [...] "Sure Grip" [...] rear end were still available. A four speed transmission was still an option except with the 440 engine.|$|E
50|$|Nissan {{gave the}} 280ZX a {{facelift}} in 1982, with revised NACA ducting in the hood, new alloy wheels (fourteen inch six-spoke alloys for non-turbo models, and fifteen inch four-spoke alloys for turbo models), a revised B-pillar garnish, new pin-stripe style tail-lights, and <b>rubber</b> <b>bumper</b> over-riders replaced the earlier model's chrome and rubber items, the bumpers were now also body coloured and wrapped around further. Interior changes were minor but included new seat trim styling. The 1982 model {{also was the}} first to offer the popular voice warning system, which warned the driver when the headlights were left on after the vehicle was turned off, if the parking brake was on while the vehicle was in motion, and many others.|$|E
50|$|In November 1976 the Japanese market models {{received}} a facelift, losing the previous L-shaped/upright rear lamps {{in favor of}} wide rectangular units. Front indicators were enlarged and moved, and new bigger <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers</b> were also added, and new grilles were introduced. This generation gradually became the A140-series in Japan, reflecting {{the introduction of new}} engines. Since it kept the 4G32 engine, the GSR was referred to as an A73 until the very end in spite of having {{received a}}ll of the bodywork modifications.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{features}} included 4-wheel anti-skid brakes, 4-beam headlights, air bags, silicone <b>rubber</b> front <b>bumper</b> {{mounted on}} internal shock absorbers and crumple zones.The front suspension used double wishbones.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>rubber</b> <b>bumpers,</b> smaller competition iron plates {{can be used to}} add weight in small increments to the bar. The colour designations for these iron plates are as follows: 1 kg is green, 1.5 kg is yellow, 2 kg is blue, 2.5 kg is red, 5 kg and 0.5 kg are white. It is useful to note the colour assignment of these iron plates is consistent with the heavier bumper plates (i.e. 1 kg and 10 kg are green, 1.5 kg and 15 kg are yellow, etc.).|$|R
