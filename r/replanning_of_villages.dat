Following the basic ideas of the constraintlogic based configuration tool ConBaCon and the experiences made during its implementation and validation, we introduce a similar CLP-oriented frame model for constraint-based WfM-systems which especially focuses on the planning and <b>replanning</b> <b>of</b> workflows. It applies to known drawbacks of existing WfM-systems. The frame model describes the transformation of WfM-problem specifications which have a rather declarative nature into an internal object-oriented and constraint-based problem representation which can be processed efficiently by a constraint-logic inference. Presuming a CLP-language as background, the model guarantees the correctness of the generated solutions and the completeness of the potential solution set {{with respect to the}} problem specification and the constraints given [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In 1962, Danish {{architect}} Jan Gehl {{shifted the}} trajectory of Copenhagen’s development by pedestrianising key parts of its city centre {{with the goal of}} enhancing the on-street conditions for humans. Rigorous field studies informed Gehl’s conclusion that city spaces perform best when they encourage the use of public spaces. Gehl observed that the quality of life between buildings is diminished when substandard architecture, poor safety and overwhelming car infrastructure limit human engagement in public places. Gehl therefore commenced the <b>replanning</b> <b>of</b> Copenhagen in 1962 by pedestrianising Strøget: the city’s main interior transit artery.|$|R

Through the algorithms, we classified different tasks in the emergency task sequence and ensured the high quality and efficiency of solution. The algorithms were designed into three kinds respectively: the emergency tasks with high priority, general emergency tasks with fewer tasks, and general emergency tasks with more tasks.|$|R

The method uses additional position estimations that augment individual UAV fault detection system. These additional estimations are obtained using images from the same planar scene taken from two different UAVs. Since accuracy and noise level of the estimation depends on several factors, dynamic <b>replanning</b> <b>of</b> the multiUAV team {{can be used to}} obtain a better estimation in case of faults caused by slow growing errors of absolute position estimation that cannot be detected by using local FDI in the UAVs. Experimental results with data from two real UAVs are also presented. 1...|$|R

Therefore, tracked US is an efficient means for controlling the validity of pre-operative planning, recognition of changes (brain shift) during the intervention, <b>replanning</b> <b>of</b> the operational path due to situational changes (iterative navigation), and finally, controlling the results (residual tumor). This paper describes a neuronavigation system exploiting this potential of interventional tracked US for permanent control of intervention progress and iterative adaptation of the planned procedure to the current situation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of oil spill {{cleaning}} by autonomous vehicles in dynamic and uncertain environments, this paper presents a multi-resolution algorithm that seamlessly integrates the concepts of local navigation and global navigation based on the sensory information; the objective here is to enable adaptive decision making and online <b>replanning</b> <b>of</b> vehicle paths. The proposed algorithm provides a complete coverage of the search area for clean-up of the oil spills and does not suffer from the problem of having local minima, which is commonly encountered in potential-field-based methods. The efficacy of the algorithm is tested on a high-fidelity player/stage simulator for oil spill cleaning in a harbour, where the underlying oil weathering process is modelled as 2 D random-walk particle tracking...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a methodological {{approach}} for the construction of Pedagogical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) based on the Tutorial Intelligent Systems (TIS) architecture which is composed of 3 specific models: Domain Model, Student Model, and Pedagogical Model.

It is important to notice that this methodological approach contemplates only some issues of implementation and validation of the TIS, which are focused on the planning and <b>replanning</b> <b>of</b> activities. This task is relevant for the TIS and is carried out using the information structured within the models previously mentioned...|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes an ethnomethodological {{approach}} {{to the study of}} naturalistic decision making.

Through an interaction-based analysis, we describe a serious emergency design-in-use situation. Results show that (1) decision-making activities are not clearly identifiable in ongoing problem-solving action but are embedded in complex work practices; (2) work practices and organizational features shape when, how and which decisions are made, underlying the situated character of the decision-making process; (3) considering the group of designers as unit of analysis allows the complex and distributed nature of decision making in organizations to be described...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflict}} between economic interests and orderrelated requirements complicates the scheduling {{and control of}} orders {{in the field of}} event logistics.

This paper introduces a concept for the implementation of autonomous control in event logistics. At this, the focus lays on the three key aspects of autonomously controlled systems; the modelling process, the object representation and the structuring of the communication processes.
