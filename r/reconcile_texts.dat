Expelled from the USSR in 1972, he became a US citizen in 1977 and Poet Laureate of the United States in 1991. In this essay, I have sought to examine the state of exile {{perceived}} in Brodsky’s poems. Using Russian literary critic Viktor Shklovsky’s concept of defamiliarization, I have strived to illuminate the formal composition of this state – its technique. This formalist approach, however, has one flaw: it fails to acknowledge the fact that the literature of exile, as pointed out by Edward Said, must never be reduced to mere ‘text’ in the narrow, technical sense. In consequence, the study of such literatures must seek to <b>reconcile</b> <b>text</b> and experience, literature and life. I thus hope that, while focusing mainly on the artistic creation of a state of exile within the text, this study may also shed some light on the extra-textual qualities of the literature of exile...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} two debated {{questions about}} how best to interpret the contribution to the Symposium that Socrates pretends to derive from Diotima: (i) Within the Lesser Mysteries, is the erōs that is being defined and characterized, with appeal to the notion of “generation in beauty”, a generic erōs that is equivalent to Socratic desire in general, or a specific erōs that is erotic in our sense?

40|$|This {{project began}} with the {{intention}} to examine {{the connection between the}} aesthetic and the political in American literature's construction of African-American subjectivity, or the relationship between resistance and representation in literary portrayals of the African-American subject. I was specifically interested in the moments in American literature where the convergence between aesthetic form and political practice creates a particular crisis in representation for African-American subjectivity,many times rendering scholarly discussion of these problematic texts dismissive of their purported politics, or even non-existent. Some of the questions I wanted to grapple with included how one accounts for texts that have "good politics" in mind when written, yet still possess racist or "bad political" aspects through {{the manner in which they}} are presented, and the manner in which the subject position of the author affects ourperception of the text. I chose to discuss American fictional texts whose readers and critics have experienced difficulty <b>reconciling</b> the <b>text's</b> aesthetic properties with the political moves they seemed to be making in their representation of African-American subjectivity. Through close analysis of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Frances Harper's abolitionist and post-Civil War poetry, and her novel Iola Leroy, Mark Twain's Puddn'head Wilson, Carl Van Vechten's Nigger Heaven, Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, and research of the criticism surrounding these texts, I found that we should not necessarily reject the notion that aesthetic representation always implies a political stance. However, if ideology and form are so closely connected, than closely examining the aesthetics of a text becomes crucial to understanding its political repercussions and the cultural work it is performing. Ultimately, I end with a plea that we acknowledge the complexity of resistance for the African-American subject and expand the ways in which we as readersand critics tend to define it. It is our continuing exploration of the complexity of racial representation in literature and cultural subject formation/construction that aids us in understanding and overcoming racism...|$|R

40|$|Diaporic literature” {{is a term}} {{frequently}} used to discuss writers who have written about transculturation and disjunction. Hence some literature can be classified as belonging to a sub-class of “Indigenous Diaspora,” where the authors’ work is informed by their people’s histories of transplantation, dispossession and alienation {{at the hands of}} colonial regimes. The Murri writer Sam Watson and Nyoongar author Kim Scott both fit into this category. The work of both novelists also shares a focus on shamanism and traditional magic, allowing for an exploration of spirituality and power from two cultural sources—that of the colonised and of the coloniser. It was for these reasons that I chose to link the authors in question when writing my doctoral thesis. In the course of my research, however, yet another intriguing similarity emerged—in Watson’s The Kadaitcha Sung and Scott’s Benang: from the heart, women are largely absent, or at best play a supporting role. Alternative forms of masculinities are explored, and accepted moral ‘standards’—as enforced by Christian colonisers—are questioned through the presentation of non-monogamous, and indeed, non-heteronormative, relationships. This has further complicated the already-fraught issue of authority—has a non-Indigenous person the right to critically analyse and evaluate the work of an Indigenous writer?

40|$|The {{difficulty}} of reading Allen Ginsberg’s poetry is {{a recurring theme}} in criticism of his work and that of other post-WWII “Beat Generation” writers. “Even when a concerted effort is made to illuminate [Beat] literature,” laments Nancy M. Grace, “doing so is difficult: the romance of the Beat life threatens to subsume the project” (812). Of course, the Beat life is romantic {{to the extent that}} it is romantically regaled. Continual romantic portrayals, such as that of Ginsberg in the recent movie Howl (2010), rekindle the Beat romance for new audiences with chicken-and-egg circularity. I explore this {{difficulty of}} reading Ginsberg that Grace and other critics identify by articulating it with respect to "Kaddish"—“Ginsberg’s most highly praised and his least typical poem” (Perloff 213) —as a difficulty of interpreting Ginsberg suspiciously. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur’s theories of interpretation—or “hermeneutics”—provide the theoretical foundation here. Ricoeur distinguishes between a romantic or “restorative” mode of interpretation, where meaning is reverently <b>reconciled</b> to a <b>text</b> assumed to be trustworthy, and a “suspicious” approach, where meaning is aggressively extrapolated from a text held as unreliable. In order to bring these theories to bear on "Kaddish" and its criticism, I draw on Rita Felski’s pioneering work in relating Ricoeur’s concept of “suspicious reading” to the field of literature. Is it possible to read "Kaddish" suspiciously? Or is there nothing left for suspicious readers to expose in texts such as "Kaddish" that are already self-exposing...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutionality}} of legislative preclusion {{of judicial review}} has received considerable attention from constitutional and administrative law scholars. We join this debate by proposing a new approach: a standards-based theory of judicial review based on two fundamental principles. First, whenever government officials make decisions involving the application of legal standards, {{the rule of law}} – and hence the rule of law safeguards of due process and judicial review – attach. Second, with the exception of those cases in which the Constitution itself contemplates standardless official discretion, legislative delegations of authority to government actors must contain legal standards that guide and control discretion. Because the availability of judicial review is tied to the existence of standards and standards are in most instances constitutionally required, the standards-based approach supports a broad right to Article III judicial review that would encompass most administrative decisions, including decisions concerning government benefits. We are not the first scholars to argue that the Constitution requires Article III review of government benefit decisions (or other agency action), but the standards-based approach offers a novel and, we believe, more coherent and workable approach to these fundamental constitutional issues. In support of these conclusions, we demonstrate how Court’s current approach to preclusion is plagued by doctrinal incoherence that ultimately permits Congress to curtail or dispense with this essential rule of law safeguard. We also explain how a standards-based approach can be <b>reconciled</b> with constitutional <b>text</b> and Supreme Court authority, noting in particular that Marbury v. Madison, the seminal opinion concerning the rule of law, indicates that Article III review of the government benefit decisions of the Executive Branch is constitutionally compelled...|$|R

Although scholars such as Gillian Beer and George Levine have established ties between developments in the natural sciences and {{the scope of the}} nineteenth-century novel, {{there has not been a}} sustained effort to attend to the narrative structures of the primary texts that most influenced coterminous literary movements of the period. My work thus attends closely to the narrative and imaginative form of scientific writing that attempts to transcend the limits of what can be seen. All three of Charles Lyell’s, Charles Darwin’s, and Sigmund Freud’s discipline-making texts (The Principles of Geology, The Origin of Species, and The Interpretation of Dreams) deal with historical forces whose operations cannot be observed in action, but only through the traces that are left behind. Three long single-author chapters detail how each <b>text</b> <b>reconciles</b> the ambition to establish a new branch of empirical science with the necessity of relying on the imagination to ford the gaps in physical evidence. I provide close readings of these foundational texts, identifying in each the rhetorical systems by which it represents and details what has never been present, and I demonstrate how each author strategically employs methods more conventionally associated with fictional narratives in the pursuit of establishing scientific facts. As a result, my project reframes the dominant concerns of Nineteenth-Century Literature and Science Studies by focusing in on how literary point of view, diversely defined, enables scientific thought to find a language in which to speak...|$|R

40|$|Postgraduate {{candidates}} in the creative arts encounter unique challenges when writing an exegesis (the written document that accompanies creative work as a thesis). As a practitioner-researcher, they must adopt a dual perspective–looking out towards an established field of research, exemplars and theories, as well as inwards towards their experiential creative processes and practice. This dual orientation provides clear benefits, for it enables them to situate the research within its field and make objective claims for the research methodologies and outcomes while maintaining an intimate, voiced relationship with the practice. However, a dual orientation introduces considerable complexities in the writing. It requires a reconciliation of multi-perspectival subject positions: the disinterested academic posture of the observer/ethnographer/analyst/theorist at times; and the invested, subjective stance the practitioner/producer at others. It requires the author to negotiate a range of writing styles and speech genres–from the formal, polemical style of the theorist to the personal, questioning and emotive voice of reflexivity. Moreover, these multi-variant orientations, subject positions, styles and voices must be integrated into a unified and coherent text. In this chapter I offer a conceptual framework and strategies for approaching this relatively new genre of thesis. I begin by summarizing the characteristics of what has begun to emerge as the predominant model of exegesis (the dual-oriented ‘Connective’ exegesis). Framing it against theoretical and philosophical understandings of polyvocality and matrixicality, I go on to point to recent textual models that provide precedents for connecting differently oriented perspectives, subjectivities and voices. I then turn to emergent archives of practice-led research {{to explain how the}} challenge of writing a ‘Connective’ exegesis has so far been resolved by higher degree research (HDR) candidates. Exemplars illustrate a range of strategies they have used to compose a multi-perspectival <b>text,</b> <b>reconcile</b> the divergent subject positions of the practitioner researcher, and harmonize the speech genres of a ployvocal text...|$|R
40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to the rhetorical practices and implications of reality television within the field of rhetoric and composition. In fact, it is easy to argue that television as a whole has been largely ignored, leaving the research to scholars in media, communication, and cultural studies. However, the convergence of media has raised questions about the nature of the viewing practices of contemporary television audiences [...] specifically regarding how to <b>reconcile</b> the complex <b>texts</b> audiences produce in response to television with the passive model of consumption that has defined it. Game scholars, as well as scholars of computers and composition, have theorized the powerful rhetorical potential of play with regard to video games, but they have yet to consider the way play has been invoked in other more traditional media. Therefore, this dissertation seeks to connect old media and new by considering how television, specifically reality TV, engages audiences across platforms, how audiences extend their own experience with reality programs, and what this might mean to rhetoric and composition scholars about contemporary literacy practices. In this dissertation, I argue that reality television has successfully used rhetorics of play and new media technologies to engage audiences within, across, and between programs and their digital environments. Using Survivor as a case study, I analyze the strategies that producers use to invite audiences into the program, specifically focusing on the generic characteristics that instigate play, the program's online presence, and the ways in which viewers respond by producing their own texts such as fantasy Survivor games, blogs, discussion forums, and video mash-ups. By doing so, I demonstrate how reality TV and new media technology have renegotiated the relationship among producers, audiences, and texts. Significantly, viewers become active participants with, as well as producers of, texts. Additionally, I use this research to study how play encourages self-motivated writing, community building, and the possible uses for "serious play" within the composition classroom...|$|R
40|$|Frans van Schooten jr. (1615 - 1660) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} Dutch mathematicians of the seventeenth century. He is best known for his two Latin editions (1649, 1659 - 61) of the Géométrie (1637) of Descartes, which originally appeared in French as an appendix to the Discours de la Methode. This thesis aims to study Van Schooten in the context of his own time and in connection with contemporary developments and practices, both mathematical and extra-mathematical. Van Schooten's ''mathematical life of learning in Leiden'' included his scholarly work, his private teaching, as well as his public lectures at the Duytsche Mathematicque, a program attached to Leiden University. The thesis consists of three parts: a biography of Van Schooten, a case study on his attitude towards Cartesian geometry, and an investigation of his teaching at the Duytsche Mathematicque. The biography is partly based on unpublished archival material and reveals new information on his life and works. For example, Van Schooten's appointment as professor of the Duytsche Mathematicque in 1646 was the result of a well-considered strategy of the Van Schooten family which had its roots in the ten years before. The second part of the thesis investigates Van Schooten's attitude towards Cartesian geometry and the legacy of Descartes by means of a case study of the so-called ''Pappus problem'', one of the key problems in the Géométrie of Descartes. However, Descartes's solution was incomplete and subsequently criticized by contemporary mathematicians with whom Van Schooten was in contact. At first, Van Schooten tried to explain the criticisms away. After this strategy had failed, he contrivedly tried to <b>reconcile</b> Descartes’s original <b>text</b> with the criticisms. Van Schooten identified himself with Descartes to such an extent that he was unable to cope with legitimate criticisms of Descartes's solution. The case study further gives new insights in the way Descartes and Van Schooten employed algebraic notations. A tension between tradition and innovation is seen in Van Schooten's public teaching at the Duytsche Mathematicque, a mathematics program at Leiden University which was taught in the Dutch language. The program had been founded in 1600 in order to train engineers for the army but the audience widened in the course of time and included craftsmen and merchants. Van Schooten's courses at the Duytsche Mathematicque have been investigated in this thesis on the basis of unpublished manuscripts. Hitherto historians have believed that the program was static, but it turns out that Van Schooten made several innovations. He increased the role of theory in his lectures in order to simplify the courses for his students. He revised the existing courses on arithmetic and fortification and he introduced new subjects to the curriculum such as perspective, logarithms and algebra. Van Schooten's algebraic approach to problem solving in arithmetic and geometry was innovative, but he adhered to the old 16 th-century algebraic notation and nowhere mentioned the new notation introduced by Descartes. The thesis concludes with a detailed inventory of sixteen unpublished mathematical manuscripts in the University of Groningen Library.
