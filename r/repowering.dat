25|$|Installation of new wind {{turbines}} can be controversial. An alternative is <b>repowering,</b> where existing {{wind turbines}} are replaced with bigger, more powerful ones, sometimes in smaller numbers while keeping or increasing capacity.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the offshore projects, a further 500MW additional net capacity of onshore windfarms {{is expected to be}} constructed until 2020. The 500MW of additional net capacity is the expected result of the scrapping of 1,300MW capacity from obsolete wind turbines combined with the simultaneous building of 1,800MW capacity of modern wind turbines – a process also known as <b>repowering.</b>|$|E

The ground around the wind turbine features an art display entitled Shadow and Light. The display includes walkways that align {{with the wind}} turbine's shadow at solar noon and two hours, eleven minutes after solar noon, respectively. On the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the wind turbine's shadow also aligns with the walkways by length. Thus the wind turbine functions as a large gnomon in an incomplete sundial. The display includes boxes of light bulbs encased in concrete {{on one side of}} a plaza around the wind turbine's base, representing the amount of electricity consumed by the average American household in a year.|$|E

2500|$|The ALCO 244 V16 diesel {{prime mover}} {{proved to be}} the undoing of the PA: [...] The engine had been rushed into production, and proved to be unreliable. The PA {{locomotives}} failed to capture a marketplace dominated by General Motors Electro-Motive Division and their E-units. The original Santa Fe three unit set #51L, 51A and 51B was repowered in August 1954 with EMD 16-567C engines rated at 1,750hp (1,305kW). This EMD <b>repowering</b> of the PAs was economically unfeasible and the remaining Santa Fe PAs retained their 244 engines. The later 251-series engine, a vastly improved prime mover, was not available in time for ALCO to recover the loss of reputation caused by the unreliability of the 244. By the time the ALCO 251 engine was accepted into widespread use, General Electric (which ended the partnership with ALCO in 1953) had fielded their entries into the diesel-electric locomotive market. General Electric eventually supplanted ALCO as a manufacturer of locomotives. [...] ALCO's loss of market share led to its demise in 1969.|$|E

2500|$|The target {{corridor}} for photovoltaics {{is set at}} 2.4 to 2.6GWp {{per year}} and the hard cap of 52GWp (introduced in 2013) remains in place. [...] The tariffs for photovoltaics are to be reviewed monthly and adjusted {{in light of the}} uptake. [...] Photovoltaic installations beyond this upper bound will not receive funding under the EEG. [...] Onshore wind retained its annual target of 2.4 to 2.6GW. [...] However the target now excludes <b>repowering,</b> effectively extending the growth cap. [...] The management premium and the bonus paid to wind farms providing stabilizing features (Systemdienstleistungen) are now being phased out. [...] From 2016 onwards, the onshore wind tariff is reduced quarterly, depending on whether new capacity tracks the prescribed target. [...] For offshore wind, the new act defines a target of 6.5GW by 2020 and 15GW by 2030. [...] Offshore wind farms that entered service before 2020 can choose between a fixed payment for 8 years or a reduced payment for 12 years. [...] After this period, the basic reward is reduced still further, depending on the distance from shore and the depth of the sea. [...] The biomass target is set at 0.1GW per year. [...] Only biogas plants that use biowaste and liquid manure will receive more than the standard remuneration, depending on their capacity. [...] Tariffs are to be reduced by 0.5% on a three-monthly basis for new installations.|$|E
2500|$|The rising {{shares of}} {{variable}} renewable generation {{had led to}} concerns {{about the ability of}} the electricity system to cope. [...] The new act included measures for the grid integration of photovoltaic systems. [...] Grid operators could now limit the feed-in of photovoltaics in times of grid overload, with the plant operators receiving compensation for their loss of revenue. [...] A new ordinance required the retrofitting of photovoltaic systems to avoid the 50.2Hz problem – the risk of widespread blackouts as PV systems simultaneously tripped in the face of frequencies above 50.2Hz. [...] Free-standing photovoltaic systems on nature conservation areas were excluded from remuneration. [...] The tariff structure for onshore wind was basically maintained, but the degression was tightened from 1% to 1.5% to incentivize efficiency improvements. [...] The system services bonus for onshore wind was extended and the <b>repowering</b> bonus was improved. [...] Offshore wind gained through improved early starter provisions. [...] The start of the degression was postponed until 2018, but increased from 5% to 7%. [...] Starter tariffs were increased but now last 8 rather than 12years. [...] Biomass tariffs were lowered by 10–15% on average, particularly for small systems. [...] The biomass tariff system itself was greatly simplified, with now four size categories and two fuel categories. [...] The degression for biomass was increased from 1% to 2%. [...] The tariffs for hydroelectricity were simplified, the funding period now uniformly 20years, and the degression rate set at 1%. [...] The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised and the start of the degression postponed until 2018, albeit at an increased rate. [...] Electricity storage facilities were fully exempted from grid charges and are to be supported by a special research program.|$|E
2500|$|More specifically, the {{photovoltaic}} tariffs {{were reduced}} somewhat, {{but not enough}} to affect uptake. [...] The degression for PV was tightened from 5% to 8–10%, {{depending on the size of}} installation. [...] A new 'self-consumption incentive' granted a fixed tariff of 25.01¢/kWh for electricity consumed by a PV operator within their own house. [...] A 'flexible degression cap' was introduced, under which the degression rate could be adjusted to keep the uptake of photovoltaics within a specified corridor. [...] The support for onshore wind improved. [...] The initial tariff was raised, the <b>repowering</b> (when old turbines are replaced by new) bonus (Repoweringbonus) was increased, and an additional system service bonus was granted for specified technical contributions (Systemdienstleistungen or SDL), including the ability to maintain voltage if the transmission grid fails. [...] The tariff for offshore wind was raised substantially. [...] An additional 'early starter bonus' was offered for offshore wind farms entering operation before 2015. [...] In parallel to the EEG, a separate loan program of €5 billion was established, to be administered by the state-owned KfW bank, with the goal of reaching 25GW installed capacity for wind by 2030. [...] Support of biomass was also increased, with special bonuses for a number of different biomass types. [...] Biomass must also comply with specified ecological requirements to be eligible, these requirements being contained in a separate 'sustainability ordinance' (Nachhaltigkeitsverordnung or BioSt-NachV). [...] The hydroelectricity tariffs were raised considerably and particularly for micro and small power plants. [...] The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised considerably too, as was the cogeneration bonus. [...] An additional 'early starter bonus' was introduced for geothermal projects put into operation before 2016. [...] A 'green power privilege' (Grünstromprivileg) was introduced, which exempted electricity suppliers with a minimum quota of renewables from the EEG surcharge under certain circumstances. [...] New measures allowed grid operators to temporarily limit wind turbine output in times of network congestion, with compensation payable to the plant owner for lost remuneration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Repowering</b> is {{the process}} of {{replacing}} older power stations with newer ones that either have a greater nameplate capacity or more efficiency which results in a net increase of power generated. <b>Repowering</b> can happen in several different ways. It can be as small as switching out and replacing a boiler, to as large as replacing the entire system to create a more powerful system entirely. There are many upsides to <b>repowering.</b> The simple act of refurbishing the old with the new is in itself beneficial alongside the cost reduction for keeping the plant running. With less costs and a higher energy output, the process is excessively beneficial.|$|E
