5000|$|In the September 2015 case Mak v. City of Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board, the First District Court of Appeals {{interpreted}} Costa-Hawkins in {{the context}} of an evidentiary presumption in Berkeley's rent ordinance that assumes that, where a tenant has moved out after a termination notice, the tenant moved out because of the notice. One common way for a landlord to take possession of a rental unit is to use an [...] "owner move-in" [...] eviction, providing the [...] "just cause" [...] to terminate a rent-controlled tenancy, but requiring that the landlord thereafter move in and make the dwelling unit their residence for some minimum period (e.g., 36 continuous months). Costa-Hawkins will generally de-control a vacant unit (i.e., allow it to be rented at market rate), but creates an exception to vacancy control where the previous tenant received a notice of termination. If the tenant has received such a notice, the vacant unit is not necessarily decontrolled. The landlords in Mak served an owner move-in notice of termination, but then entered an agreement with the tenant, where the tenant recited that they were not moving out because of the notice. The Berkeley regulation in question assumed that the tenant moved out because of the owner move-in notice, and the landlords were not able to rebut this presumption when their new tenants challenged the validity of their market rate rent. The vacant unit was therefore still subject to the previous <b>rent</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between rent control and prices of owner occupied housing {{in the presence of}} different qualities of housing. While a <b>rent</b> <b>ceiling</b> and the price of condominiums are substitutes if housing is undifferentiated, it is shown that this is not necessarily the case when housing differs in quality. A complete dismantling of rent-control may in fact increase the price of condominiums. JEL Classification: D 45, D 49, R 2...|$|E
40|$|We use {{agent-based}} {{models to}} consider <b>rent</b> <b>ceilings</b> in non-Walrasian housing markets, where bargaining between landlord and tenant leads to exchange {{at a range}} of prices. In the non-Walrasian setting agents who would be extramarginal in the Walrasian setting frequently are successful in renting, and actually account for a significant share of the units rented. This has several implications. First, <b>rent</b> <b>ceilings</b> above the Walrasian equilibrium price (WEP) can affect the market outcome. Second, <b>rent</b> <b>ceilings</b> that {{reduce the number of}} units rented do not necessarily reduce total market surplus. Finally, the distributional impact of rent controls differs from the Walrasian setting. ...|$|R

A coordinating agency and/or subsidies for new tenants would help to produce more housing, thereby increasing the pro…ts for landlords while also enabling more low income households to …nd housing...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of rent control laws in many California cities {{has led to}} a furious debate concerning its legal, economic, and social consequences. Leading scholars believe that rent control only exacerbates existing housing shortages and excludes the poor, the minority and the elderly from scarce rental housing. This article sets forth the proposition that the fixing of <b>rent</b> <b>ceilings</b> by a local government violates the federal antitrust laws and can be invalidated in federal court...|$|R
5000|$|Writing in 1946, economists Milton Friedman and George J. Stigler said: [...] "Rent ceilings, therefore, cause {{haphazard}} and arbitrary {{allocation of}} space, inefficient use of space, retardation of new construction and indefinite continuance of <b>rent</b> <b>ceilings,</b> or subsidization of new construction and a future depression in residential building."Although those paying lower than market rent are [...] "protected," [...] most economists argue that newer residents actually pay higher rent due to reduced supply.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} price {{controls}} on competitive equilibrium {{is a standard}} topic in many undergraduate economics courses. This classroom experiment demonstrates the effect of <b>rent</b> control (price <b>ceilings)</b> {{on the market for}} apartments. As participants in the experiment, students experience the effect of a price ceiling as buyers (renters) and sellers (landlords). The classroom-posted offer market exhibits a shortage under a binding price ceiling. Further, we explore a secondary response to rent control. When given the opportunity, landlords lower the quality of the apartments by reducing maintenance expenditures under the price ceiling, thus moving the market back to equilibrium. Since many students are themselves renters, they should relate to changes in quality due to lower maintenance by landlords. This experiment will stimulate discussion on market forces and on public policy aimed at restricting prices. ...|$|R
60|$|Everybody hates house agents just as {{everybody}} loves sailors. It {{is no doubt}} a very wicked and unjust hatred, but the business of a novelist is not ethical principle but facts. Everybody hates house agents because they have everybody at a disadvantage. All other callings have {{a certain amount of}} give and take; the house agent simply takes. All other callings want you; your solicitor is afraid you may change him, your doctor cannot go too far, your novelist--if only you knew it--is mutely abject towards your unspoken wishes--and as for your tradespeople, milkmen will fight outside your front door for you, and green-grocers call in tears if you discard them suddenly; but who ever heard of a house agent struggling to serve anyone? You want to get a house; you go to him, you dishevelled and angry from travel, anxious, enquiring; he calm, clean, inactive, reticent, quietly doing nothing. You beg him to reduce <b>rents,</b> whitewash <b>ceilings,</b> produce other houses, combine the summer house of No. 6 with the conservatory of No. 4--much he cares! You want to dispose of a house; then he is just the same, serene, indifferent--on one occasion I remember he was picking his teeth all the time he answered me. Competition is a mockery among house agents, they are all alike, you cannot wound them by going to the opposite office, you cannot dismiss them, you can at most dismiss yourself. They are invulnerably placed behind mahogany and brass, too far usually even for a sudden swift lunge with an umbrella, and to throw away the keys they lend you instead of returning them is larceny and punishable as such.|$|R
40|$|This article uses a new {{national}} data set to test hypotheses about mixed-income hous-ing, here defined as housing that: includes families with relatively higher incomes; is partly subsidized and partly market-rate; or has a predominance of families not dependent on welfare. We conclude that mixed-income housing usually is found in low-poverty neighborhoods. It is feasible in high-poverty neighborhoods only when there are special housing market conditions, such as immigrants {{who are willing to}} use assisted housing in poor neighborhoods as a starting point. In general, mixed-income housing does not require special rent incentives such as <b>ceiling</b> <b>rents.</b> Hous-ing that is diverse in racial and ethical terms is as likely to have a broad range of incomes as is housing in which one group predominates. This article uses the current experience of privately owned rental housing projects subsi-dized by U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs to draw lessons about the way to create mixed-income housing. These lessons are relevant both to the effort to transform public housing projects into mixed-income housing and to th...|$|R

It amended The United States Housing Act of 1937. It increased aggregate budget authority for low-income housing for fiscal year 1993 and 1994. It also extends <b>ceiling</b> <b>rents</b> , excludes certain child care expenses and excessive travel expenses from the calculation of adjusted income and apply to Indian public housing certain definitions of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act; It allows the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to issue public and Section 8 housing tenant preference rules. The Act also extends certain exemptions from waiting list requirements and eligibility restrictions with respect to income eligibility for assisted housing and while revising the family self-sufficiency program, with respect to escrow saving accounts, incentives for participation and action plans.|$|R
