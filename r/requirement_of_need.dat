Most of the research has been done in this area but we are lagging to achieve security needs. Already many models such as ADAM, DHP, LERAD and ENTROPHY are proposed to resolve security problems but we need an efficient model to detect new typesof various intrusions within the entire network. In this paper, we proposed to design a modernized intrusion detection system which consist of two methods such as anomaly and misuse detection. Both are integrated and also used to detect novel attacks. Our system proposed to discover temporal pattern of attacker behaviors, which is profiled using an algorithm EAA (Enhanced Apriori Algorithm).

Though Zinga makes Rian the new power source after Amily is too wounded to continue, she sacrifices herself to enable Ryuga to use the stolen life force to force Radan back its inactive state and then Gald reseals the castle.
