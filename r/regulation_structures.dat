50|$|Histone H2A has {{the highest}} number of known variants, some of which are {{relatively}} well characterized. H2A.X is the most common H2A variant, with the defining sequence motif ‘SQ(E/D)Φ’ (where Φ-represents a hydrophobic residue, usually Tyr in mammals). It becomes phosphorylated during the DNA damage response, chromatin remodeling, and X-chromosome inactivation in somatic cells. H2A.X and canonical H2A have diverged several times in phylogenetic history, but each H2A.X version is characterized by similar structure and function, suggesting it may represent the ancestral state.H2A.Z regulates transcription, DNA repair, suppression of antisense RNA, and RNA Polymerase II recruitment. Notable features of H2A.Z include a sequence motif ‘DEELD,’ a one amino acid insertion in L1-loop, and a one amino acid deletion in the docking domain relative to canonical H2A. Variant H2A.Z.2 was suggested to be driving the progression of malignant melanoma. Canonical H2A can be exchanged in nucleosomes for H2A.Z with special remodeling enzymes. macroH2A contains a histone fold domain and an extra, long C-terminal macro domain which can bind poly-ADP-ribose. This histone variant is used in X-inactivation and transcriptional <b>regulation.</b> <b>Structures</b> of both domains are available, but the inter-domain linker is too flexible to be crystallized.H2A.B (Barr body deficient variant) is a rapidly evolving mammal specific variant, known for its involvement in spermatogenesis. H2A.B has a shortened docking domain, which wraps around a short DNA region. H2A.L and H2A.P variants are closely related to H2A.B, but are less studied. H2A.W is a plant specific variant with SPKK motifs at the N-terminus with a putative minor-groove-binding activity. H2A.1 is a mammalian testis, oocyte and zygote specific variant. It can preferentially dimerize with H2B.1. It is so far characterized only in mouse, but a similar gene in human is available which is located {{at the end of the}} largest histone gene cluster. Currently other less extensively studied H2A variants are starting to emerge such as H2A.J.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The thermotolerance of Aspergillus fumigatus plays a {{critical}} role in mammalian and avian infections. Thus, the identification of its adaptation mechanism to higher temperature is very important for an efficient anti-fungal drug development as well as fundamental understanding of its pathogenesis. We explored the temporal transcription <b>regulation</b> <b>structure</b> of this pathogenic fungus under heat shock conditions using the time series microarray data reported by Nierman et al. (Nature 2005, 438 : 1151 - 1156). Results The estimated transcription <b>regulation</b> <b>structure</b> of A. fumigatus shows that the heat shock proteins are strongly negatively associated with central metabolic pathway genes such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and carbohydrate metabolism. It was 60 min and 120 min, respectively, after the growth temperature changes from 30 °C (corresponding to environments of tropical soil) to 37 °C and 48 °C (corresponding to temperatures in the human body and compost, respectively) that some of genes in TCA cycle were started to be upregulated. In these points, most of heat shock proteins showed lowest expression level after heat shocks. Among the heat shock proteins, the HSP 30 (AFU 6 G 06470), a single integral plasma membrane heat shock protein, presented most active role in transcription <b>regulation</b> <b>structure</b> in both heat shock conditions of 37 °C and 48 °C. The metabolic genes associated with multiple genes in the gene regulation network showed a tendency to have opposite expression patterns of heat shock proteins. The role of those metabolic genes was second regulator in the coherent feed-forward loop type of <b>regulation</b> <b>structure</b> having heat shock protein as its first regulator. This type of <b>regulation</b> <b>structure</b> might be very advantageous for the thermal adaptation of A. fumigatus under heat shock because a small amount of heat shock proteins can rapidly magnify their regulation effect on target genes. However, the coherent feed-forward loop type of regulation of heat shock proteins with metabolic genes became less frequent with increasing temperature. This might be the reason for dramatic increase in the expression of heat shock proteins and the number of heat shock response genes at heat shock of 48 °C. Conclusion We systemically analysed the thermal adaption mechanism of A. fumigatus by state space model with times series microarray data in terms of transcription <b>regulation</b> <b>structure.</b> We suggest {{for the first time that}} heat shock proteins might efficiently regulate metabolic genes using the coherent feed-forward loop type of <b>regulation</b> <b>structure.</b> This type of <b>regulation</b> <b>structure</b> would also be efficient for adjustment to the other stresses requiring rapid change of metabolic mode as well as thermal adaptation. </p...|$|R

Recently we identified the main <b>regulation</b> <b>structures</b> of metabolic pathways through the manually curated reconstruction of the regulatory networks of Bacillus subtilis [1]. We noticed a strong interplay between the metabolic pathways and the genetic regulations: 13 % of 456 metabolites are involved in genetic regulations and 53 % of the genes involved in metabolic pathways are directly regulated by a genetic regulator {{under the control of}} a metabolite. Surprisingly, few studies centred on metabolic pathways have considered this coupling between the genetic and metabolic regulatory networks [2 - 3].

40|$|The Hydraulic {{performance}} of structures provided for regulation in irrigation canals {{is influenced by}} many parameters such as type of flow control, type and frequency of adjustments, and topographical features of sub-systems that they are installed. The irrigation systems in Sri Lanka mostly designed for up-stream discharge control operation, with manually/mechanically adjusted gated structures, under steady state flow conditions. Further, topographical features of many gravity irrigation systems are varying at sub-system level due to presence of single and double bank reaches, inclusion of in-lined storage tanks. However, irrigation systems are operated under varying flow regime due to scheduled or unscheduled flows in water delivery. The adjustments of gates in structures in such situations are done by manually/mechanically by operators at different frequencies. Therefore these situations are analyzed by hydraulic simulations using SIC hydraulic model for three different topographical sub-systems under different frequency of adjustments. The actual performance in water delivery is evaluated by effective volume of water delivered, timeliness in water delivery, at the final delivery location while maintaining on-line water adequacy through delivery points along the canal. The results will provide guidance for operation of <b>regulation</b> <b>structures</b> for effective conveyance of water under varying flow conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{relative}} market power hypothesis (RMPH) {{and the theory}} of efficient structure hypothesis (ESH) have radically contrasting implications for merger and antitrust policy. Advocates of the RMPH tend to see antitrust enforcement as socially beneficial, while advocates of the ESH tend to see policies that inhibit mergers as socially costly. Previous empirical tests of these hypotheses in banking have yielded mixed results. Important determinants of bank performance such as different <b>regulation</b> <b>structures</b> and bank size have not been simultaneously incorporated when analyzing these two hypothesis. This paper reexamine the structure-performance relationship for banks of different size under different regimes by using a stochastic cost frontier methodology to estimate both X-inefficiency and scale inefficiency scores for individual banks of different sizes that operate under different regimes. These inefficiency scores are then utilized to test RMPH and ESH. These tests, in turn, serve us as a guideline as to how changes in regulation and market system affect social welfare. The results show support for ESH and suggest that in an ever growing integrated financial system, banks can beneficiate significantly from {{the implementation of a}} universal banking system. 3 Reevaluation of the Market Structure Performance Relationship for Banks under Different Regime...|$|E
