50|$|Hummer H1s {{have other}} unusual features, such as inboard brakes and portal gears {{that allow the}} drivetrain's half shafts a higher placement, for greater ground clearance. The {{radiator}} is up high, sloping over the engine on a forward-hinged hood. The air intake is high-mount, enabling the H1 to ford waist-level water. Rather than using simple <b>runflat</b> tires, magnesium-aluminum alloy or rubber inserts are an optional feature for <b>runflat</b> ability.|$|E
50|$|Hutchinson Industries is a Trenton, New Jersey-based {{military}} manufacturer {{that produces}} <b>runflats</b> for the United States Armed Forces.|$|R
50|$|The men go to talk <b>Runflat's</b> other brother, J, {{trying to}} find out the {{location}} of the gun deal, during the confrontation, Ben accidentally shoots J, who subsequently reveals that the deal will take place at an old abandoned warehouse at 9 PM.|$|R
50|$|The Prime Minister of Spain and Deputy Prime Minister of Spain both use Audi vehicles. The premier's Audi A8L was {{purchased}} in March 2005 shortly after retiring the former A8 used by PM José María Aznar. The vehicle, which then cost the Spanish government well over 380,000 Euros (approx. $520,000 USD), {{is said to}} be equipped with the latest features, <b>runflats,</b> level B7+ armouring, satellite communications and various special items that are kept secret by the Spanish officials. The fleet has been renovated and now includes various new Audi A8L, Mercedes-Benz S600 and A6s, although former prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero wanted to swap those cars for the hybrid Toyota Prius to save fuel oil.|$|R
50|$|Upset at James, Ben {{refuses to}} go home and instead takes a 1-26 call to respond to a {{disturbance}} at a strip club, where two men get into a mexican standoff with James and Ben, which Ben thinks it's another joke call, so he fools around. James subdues the men, and the two are then tipped off about a gun deal involving Omar's men. Ben then confronts James about the 1-26's. James receives a call from Santiago in the car, when he finds out that <b>Runflat</b> had turned himself in, Ben says how Runflat's brother in the park said that <b>Runflat</b> had just got out of prison. James then contradicts, saying that <b>Runflat</b> hadn't been in prison for over two years, leading to another clue.|$|E
5000|$|In this system, {{there is}} an {{additional}} support ring or insert attached to the wheel that can support {{the weight of the}} vehicle {{in the event of a}} loss of pressure. The <b>runflat</b> insert, because of its unsurpassed ability to carry heavy vehicle loads for long distances at high speeds, is the normal <b>runflat</b> selection for military vehicles, high-level executive protection vehicles, and [...] "armored" [...] vehicles used by government, aid groups, or private contractors in conflict zones.|$|E
50|$|Additional cast {{includes}} Gary Owen as Crazy Cody, Jay Pharoah as <b>Runflat,</b> David Banner as Pawnshop Jay, Dragoș Bucur as Marko, Gary Weeks as Dr. Cowan, Jacob Latimore as Ramone and Benjamin Flores, Jr. as Morris, Runflat's brother.|$|E
50|$|Several brands, {{including}} Michelin and Recaro, {{were involved}} {{with the development of}} the Fluence. For example, Michelin contributed tires with PAX technology (similar to <b>Runflat),</b> BS tooling manufactured the 22 in aerodynamic alloy wheels, and Recaro developed the seats.|$|E
50|$|Gearbox is a fully {{automatic}} ZF unit, this coupled to a two-speed transfer case. The planetary hub-reduction drive axles have disc brakes and feature a central tire inflation system (CTIS) and anti-lock brakes (ABS). Tyres are 385/80R 20, wheels featuring <b>runflat</b> inserts as standard.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a Detroit Diesel/MTU Friedrichshafen 926 {{turbo-diesel}} with [...] and 959 lbft Nm torque. There was optional rear wheel steering, {{along with a}} central tire inflation system and VFI <b>runflat</b> tires. It was capable of fording water at depth of 30" [...] (60" [...] with preparation). It featured an electronically controlled braking (ABS) system and electronic stability control (ECS). There was 30 kW onboard electrical power and 10 kW mobile power.|$|E
50|$|Since 1991, the Colombian Presidential {{vehicles}} {{have usually}} been BMWs. In 2006, the Presidential fleet included four armoured BMW 7-Series and several units of Toyota Land Cruiser 100, whose level of armour {{is a state}} secret. These BMWs and Toyotas are equipped with GPS and <b>runflat</b> tires. The motorcade {{is made up of}} 3 BMWs plus 5 Toyota 100s all armored plus a Prado armored level IIIA for Police Escort and an ambulance and no less than 8 motorcycles. All the vehicles have presidential tags.|$|E
50|$|Militarisation {{packages}} and modification are extensive and range from basic to near-tactical, and can include air-conditioning and/ or an auxiliary heater to manage extreme climate conditions, blackout lighting, NATO trailer coupling, rifle brackets in the cab, a roof hatch for observation and/or {{a machine gun}} mount, and steel bumpers with black out lights. To enhance mobility, single tyred axles (with differential locks) are available, these with a central tyre inflation system (CTIS) and <b>runflat</b> inserts if required. More extensive militarisation can include a fording capability of up to 750 mm, a self-recovery winch, and military-specific electrics/electronics and communication/ command equipment.|$|E
50|$|Standard tires {{fitted to}} the MTVR are Michelin 1600 R20 XZL {{and with the}} {{exception}} of the MK36 wrecker variant, no spare is carried. Compensating for no spare is a <b>runflat</b> setting option on the CTIS. CTIS allows the driver to adjust tyre pressures to suit both payload and terrain conditions, from the driving seat. The two-piece bolt-together steel wheel rims are fitted with beadlocks for extreme low-pressure operations and tires will remain seated at pressures down to 10 psi. In the event that any one tire should fail totally, a limp-home facility allows for a second axle suspension unit to be raised and secured.|$|E
5000|$|After {{picking up}} Ben and {{taking him to}} the police station, James tells {{dispatch}} to give him all the 1-26's that are called into the station. James makes Ben {{take care of all}} the 1-26's. James then arrives at the park to question an informant <b>Runflat,</b> about a connection of Serbia and [...] "Omar". He finds out that a shipment will come in later that day. After leaving the park, James takes Ben to the local shooting range where he finds out that Zastava M92's have been given to the store, Ben realizes he has a clue for James. When a 1-26 is called in, Ben and James are called to the Sweet Auburn Curb Market where a drunk man named Crazy Cody is being disorderly. Ben tries to subdue him but is unable to, so James arrests him.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} a heavily {{modified}} Chevrolet Suburban equipped with protective armor, <b>runflat</b> tires, vehicle transponder, and turbocharger. The most obvious feature is a configurable antennae platform {{mounted on the}} roof. This contains a large SATCOM dome containing a tracking dish {{that serves as the}} data uplink and downlink as the primary communications path for the motorcade. Also on the roof are smaller VHF antennas that serve as a repeater for the other motorcade elements as well as another communications path to local authorities and the onsite WHCA office. VHF antennae configuration changes according to the mission operational requirements. This also serves as the hub for the LCP or Limousine Control Package that allows C2 functions to be performed from USSS control cars, presidential parade limo or presidential suburban. 22 of these vehicles were built by Assurance Technology Corporation in Carlisle, MA and developed with NRL (Naval Research Laboratory).|$|E
50|$|The Hunter TR-12's crew {{compartment}} is a mono-hull mounted on an independent chassis. It provides Level B6 (Standard EN 1063) protection levels, offering protection against rifle fire and ambushes. Each {{side of the}} hull has equipped two small armored windows and firing ports. Two doors are mounted {{at the front of}} each side of the {{crew compartment}} with small window and firing port. The Hunter TR-12 can mount a 360 degree roof turret with an M60 machine gun, an M2HB-QCB machine gun, or a Mk 19 grenade launcher. Weapons can be fitted to a remote weapons station. Its 4×4 chassis and <b>runflat</b> tires can handle off-road terrain. The vehicle has a crew of two and is capable of carrying 10 troops. The standard configuration has one spare wheel at the rear and comes with search lights and a thermal camera. It can be optionally fitted with blackout lights, a snorkel, and front winch.|$|E
50|$|The Humvee seats 4 with an {{available}} {{fully enclosed}} metal cabin with a vertical windshield. The body is constructed from lightweight and rust-resistant aluminum, instead of conventional steel. It has all-wheel drive with an independent suspension and helical gear-reduction hubs similar to portal axles which attach towards the top rather than {{center of each}} wheel to allow the drivetrain shafts to be raised for a full 16 in of ground clearance. The body is mounted on a narrow steel frame with boxed rails and five cross members for rigidity. The rails act as sliders to protect the drivetrain which is nestled between and above the rails. Raising the drivetrain into the cabin area and lowering the seats into the frame creates a massive chest-high transmission hump which separates passengers on each side and lowers the overall center of gravity compared to most trucks where the body and passengers are above the frame. The vehicle also has disc brakes on all 4 wheels, and 4-wheel double-wishbone suspension. The brake discs are not mounted at the wheels as on conventional automobiles, but are inboard, attached {{to the outside of}} each differential. The front and rear differentials are Torsen type, and the center differential is a regular, lockable type. Torque-biasing differentials allows forward movement as long as at least one wheel has traction. It runs on specialized 37 × 12.5 radial tires with low-profile <b>runflat</b> devices. Some HMMWVs are equipped with an optional central tire inflation system (CTIS), which enables pressure to be lowered for soft ground or raised for hard pavement. While it is optimized for off-road mobility, it can drive at highway speeds of 55 mph at maximum weight with a top speed of 70 mph.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} about areas of a non-assembling diagnostics {{according to an}} EUSAMA methodology. Result of the methodology is a technical condition examination of dampers. However with regard to testing of whole suspension and damping vehicle system are results distorted by influence of other vehicle components. EUSAMA needed improvements because of new super light city vehicles and vehicles with <b>runflat</b> tires. Goal of thesis is addition criterion for the EUSAMA {{which can be used}} in current EUSAMA suspension testers. Problems are solved by a virtual simulation where is created a model of real vehicle FIAT 500...|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art {{development}} {{in the field of}} tire technology do show a clear trend toward extended-mobility-tires. These tires - also known as <b>runflat</b> tires - have reinforced side walls to guarantee basic mobility properties even in the case of air pressure loss. Since the individual layers as well as the complete build up are different to traditional tire technology, the enhanced layer stiffness generates higher loads to the rim flanges, wheel well and wheel disc. Although these tires seem to be perfectly compatible to conventional wheels with regard to design and mounting process, the stress loading as well as the structural durability of the wheel may be an issue, which has to be examined carefully: Are the design and cross-sectional properties of the wheels appropriate for the complete life cycle of the vehicle? Since automotive wheels are relevant for operational safety, these parts must not fail causing an accident. This has to be ensured by experimental methods such as rig based durability tests. While simplified test procedures such as cornering fatigue tests or radial fatigue tests do not cover the complete load mechanics by the tire, the unique BiAxial Wheel Fatigue Test facilities (ZWARP) were used to generate technical expertise in the field of <b>runflat</b> tires and their relation to the loading of the wheels. Since both loading as well as assembly interaction in the ZWARP are incorporated in a realistic manner, costs and time are saved due to an appropriate accelerated life testing and the elimination of specialized on-road testing...|$|E
