In order to obtain a three-dimensional analytical solution of the Viscous-elastic half-space with the moving loads of different speeds, the Laplace transform and <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate</b> transformation in cylindrical coordinates are used. Then, the IFFT and <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate</b> transformation are used to solve two-dimensional infinite integration which can greatly improve the operational efficiency. The rules {{of response}}s of different velocities from the results by using the principle of dynamics and energy dissipation are also analyzed and induced in this paper, and obtain the incentives of displacement distortion by the super-Rayleigh wave velocity at surface.

40|$|Abstract — Scalable network {{localization}} is key for realizing ad-hoc networks. In {{this paper}} we propose a localization scheme where nodes form a <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate</b> system of the network in a distributed manner. Each node in the adhoc network is capable of estimating both the range and orientation of its 1 -hop neighbors. The proposed localization scheme then achieves a <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate</b> system for any topology as long as the underlying graph is connected, irrespective of the node density. We evaluate the performace of the proposed scheme and show with simulations that it is more scalable than a similar localization scheme that uses triangulation. We also present propagation of localization error in the network due to estimation errors in both the range and the orientation. We also discuss how this scheme can be implemented using optical wireless technology. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a few-body mixture of two bosonic components, each {{consisting of two}} particles confined in a quasi one-dimensional harmonic trap. By means of exact diagonalization with a correlated basis approach we obtain the low-energy spectrum and eigenstates for {{the whole range of}} repulsive intra- and inter-component interaction strengths. We analyse the eigenvalues {{as a function of the}} inter-component coupling, covering hereby all the limiting regimes, and characterize the behaviour in-between these regimes by exploiting the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Provided with this knowledge we study the breathing dynamics in the linear-response regime by slightly quenching the trap frequency symmetrically for both components. Depending on the choice of interactions strengths, we identify 1 to 3 monopole modes besides the breathing mode of the center of mass coordinate. For the uncoupled mixture each monopole mode corresponds to the breathing oscillation of a specific <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate.</b> Increasing the inter-component coupling first leads to multi-mode oscillations in each <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate,</b> which turn into single-mode oscillations of the same frequency in the composite-fermionization regime.
