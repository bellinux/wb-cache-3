40|$|This study {{presents}} a Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) methodology <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> design. At present, many Chinese semi-trailer enterprises have low design level and their products {{often have a}} relatively short life-span. To solve this problem, {{it is necessary to}} integrate intelligent design process into semi-trailer design. Then a rapid design system <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> based on KBE is put forward. Combining with the UG development tools (KF, UDF, Part Family and Reuse Library), CBR (Case-Based Reasoning), parametric modeling and knowledge integration techniques, the rapid design system <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> is realized. The system provides appropriate suggestions and supports to promote working efficiency. Besides, it also achieves knowledge reuse and accumulation, improves the design quality and significantly reduces the design cycle...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to obtain an insight into various secondary braking systems for goods vehicles. Practical tests were carried out with a tractor- semi-trailer combination. The performance of various split braking systems as well as spring brake actuators are shown. With {{nearly all of the}} secondary braking systems it is possible to obtain sufficient deceleration to meet legal <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> the braking path. The critical point however is lateral stability. The report concludes with recommendations <b>for</b> legal <b>requirements</b> concerning lateral stability both on dry and on wet road surfaces. It is concluded that: lateral stability must be obtained on both a dry and a wet road surface; tractors <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> should have a split braking system; and service brakes for motor vehicles and trailers (semi-trailers) should have a certain braking capacity in case a failure occurs (emergency braking capacity). As a solution it is proposed that the emergency braking capacity of the service brake shall be at least 50 % of the normal required capacity...|$|R
50|$|Walther {{followed}} {{the design of}} the cast steel wheel for solid rubber tires with the design of a cast steel wheel for pneumatic tires and then the design of an improved brake drum. When semi-trailer trucks were developed, he designed improved versions of the fifth wheel and landing legs <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks. Walther’s engineering skills resulted in patents for many developments of truck wheels, brake drums, fifth wheels, and landing legs that have helped to expand the role of trucks in the transportation industry.|$|R
50|$|When {{vehicles}} {{enter the}} cross-over area, unless markings {{on the ground}} indicate two turning lanes in the cross-over, drivers form one lane. A cross-over with two lanes is designed at high-volume cross-overs, or when the right lane turns onto an intersecting street. In this case, the right lane is reserved for vehicles completing the design. Most cross overs must be made large enough <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks to complete the cross over. This large cross-over area often leads to two vehicles incorrectly lining up at a single cross-over.|$|R
5|$|Since June 2011, the E751 {{comprises}} the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y. The tolls there {{are based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed-toll system. Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailers,</b> depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is used by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|R
