25|$|Newspapers often refine {{distribution}} of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change {{to reflect the}} location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising—the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial—or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, {{but there will be}} different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising <b>rate</b> <b>card</b> provides a good example of editioning.|$|E

40|$|An {{option is}} {{embedded}} in credit cards. Since credit cards offer open credit lines, cardholders can borrow at the same terms when they become riskier. This option value raises the zero-profit <b>card</b> <b>rate.</b> Furthermore, adverse selection occurs if cardholders are better informed about the probability of becoming riskier {{in the future and}} borrow more when they become riskier. The adverse selection can limit rate competition and keep the <b>card</b> <b>rate</b> above the zero-profit <b>card</b> <b>rate.</b> An up-front fee is not a good alternative because it is also vulnerable to adverse selection. A low introductory <b>card</b> <b>rate</b> is an effective way to avoid the adverse selection problem when asymmetric information is mainly about the change in the borrower's risk profile in the future, as opposed to the riskiness in the present period.

This paper endeavors to explain the rates in the Turkish market using measures of non-price competition. In this market, issuers compete monopolistically by differentiating their credit card products. The fact that credit cards and all other banking services are perceived as a bundle by consumers allows banks to deploy also bank level characteristics to differentiate their credit cards. Thus, credit <b>card</b> <b>rates</b> are expected to be affected by the features and service quality of banks. Panel data estimations also control for various costs associated with credit card lending. The results show significant and robust effects of the non-price competition variables on credit <b>card</b> <b>rates.</b> ...|$|R
