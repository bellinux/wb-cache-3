They are analogous to human shoes and are most common in sled dog races. Many races require booties as a basic element of dog care. The Yukon Quest Sled Dog Race, for example, requires mushers to carry no fewer than eight booties per dog.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{materials of}} modern tires are synthetic rubber, natural <b>rubber,</b> <b>fabric</b> and wire, {{along with other}} compound chemicals. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body ensures support. Before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Today, {{the vast majority of}} tires are pneumatic inflatable structures, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion. Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as cars, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, earthmovers, and aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber, natural <b>rubber,</b> <b>fabric</b> and wire, along with carbon black and other chemical compounds. They {{consist of a}} tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air. Before rubber was developed, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including cars, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks, heavy equipment, and aircraft. Metal tires are still used on locomotives and railcars, and solid rubber (or other polymer) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications, such as some casters, carts, lawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.|$|E

50|$|Inflatable rubber dams are {{cylindrical}} <b>rubber</b> <b>fabrics</b> placed across channels, {{streams and}} weir or dam crests {{to raise the}} upstream water level when inflated. The membrane is a multi-layer fabric made of synthetic fibre (usually nylon) and rubberised on one or both sides. The fabric is quite flexible and yet exhibits good wear-resistance characteristics. A layer of stainless steel mesh or ceramic chips can be embedded in the surface layer to reduce or prevent vandal damage.|$|R

5000|$|The modern game {{originated}} in the late 19th century {{as a form of}} rugby football, played in rivers in England and Scotland, with a small 3 to 4 inch ball constructed of rubber imported from colonial plantations in India. This [...] "water rugby" [...] came to be called [...] "water polo" [...] based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, pulu. The original ball soon gave way to a football (soccer ball), which allowed for passing and swimming above water with the ball. However, the leather football absorbed water and became extremely heavy, slippery and out-of-control when wet. In 1936, James R. ("Jimmy") Smith, California water polo coach and {{author of several books on}} water polo mechanics, developed a ball made with an inflatable bladder and a <b>rubber</b> <b>fabric</b> cover, which improved performance. [...] The new ball was red, but by 1948 yellow was adopted for better visibility by players. It became the official FINA and Olympic ball in 1956.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} shed (which {{doubled as}} a hangar) {{was designed by}} Vickers and built from the wall of Cavendish Dock at their [...] "Naval Construction Yard" [...] in Barrow, out to piles driven into the basin floor. It contained a float on which construction of the airship took place and which could {{be taken out of}} the shed together with the airship. Beginning in 1909, the work was due to be completed in August that year and the ship delivered two months later, but in June trouble occurred with driving the piles into the floor of the dock. Consequently, the shed was not completed until June 1910, at which point the actual construction of HMA No. 1 could begin. A screen was erected in the dock together with a newly designed 38 ft-high floating mooring mast that was capable of withstanding a steady pull of 80 tons (81 tonnes). A large safety margin had been allowed; the maximum load the ship would exert on the mast was calculated to be approximately 4 tons (4 tonnes) in a wind of 80 mph. [...] In preparation for the completion of Mayfly, crew training commenced on 25 February 1910, covering important skills such as working the <b>rubber</b> <b>fabric</b> (carried out at Messrs Short Brothers works, Battersea, London), instructions in petrol engines at Vickers works, and instruction in signals, aeronautics and meteorology.|$|E
5000|$|Over the years, both {{technical}} and rule changes affected {{the character of}} the game. In 1928, Hungarian water polo coach Béla Komjádi invented the [...] "air pass," [...] or [...] "dry pass", a technique in which a player directly passes the ball through the air to another player, who receives it without the ball hitting the water. Previously, players would let the ball drop in the water first and then reach out for it, but the dry pass made the offensive game more dynamic, and contributed to Hungarian dominance of water polo for 60 years. In 1936, James R. ("Jimmy") Smith, California water polo coach and {{author of several books on}} water polo mechanics, developed a water polo ball made with an inflatable bladder and a <b>rubber</b> <b>fabric</b> cover, which improved performance. The previous leather ball absorbed water and became heavier during the game. In 1949, rule changes allowed play to continue uninterrupted after a referee whistled an ordinary foul, speeding up play. In the 1970s, the exclusion foul replaced a point system for major fouls; players guilty of this foul were excluded for a 1-minute penalty and their team forced to play with fewer players. Possession of the ball was limited to 45 seconds before a scoring attempt. Time of penalties and possession has been reduced since then. The direct shot on goal from the seven (7) meter line after a free throw was allowed in 1994, and changed to a five-meter shot in 2005.|$|E

40|$|Wasted Truck Tyres {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} for concrete coarse aggregate. The used tyres of truck are properly cutted and different ratios can be added to concrete blocks. The main components of modern tyres are synthetic rubber, natural <b>rubber,</b> <b>fabric</b> and wire, along with carbon black and chemical compounds. In the present paper, Truck Tyres are used as conventional coarse aggregate in concrete for high strength (M 50 Grade) concrete for every incremental of 25 % replacement up to 100 % is done. Slump cone test, Vee-Bee consistometer test and Compaction factor test are conducted to find freshness of concrete. The concrete is casted in cubes to harden it, tests such as compressive strength, cylinders for split tensile strength and prisms for flexural strength for 7 days, 14 days and 28 days curing are done. The results obtained are compared with conventional coarse aggregate (0 % replacement) concrete...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{reflects}} principally on {{the work}} of South African artist Nicholas Hlobo, born in Cape Town in 1975, who has, in a relatively short space of time, achieved international art-world visibility for his sculptural objects made from <b>rubber,</b> <b>fabric,</b> and found objects (often including wood, soap, and colonial-era furniture). I draw for the purposes of comparison {{on the work}} of photographer Zanele Muholi (born in 1972 in Umlazi, Durban), an artist-activist whose primary concern is, in her own words, to present ‘positive imagery of black queers (especially lesbians) in South African society and beyond’ (Muholi 2010 online; Williamson 2009 130). Both artists are well known in South African art circles for work that, although in different media, intervenes in the fields of local gender politics and anxieties about the body politic and the politics of the body — this in a country in which, despite guarantees of freedom from {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexuality, it remains dangerous to be identified publicly as lesbian, gay, or transgender...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} are presented {{of the performance}} of the Anaconda, a wave energy converter comprising a submerged water-filled distensible tube aligned with the incident waves. Experiments were carried out at a scale of around 1 : 25 with a 250 mm diameter tube, 7 m long, constructed of <b>rubber</b> and <b>fabric,</b> terminating in a linear power take-off of adjustable impedance. The paper presents some basic theory that leads to predictions of distensibility and bulge wave speed in a pressurised compound <b>rubber</b> and <b>fabric</b> tube, including the effects of inelastic sectors in the circumference, longitudinal tension, and the surrounding fluid. Results are shown to agree closely with measurements in still water. The theory is developed further to provide a model for the propagation of bulges and power conversion in the Anaconda. In the presence of external water waves the theory identifies three distinct internal wave components and provides theoretical estimates of power capture. For the first time, these and other predictions of the behaviour of the Anaconda, a device unlike almost all other marine systems, are shown to be in remarkably close agreement with measurements...|$|R

5000|$|Vehicle mats {{generally}} {{come in two}} options: either <b>rubber</b> or carpet <b>fabric.</b> These {{differ in}} a number of ways, and each material provides advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other.

50|$|A further {{development}} is the pelletron, where the <b>rubber</b> or <b>fabric</b> belt {{is replaced by a}} chain of short conductive rods connected by insulating links, and the air-ionizing electrodes are replaced by a grounded roller and inductive charging electrode. The chain can be operated at much greater velocity than a belt, and both the voltage and currents attainable are much greater than with a conventional Van de Graaff generator. The 14 UD Heavy Ion Accelerator at The Australian National University houses a 15-million-volt pelletron. Its chains are more than 20 meters long and can travel faster than 50 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Materials include steel (in {{the form}} of links or cables), polyurethane, <b>rubber,</b> and <b>fabric.</b> The original-style steel-link chains are also {{available}} {{in a variety of}} carbon steel and steel alloys and link shapes. Link shapes include standard, twisted, square, and reinforced. The shape of the links changes the flexibility, grip, and strength of the chain. The links can also have added studs or V-bars for an even more aggressive traction. The use of alloy steel and hardened steel adds durability. Traction cables (cable chains, snow cables) attach like chains but are made from cable rather than chain.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{self-sealing}} tanks {{have multiple}} layers of <b>rubber</b> and reinforcing <b>fabric,</b> one of vulcanized rubber and one of untreated natural rubber, which can absorb fuel, swell and expand when it comes {{into contact with the}} fuel.
