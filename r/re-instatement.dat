5|$|However, his <b>re-instatement</b> {{was short}} lived, as the {{navigation}} ceased {{to operate in}} January 1869, the last month in which tolls were collected. Mortgages of £19,708 were outstanding, of which £2,607 dated from the original construction by Pyott. A plan to buy the waterway by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt to buy the navigation was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea. He created a company called the Itchen Navigation Ltd, with a capital of £20,000, but {{they were unable to}} establish who owned it, and so the company never traded.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before Leo's {{death in}} May 912, the emperor {{reconciled}} himself with Nicholas Mystikos, who now demanded his <b>re-instatement</b> as Patriarch. The sources are unclear, but shortly after Leo's death, or perhaps already before, Euthymius was deposed by a synod convened at Magnaura {{in favour of}} Nicholas, who was recalled from exile. Euthymius was exiled to Agathou, where he died on 5 August 917.|$|E
25|$|This {{move was}} highly {{controversial}} and on 12 November 2000 about 80,000 marched in protest at their continued exclusion. South Sydney challenged {{the decision in}} the Federal Court claiming that the NRL agreement was exclusionary, intended to unfairly exclude South Sydney, and breached the Trade Practices Act. Justice Paul Finn ruled that the agreement did not specifically exclude any club and dismissed the Rabbitohs' claims for <b>re-instatement</b> into the national competition. Souths appealed this decision and were re-admitted into the competition in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian {{state was}} legally a kingdom, {{but it had}} no king, as the Allied powers would not have tolerated any <b>re-instatement</b> of the Habsburg dynasty. The country {{retained}} its parliamentary system following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, with a prime minister appointed as head of government. As head of state, Horthy retained significant influence through his constitutional powers and the loyalty of his ministers to the crown. Although his involvement in drafting legislation was minuscule, he nevertheless {{had the ability to}} ensure that laws passed by the Hungarian parliament conformed to his political preferences.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009 Secretary of State for Transport Lord Adonis {{announced}} {{a plan to}} increase frequency on the line by allowing Hertfordshire County Council to lease the line from Network Rail and converting it to light rail from 2011. It was hoped {{that this would be}} possible for the same amount of subsidy the line received, as the new infrastructure required, such as a passing loop would be cheaper for light rail than heavy rail. Longer-term proposals envisaged extensions into Watford town centre via Clarendon Road and High Street, and St Albans city centre, possibly as far as St Albans City railway station, and possible <b>re-instatement</b> of the line to Hatfield.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{delivered}} {{an apology}} and the Canadian government announced a compensation package, {{one month after}} President Ronald Reagan made similar gestures in the United States. The package for interned Japanese Canadians included $21,000 to each surviving internee, and the <b>re-instatement</b> of Canadian citizenship {{to those who were}} deported to Japan. The agreement also awarded $12 million to the NAJC to promote human rights and support the community, and $24 million for the establishment of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation to push for the elimination of racism. Nothing was given for those that had been interned and died before compensation was given out.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been issues {{with the use of}} false DMCA {{takedown}} notices. Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a lawsuit is required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer can just claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses). In addition, the technical process of removal and <b>re-instatement</b> of content on Second Life is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.|$|E
500|$|In 1961 Bessie's {{aldermanic}} term on Liverpool's council expired. That year, the Conservatives briefly {{took control}} of the council, and used their majority to block her reappointment. This ended 31 years' service on the council. In 1963, when Labour regained control, she did not seek <b>re-instatement.</b> The year 1963 saw the publication of The Braddocks, [...] in which Bessie made a sustained attack on communism and Trotskyism: [...] "The purpose of this book is to bring home to the rank and file how wide that influence is... unless positive steps are taken by the workers themselves... democracy will be dead". Reviewing the book for the Socialist Standard, Lawrence Weidberg thought it gave a useful picture of early 20th century working-class life in Liverpool, but concluded that [...] "from the evidence of this book the Braddocks qualified fully for the role of blind leaders of the blind".|$|E

2500|$|Like other revolutionary {{societies}}, the Young Turks {{had their}} origins in secret societies of [...] "progressive medical university students and military cadets", namely the Young Ottomans, driven underground {{along with all}} political dissent after the Constitution of 1876 was abolished and the First Constitutional Era brought to a close by Abdul Hamid II in 1878 after only two years.

2500|$|On September 13, Kotomitsuki {{filed an}} {{injunction}} with the Tokyo District Court seeking his <b>re-instatement</b> to sumo, arguing {{that he had}} not been given a full explanation for his dismissal and that he was made an unfair example by the Sumo Association in comparison with the lighter punishment given to all the other wrestlers who admitted gambling (a one-tournament suspension). On November 30 a group of fans calling themselves [...] "Save Kotomitsuki" [...] handed in a petition with 58,000 signatures to the Sumo Association asking that he either be re-instated or that his expulsion be revised to a retirement, allowing him to remain in the Association as an elder.|$|E

Their teams {{are known as}} the [...] "Scarlet Raptors." [...] In 2006, Rutgers–Camden won the NCAA Division III Softball championship, defeating two-time defending champion St. Thomas, 3-2 to capture the school's first national title. Rutgers–Camden basketball also holds the unfortunate distinction of the longest losing streak in college basketball, set in 1997. The team was disbanded, but student outcry lead to a <b>re-instatement.</b> Rutgers–Camden broke its NCAA-record 117-game losing streak with a 77-72 victory over Bloomfield College.|$|E
2500|$|When Cobra returns a {{few years}} later in the , Hawk lobbies for the <b>re-instatement</b> of the G.I. Joe team. He is successful, and {{publicly}} announces the reinstatement of the G.I. Joe team, which is seen by members of Cobra. However, he does not re-assume full command, passing on leadership responsibility to Duke, while he takes on more of an advisory role. This is so he can devote time to {{keeping an eye on the}} Jugglers, a cabal of generals with an agenda of their own. He also mentions that several younger officers have nicknamed him [...] "General Tomahawk". When Scarlett and Snake Eyes are taken prisoner by Destro, Hawk sends Kamakura and Spirit to find Cobra Commander's son Billy, who helps them rescue Scarlett and Snake Eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Parnell {{fought back}} desperately, despite his failing health. On 10 December, {{he arrived in}} Dublin to a hero's welcome. He and his {{followers}} forcibly seized {{the offices of the}} party paper United Irishman. His prestige had a year before reached new heights, but the crisis crippled this support, and most rural nationalists turned against him. In the December North Kilkenny by-election, he attracted Fenian [...] "hillside men" [...] to his side. This ambiguity shocked former adherents, who clashed physically with his supporters; his candidate lost by almost two to one. Deposed as leader, he fought a long and fierce campaign for <b>re-instatement.</b> He conducted a political tour of Ireland to re-establish popular support. In a North Sligo by-election, the defeat of his candidate by 2,493 votes to 3,261 was less resounding.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 July 1939, NZR RM class Standard railcars began {{operating}} a service between Napier and Wairoa, {{and when the}} line to Gisborne was completed, the Gisborne Express was introduced on 7 September 1942, running from Wellington through to Gisborne. [...] This service typically operated twice weekly except for holiday periods when it was more frequent, but it ceased to operate in 1955 {{and was replaced by}} more efficient railcars except for occasional <b>re-instatement</b> during holiday periods to cater for heavy loads. [...] By this time, railcars had already replaced the Napier Express; in 1954, the daily express was replaced by twice daily services run initially by Standard railcars and then by 88 seaters. [...] This markedly quickened the journey from Napier to Wellington from 7 hours to 5.5 hours. [...] The railcars entered into service to Gisborne on 1 August 1955 and also ran twice daily; one return service terminated in Napier while one went through to Wellington.|$|E
2500|$|With the 39th BC general {{election}} coming in May 2009, Trevena was acclaimed as the BC NDP candidate in October 2008. The BC Liberals selected {{former chief of}} the Kwakiutl First Nation Marion Wright to face Trevena in what was projected to be a competitive race but which Trevena easily won. In the 39th Parliament of British Columbia Trevena became one of two assistant deputy speakers. In that role, she travelled to Kenya to attend a conference for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, along with the speaker Bill Barisoff. She joined with fellow NDP MLAs Scott Fraser and Lana Popham, {{in conjunction with the}} Western Canada Wilderness Committee, in lobbying for the stop to old-growth logging on Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland. In the Harmonized Sales Tax debate, Trevena called for the Select Standing Committee on Finance to conduct public consultation across the province but ultimately opposed its implementation on the basis its fewer exemptions compared to Provincial Sales Tax and the increased control the HST would give to the federal government on taxation matters. In November 2010, Trevena emerged as one of thirteen NDP MLAs to call for a leadership convention over the leadership of Carol James. Trevena had been critical of the party a year earlier at a BC NDP convention when she criticized the neglect of the party's [...] "Sustainable BC" [...] vision during the 2009 election but did not publicly come out against James' leadership, as Bob Simpson was removed from caucus in October for public dissent, until Katrine Conroy resigned as caucus whip. After threats of discipline and mediation efforts failed and James resigned, Trevena immediately stated she was not running for the leadership position. Instead, in mid-March 2011, she endorsed John Horgan in the leadership race, though Adrian Dix went on to win. Dix moved Trevena from assistant deputy speaker to opposition critic of children and family development, a role similar to what she held during the 38th Parliament. In this role she responded to an editorial by Mary McNeil, the minister responsible for children and families, calling for the minister to poverty reduction strategy. As the government was considering a fall 2011 election, Trevana was acclaimed the NDP candidate for the North Island riding, though the mid-term election was not called. In 2012 she toured with an NDP forestry committee, along with Bill Routley, Norm Macdonald, and Harry Lali seeking strategies to curtail raw log exports. She subsequently presented the NDP forestry plan later that year, calling for reforestation, restriction to raw log exports, and the <b>re-instatement</b> of a jobs commissioner. She advocated for the Coastal Ferry Amendment Act to include a freeze in the rise of ferry fees and subsequently called fare increases [...] "disgraceful".|$|E
