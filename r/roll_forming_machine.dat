The continuous production of such structures takes place incrementally in a modified <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> <b>machine.</b> By producing those complex parts process-related changes in the material properties occur {{as a result of}} the cold forming.

Investigations on linear flow split profiles show large gradients in the microstructure and properties over the profile cross section. In the areas of low plastification the degree of deformation and the flow stress can be determined by microstructure and hardness measurements. In the severely deformed areas, like the upper flange surface, this determination becomes doubtable. Therefore the electron backscattered diffraction method was used to investigate, if an ultrafine-grained structure is occurring as it evolves in the processes of severe plastic deformation.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} half century roll forming has become a highly {{productive}} metal forming technology, well-established in the industry for the manufacturing of mass products. About 8 % of the annual world production of steel is processed by roll forming mills. Roll forming technology enables the manufacturing of profile-shaped products with an extremely wide spectrum of geometrical shapes. In lightweight construction, the utilization of roll-formed structures of high and ultra-high-strength steels has increased remarkably in the recent years. However, the application of those types of steel entails some disadvantages resulting in a decreasing forming capacity and enormous efforts to reach the required dimensional accuracy. Until a profile leaves the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> <b>machine</b> with the target quality, it is mostly necessary to align the forming rolls several times. Sometimes even design changes are required. This is the result of unreliable process planning. Furthermore, typical profile failures such as twist, flare and spring-back occur even stronger compared to mild steels. Nowadays, it is usual to control the dimensional accuracy of the profiles after the last forming stand. This kind of quality control has the following disadvantage: manufacturing errors are detected very late. Therefore, a continuous quality control process and an active manipulation during the forming process promise a large potential for an improvement of the dimensional accuracy and an increase of roll forming productivity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Linear flow {{splitting}} {{is a new}} continuous {{cold forming}} process where {{the edge of a}} sheet metal is formed into two flanges by splitting and supporting rolls. Thus the production of bifurcated profiles from sheet metal without lamination of material becomes feasible. The production of such structures takes place incrementally in a modified <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> <b>machine.</b> Experimental investigate-ons on a HSLA steel show, that even at a surface increase of the sheet edge of about 1800 % no cracks were nucleated in the profiles. EBSD measurements in the splitting centre reveal that similar to other SPD processes UFG microstructures develop in the processing zone. Thus a steady state is reached in the processing zone where increasing strain has no more (or little) influence on the materials properties i. e. its deformability, as it is typical for SPD-processes. The formation of UFG microstructures {{is considered to be a}} mandatory condition for the linear flow splitting process, as it improves the formability of the material to the extremely high level required for this process. The mechanical properties of profiles produced by linear flow splitting are characterised by large gradients, depending on the local deformation and the resulting microstructure.

Among the major requirements to obtain a defect-free product are outlined: the accurate geometry of the part, the taking into account of the springback {{as well as the}} prediction of twist. Furthermore, the roll forming operation could be only the first forming operation: the part could be curved or locally deep drawn afterwards. FE codes could allow fulfilling these requirements.

This is because of the excessive computational time due to the long strip length and the multiple numbers of stands that have to be modelled.

The manufacturing process is as follows; the tube which the sheet is formed and welded to by <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> <b>machine,</b> is mounted on a suitable mandrel. This mandrel has an external toothing which corresponds to internal toothing of the final product. During axial moving and rotating of the workpiece, forming operation is carried out in lengthwise direction of the toothing. This forming rolls is positioned on the roll head and have a rolling axis vertical with the one of a mandrel. The total forming load needed in the {{cold reduction}} process is separated into numerous forming steps along the entire cylindrical length of the zone to be formed. In the process of cold forming on the profiled mandrel during the impact forming operation, material is pushed into depression of toothing of a mandrel mainly in a radial direction. Finally splines can be generated {{on the surface of}} components and overall elongated. If the process parameter such as the length of forming per 1 rotation of 1 roll is not optimized, the impact force from the rolls of the forming process causes geometrical defects.

Simple models in literature [K. F.

40|$|Roll forming of ultra-high {{strength}} steels (UHSS) {{and other}} high strength alloys is an advanced manufacturing methodology {{with the ability}} of cold forming those materials to complex three-dimensional shapes for lightweight structural applications. Due to their high strength, most of these materials have a reduced ductility which excludes conventional sheet forming methods under cold forming conditions. Roll forming is possible due to its low strains and incremental forming characteristic. Recent research investigates the development of high strength nano-structured aluminum sheet and titanium alloys, {{as well as their}} behaviour in roll forming with regard to formability, material behaviour and shape defects. The development of new materials is often limited to small scale samples due to the high preparation costs. In contrast, industrial application needs larger scale tests for validation, especially in roll forming where a minimum sheet length is required to feed the sample trough the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> <b>machine.</b> This work describes a novel technique for studying roll forming of a short length of experimental material. DP 780 steel strips (500 mm – 1300 mm length) were welded between two mild steel carrier sheets of similar width and thickness giving an overall strip length of 2 m. Roll forming trials were performed and longitudinal edge strain, bow and springback determined on the welded samples and samples formed of full length DP 780 strip before and after cut off. The experimental results of this work show that this method gives a reasonable approach for predicting material behavior in roll forming transverse to the rolling direction. In contrast to that significant differences in longitudinal bow were observed between the welded sections and the sections formed of full length DP 780 strip; this indicates that the applicability of this method is limited with regard to predicting longitudinal material behavior in roll forming. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Bending in a V-die {{has been}} used to {{indicate}} the outcome of bending in cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming,</b> although little direct correlation has been performed. In this work direct comparison of the springback in both processes was performed using six samples of automotive steels in a conventional <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> line where the transverse springback is measured. A bend of similar radius was formed in a V-die and the springback determined. In general, the springback in V-die forming was greater than in <b>roll</b> <b>forming,</b> in some cases by a factor of 2. The theoretical springback angle was determined for all steels using a simple and approximate analytical equation and compared to the experimental <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> and bending results. While for the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process good agreement was achieved the theoretical values significantly underestimated springback in the V-bending process...|$|R
40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steel (AHSS), especially dual phase steel, is widely used on modern automobiles to achieve {{high strength}}-to-weight ratios. <b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> {{is one of the}} most widely used forming processes in the steel industry. In this study, <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process, where bending is the main deformation mode, is adopted to investigate the fracture mechanism. A set of rollers is designed to investigate the fracture mechanism on <b>roll</b> <b>formed</b> part. The fracture behavior is studied during <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> processes. Microstructure observation and macro mechanics analysis with FEM simulation are adopted to investigate the fracture mechanism. The analysis of stress triaxiality and Lode angle parameter from FEM simulation results meets the results of microstructure observation. In the end, the Oyane fracture is calibrated with two basic tests. Then the fracture behavior of <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process is predicted and analyzed with the Oyane fracture criterion in FEM simulations...|$|R
40|$|Cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is an {{extremely}} important but little studied sheet metal forming process. In this thesis, the process of cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is introduced and it is seen that <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design {{is central to the}} cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. The conventional design and manufacture of <b>form</b> <b>rolls</b> is discussed and it is observed that surrounding the design process are a number of activities which although peripheral are time consuming and a possible source of error. A CAD/CAM system is described which alleviates many of the problems traditional to <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design. New techniques for the calculation of strip length and controlling the means of forming bends are detailed. The CAD/CAM system's advantages and limitations are discussed and, whilst the system has numerous significant advantages, its principal limitation can be said to be the need to manufacture <b>form</b> <b>rolls</b> and test them on a mill before a design can be stated satisfactory. A survey of the previous theoretical and experimental analysis of cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is presented and is found to be limited. By considering the previous work, a method of numerical analysis of the cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process is proposed based on a minimum energy approach. Parallel to the numerical analysis, a comprehensive range of software has been developed to enhance the designer's visualisation of the effects of his <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design. A complementary approach to the analysis of <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design is the generation of <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design, a method for the partial generation of designs is described. It is suggested that the two approaches should continue in parallel and that the limitation of each approach is knowledge of the cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. Hence, an initial experimental investigation of the rolling of channel sections is described. Finally, areas of potential future work are discussed...|$|R
