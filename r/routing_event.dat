30|$|The Context Provisioning Architecture {{is based}} on the {{producer}} (provider)-consumer model in which context related services take the roles of context providers or context consumers. These basic entities are interconnected by means of context brokers that provide <b>routing,</b> <b>event</b> management, query resolution and lookup services. The following paragraphs describe these three main components of the architecture. A Context Consumer (CxC) is a component (e.g. a context based application) that uses context data. A CxC can retrieve context information by sending a subscription to the Context Broker (CxB) or a direct on-demand query and context information is delivered when and if it is available. The Context Provider (CxP) component provides contextual information. A CxP gathers data from a collection of sensors, network/cloud services or other relevant sources. A CxP may use various aggregation and reasoning mechanisms to infer context from raw sensor, network or other source data. A CxP provides context data only to a specific invocation or subscription and is usually specialized in a particular context domain (e.g. location). A Context Broker (CxB) is the main coordinating component of the architecture. Primarily the CxB has to facilitate context flow among all attached components, which it achieves by allowing CxCs to subscribe to or query context information and CxPs to deliver notifications or responses.|$|E

In particular, {{we focus on}} providing reliability as a QoS guarantee, which is a proportion of published events received by a subscriber. We realize this by setting up routes that guarantee subscriber requested reliability on an event broker network where every broker node {{is associated with a}} dynamically changing node reliability value. Route determination is done in an adaptive fashion via our AR (Adaptive Reliability) algorithm that uses persistent path-quality information, in the form of reliability-estimates and (1) minimizes number of messages transmitted during route-establishment (2) guarantees reliable event notification delivery to the subscribers and (3) subsequently uses reliability-estimates to refine route quality adaptively. We validate the efficacy of AR empirically using DR-SIM (Dynamic Reliability Simulator), that we have built over Hermes. DR-SIM measures dynamically changing reliability values of every broker node in the network. Our results reveal that AR guarantees reliable event notifications to subscribers, with a (1) lower message complexity compared to other existing efforts in this area, (2) is scalable in terms of space consumed with increasing sizes of broker networks and increasing number of clients (3) and is able to adapt to the dynamics of varying node reliabilities in the broker network. © AC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—BGP {{hijacking}} is a {{well known}} threat to the Internet routing infrastructure. There has been considerable interest in developing tools that detect prefix hijacking but such systems usually identify {{a large number of}} events, many of them being due to some benign BGP engineering practice or misconfiguration. Ramachandran et al. [1] and later Hu et al. [2] also correlated suspicious <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> with spam and claimed to have found evidence of spammers temporarily stealing prefixes to send spam. In an effort to study at large scale the existence and the prevalence of malicious BGP hijacks in the Internet we developed a system which (i) identifies hijacks using BGP, traceroute and IRR data and (ii) investigates traffic originating from the reported networks with spam and netflow data. In this paper we present a real case where suspicious BGP announcements coincided with spam and web scam traffic from corresponding networks. Through this case study we show that a correlation of suspicious <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> with malicious activities is insufficient to evidence harmful BGP hijacks. We thus question previously reported cases and conclude that identifying malicious BGP hijacks requires additional data sources as well as feedback from network owners in order to reach decisive conclusions.

While prior work on Internet routing dynamics examined routing stability to individual destinations, {{in this paper we}} study the routing stability of the Internet as a whole. We use the observed changes in the number of routes over each AS-AS link as a metric and measure such changes from multiple vantage points over a period of one year. We then apply Principal Component Analysis to identify those AS links that were most involved in routing changes. Our work is the first to combine measurement data collected from multiple monitors to gauge the overall routing stability in the Internet. Our results show that very few <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> impact the entire Internet, and those events were due to announcement of new prefixes either in the form of route leakages or address space de-aggregation.

40|$|Abstract — The global Internet routing {{infrastructure}} {{is a large}} and complex distributed system where routing changes occur constantly. Our objective in {{this paper is to}} develop a simple and effective inference solution that can identify the AS or inter-AS link failures that trigger large scale routing changes in near realtime. We achieve this goal through a novel approach based on link weights. We measure the weight of each inter-AS link by the number of routes carried over that link, and keep track of its expected value and variance. We then correlate the weight changes of adjacent links and use a min-cut heuristic to find candidates for the origin of change. This work makes three contributions. First, we keep track of link weights rather than the routes of individual prefixes and thus our analysis is based on an aggregate view. Second, we use expected value and mean deviation of the link weights to identify <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> and distinguish route changes caused by failures from those by recoveries. Finally we use a min-cut heuristic based on the classification of <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> to accurately identify the AS or inter-AS link most likely responsible for the observed route changes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 This {{dissertation}} {{concentrates on}} the controlling factors on the instability of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and their effects on abrupt climate change. Northern Hemisphere climate fluctuated abruptly during the last deglaciation possibly related to variability in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and reduced aerial extent of the LIS. Reductions in AMOC can be induced by changes in the hydrologic cycle which in turn may be controlled by instabilities in the LIS due to subglacial hydrology, sliding and till deformation. Sedimentological observations of the Tiskilwa Till, Illinois, and Sky Pilot Till, Manitoba determined that the LIS deposited these tills in a ≤ 1 m thick deforming layer as strain migrated upwards due to till accretion. These tills experienced high strain in a deforming layer thick enough contribute to ice sheet motion. Simulations of the subglacial hydrology of the James Lobe (JL) of the LIS suggest that the JL had little affect on regional groundwater flow and that subglacial aquifers were incapable of draining meltwater from the ice-till interface. However, a canal basal drainage system with canals up to 70 cm wide spaced 40 to 70 m apart could drain the ice-till interface keeping the JL coupled to its bed. To resolve the effects of LIS retreat on the hydrologic cycle, a suite of new freshwater routing proxies indicate that western Canadian Plains freshwater was routed to the St. Lawrence {{at the start of}} the Younger Dryas with an increase in base flow discharge sufficient to reduce AMOC. These proxies identified a previously unrecognized intra-Younger Dryas <b>routing</b> <b>event</b> at 12 ka, the impact of which indicates the tight coupling of AMOC, climate and the hydrologic cycle. To determine the role of the LIS in Holocene climate change, 10 Be ages from western Quebec were used to date the final disappearance of the LIS at 6. 8 ka following a period of rapid retreat and thinning that contributed to a rapid rise in sea level. The disappearance of the LIS initiated the Holocene Thermal Maximum, while the attendant reduction in freshwater runoff induced the formation of Labrador deep sea water...|$|E
40|$|Event {{correlation}} is a widely-used {{data processing}} methodology {{for a broad}} variety of applications, and is especially useful {{in the context of}} distributed monitoring for software faults and vulnerabilities. However, most existing solutions have typically been focused on 'intra-organizational' correlation; organizations typically employ privacy policies that prohibit the exchange of information outside of the organization. At the same time, the promise of 'inter-organizational' correlation is significant given the broad availability of Internet-scale communications, and its potential role in both software maintenance and software vulnerability exploits. In this proposal, I present a framework for reconciling these opposing forces in event correlation via the use of privacy preservation integrated into the event processing framework. By integrating flexible privacy policies, we enable the correlation of organizations' data without actually releasing sensitive information. The framework supports both source anonymity and data privacy, yet allows for the time-based correlation of a broad variety of data. The framework is designed as a lightweight collection of components to enable integration with existing COTS platforms and distributed systems. I also present two different implementations of this framework: XUES (XML Universal Event Service), an event processor used as part of a software monitoring platform called KX (Kinesthetics eXtreme), and Worminator, a collaborative Intrusion Detection System. KX comprised a series of components, connected together with a publish-subscribe content-based <b>routing</b> <b>event</b> subsystem, for the autonomic software monitoring of complex distributed systems. Sensors were installed in legacy systems. XUES' two modules then performed event processing on sensor data: information was collected and processed by the Event Packager, and correlated using the Event Distiller. While XUES itself was not privacy-preserving, it laid the groundwork for this thesis by supporting event typing, the use of publish-subscribe and extensibility support via pluggable event transformation modules. Worminator, the second implementation, extends the XUES platform to fully support privacy-preserving event types and algorithms {{in the context of a}} Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS), whereby sensor alerts can be exchanged and corroborated [...] a reduced form of correlation that enables collaborative verification [...] without revealing sensitive information about a contributor's network, services, or even external sources as required. Worminator also fully anonymizes source information, allowing contributors to decide their preferred level of information disclosure. Worminator is implemented as a monitoring framework on top of a COTS IDS sensor, and demonstrably enables the detection of not only worms but also 'broad and stealthy' scans; traditional single-network sensors either bury such scans in large volumes or miss them entirely. Worminator has been successfully deployed at 5 collaborating sites and work is under way to scale it up further. The contributions of this thesis include the development of a cross-application-domain event correlation framework with native privacy-preserving types, the use and validation of privacy-preserving corroboration, and the establishment of a practical deployed collaborative security system. I also outline the next steps in the thesis research plan, including the development of evaluation metrics to quantify Worminator's effectiveness at long-term scan detection, the overhead of privacy preservation and the effectiveness of our approach against adversaries, be they 'honest-but-curious' or actively malicious. This thesis has broad future work implications, including privacy-preserving signature detection and distribution, distributed stealthy attacker profiling, and 'application community'-based software vulnerability detection...|$|E
40|$|Network {{operators}} need to {{know the}} root cause of traffic anomalies to determine the appropriate action to mitigate their effect. This paper studies the one type of anomaly for which we can know the root cause: routing-induced anomalies. A major challenge in quantifying the effect of <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> on traffic is that the flows affected by routing are not easily distinguishable {{from the rest of the}} traffic. We study this problem using both logs of routing messages and traffic flow records of two research backbones. We define the notion of routing impact in order to quantify how much of the observed volume variation in the traffic matrix is caused by routing changes. Our solution involves a method to compute the traffic matrix that achieves up-to-second accuracy. Results indicate that routing-induced traffic anomalies correspond to a very small faction ( 80 %) remain undetected because other volume changes hide their effect, or because they have a limited impact on traffic volume. However, the <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> detected by Kalman correspond to those events that have the biggest impact on the traffic. Running Kalman on destination address or prefixes instead of packets count can improve the detection of routing anomalies. These results represent the promise of a model of routing-induced anomalies, which could be used to accurately identify routinginduced traffic shifts even when no routing messages are available. 1...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of the interdomain routing system is challenging. One reason is that a single routing or policy change can have far reaching and complex effects. Connecting observed behavior with its underlying causes is made even more difficult by the amount of noise in the BGP system. In this paper we address these challenges by presenting PathMiner, a system to extract large scale <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> from background noise and identify the AS or link responsible for the event. PathMiner is distinguished from previous work in its ability to identify and analyze large-scale events that may re-occur many times over long timescales. The central idea behind PathMiner is that although a routing change at one AS may induce large-scale, complex responses in other ASes, the correlation among those re-sponses (in space and time) helps to isolate the relevant set of re-sponses from background noise, and makes the cause much easier to identify. Hence, PathMiner has two components: an algorithm for mining large scale coordinated changes from routing tables, and an algorithm for identifying the network element (AS or link) re-sponsible for the set of coordinated changes. We describe the implementation and validation of PathMiner. We show that it is scalable, being able to extract significant events from multiple years of routing data at a daily granularity. Finally, using PathMiner we study interdomain routing over past 9 years and use it to characterize the presence of large scale <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> and to identify the responsible network elements...|$|R

Our tool passively monitors the traffic within the network and actively probes paths for which the TCP traffic characteristics indicate a possible routing problem. More importantly, our tool focuses on detecting <b>routing</b> <b>events</b> that actually affect network traffic, which from the network operators’ perspective is most relevant. The experimental results based on large-scale measurement in the Internet indicate that our tool effectively detects {{a significant number of}} routing outages and forwarding loops. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — BGP {{has been}} {{deployed}} in Internet {{for more than}} a decade. However, the events that cause BGP topological changes are not well understood. Although large traces of routing updates seen in BGP operation are collected by RIPE RIS and University of Oregon RouteViews, previous work examines this data set as individual routing updates. This paper describes methods that group <b>routing</b> updates into <b>events.</b> Since one event (a policy change or peering failure) results in many update messages, we cluster updates both temporally and topologically (based on the path vector information). We propose a new approach to analyzing the update traces, classifying the topological impact of <b>routing</b> <b>events,</b> and approximating the distance to the the Autonomous System originating the event. Our analysis provides some insight into routing behavior: First, at least 50 % path changes are caused by events on transit peerings. Second, a significant number (23 – 38 %) of path changes are transient, in that routing updates indicate temporary path changes, but they ultimately converge on a path that is identical from the previously stable path. These observations suggest that a content provider cannot guarantee end-to-end routing stability based solely on its relationship with its immediate ISP, and that better detection of transient changes may reduce routing overhead.
