In Zimbabwe 75% of airtime has to be given to local music. Protective actions have seen the growth of new genres like Urban Grooves emerge in Zimbabwe. In 2016 Sony Music launched in Africa by opening an office in Nigeria, traditionally services of western major international studios have not been available in Africa, the local demand for their music being met through piracy.|$|E
25|$|Soon enough {{she finds}} herself outside the Weylin {{plantation}} in a rainstorm, a very drunk Rufus lying face down in a puddle. She tries to drag {{him back to the}} house, then gets Nigel to help her carry him. Back at the house, an aged Weylin appoints Dana to nurse Rufus back to health under threat of her life. Suspecting Rufus has malaria and knowing she cannot help much, Dana feeds Rufus the aspirin she has packed to lower his fever. Rufus survives, but <b>remains</b> <b>weak</b> for weeks. Dana learns that Rufus and Alice have had three children and that only one, a boy named Joe, has survived, though Alice is pregnant again. Rufus had forced Alice to let the doctor bleed the other two when they had fallen ill, inadvertently killing them. Weylin has a heart attack and when Dana is unable to save his life, Rufus sends her to work in the corn fields as punishment. By the time Rufus repents his decision, she has collapsed from exhaustion and is being whipped. Rufus then appoints Dana as the caretaker of his ailing mother, Margaret. Now the master of the plantation, Rufus sells off some slaves, including Tess, Weylin's former concubine. When Dana grows angry with him for the sale, Rufus explains that his father left debts he must pay. He then convinces Dana to use her writing talent to stave off his other creditors, despite the fact that Dana abhors secretarial work, and once had a fight with Kevin about typing his manuscripts. Time passes and Alice gives birth to a girl, Hagar, who is Dana’s direct ancestor. Alice confides to Dana that she plans to run away with her children as soon as possible, as she fears that she is forgetting to hate Rufus. Dana convinces Rufus to let her teach his son Joe and some of the slave children how to read. However, when a slave named Sam asks Dana if his younger siblings can join in on the lessons, Rufus sells him away as punishment for flirting with her. When Dana tries to interfere, Rufus hits her. Faced with her own powerlessness over Rufus, she retrieves the knife she has brought from home and slits her wrists in an effort to time travel.|$|E

6000|$|A tendril {{which has}} not become {{attached}} to any body, does not contract spirally; and in course of {{a week or two}} shrinks into the finest thread, withers and drops off. An attached tendril, on the other hand, contracts spirally, and thus becomes highly elastic, so that when the main foot-stalk is pulled the strain is distributed equally between all the attached discs. For {{a few days after the}} attachment of the discs, the tendril <b>remains</b> <b>weak</b> and brittle, but it rapidly increases in thickness and acquires great strength. During the following winter it ceases to live, but adheres firmly in a dead state both to its own stem and to the surface of attachment. In the accompanying diagram (fig. 11.) we see the difference between a tendril (B) some weeks after its attachment to a wall, with one (A) from the same plant fully grown but unattached. That the change in the nature of the tissues, as well as the spiral contraction, are consequent on the formation of the discs, is well shown by any lateral branches which have not become attached; for these in a week or two wither and drop off, in the same manner as does the whole tendril if unattached. The gain in strength and durability in a tendril after its attachment is something wonderful. There are tendrils now adhering to my house which are still strong, and have been exposed to the weather in a dead state for fourteen or fifteen years. One single lateral branchlet of a tendril, estimated to be at least ten years old, was still elastic and supported a weight of exactly two pounds. The whole tendril had five disc-bearing branches of equal thickness and apparently of equal strength; so that after having been exposed during ten years to the weather, it would probably have resisted a strain of ten pounds! ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Increasing {{interest}} in sustainability {{has led to}} a growing number of initiatives directed at environmentally sustainable operations. However, a systems perspective with hierarchically structured principles is often not a prerequisite to these action-oriented efforts. While the linkage between overall guiding principles and the definition of successful outcomes has been addressed in other areas, such as management science, this linkage <b>remains</b> <b>weaker</b> in the area of environmental and social sustainability. The effect can be action without long term or overall strategic focus on social, economical, and ecological sustainability. We present a general logical structure for the envisioning, organization and assessment of sustainability initiatives. The critical role of basic principles for sustainability, organized in a general framework for backcasting (The Natural Step framework), is described. The practical utility of the framework for the development of strategic plans, and for the informing of metrics to monitor those plans, will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the level}} of {{economic}} development {{as a proxy for}} the degree of capital market segmentation, this study tests the global market segmentation hypothesis, which predicts that the magnitude of the market 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to an earnings announcement of an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) firm will vary systematically with {{the extent to which the}} firm 2 ̆ 7 s home country capital market is segmented. Supporting this idea, the evidence shows that the earnings announcement of an emerging economy ADR induces a larger market reaction than a developed economy ADR. This finding contributes to the market segmentation literature by providing evidence that the market can remain segmented even after cross-listing in the sense that the information environment of firms from segmented economies <b>remains</b> <b>weaker.</b> It also extends prior literature on the information content of earnings by documenting that the degree of capital market segmentation in a multinational firm 2 ̆ 7 s country of domicile is an important determinant of the information content of its U.

40|$|The socket <b>remains</b> the <b>weakest</b> link {{of primary}} total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA). The revision rates of the socket are {{higher than those of}} the stem, with aseptic loosening and polyethylene wear being the most frequent indications for revision THA. Both cemented all-polyethylene cups and cementless sockets have benefited from stepwise improvements in surgical techniques and designs. In many countries, cementless sockets have replaced cemented cups during primary THA, with > 90 % of the acetabular components using a cementless fixation mode. The long-term prospective data of cementless sockets from high-volume centers show excellent and equivalent survivorship to cemented implants, but the insertion technique is easier and quicker. In addition, cementless sockets are more versatile than cemented all-polyethylene cups. With cementless sockets there is a move to increased porosity of the ingrowth surface, tri-bearing options, and enhanced locking mechanisms. There is a role for well-conducted randomized controlled trials to assess these new designs because data from various national registries show that the socket <b>remains</b> the <b>weakest</b> link of primary THA. Factors like sex, age, diagnosis, and bearing couples have a different and significant influence on the intermediate to long-term survivorship of contemporary cemented and cementless THA. status: publishe...|$|R
