40|$|A {{method for}} {{reaction}} forming refractory metal carbides. The method involves the fabrication of a glassy carbon preform by casting an organic, resin-based liquid {{mixture into a}} mold and subsequently heat treating it in two steps, which cures and pyrolizes the resin resulting in a porous carbon preform. By varying the amounts of the constituents in the organic, resin-based liquid mixture, control over {{the density of the}} carbon preform is obtained. Control of the density and microstructure of the carbon preform allows for determination of the microstructure and properties of the <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> <b>carbide</b> material produced. The glassy carbon preform is placed on a bed of refractory metal or refractory metal [...] silicon alloy. The pieces are heated above the melting point of the metal or alloy. The molten metal wicks inside the porous carbon preform and reacts, forming the <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> <b>carbide</b> or <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> <b>carbide</b> plus a minor secondary phase...|$|E

40|$|Graphite {{surfaces}} can be hardened {{and protected}} from erosion by hydrogen at high temperatures by <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> <b>carbide</b> coatings, {{which are usually}} prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or chemical vapor reaction (CVR) methods.

In an effort to lower the bulk substrate deposition temperature, the use of laser interactions with both the substrate and the metal halide deposition gas has been employed. Initial testing involved the use of a CO 2 laser to heat the surface of a graphite substrate and a KrF excimer laser to accomplish a photodecomposition of TaCl 5 gas near the substrate.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to develop a}} technique with which <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> <b>carbide</b> samples can be exposed to hydrogen containing gases at high temperatures, and to use various microstructural and analytical techniques to determine the chemical and rate processes involved in hydrogen degradation in these materials. Five types of carbides were examined including WC, NbC, HfC, ZrC, and TaC. The ceramics were purchased and were all monolithic in nature. The temperature range investigated was from 850 to 1600 C with a hydrogen pressure of one atmosphere. Control experiments, in vacuum, were also conducted for comparison so that the net effects due to hydrogen could be isolated. The samples were analyzed prior to and after exposure. Gas samples were collected in selected experiments and analyzed using gas chromography. Characterization of the resulting microstructure after exposure to hydrogen was conducted using optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and weight change. The ceramics were purchased and were all monolithic in nature. It was found that all samples lost weight after exposure, both in hydrogen and vacuum. Results from the microstructure analyses show that the degradation processes are different among the five types of ceramics involved. In addition, the apparent activation energy for the degradation process is a function of temperature even within the same material. This indicates that there are more than one mechanism involved in each material, and that the mechanisms are temperature dependent...|$|E

40|$|Cemented {{carbides}} are multiphase materials {{composed of}} <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> <b>carbides</b> e. g. WC, TiC {{embedded in a}} metallic binder (Co, Ni, Fe). Due to their high hardness and superior wear resistance, cemented carbides {{are used in the}} production of tools for cutting, machining and milling. Because cemented carbides are brittle and expensive materials, it can be favourable to join them to steel substrates, e. g. in case of saw blades for wood machining applications, where cemented carbides are used as saw tooth tip. Welding of dissimilar materials such as steel and cemented carbides (hardmetals, cermets) is particularly challenging because mismatches in their thermal expansion coefficients and thermal conductivities result in build-up of residual stress as well as the formation of brittle intermetallic phases (e. g. M 6 C and M 12 C) at the cemented carbide/steel interface due to the diffusion of C from the cemented carbides into the steel [1]. Laser beam welding (LBW) of cemented carbides to steel appears as an attractive technique to conventional brazing processes due to its high precision, high process speed, low heat input and the option of welding without filler. So far exclusively joints between cemented carbides with WC concentrations above 88 wt. -% WC and without mixed carbide additions were studied [2 - 4]...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Hypersonic flight at a speed greater than Mach 5 (1715 ms- 1) requires materials that can withstand temperatures up to 3000 °C, high heat flux, rapid heating and disassociated reactive oxygen in the extreme environment of space and during re-entry. A number of advanced ceramic materials have melting points over 3000 °C, of which the <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> <b>carbides</b> and borides are of main interest due to their excellent thermal conductivity from room temperature to over 2500 °C, good chemical stability and ablation resistance at high temperatures. These materials are classified as ultra-high-temperature ceramics (UHTCs). Among the family of UHTCs, ZrB 2 and HfB 2 are reported as the most promising candidates {{to be used as}} thermal protection systems (TPS) for the nose tip and sharp leading edges. However, the issue of using monolithic ZrB 2 and HfB 2 is the phase transformation of ZrO 2 and HfO 2 oxide by-products at elevated temperature, leading to a volume change that results in cracking of the formed oxide scale. Hence, it is necessary to use dopants to stabilize the oxidation products of ZrB 2 and HfB 2 in-situ and to minimise the transformation induced cracking and thus improving the oxidation resistance. This research is focused on introducing dopants, such as Y and Ta into HfB 2 and to understand its effect on the oxidation behaviour of HfB 2 based UHT ceramics. The primary objectives were to: (a) Synthesize sub-micron pure and doped HfB 2 powders; (b) Sinter the HfB 2 based ceramics to achieve relative density > 95...|$|R
