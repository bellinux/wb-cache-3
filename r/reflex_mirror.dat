2500|$|Compared {{with some}} low cost cameras that provide an optical {{viewfinder}} {{that uses a}} small auxiliary lens, the DSLR design {{has the advantage of}} being parallax-free: it never provides an off-axis view. A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used, it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture. Some people prefer to compose pictures on the display– for them this has become the de facto way to use a camera. Depending on the viewing position of the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> (down or up), the light from the scene can only reach either the viewfinder or the sensor. Therefore, many early DSLRs did not provide [...] "live preview" [...] (i.e., focusing, framing, and depth-of-field preview using the display), a facility that is always available on digicams. Today most DSLRs can alternate between live view and viewing through an optical viewfinder.|$|E
50|$|Digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) use a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> {{that can}} reflect {{the light and}} also can swivel from one {{position}} to another position and back to initial position. By default, the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> is set 45 degree from horizontal, blocks the light to the sensor and reflects light from the lens to penta-mirror/prism at the DSLR camera and after some reflections arrives at the viewfinder. The <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> is pulled out horizontally below the penta-mirror/prism when shutter release is fully pressed, so the viewfinder will be dark and the light/image can directly strike the sensor {{at the time of}} exposure (speed setting).|$|E
5000|$|Cope {{with high}} zoom-ratio lenses, without needing a bulky <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reflex</b> finder <b>mirror</b> flips up {{and returns}} {{instantly}} after exposure.|$|R
50|$|This makes short-focus {{wide-angle}} lenses undesirable for single-lens reflex cameras {{unless they}} are used with the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirrors</b> locked up. On large format view cameras and rangefinder cameras, short-focus lenses are widely used because they give less distortion than the retrofocus design {{and there is no}} need for a long back focal distance.|$|R
50|$|Contrast-detect {{autofocus}} is {{a common}} method in digital cameras that lack shutters and <b>reflex</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Most DSLRs use this method (or a hybrid of both contrast and phase-detection autofocus) when focusing in their live-view modes. A notable exception is Canon digital cameras with Duel Pixel CMOS AF. Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras, typically used contrast-measurement autofocus, although phase detection has become the norm on most mirrorless cameras giving them significantly better AF tracking performance compared to contrast detection.|$|R

5000|$|... 1676: Johann Sturm (Germany) {{described}} {{first known}} {{use of a}} <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> in a camera obscura. The camera obscura was known to Aristotle as an aid in observing solar eclipses, but its use as an artist's aid was first expounded by Giambattista della Porta (Italy) in 1558. The <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> corrected the up-down image reversal that could make using a non-SLR camera obscura disconcerting - but not the left-right reversal.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} α33 and α55 cameras, Sony also {{announced}} {{one of the}} last Sony DSLRs - the α560 which can also shoot movie files at full HD stereo 1080p AVCHD, but with limited manual controls and no continuous AF. These three cameras use the same technology Sony Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor. The α33 and α55 are SLT based (fixed translucent mirrors) and can take movie files with continuous Auto Focus, whereas DSLRs using <b>reflex</b> <b>mirrors</b> typically cannot, at least not without limitations.|$|R
50|$|By then a chief designer, {{he decided}} to design a <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> camera, which materialised as the Edixa {{miniature}} reflex. Wirgin joined the club of the renowned <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> manufacturers. Waaske further designed all the successors to the Edixa, including the Edixamat reflex and the Edixa Electronica.|$|R
5000|$|... 2010: Sony SLT α33 and SLT α55 (Japan): first SLRs {{without an}} optical viewfinder. What {{appears to be}} a {{pentaprism}} head is a high resolution electronic viewfinder (EVF). Had 16.2 MP (α55) or 14.2 MP (α33) APS-sized CMOS sensors with secondary 1080i high definition video capture. Also had a swiveling live view LCD panel. The SLTs' fixed so-called [...] "Translucent <b>Mirror</b> Technology" [...] <b>reflex</b> <b>mirrors</b> (a revival of pellicle mirrors Canon Pellix above) siphon off light to their fifteen phase comparison autofocus sensors to provide continuous autofocusing in their HD video mode.|$|R
5000|$|Shutter lag may be diminished, and {{pictures}} taken {{at a faster}} rate, compared to systems employing a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In still photography, a single-lens {{reflex camera}} {{requires}} {{a space for}} the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror,</b> imposing a limit {{on the use of}} wide-angle lenses of normal designs. The retrofocus lens addressed this situation by shifting the focal plane further back, thus making wider-angle lenses usable while retaining normal viewing and focusing. Unless the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> were locked in the [...] "up" [...] position, blacking out the viewfinder, the rearmost element of a non-retrofocal lens would be in the way as the mirror flipped up and down during exposure.|$|E
50|$|The Canon Pellix is {{a manual}} focus camera {{released}} in 1965 {{that uses a}} semitransparent stationary <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> behind which a metering cell is raised during the reading.|$|E
5000|$|... 1947: Gamma Duflex (Hungary): first instant return mirror SLR, first metal {{focal-plane shutter}} SLR, first {{internal}} semi-automatic lens diaphragm SLR. Also had a mirror [...] "prism" [...] viewfinder, an intermediate step to a solid pentaprism. <b>Reflex</b> <b>mirrors</b> coupled to the shutter release had been spring actuated to rise automatically since the 19th century, but the viewfinder would remain blacked-out until the mirror was manually cocked back down. With an automatic, instant return mirror, the viewfinder blackout time {{might be as}} short as ⅛th second. The semi-auto diaphragm closed the lens diaphragm with shutter release, but {{it needed to be}} manually re-cocked open. The Duflex was very ambitious, but very unreliable and Gamma's first and last production SLR.|$|R
2500|$|Many lenses are mountable, [...] "diaphragm-and-meter-compatible", {{on modern}} DSLRs and on older film SLRs {{that use the}} same lens mount. However, when lenses {{designed}} for 35mm film or equivalently sized digital image sensors are used on DSLRs with smaller sized sensors, the image is effectively cropped and the lens {{appears to have a}} longer focal length than its stated focal length. Most DSLR manufacturers have introduced lines of lenses with image circles optimised for the smaller sensors and focal lengths equivalent to those generally offered for existing 35mm mount DSLRs, mostly in the wide angle range. These lenses tend not to be completely compatible with full frame sensors or 35mm film because of the smaller imaging circle and, with some Canon EF-S lenses, interfere with the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirrors</b> on full-frame bodies.|$|R
40|$|Pierre Coulibeuf is a {{polyhedric}} {{and original}} french director and artist who truly inspired me during my studies. The {{first chapter of}} my thesis is entirely dedicated to {{his work as a}} filmmaker. His films draw inspiration from the work of other artists, such as photographers, painters, writers, dancers and performers, making his cinema an experimental field where different disciplines meet and influence each other. This meeting leads to the creation of original projects which reinvent the universe and imaginary of other artists (Michelangelo Pistoletto, Pierre Klossowski, Meg Stuart, Jan Fabre…), a game of endless repetitions, <b>reflexes,</b> <b>mirror</b> images and double identities. The second chapter is dedicated to the mutual influences between cinema and visual arts from the pre-cinema history to nowadays and the third and fourth chapters analyze two important films of Pierre Coulibeuf: L’Homme noir and Klossowski, peintre-exorciste...|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F SLR of 1959 {{has many}} {{structural}} similarities to the SP {{from which it}} evolved {{with the addition of}} a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> and interchangeable pentaprism viewfinder.|$|E
5000|$|In recent years, {{some have}} applied the misnomer ZLR to any camera superficially {{resembling}} an SLR {{whether or not}} it actually had a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror,</b> e.g. the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8. (See: Bridge camera) ...|$|E
50|$|A pentamirror is {{an optical}} device {{used in the}} {{viewfinder}} systems of various single-lens reflex cameras instead of the pentaprism. It is used to reverse again the laterally reversed image coming from the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{his work}} for ARRI, he invented the {{spinning}} <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> shutter for film cameras, which was first used in the Arriflex 35 in 1937. It allows the operator to have a viewfinder image equal to the recorded picture.|$|R
50|$|Conceptually {{intermediate}} {{between the}} Rangefinder Leicas and the SLR Leicas was the Leica Visoflex System, a <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> box that {{attached to the}} lens mount of Leica rangefinders (separate versions were made for the screwmount and M series bodies) and accepted lenses made especially for the Visoflex System. Rather than using the camera’s rangefinder, focusing was accomplished via a groundglass screen. A coupling released both mirror and shutter to make the exposure. Camera rangefinders are inherently limited {{in their ability to}} accurately focus long focal-length lenses and the <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> box permitted much longer length lenses. Throughout its history, Leitz has been responsible for numerous optical innovations, such as aspherical production lenses, multicoated lenses, and rare earth lenses.|$|R
5000|$|... 1949: VEB Zeiss Ikon (Dresden) Contax S (East Germany): second {{pentaprism}} eyelevel viewing 35 mm SLR. First M42 {{screw mount}} camera. (The East German KW Praktica came out {{at about the}} same time.) With earlier [...] "waist level" [...] SLR viewfinder systems (in which the photographer looks downward at the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror's</b> image on the focusing screen), moving subjects are seen to track across the field-of-view in reverse direction of their actual motion, making action shooting counter-intuitive. A pentaprism is an eight-sided (only five are of significance; the other three are cut off corners) chunk of glass silvered on three sides that collects, redirects and re-reverses the light from the mirror with minimal light loss. With a proper pentaprism, all a photographer needs to do is hold the camera up to eyelevel and everything is there. The pentaprism SLR had first been proposed in the 19th century and was used in non-35 mm SLRs in the 1930s. Similar systems (or, in the 1990s, its cheaper alternative, the pentamirror) became so common in 35 mm SLRs by the late 1950s that it is the characteristic pentaprism [...] "head" [...] atop the camera body that defines the type for most people.|$|R

5000|$|Both IX Nikkor lenses, for Nikon's Advanced Photo System (APS) SLRs, {{and very}} old [...] "invasive" [...] Fisheye-Nikkor lenses from the 1960s {{must not be}} mounted on the FM, as their rear {{elements}} will damage the FM's <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Hasselblad {{cameras were}} {{selected}} by NASA {{because of their}} interchangeable lenses and magazines.

25|$|Johann Zahn's Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium, {{published}} in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches {{of both the}} camera obscura and the magic lantern. A hand-held device with a <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> mechanism was first proposed by Johann Zahn in 1685, a design that would later be used in photographic cameras.|$|R
5000|$|... 1962: Nikkorex Zoom 35 (Japan): first 35 mm SLR with fixed {{zoom lens}} (Zoom-Nikkor Auto 43-86mm f/3.5). Had non-pentaprism, four <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> {{viewfinder}} and leaf shutter. Fixed lens SLRs {{have been an}} occasional phenomenon bridging simpler viewfinder cameras and more ambitious interchangeable lens SLRs. Presently, they are off-again with non-SLR electronic viewfinder (EVF) superzoom digital cameras occupying this market segment.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989: Yashica Samurai Z-L (Japan): first SLR {{intentionally}} {{designed for}} left-handed operation. Took up to 72 exposures of horizontal 18×24 mm single frames (also called half frames) on 135 film. Had flat-topped non-pentaprism <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> and optical relay viewfinder. Also had unique-to-Samurai-series vertical body design with fixed autofocus 25-75mm f/4-5.6 zoom lens, interlens leaf shutter, programmed autoexposure, built-in motor drive and electronic flash. Was mirror copy of auto-everything, point-and-shoot Samurai Z camera.|$|R
5000|$|... 1861: Thomas Sutton (UK) {{received}} {{first patent}} for SLR photographic camera. An unknown number made but very few; no known production model; no known surviving examples. The manually levered <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> {{also served as}} the camera's shutter. Used glass plates.|$|E
50|$|Most SLR cameras permit {{upright and}} {{laterally}} correct viewing {{through use of}} a roof pentaprism situated in the optical path between the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> and viewfinder. Light, which comes both horizontally and vertically inverted after passing through the lens, is reflected upwards by the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror,</b> into the pentaprism where it is reflected several times to correct the inversions caused by the lens, and align the image with the viewfinder. When the shutter is released, the mirror moves out of the light path, and the light shines directly onto the film (or {{in the case of}} a DSLR, the CCD or CMOS imaging sensor). The Canon Pellix film camera was an exception to the moving mirror system, wherein the mirror was a fixed beamsplitting pellicle.|$|E
50|$|Cinematography uses a {{rotary disc}} shutter in movie cameras, a {{continuously}} spinning disc which conceals the image with a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> during the intermittent motion between frame exposure. The disc then spins {{to an open}} section that exposes the next frame of film while it is held by the registration pin.|$|E
50|$|Some common {{features}} of 35mm SLR photography were first {{seen on the}} Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at full aperture. For this purpose the RE-lensese have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter at full aperture, retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's <b>reflex</b> finder <b>mirror.</b> This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting {{a fraction of the}} light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972: Polaroid SX-70 (USA): first {{instant film}} SLR. Had non-pentaprism <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> system and {{electronic}} autoexposure in flat-folding body with bellows and fixed 116mm f/8 lens. Took ten exposure, 3⅛×3⅛ inch frame Polaroid SX-70 instant film packs. The principle of self-developing [...] "instant photography" [...] came to Edwin Land in 1943. The first production instant camera was the non-SLR Polaroid Land Model 95 (USA) of 1948, producing sepia-toned, peel-apart pictures. Steady improvements {{culminated in the}} seven year, nearly quarter-billion dollar SX-70 camera and film project to create full-color, self-contained, develop-before-your-eyes, [...] "garbage-free" [...] prints.|$|R
5000|$|... 1996: Minolta Vectis S-1 (Japan/Malaysia): first Advanced Photo System (APS) IX240 film SLR. Took up {{to forty}} {{exposures}} of 16.7×30.2 mm frames on polyethylene naphthalate base, singly perforated 24 mm wide film coated with invisible magnetic data encoding stripe, pre-loaded into self-locking ready-to-use cartridges. Had flat-topped non-pentaprism sideways <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> and optical relay viewfinder. Compact design with good lenses and large accessory system. APS film {{was introduced by}} Kodak, Canon, Fuji, Minolta and Nikon in 1996 as Kodak's last attempt (of many) at drop-in film loading. APS was moderately popular, but faded quickly and almost dead by 2002.|$|R
