25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice.

40|$|By {{integrating}} the building structure as {{thermal energy storage}} into the building services concept, thermally activated building systems (TABS) {{have proven to be}} economically viable for the heating and cooling of buildings. Having already developed an integrated design method and various control concepts in the past, in the present paper the impact of different aspects of TABS regarding the energetic performance of such systems is analyzed. Based on a simulation case study for a typical Central European office building, the following conclusions can be drawn. The energy efficiency of TABS is significantly influenced by the hydronic circuit topology used. With separate zone <b>return</b> <b>pipes</b> energy savings of approximately 15 - 25 Â kWÂ h/m 2 Â a, or 20 - 30 % of heating as well as cooling demand, can be achieved, compared to common zone <b>return</b> <b>pipes,</b> where energy losses occur due to mixing of return water. A strong impact on energy efficiency can also be observed for the control strategy. Thus, by intermittent operation of the system using pulse width modulation control (PWM), the electricity demand for the water circulation pumps can be reduced by more than 50 % compared to continuous operation. Concerning cold generation for TABS, it is shown that free cooling with a wet cooling tower is most efficient, if the cold source is the outside air. Variants with mechanical chillers exhibit 30 - 50 % higher electricity demands for cold generation and distribution, even though their runtimes are much shorter compared to the cooling tower runtimes. In conclusion, the results show that significant energy savings can be achieved using adapted system topologies and applying appropriate control solutions for TABS.

This is generally called Ground Thermal Response Testing (TRT) by the GHP industry. [...] Understanding the ground conductivity and thermal capacity is essential to proper GHP design, and using TRT to measure these properties was first presented in 1983 (Mogensen). The now commonly used procedure, introduced by Eklöf and Gehlin in 1996 and now approved by ASHRAE involves inserting a pipe loop deep into the ground (in a well bore, filling the anulus of the bore with a grout substance of known thermal properties, heating the fluid in the pipe loop, and measuring the temperature drop in the loop from the inlet and <b>return</b> <b>pipes</b> in the bore. The ground thermal conductivity is estimated using the line source approximation method—plotting a straight line on the log of the thermal response measured.

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} investigations {{were carried}} out on air-filled cavities containing heated inner cylinders. The effect of varying the position of radial spacers on a single cylinder was studied. It was concluded that for central positioning of the cylinder within the cavity. the rate of heat-transfer was minimised at a radial spacer angle of 480 (measured from the vertically downwards radius vector). When the cylinder was positioned at displacement ratio of 0. 7, the rate of heat-transfer was minimised at a corresponding spacer angle of 520. The corresponding reductions in the total rate of heat-transfer {{were found to be}} 25 % and 31 % less than that obtained for the system with no spacers at a cylinder displacement ratio of zero. Following this research investigation, the behaviour of a two-pipe arrangement, consisting of a hot supply and cooler <b>return</b> <b>pipe</b> within a rectangular sectioned cavity, was studied. Eccentric positioning of both supply and return pipes showed that minimum rates of heat-transfer occur at supply and <b>return</b> <b>pipe</b> displacement ratios of 0. 45 and - 0. 33 respectively. This value of heat-transfer is approximately 20 % less than that obtained for a system where supply and <b>return</b> <b>pipe</b> displacement ratios are 0. 7 and zero respectively. As experimental testing has proved to be excessively time consuming (e. g. due to having to wait until a steady-state ensued before measurments were taken) and laborious, a finite-element numerical model was developed and used to predict the heat-transfer between a heated inner cylinder and a cooled outer square duct. This study investigated eccentricity effects on the rate of heat-transfer for different ratios of duct height to cylinder radius. Solutions were obtained for Rayleigh numbers 1 to 300 and optimal pipe eccentricity for minimum heat-transfer was predicted. These predictions were in good agreement with previous experimental results...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} for {{minimisation of the}} capital costs and energy consumption in a district heating network is presented using a case study based on a district heating network in South Wales, UK. A number of different design cases were simulated using the PSS SINCAL, taking into account different supply and return temperatures and target pressure losses.

Optimisation was conducted to obtain the optimal flow rate and supply temperature for the variable flow and variable supply temperature operating strategy. The optimisation model was formulated using the FICO™ Xpress optimisation suite. The objective of optimisation was to minimise the annual total energy consumption and costs.

The housing is mounted either directly on the engine or remotely with supply and <b>return</b> <b>pipes</b> connecting it to the engine. In the mid-1950s, the spin-on oil filter design was introduced: a self-contained housing and element assembly {{which was to be}} unscrewed from its mount, discarded, and replaced with a new one. This made filter changes more convenient and potentially less messy, and quickly came to be the dominant type of oil filter installed by the world's automakers. Conversion kits were offered for vehicles originally equipped with cartridge-type filters. In the 1990s, European and Asian automakers in particular began to shift back in favor of replaceable-element filter construction, because it generates less waste with each filter change. American automakers have likewise begun to shift to replaceable-cartridge filters, and retrofit kits to convert from spin-on to cartridge-type filters are offered for popular applications. Commercially available automotive oil filters vary in their design, materials, and construction details.
