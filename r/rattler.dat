5|$|After {{the deadly}} {{incident}} on the New Texas Giant on July 19, 2013, {{and because the}} two rides share several similarities, Six Flags Fiesta Texas had ceased running Iron <b>Rattler</b> pending investigation findings from its sister park. In under a month, Iron <b>Rattler</b> reopened on August 14 with seat belts as another added restraint to the two trains.|$|E
5|$|The National Roller Coaster Museum and Archives {{announced}} on April 16, 2013, {{they would be}} auctioning off the first ride of Iron <b>Rattler</b> {{on the evening of}} May 17, 2013, and proceeds going towards the museum.

5|$|Before Iron Rattler's debut year, <b>Rattler</b> {{was only}} ranked {{once in the}} Amusement Todays Golden Ticket Awards for the 2011 Top 50 Wooden Coasters ranked at 47 in the world, since the {{creation}} of the award in 1998. After the renovation in 2013, Iron <b>Rattler</b> was ranked highly by the voters. The ride was ranked the second-best new ride of 2013 with 19% of the vote. It also ranked at position 11 for the world's best steel roller coasters its debut year.|$|E

50|$|Native American {{people often}} use <b>rattles</b> in {{ceremonial}} dances. Oftentimes, these <b>rattles</b> {{are meant to}} represent something. Each figure or depiction can relate to something sacred to their tribe. Often, the sound of <b>rattles</b> forms {{a connection to the}} supernatural world when the <b>rattles</b> are employed by shamans. The use of the raven <b>rattle,</b> like the one pictured to the right, always implies power, which when used in dances, symbolize the status of the chief, who has a hereditary right to use the <b>rattle.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>rattle</b> {{is a type}} of {{percussion}} instrument {{which produces}} a sound when shaken. <b>Rattles</b> are described in the Hornbostel-Sachs system as Shaken Idiophones or <b>Rattles</b> (112.1).|$|R

5|$|Renaudin, {{seeing the}} hapless {{condition}} of his ship, ordered his flags hoisted half-mast in surrender and distress around 14:00, but after her surrender no British ship {{managed to get}} men aboard to take possession. This left Vengeurs few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could. Ultimately the ship's pumps became unmanageable, and Vengeur began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged HMS Alfred and Culloden, {{as well as the}} services of the cutter <b>Rattler,</b> saved any of the Vengeur's crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them. Lieutenant John Winne of <b>Rattler</b> was especially commended for this hazardous work. By 18:15, Vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded and the dead remained aboard, though some possibly stayed aboard in the hope of being rescued by a French ship rather than a British and avoid captivity.|$|E

In 1983, Luscombe Aircraft was based at Lympne producing their Luscombe <b>Rattler,</b> a military version of the Luscombe Vitality. The Cinque Ports Flying Club moved to Lydd in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Alfred rescued about 100 men; <b>Rattler,</b> about 40; and Culloden, 127, {{including}} Captain Renaudin, who {{abandoned his}} ship {{and left in}} the very first British boat. He was taken to Culloden and served a meal in the officers' mess; as he dined with his son and other French and British officers, a commotion was heard; racing to the gallery of Culloden, the party witnessed Vengeur sink with the remaining wounded aboard. Figures of the casualties on Vengeur are not precisely known, but amount to approximately 250 killed during the battle, 106 drowned in the sinking, and 367 rescued by the British.|$|E

5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk <b>rattler</b> 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

40|$|Human {{response}} to sonic booms heard indoors {{is affected by}} the generation of contact-induced <b>rattle</b> noise. The annoyance caused by sonic boom-induced <b>rattle</b> noise was studied in a series of psychoacoustics tests. Stimuli were divided into three categories and presented in three different studies: isolated <b>rattles</b> at the same calculated Perceived Level (PL), sonic booms combined with <b>rattles</b> with the mixed sound at a single PL, and sonic booms combined with <b>rattles</b> with the mixed sound at three different PL. Subjects listened to sounds over headphones and were asked to report their annoyance. Annoyance to different <b>rattles</b> was shown to vary significantly according to <b>rattle</b> object size. In addition, the combination of low-amplitude sonic booms and <b>rattles</b> can be more annoying than the sonic boom alone. Correlations and regression analyses for the combined sonic boom and <b>rattle</b> sounds identified the Moore and Glasberg Stationary Loudness (MGSL) metric as a primary predictor of annoyance for the tested sounds. Multiple linear regression models were developed to describe annoyance to the tested sounds, and simplifications for applicability to a wider range of sounds are presented...|$|R
