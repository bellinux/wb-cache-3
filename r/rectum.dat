5|$|The {{tobacco smoke}} enema, an {{insufflation}} of tobacco smoke into the <b>rectum</b> by enema, was a medical treatment employed by European physicians {{for a range}} of ailments.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), digestive tract (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, <b>rectum,</b> anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, vagina, vulva), and soft tissues.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or <b>rectum</b> is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} {{the upper part of}} the cervix lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the <b>rectum,</b> forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the <b>rectum</b> femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|In the hindgut (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets. The <b>rectum</b> absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
5|$|The mid-18th century saw an {{upsurge in}} the public's {{fear of being}} mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the {{uncertainty}} of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the <b>rectum.</b> Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.|$|E
5|$|The next day, CIA agent Lacey {{shows up}} at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a transdermal strip that will expose Kim to ricin via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the presidential palace in Pyongyang, they are {{introduced}} to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more strips from an UAV, {{but in order to}} smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a Siberian tiger and then hide the container in his <b>rectum.</b> Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the <b>rectum.</b> This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|Detective Michael Tritter is a {{recurring}} fictional {{character in the}} medical drama series House, portrayed by David Morse. He is the main antagonist of the third season, which ran between 2006 and 2007. Tritter is a police detective, who tries to get Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) to apologize for leaving him in an examination room with a thermometer in his <b>rectum.</b> After House refuses to apologize, Tritter researches House's background and discovers his Vicodin addiction. Tritter turns people close to House against him and forces House to go to rehab. When the case ultimately comes to court, the judge sentences House to one night in jail, for contempt of court, and to finish his rehabilitation, telling Tritter that she believes House is not the drug addict {{he tried to make}} him out to be.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} <b>rectum,</b> where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's <b>rectum.</b> Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
25|$|Recto-rectal (high) {{intussusception}} (intra-rectal intussusception) {{is where}} the intussusception starts in the <b>rectum,</b> does not protrude into the anal canal, but stays within the <b>rectum.</b> (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the <b>rectum</b> and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only). These are usually intussusceptions that originate in the upper <b>rectum</b> or lower sigmoid.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{is usually}} {{continuous}} from the <b>rectum,</b> with the <b>rectum</b> almost universally being involved. Perianal disease is rare. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from proctitis or {{inflammation of the}} <b>rectum,</b> to left sided colitis, to pancolitis, which is inflammation involving the ascending colon.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rectum</b> {{receives}} {{blood from}} both the inferior mesenteric artery and the internal iliac artery; the <b>rectum</b> is rarely involved by colonic ischemia due to this dual blood supply.|$|E
25|$|Proctitis: Involvement {{limited to}} the <b>rectum.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{surgical}} approaches to treat megacolon, {{such as a}} colectomy (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal anastomosis (ligation of the remaining ileum and <b>rectum</b> segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of colon, sigmoid and <b>rectum)</b> followed by ileostomy or followed by ileoanal anastomosis.|$|E
25|$|Sphincter {{function}} in rectal prolapse {{is almost always}} reduced. This {{may be the result}} of direct sphincter injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing <b>rectum.</b> Alternatively, the intussuscepting <b>rectum</b> may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR - contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the <b>rectum).</b> The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be effected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter.|$|E
25|$|The mesorectum is {{that part}} {{attached}} to the upper third of the <b>rectum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stimulation {{of sensory}} receptors in the urinary bladder and <b>rectum</b> {{may result in}} sensations of fullness.|$|E
25|$|Proctosigmoiditis: Involvement of the rectosigmoid colon, {{the portion}} of the colon {{adjacent}} to the <b>rectum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{is marked}} by chronic bloody {{diarrhea}} and inflammation mostly affects the distal colon near the <b>rectum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Culdocentesis, {{in which}} fluid is {{retrieved}} {{from the space}} separating the vagina and <b>rectum,</b> is a less commonly performed test {{that may be used}} to look for internal bleeding. In this test, a needle is inserted into the space {{at the very top of}} the vagina, behind the uterus and in front of the <b>rectum.</b> Any blood or fluid found may have been derived from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for foreign bodies to enter the tract from the mouth, or from the <b>rectum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Proctosigmoiditis and {{left-sided}} colitis {{involves the}} lower colon, from the <b>rectum</b> up {{the left side}} of the patient.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rectum</b> is {{the last}} section of the large intestine. It holds the formed feces {{awaiting}} elimination via defecation.|$|E
25|$|Barium enema {{examinations}} {{are used}} to study the large intestine and <b>rectum</b> and are classified as lower gastrointestinal series.|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and <b>rectum.</b> Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the <b>rectum</b> can hold, how well the <b>rectum</b> holds it, and how well the <b>rectum</b> can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} <b>rectum</b> such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, <b>rectum</b> and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E
25|$|Pancolitis: Involvement of {{the entire}} colon, {{extending}} from the <b>rectum</b> to the cecum, beyond which the small intestine begins.|$|E
25|$|Internal rotation. The fetal head rotates 90 {{degrees to}} the occipito-anterior {{position}} so that the baby's face is towards the mother's <b>rectum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The large {{intestine}} absorbs water and any remaining absorbable nutrients {{from the food}} before sending the indigestible matter to the <b>rectum.</b> The colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the colonic bacteria, such as vitamin K (especially important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate blood coagulation), vitamin B12, thiamine and riboflavin. It also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter in the <b>rectum</b> until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.|$|E
25|$|Complications include constipation, {{which is}} reduced if the {{technique}} {{does not use}} posterior rectal mobilization (freeing the <b>rectum</b> from its attached back surface).|$|E
25|$|The {{pelvic cavity}} {{is a body}} cavity that is bounded by {{the bones of the}} pelvis and which {{primarily}} contains reproductive organs and the <b>rectum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{condition}} {{associated with}} internal intussusception is colitis cystica profunda (also known as CCP, or proctitis cystica profunda), which is cystica profunda in the <b>rectum.</b> Cystica profunda {{is characterized by}} formation of mucin cysts in the muscle layers of the gut lining, and it can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. When it occurs in the <b>rectum,</b> some believe to be an interchangeable diagnosis with SRUS since the histologic features of the conditions overlap. Indeed, CCP is managed identically to SRUS.|$|E
25|$|Most sources {{define the}} large {{intestine}} as {{the combination of}} the cecum, colon, <b>rectum,</b> and anal canal. Some other sources exclude the anal canal.|$|E
25|$|Steroid enemas {{can also}} be used to treat {{symptoms}} in the lower colon and <b>rectum.</b> Hydrocortisone and budesonide liquid and foam enemas are marketed for this purpose.|$|E
