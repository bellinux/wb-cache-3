25|$|Shortly after, Csaky found {{a studio}} at the artists' {{collective}} La <b>Ruche</b> in Montparnasse. The building had been constructed by Gustave Eiffel, and was adapted as artists' studios by the sculptor Alfred Boucher. Among other émigré artists at La <b>Ruche</b> were Alexander Archipenko (who arrived in Paris the same year), Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine, and Sonia Delaunay (Terk). In {{the early years}} of the 20th century, other artists who lived there for a time included Guillaume Apollinaire, Ossip Zadkine, Moise Kisling, Marc Chagall, Max Pechstein, Fernand Léger, Jacques Lipchitz, Max Jacob, Blaise Cendrars, Chaim Soutine, Robert Delaunay, Amedeo Modigliani, Constantin Brâncuși, and Diego Rivera, attracted to Paris from across Europe and Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Living {{and working}} at La <b>Ruche</b> in Montparnasse, Csaky {{exhibited}} his highly stylized 1909 sculpture Tête de femme (Portrait de Jeanne) at the 1910 Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, now significantly beyond {{the influence of}} Auguste Rodin. The following year he exhibited a proto-Cubist work entitled Mademoiselle Douell (1910).|$|E
25|$|In January 1946, events {{came to a}} {{head when}} Lescot jailed the Marxist editors of a journal called La <b>Ruche</b> (The Beehive). This action precipitated student strikes and protests by {{government}} workers, teachers, and shopkeepers in the capital and provincial cities. In addition, Lescot's mulatto-dominated rule had alienated the predominantly black Garde. His position became untenable, and he resigned on 11 January. Radio announcements declared that the Garde had assumed power, which it would administer through a three-member junta.|$|E
50|$|The {{household}} sets {{up its own}} {{exploration of}} mathematics in order to crack the code of the last messages from Mr <b>Ruche's</b> old friend, now apparently murdered. Mathematical topics covered in the book include primes and factors; irrational and amicable numbers; the discoveries of Pythagoras, Archimedes and Euclid; and the problems of squaring the circle and doubling the cube.|$|R
25|$|From 1904 to 1906 Miklos studied under Kimnach László (1857–1906) at the Hungarian Royal National School of Arts and Crafts, {{where he}} met Joseph Csaky. A {{musician}} and music lover, he played the violin and harp. He traveled to Paris in 1909, shortly after Csaky, and settled at La <b>Ruche</b> in Montparnasse. Shortly thereafter Miklos exhibited at the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants. There he formed close associations with Csaky, Archipenko and Léger, artists {{at the forefront of}} the Parisian avant-garde. While in Paris he was exposed to the works of French modernists Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat, Paul Gauguin, and probably Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.|$|E

2500|$|On {{her first}} night in the Bohemian {{community}} {{she went to the}} café La Rotonde where the man at the next table introduced himself as [...] "Modigliani, painter and Jew". In addition to making close friends with Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Serge Diaghilev, and Jean Cocteau, she stayed for a while at La <b>Ruche</b> with many of the leading members of the avant-garde living there at the time. In Montparnasse she also met her future husband, the Norwegian artist Roald Kristian.|$|E
2500|$|Virtually penniless painters, sculptors, writers, {{poets and}} composers came {{from around the}} world to thrive in the {{creative}} atmosphere and for the cheap rent at artist communes such as La <b>Ruche.</b> Living without running water, in damp, unheated [...] "studios", seldom free of rats, many sold their works for a few francs just to buy food. Jean Cocteau once said that poverty was a luxury in Montparnasse. First promoted by art dealers such as Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, today works by those artists sell for millions of euros.|$|E
2500|$|Swanton often {{collaborated on}} her {{projects}} with her close friend Adelaide De Montgolfier, {{daughter of the}} famous aeronaut Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier. Shortly after the July Revolution of 1830, Swanton {{is said to have}} been engaged by the French government to help General Lafayette establish public libraries in France, but the plan was never brought to fruition. Instead, she and Montgolfier created what the latter called a [...] "choice circulating library" [...] for [...] "sound and healthy reading", geared in particular towards young women and designed to [...] "develop and enkindle the soul, enlighten the mind, and vivify and direct the imagination". The pair also founded La <b>Ruche,</b> journal d'études familière, a monthly magazine dedicated to the education of young women, and co-authored a number of children's books.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the age of}} ten, Rivera studied art at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. He was {{sponsored}} to continue study in Europe by Teodoro A. Dehesa Méndez, {{the governor of the}} State of Veracruz. After arrival in Europe in 1907, Rivera initially went to study with Eduardo Chicharro in Madrid, Spain, and from there went to Paris, France, to live and work with the great gathering of artists in Montparnasse, especially at La <b>Ruche,</b> where his friend Amedeo Modigliani painted his portrait in 1914. His circle of close friends, which included Ilya Ehrenburg, Chaim Soutine, Amedeo Modigliani and Modigliani's wife Jeanne Hébuterne, Max Jacob, gallery owner Léopold Zborowski, and Moise Kisling, was captured for posterity by Marie Vorobieff-Stebelska (Marevna) in her painting [...] "Homage to Friends from Montparnasse" [...] (1962).|$|E
2500|$|Proper {{accessories}} to wear {{with the}} frock coat included a non-collapsible top {{hat and a}} boutonnière in the lapel. A Homburg hat was considered too informal to wear with proper formal morning dress. During the Victorian and Edwardian era, button boots with a single row of punching across the cap toe were worn along with a cane. [...] On cold days, it was common to wear a frock overcoat, a type of overcoat cut {{exactly the same as}} the frock coat, with the waist seam construction, only a little longer and fuller to permit it to be worn {{over the top of the}} frock coat. Patent leather dress boots were worn up until the Edwardian era with morning dress. The practice of wearing patent leather shoes is today reserved strictly for evening formalwear. [...] Trousers are uncuffed and worn with braces (suspenders in American English) to avoid the top of the trousers from showing underneath the waistcoat. Only white shirts were worn with frock coats. The shirt was worn with a standing detachable collar. The most standard neckwear was a formal cravat (or Ascot in American English). The cravat was tied in the Ascot knot (the entire cravat is called an Ascot in American English) characterised by way the ends cross over in front, or alternatively in a <b>Ruche</b> knot, tied like a four-in-hand knot of a modern necktie. A decorative cravat pin often adorned with a precious stone or pearl was used to keep the cravat tidy. The cravat was usual with a frock coat when worn in more formal occasions through the Victorian and Edwardian eras, although the long necktie came to be worn increasingly after the turn of the century in the same manner as it is today with morning dress. The practice of wearing bow ties as an acceptable alternative with formalwear fell away after the late Victorian to early Edwardian era and became relegated to eveningwear, as remains the case in the twenty-1st century. As with a formal shirt for white tie, cuffs were single (rather than double) cuffed and made to close with cufflinks. The waistcoat was usually double-breasted with double-breasted style (or peaked) lapels. Formal gloves in light grey suede, chamois, or kid leather were also required.|$|E

60|$|Her {{room was}} a little rough-plastered garret room, with an eastern window, and at last she saw the yellow light inter-filtrate the dark-blue of the eastern sky, and she rose and pattered about in her bare feet, while she put up her hair like a woman and slipped on her underskirt, stiff with starch, and then her dress, with its {{open-work}} sleeves and <b>ruche</b> of lace, threaded with blue ribbon. She moved about on her bare feet, rejoicing in the crisp rustle of her new clothing, and put on her wide hat with its hectic rose-buds and paris-green thick leaves.

60|$|Miss Fennimore was politely {{summoned to}} Mrs. Fulmort's dressing-room for the {{official}} communication; but this day {{was no exception}} to the general custom, that the red baize door was not passed by the young ladies until their evening appearance in the drawing-room. Then the trio descended, all alike in white muslin, made high, and green sashes--a dress carefully distinguishing Phoebe as not introduced, but very becoming to her, with the simple folds and the little net <b>ruche,</b> suiting admirably the tall, rounded slenderness of her shape, her long neck, and short, childish contour of face, where there smiled a joy of anticipation almost inappreciable to those who know not {{what it is to}} spend day after day with nothing particular to look forward to.|$|E

6000|$|It {{would have}} been absurd of him to trace into ramifications {{the effect of the}} ribbon from which Miss Gostrey's trinket depended, had he not for the hour, at the best, been so given over to {{uncontrolled}} perceptions. What was it but an uncontrolled perception that his friend's velvet band somehow added, in her appearance, to the value of every other item--to that of her smile and of the way she carried her head, to that of her complexion, of her lips, her teeth, her eyes, her hair? What, certainly, had a man conscious of a man's work in the world to do with red velvet bands? He wouldn't for anything have so exposed himself as to tell Miss Gostrey how much he liked hers, yet he HAD none the less not only caught himself in the act--frivolous, no doubt, idiotic, and above all unexpected--of liking it: he had in addition taken it as a starting-point for fresh backward, fresh forward, fresh lateral flights. The manner in which Mrs. Newsome's throat WAS encircled suddenly represented for him, in an alien order, almost as many things as the manner in which Miss Gostrey's was. Mrs. Newsome wore, at operatic hours, a black silk dress--very handsome, he knew it was [...] "handsome"--and an ornament that his memory was able further to identify as a <b>ruche.</b> He had his association indeed with the <b>ruche,</b> but it was rather imperfectly romantic. He had once said to the wearer--and it was as [...] "free" [...] a remark as he had ever made to her--that she looked, with her ruff and other matters, like Queen Elizabeth; and it had after this in truth been his fancy that, as a consequence of that tenderness and an acceptance of the idea, the form of this special tribute to the [...] "frill" [...] had grown slightly more marked. The connexion, as he sat there and let his imagination roam, was to strike him as vaguely pathetic; but there it all was, and pathetic was doubtless in the conditions the best thing it could possibly be. It had assuredly existed at any rate; for it seemed now to come over him that no gentleman of his age at Woollett could ever, to a lady of Mrs. Newsome's, which was not much less than his, have embarked on such a simile.|$|E
60|$|On the Thursday evening, Belle shut {{herself up}} with her maid, and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled her hair, they {{polished}} her neck and arms with some fragrant powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not rebelled. They laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed {{at herself in the}} mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and a <b>ruche,</b> reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.|$|E
