2500|$|All of {{the primary}} {{structure}} was recovered from the seabed. Controls were trimmed near the neutral position. The flaps were in the [...] "UP" [...] position (i.e., retracted). Investigators {{found no evidence that}} the controls were jammed. The left main landing gear leg had become separated during the impact, and the <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> leg was bent aft. The nose gear was bent aft and to the right. Both propellers were recovered and showed similar damage. Both engines were stripped down and examined. They were found to be in similar condition, with valves and other moving parts in good shape. Both engines could be turned when the spark plugs were removed. Both engines, with propellers attached, were found at the northern end of the debris field.|$|E
2500|$|Both sets of finalists for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles had {{stated that}} {{they were willing to}} put their rivalry aside for at least one night to win the tournament, a {{sentiment}} that the former [...] "Super Sky Team" [...] of La Sombra and Volador Jr. demonstrated by wearing similar <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> to the ring. They both wore black masks, shirts and tights with white markings reminiscent of the [...] "skeleton" [...] image used by Volador Jr.'s uncle L.A. Park and Volador Jr.'s father Super Parka. Despite statements that they would get along the team of Atlantis and Último Guerrero had some problems during the first fall causing them to lose to La Sombra and Volador Jr. With the second fall being their last change the former Los Guerreros de la Atlantida began to work together more, relying on their many years of experience as a team, winning the second fall when they both applied Atlantis' Atlantida, a spinning backbreaker rack, to the former Super Sky Team to gain a submission victory in the second fall. The third fall proved to be the tipping point between Atlantis and Último Guerrero while La Sombra and Volador Jr. managed to put their personal differences aside for one night. The third and final fall was won by Volador Jr. and La Sombra when La Sombra pinned Atlantis after a top rope Asai Moonsault. While the winners celebrated Atlantis and Guerrero argued and almost fought before being separated by CMLL officials. After the match both wrestlers made challenges for the other to put their mask on the line at a future date, before settling on the shorter term with a singles match between the two for the follow week's CMLL Super Viernes show, proposed as a match with no referee and thus no disqualification.|$|E

50|$|I saw {{the climb}} of the Angliru and I {{thought it was}} good for cycling. I watched on {{television}} and saw a superb race. I am for these difficulties out of the normal, these extreme gradients. The steepness doesn't shock me because there is always a solution in choosing the <b>right</b> <b>gears.</b> The organiser should give an idea of what's needed in the race bible. I would see it, as a former rider (and organiser of the Dauphiné Libéré) as my duty.|$|R
2500|$|... 2008 – A Briko Air C402 {{suffered}} {{a failure of}} the <b>right</b> main <b>gear</b> and crash landed, closing the airport for two hours. No deaths.|$|R
50|$|When {{the handle}} for {{lowering}} {{the landing gear}} was activated, the indicator showed two green and one red light. The red light indicated that the <b>right</b> main <b>gear</b> was not locked in position. The landing was aborted. Attempts at lowering the gear manually were also unsuccessful. Investigation into {{the cause of the}} failure to deploy revealed that the <b>right</b> main <b>gear</b> hydraulics actuator eyebolt was separated from the actuator. A further analysis of the actuator showed corrosion on the inside leading to reduced mechanical strength of the actuator and eventual failure.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 March 2011, an Air Iceland Bombardier Q100 Dash 8 {{aircraft}} {{suffered a}} collapsed right landing gear whilst landing at Nuuk Airport, Greenland. Several of the 31 Passengers on board reported a severe crosswind gust {{immediately prior to}} the main gear touching down, {{which resulted in the}} aircraft drifting over and subsequently making contact with snow banks alongside the runway, causing the <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> to collapse.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 July 1959, an East Anglian Flying Services Vickers 614 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPH) {{was written}} {{off in a}} landing accident. On {{approach}} the aircraft's right-hand main gear indicator showed that the gear was unsafe. An emergency landing was made on the grass parallel to the runway. The <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> collapsed and the aircraft swung to the right, damaging it beyond repair. None of the 39 occupants were injured.|$|E
50|$|After takeoff, {{failures}} {{continued to}} multiply. While the aircraft was supersonic {{en route to}} the destination airport, Tupolev bureau's crisis centre predicted that the front and left landing gear would not extend and that the aircraft would have to land on the <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> alone, at a landing speed of over 300 km/h. Due to expected political fallout, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was personally notified {{of what was going on}} in the air.|$|E
50|$|Prior to landing, the <b>right</b> main landing <b>gear</b> {{failed to}} lock {{and the crew}} circled for an hour before {{attempting}} a prepared emergency landing. Upon touchdown, the <b>right</b> landing <b>gear</b> collapsed, the <b>right</b> wing touched ground, and a fire broke out. The fire went out before the aircraft came to rest and all passengers and crew were evacuated. Five people suffered minor injuries, some from propeller parts entering the cabin and others from the evacuation.|$|R
50|$|On 2015 a Phoenix Air Learjet 35 (registered N80PG) skidded, {{followed}} by <b>right</b> main <b>gear</b> collapse which damaged the plane substantially at Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport. Cause {{is still under}} investigation.|$|R
50|$|A {{spiral bevel}} gear set should always be {{replaced}} in pairs i.e. both the left hand and <b>right</b> hand <b>gears</b> should be replaced together since the gears are manufactured and lapped in pairs.|$|R
50|$|In racing, short {{shifting}} is {{a technique}} intended to avoid losing valuable acceleration time changing gears later. Although this means {{not being able to}} accelerate using the engine's peak power at the moment of the gear change, total acceleration over time may be greater as no acceleration can happen during the gear change. This can aid overtaking by ensuring that the car is in the <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> in anticipation of a manoeuvre.|$|E
50|$|The landing {{was normal}} until the {{beginning}} of the flare phase. The MD-11 touched down, bounced, and rolled to the right. On the second touchdown, about 1,100 feet later, the <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> snapped and the No. 3 engine (right wing engine) contacted the runway, with the right roll continuing until the right wing spars broke. The aircraft came to rest off {{the right side of the}} runway, on its back, and on fire. All five occupants escaped through a cockpit window. The airplane was destroyed by fire.|$|E
5000|$|Although the TE2800 is {{the fastest}} Manta A ever made, it is not officially an Opel. It could outrun cars like the 911 Carrera of 1973 and the BMW2002 turbo from 1973, even though those cars had more engine power. The low weight of the Manta {{bodyshell}} and {{the combination of the}} <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> ratios was what gave the car its success. However, the cars were very expensive, almost twice the price of a [...] GT/E in 1975. Very few of these cars exist today, as most were used in rally and motorsport events.|$|E
50|$|On May 3, 1947, AOA's Flagship Denmark {{was damaged}} {{on the runway}} in Boston when the right wing struck the ground because the <b>right</b> landing <b>gear</b> was {{retracted}} while the plane was on the ground.|$|R

5000|$|The second {{incident}} occurred on July 19, 1990. It involved an ex-Air Anglia F-27-200 (registration G-BCDO) in a landing accident at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport {{at the end}} of a scheduled flight from London Stansted. The aircraft's right-hand main gear failed to lock down while preparing to land. This resulted in a forced landing with the <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> retracted, damaging the aircraft beyond repair. There were no injuries among the 17 passengers and four crew members. (The aircraft was subsequently ferried to Air UK's base at Norwich Airport, where it was withdrawn from service and scrapped.) ...|$|E
5000|$|On September 4, 2002, Asian Spirit Flight 897 was {{the last}} flight {{of the day to}} Malay, departing Manila at 3:36 pm for a one-hour flight. During the {{approach}} to Malay, the right main gear failed to deploy. The approach was abandoned and the crew decided to return to Manila for an emergency landing. The plane circled for about 35 minutes over Las Piñas City to burn off fuel. The crew then carried out an emergency landing with the <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> retracted on Manila's international airport runway 24. After touchdown the aircraft swerved off the runway onto a grassy area.|$|E
50|$|March 8, 2003 - a Fokker F27-500 Friendship {{with the}} {{registration}} N712FE, {{en route from}} Greensboro, North Carolina to New Bern, North Carolina, indicated an unsafe landing gear condition during the approach to New Bern. A tower flyby was performed, and the tower controller confirmed the <b>right</b> <b>gear</b> was not fully extended. The crew declared an emergency and diverted to Kinston Regional Jetport to conduct an emergency landing. On the landing roll the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid off the runway. Examination of the right main landing gear revealed the drag brace was fractured. The aircraft was retired from service. There were no casualties.|$|E
50|$|On July 6, 1997, Delta Air Lines Flight 1470, a Boeing 727 {{suffered}} a <b>right</b> landing <b>gear</b> failure after landing on Runway 21. While {{there were no}} fatalities, 3 people were injured and the aircraft suffered serious damage.|$|R
50|$|On February 27, 2008, {{at about}} 01:41 local, a Cessna 210L, N5489V, {{operated}} as FLX 805, experienced {{collapse of the}} <b>right</b> main landing <b>gear</b> during landing at TPA. The airplane was substantially damaged and the pilot was not injured. The flight originated from CAE about 2243.

5000|$|On 12 February 2009 a British Aerospace Jetstream 31 {{registered}} SX-SKY {{experienced a}} <b>right</b> main <b>gear</b> collapse after landing inbound from Rhodes. None of the 15 passengers and 3 crew were injured, but the aircraft sustained considerable damage to its <b>right</b> landing <b>gear,</b> wing and propeller that was deemed beyond economical repair, {{resulting in the}} aircraft being written-off. The cause of the accident was that the aircraft had previously suffered two heavy landings in the previous 27 which were not reported. One of the heavy landings caused a fracture in a landing gear cylinder, which propagated until the cylinder failed, causing the landing gear to collapse. SX-SKY was noted being scrapped at Heraklion airport in late February 2011.|$|R
