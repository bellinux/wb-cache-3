40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the coloration characteristics by identifying the factor affecting <b>red</b> coloration of <b>copper</b> <b>red</b> glaze in traditional Korean ceramics. This study analyzed the characteristics of the reduction-fired <b>copper</b> <b>red</b> glaze by using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, EDX and UV-vis spectroscopy. As a result of XRD analysis, the glaze completely melted and amorphous glass appeared overall, and the characteristic peak of metal Cu was shown together. In addition, as a result of Raman analysis, the characteristic bands of CuO and Cu 2 O were shown together. The distribution of component elements was observed by EDX. As a result, copper(Cu) were distributed throughout the glaze. Thus, it was shown that <b>copper</b> <b>red</b> glaze appeared the best red coloration because metal Cu, CuO and Cu 2 O evenly existed throughout glaze in particle colloidal state. The chroma value of the <b>copper</b> <b>red</b> glaze was CIE L * 30. 07, a * 13. 65, b * 3. 72. Wine-Red Solutio...|$|R

The Gentiles, whose skillfulness in this art is commendable, make basilisks in this manner. They have, underground, a house walled with stones everywhere, above and below, with two very small windows, so narrow that scarcely any light can appear through them; in this house they place two old cocks of twelve or fifteen years, and they give them plenty of food. When these have become fat, through the heat of their good condition, they agree together and lay eggs. Which being laid, the cocks are taken out and toads are placed in, which may hatch the eggs, and to which bread is given for food. The eggs being hatched, chickens issue out, like hens' chickens, to which after seven days grow the tails of serpents, and immediately, if there were not a stone pavement to the house, they would enter the earth. Guarding against which, their masters have round brass vessels of large size, perforated all over, the mouths of which are narrow, in which they place these chickens, and close the mouths with copper coverings and inter them underground, and they are nourished with the fine earth entering through the holes for six months. After this they uncover them and apply a copious fire, until the animals' insides are completely burnt. Which done, when they have become cold, they are taken out and carefully ground, adding to them a third part of the blood of a red man, which blood has been dried and ground. These two compositions are tempered with sharp acid in a clean vessel; they then take very thin sheets of the purest <b>red</b> <b>copper,</b> and anoint this composition over them on both sides, {{and place them in}} the fire. And when they have become glowing, they take them out and quench and wash them in the same confection; and they do this for a long time, until this composition eats through the copper, and it takes the color of gold. This gold is proper for all work."--Ib. p. 267.|$|E

60|$|It {{was beaten}} hard, the team were fresh and fast, {{and for a}} while the girl felt the exhilaration of the swift rush through nipping air. The desolate town faded behind her; a grey blur that lifted itself out of the horizon, and was a big birch bluff, came flitting back to her; there was deep stillness, only {{intensified}} by the screech of runners and the soft drumming of hoofs. A vast sweep of fleckless azure overhung the glistening plain below. It was not all white, however, for there were shades of grey and dusky purple in the hollows, and the trail was a wavy riband that rose and fell in varying blue. It was beautiful in its own way, and the stinging air stirred her blood like wine. That was for an hour or so; but when the sun dipped, a <b>red,</b> <b>copper</b> ball, amidst a frosty haze, and the blues and greys crept wide across the whiteness of the plain, the cold laid hold of her.

And such skirts as Ann Veronica had had when she entered the valley of Saas were safely packed away in the hotel, and she wore a leather belt and loose knickerbockers and puttees--a costume that suited the fine, long lines of her limbs far better than any feminine walking-dress could do. Her complexion had resisted the snow-glare wonderfully; her skin had only deepened its natural warmth a little under the Alpine sun. She had pushed aside her azure veil, taken off her snow-glasses, and sat smiling under her hand at the shining glories--the lit cornices, the blue shadows, the softly rounded, enormous snow masses, the deep places full of quivering luminosity--of the Taschhorn and Dom. The sky was cloudless, effulgent blue.|$|E
60|$|Somebody {{staring into}} the sky with the same {{ethereal}} appetite declared that the moon was made of green cheese. I never could conscientiously accept the full doctrine. I am Modernist in this matter. That the moon is made of cheese I have believed from childhood; {{and in the course}} of every month a giant (of my acquaintance) bites a big round piece out of it. This seems to me a doctrine that is above reason, but not contrary to it. But that the cheese is green seems to be in some degree actually contradicted by the senses and the reason; first because if the moon were made of green cheese it would be inhabited; and second because if it were made of green cheese it would be green. A blue moon is said to be an unusual sight; but I cannot think that a green one is much more common. In fact, I think I have seen the moon looking like every other sort of cheese except a green cheese. I have seen it look exactly like a cream cheese: a circle of warm white upon a warm faint violet sky above a cornfield in Kent. I have seen it look very like a Dutch cheese, rising a dull <b>red</b> <b>copper</b> disk amid masts and dark waters at Honfleur. I have seen it look like an ordinary sensible Cheddar cheese in an ordinary sensible Prussian blue sky; and I have once seen it so naked and ruinous-looking, so strangely lit up, that it looked like a Gruyere cheese, that awful volcanic cheese that has horrible holes in it, as if it had come in boiling unnatural milk from mysterious and unearthly cattle. But I have never yet seen the lunar cheese green; and I incline to the opinion that the moon is not old enough. The moon, like everything else, will ripen by the end of the world; and in the last days we shall see it taking on those volcanic sunset colours, and leaping with that enormous and fantastic life.|$|E

The characteristics of the reduction-fired <b>copper</b> <b>red</b> glaze’s sections are analyzed using an optical microscope, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDX). The sections observed using an optical microscope are divided into domains of surface, red-bubble, and red band. According to the Raman micro spectroscopy analysis results, the major characteristic peak is identified as silicate in all three domains, and the intensity of Cu 2 O increases toward the red band. In addition, it is confirmed that the most abundant CuO exists in the glaze bubbles. Moreover, CuO and Cu 2 O exist as fine particles in a dispersed state in the surface domain. Thus, Cu combined with oxygen is distributed evenly throughout the <b>copper</b> <b>red</b> glaze, and Cu 2 O is more concentrated toward the interface between body and glaze. It is also confirmed that CuO is concentrated around the bubbles. Therefore, it is concluded that the red coloration of the <b>copper</b> <b>red</b> glaze is revealed no...|$|R

6000|$|Meanwhile {{the caravan}} {{continued}} its course down the broad smooth Wady Ruways, on whose left side {{was a large}} atelier, with broken walls and spalled quartz of the Negro variety. Here we found, for the first time, the handmills made of the hardest grey granite, so beautifully worked further south; they explained the fine and carefully polished tube which {{had been brought to}} the first Expedition at Zibá.[EN#10] Several of these articles were all but whole, an exception in this land of [...] "clasts." [...] We then struck over the stony divide to the left, towards a fine landmark--a Khitm, or [...] "block," [...] shaped like a seal cut en cabochon: its name is the barbarous sounding Khurm el-Badaríyyah. During the ascent, which was easy, we passed a second strew and scatter of the white stone broken into small pieces. From the Col, reached at 9.45 a.m., a descent, vile for camels not for mules, presently landed us in the Wady Umm Ámil. The left bank of the hideous narrow gorge showed a line of wells or water-pits, made, said Furayj, by the Mutakaddimín (veteres),--the Ancients who were probably Mediævals. Crossing the torrent-gully we left on its right bank the ruins of large works, especially the upper parallelogram. After a thirteen miles' ride we halted at 10.40 a.m. under a rock on the left side, opposite three couthless heaps of water-rolled stones surrounded by fine quartz. By far the poorest thing we had yet seen, this [...] "town" [...] had been grandiosely described to the first Expedition at Zibá. Many blessings were heaped upon the head of Ámil and his mother: the name, however, as the Sayyid suggested, is evidently a corruption of Mu'ámil--"the workman, the employee."[EN#11] I would conjecture that here the slave-miners were stationed, Old Zibá being the master's abode: our caravan entitled it El-Lomán--"the bagnio, the prison for galériens."
