5|$|A segment with <b>Raven</b> {{took place}} where he demanded {{to be placed in}} the main event for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Larry Zbyszko disagreed, {{resulting}} in <b>Raven</b> attacking him before security pulled <b>Raven</b> off. Rhino then came out and stated that he deserved the title shot more than <b>Raven.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Raven</b> and NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zybysko {{continued}} their feud after Turning Point. On the December17, 2005 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that at Final Resolution he would choose a new opponent to challenge <b>Raven.</b> He added a stipulation that if <b>Raven</b> won he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, but if <b>Raven</b> lost, {{he would be}} fired from TNA. <b>Raven</b> faced Sean Waltman at the show in a Raven's Rules match. <b>Raven</b> lost the match after interference from Zybysko. Due to the stipulation attached, <b>Raven</b> was fired in the storyline.|$|E
5|$|<b>Raven</b> and NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zybysko were {{involved}} in a rivalry heading into Final Resolution. At Bound for Glory, <b>Raven</b> requested an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match but was denied by Zybysko. This led to <b>Raven</b> assaulting him before being ejected from the arena by security in the storyline. At Genesis, Zybysko offered <b>Raven</b> the chance to be released from his contract, as this was what Zybysko wanted in the storyline. <b>Raven</b> declined the offer and tried to attack Zybysko once again. Instead, Zybysko forced <b>Raven</b> to face P.J. Polaco in a match, which <b>Raven</b> won. This led to Turning Point where <b>Raven</b> once again declined an offer to be released. Zybysko then revealed Chris K as Raven's opponent for the night; <b>Raven</b> was victorious in the encounter. On the December17, 2005 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that at Final Resolution <b>Raven</b> would have another opponent and if he won the bout then he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match.|$|E

25|$|Nicod's {{criterion}} {{says that}} only observations of <b>ravens</b> should affect one's {{view as to}} whether all <b>ravens</b> are black. Observing more instances of black <b>ravens</b> should support the view, observing white or coloured <b>ravens</b> should contradict it, and observations of non-ravens should not have any influence.|$|R
5|$|The Australian raven's closest {{relatives}} {{are the other}} two species of <b>raven</b> occurring in Australia: the little <b>raven</b> and forest <b>raven.</b> The Australian <b>raven</b> is also somewhat {{closely related to the}} Torresian and little crow, although not as closely related as it is to the other <b>raven</b> species. Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three <b>raven</b> species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little <b>raven</b> may be nested within the Australian <b>raven,</b> though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed. Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian <b>raven</b> to form two clades, almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little <b>raven</b> are to each other. This led the authors to propose that the subspecies be recognised as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The Chaldean myth the Epic of Gilgamesh, Utnapishtim {{releases}} a dove and a <b>raven</b> to find land; the dove merely circles and returns. Only then does Utnapishtim send forth the <b>raven,</b> {{which does not}} return, and Utnapishtim concludes the <b>raven</b> has found land.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event pitted <b>Raven</b> against P.J. Polaco. This match {{occurred}} because <b>Raven</b> refused to quit the company, which was something NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko had requested in the storyline. Since <b>Raven</b> refused to quit, Zbyszko forced him to wrestle Polaco. Cassidy Riley interfered in the match by attempting to aid <b>Raven.</b> The duration of the bout was 5 minutes and 45 seconds. <b>Raven</b> won the contest by forcing Polaco's head into the mat with his signature Even Flow DDT maneuver.|$|E

5|$|The {{predominant}} bout on {{the card}} was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion <b>Raven</b> and the challenger Rhino. At Sacrifice, <b>Raven</b> teamed with Sabu to face the team of Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. On the pre-show of the gathering, Zbyszko announced if Jarrett pinned <b>Raven</b> during the contest then he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match. However, he added that if <b>Raven</b> pinned Jarrett during the contest then Jarrett would not have another title match for an entire year. Rhino ended up pinning <b>Raven</b> at the event, with TNA declaring him number-one contender on their website after the show. Tenay promoted <b>Raven</b> versus Rhino for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Unbreakable on the August19 episode of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match of}} the show was between <b>Raven</b> and Chris K. This match {{occurred}} because <b>Raven</b> refused to quit the company, which was something NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko had requested in the storyline. <b>Raven</b> pinned Chris K after slamming Chris K's head into the mat with his signature <b>Raven</b> Effect DDT maneuver at 5 minutes and 45 seconds in.|$|E
5|$|A circovirus—given {{the name}} <b>raven</b> circovirus or RaCV—was {{isolated}} from an Australian <b>raven</b> suffering from feather lesions in 2006. It has affinities with canary circovirus (CaCV) and pigeon circovirus (PiCV). Its clinical significance is unknown. Tick infestation {{is rare in}} the Australian <b>raven,</b> with Ixodes holocyclus and Amblyomma triguttatum recorded. Lice and hippoboscid flies have been recorded yet little-researched, and an infestation by the fly Passeromyia longicornis was recorded in one nest.|$|E
2500|$|Hence, {{from the}} Bayesian-Carnapian point of view, the {{observation}} of a non-raven does not tell us anything about the color of <b>ravens,</b> but it tells us about the prevalence of <b>ravens,</b> and supports [...] "All <b>ravens</b> are black" [...] by reducing our estimate {{of the number of}} <b>ravens</b> that might not be black.|$|R
50|$|As of the 2010 season, any <b>Ravens</b> preseason games not on {{national}} television are seen on WBAL-TV in Baltimore and on Mid-Atlantic Sports Network throughout the region.

5|$|German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus {{other species}} {{as far as}} India into a single species, C. coronoides, as he {{believed}} there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official RAOU checklist listed three species (Australian <b>raven,</b> Torresian crow and little crow), with the little <b>raven</b> recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest <b>raven</b> in 1970. Streseman described C. difficilis in 1943 from a single specimen, now {{thought to have been}} an unusual Australian <b>raven</b> or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.|$|E
50|$|Trying to halt a two-game losing streak, the <b>Ravens</b> {{traveled}} to MetLife {{for one of}} their two straight games there.

The <b>Ravens</b> defense allowed Beckham two 60+ yard touchdowns, helping the Giants win.|$|R

50|$|It is {{not known}} how long the <b>ravens</b> {{have been living in}} the Tower of London, but they were {{resident}} by the time of King Charles II. Legend maintains that should the <b>ravens</b> ever leave the Tower, the White Tower will fall and disaster will befall the kingdom. When he received complaints that the <b>ravens</b> interfered with observatory work, Charles ordered the re-siting of the Royal Observatory to Greenwich rather than remove the <b>ravens.</b> In order to prevent the <b>ravens</b> from flying away, their flight feathers are trimmed so that they cannot fly in a straight line for any appreciable distance. The <b>ravens</b> are free, however, to roam the Tower grounds.|$|R
