40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} nitrogen (N) level on iron (Fe) content in <b>milled</b> <b>rice,</b> a field experiment was carried out under three N application levels including 0, 150 and 300 kg/hm 2 by using 120 rice genotypes. In addition to the genotypic differences of iron content in <b>milled</b> <b>rice,</b> grain yield, 1000 -grain weight and N content in grains under the same N level, there were also variations in the response of Fe content in <b>milled</b> <b>rice</b> to N levels. Based on the range and variation coefficient of Fe content in <b>milled</b> <b>rice</b> under the three N levels, the response of Fe content in <b>milled</b> <b>rice</b> to N levels could be classified into four types including highly insensitive, insensitive, sensitive and highly sensitive types. A significant quadratic correlation {{was found between the}} Fe content in <b>milled</b> <b>rice</b> and 1000 -grain weight or the N content in grains. However, no significant correlation between the Fe content in <b>milled</b> <b>rice</b> and grain yield was detected. In conclusion, there are genotypic differences in the effects of N levels on Fe content in <b>milled</b> <b>rice,</b> which is favorable to breeding of Fe-rich rice under different N environments.

Rice starch granules begin to swell radially, then undergo radial contraction and random tangential expansion to form complex structures in the gelatinization temperature range. At the end of the gelatinization temperature range, starch granules begin to lose their granular structures. At higher temperatures, rice starch granules soften and melt into thin flat disks and then stretch into thin filaments to form a three-dimensional network. During this transition, rapid increases in swelling power and solubility occur. These progressive configurational changes are reflected in the amylograph curves. Susceptibility of the starch granules dispersed in excess water to changes during heating is dependent on gelatinization temperature range during initial swelling and on the ratio of amylose to amylopectin in the latter stage of swelling. Birefringence end-point temperature (BEPT) was affected mainly by the degree of crystallinity (r = 0. 67 [superscript]**);The progressive structural changes of <b>milled</b> <b>rice</b> grains proceed from the periphery {{toward the center of the}} endosperm as water diffuses.
