To {{complete}} {{the series of}} considerations connected with the philosophical character of the syllogism, it is requisite to consider, since the syllogism is not the universal type of the reasoning process, what is the <b>real</b> <b>type.</b> This resolves itself into the question, {{what is the nature}} of the minor premise, and in what manner it contributes to establish the conclusion: for as to the major, we now fully understand, that the place which it nominally occupies in our reasonings, properly belongs to the individual facts or observations of which it expresses the general result; the major itself being no real part of the argument, but an intermediate halting-place for the mind, interposed by an artifice of language between the real premises and the conclusion, by way of a security, which it is in a most material degree, for the correctness of the process. The minor, however, being an indispensable part of the syllogistic expression of an argument, without doubt either is, or corresponds to, an equally indispensable part of the argument itself, and we have only to inquire what part.|$|E
60|$|The {{interest}} {{aroused by}} the mining-camp tales influenced other American writers {{to discover the}} neglected literary wealth of their several localities; but they were fortunately on guard against Harte's exaggerated sentimentality and related their stories with more art and more truth to nature. As a specific example read Cable's Old Creole Days and Madame Delphine with their exquisite pictures {{of life in the}} old French city of New Orleans. These are romances or creations of fancy, to be sure; but in their lifelike characters, their natural scenes and soft Creole dialect they are as realistic (that is, as true to a <b>real</b> <b>type</b> of American life) as anything that can be found in literature. They are, in fact, studies as well as stories, such minute and affectionate studies of old people, old names and old customs as the great French novelist Balzac made in preparation for his work. Though time holds its own secrets, one can hardly avoid the conviction that Old Creole Days and Madame Delphine are not books of a day but permanent additions to American fiction.|$|E

60|$|There {{seems to}} be an {{extraordinary}} idea abroad that Fielding was in some way an immoral or offensive writer. I have been astounded by the number of the leading articles, literary articles, and other articles written about him just now {{in which there is a}} curious tone of apologising for the man. One critic says that after all he couldn't help it, because he lived in the eighteenth century; another says that we must allow for the change of manners and ideas; another says that he was not altogether without generous and humane feelings; another suggests that he clung feebly, after all, to a few of the less important virtues. What on earth does all this mean? Fielding described Tom Jones as going on in a certain way, in which, most unfortunately, a very large number of young men do go on. It is unnecessary to say that Henry Fielding knew that it was an unfortunate way of going on. Even Tom Jones knew that. He said in so many words that it was a very unfortunate way of going on; he said, one may almost say, that it had ruined his life; the passage is there for the benefit of any one who may take the trouble to read the book. There is ample evidence (though even this is of a mystical and indirect kind), there is ample evidence that Fielding probably thought that it was better to be Tom Jones than to be an utter coward and sneak. There is simply not one rag or thread or speck of evidence to show that Fielding thought that it was better to be Tom Jones than to be a good man. All that he is concerned with is the description of a definite and very <b>real</b> <b>type</b> of young man; the young man whose passions and whose selfish necessities sometimes seemed to be stronger than anything else in him.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the various}} awkward and unfortunate efforts which the French have {{made at the}} {{development}} of a social system, they have at least stated one true principle, that of fraternity or brotherhood.

6000|$|Independently of the {{essential}} gift of poetic feeling, as we have now attempted to describe it, a certain rugged sterling worth pervades whatever Burns has written: a virtue, as of green fields and mountain breezes, dwells in his poetry; it is redolent of natural life, and hardy, natural men. There is a decisive strength in him; and yet a sweet native gracefulness: he is tender, and he is vehement, yet without constraint or too visible effort; he melts the heart, or inflames it, with a power which seems habitual and familiar to him. We see in him the gentleness, the trembling pity of a woman, with the deep earnestness, the force and passionate ardor of a hero. Tears lie in him, and consuming fire; as lightning lurks in the drops of the summer cloud. He has a resonance in his bosom for every note of human feeling: the high and the low, the sad, the ludicrous, the joyful, are welcome in their turns to his [...] "lightly-moved and all-conceiving spirit." [...] And observe with what a prompt and eager force he grasps his subject, be it what it may!

Is it of reason--some truth to be discovered? No sophistry, no vain surface-logic detains him; quick, resolute, unerring, he pierces through into the marrow of the question, and speaks his verdict with an emphasis {{that can not be}} forgotten. Is it of description--some visual object to be represented? No poet of any age or nation is more graphic than Burns: the characteristic features disclose themselves to him at a glance; three lines from his hand, and we have a likeness. And, in that rough dialect, in that rude, often awkward, metre, so clear, and definite a likeness! It seems a draughtsman working with a burnt stick; and yet the burin of a Retzsch is not more expressive or exact.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of higher-order exact real number {{computation}} based on Scott domain theory. Our main object of investigation is a higher-order functional programming language, Real PCF, which {{is an extension of}} PCF with a data <b>type</b> for <b>real</b> numbers and constants for primitive real functions. Real PCF has both operational and denotational semantics, related by a computational adequacy property. In the standard interpretation of <b>Real</b> PCF, <b>types</b> are interpreted as continuous Scott domains. We refer to the domains in the universe of discourse of Real PCF induced by the standard interpretation of <b>types</b> as the <b>real</b> numbers <b>type</b> hierarchy. Sequences are functions defined on natural numbers, and predicates are truth-valued functions. Thus, in the <b>real</b> numbers <b>types</b> hierarchy we have real numbers, functions between real numbers, predicates defined on real numbers, sequences of real numbers, sequences of sequences of real numbers, sequences of functions, functionals mapping sequences to numbers (such as limiting operators), functionals mapping functions to numbers (such as integration and supremum operators), functionals mapping predicates to truth-values (such as existential and universal quantification operators), and so on. As it is well-known, the notion of computability on a domain depends on the choice of an effective presentation. We say that an effective presentation of the <b>real</b> numbers <b>type</b> hierarchy is sound if all Real PCF definable elements and functions are computable with respect to it. The idea is that Real PCF has an effective operational semantics, and therefore the definable elements and functions should be regarded as concretely computable. We then show that there is a unique sound effective presentation of the <b>real</b> numbers <b>type</b> hierarchy, up to equivalence with respect to the induced notion of computability. We can thus say that there is an absolute notion of computability for the <b>real</b> numbers <b>type</b> hierarchy. All computable elements and all computable first-order functions in the <b>real</b> numbers <b>type</b> hierarchy are <b>Real</b> PCF definable. However, as it is the case for PCF, some higher-order computable functions, including an existential quantifier, fail to be definable. If a constant for the existential quantifier (or, equivalently, a computable supremum operator) is added, the computational adequacy property remains true, and Real PCF becomes a computationally complete programming language, in the sense that all computable functions of all orders become definable. We introduce induction principles and recursion schemes for the real numbers domain, which are formally similar to the so-called Peano axioms for natural numbers. These principles and schemes abstractly characterize the real numbers domain up to isomorphism, {{in the same way as}} the so-called Peano axioms for natural numbers characterize the natural numbers. On the practical side, they allow us to derive recursive definitions of real functions, which immediately give rise to correct Real PCF programs (by an application of computational adequacy). Also, these principles form the core of the proof of absoluteness of the standard effective presentation of the <b>real</b> numbers <b>type</b> hierarchy, and of the proof of computational completeness of Real PCF. Finally, results on integration in Real PCF consisting of joint work with Abbas Edalat are included...|$|R
