The name was later changed to Stamford after a town in Lincolnshire, England. The deed to Stamford was signed on 1 July 1640 between Captain Turner of the New Haven Colony and Chief Ponus. The land that now forms the city of Stamford was bought for 12 coats, 12 hoes, 12 <b>ratchets,</b> 12 glasses, 12 knives, four kettles, and four fathoms of white wampum. The deed was renegotiated several times until 1700 when the territory was given up by the Native American inhabitants for a more substantial sum of money.|$|E

The above-water track was re-laid, reusing the original cast iron centre rails with their integral <b>ratchets.</b> The cradle was completely rebuilt on the original pattern. The functioning of the slipway was essential for the long-term preservation of the restored Underfall Yard as a historic industrial monument, as it provided the Underfall Restoration Trust with funds to maintain slipway and buildings, and the tenants of those buildings with boats to earn a living.|$|E

Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, stating that Redemption is [...] "a more sober, stripped-down version of 24, and that’s refreshing," [...] {{and that it}} was the first time a terrorist threat did not take place in Southern California, and the depiction of the conflict in Sangala is highly realistic and compelling. Stanley also said that a two-hour version of 24 proves that downsizing isn't always a bad thing. Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times praised the film, acknowledging the producers taking on board the criticism and moral issues regarding the use of torture, and stated that a group of innocent young children running for their lives [...] "instantly <b>ratchets</b> up a story's emotional level." ...|$|E

Goldman ultimately gave the episode an eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal felt that the episode was the series' best installment. Writing for The Grand Rapids Press, John Serba opined that [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] was a delightful ending to the first portion of the season. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club stated that prior to its ending, the episode was [...] "the usual mix of pretty good and deeply irritating." [...] Handlen lauded the character development in the installment; [...] "The episode {{puts a lot of}} effort into heightening the tensions between Hershel and Rick's people, and while it’s not exactly subtle, it makes enough sense to be effective. This is conflict that should've been building for a few episodes now, instead of arriving fully formed right before it explodes, but I'm willing to take what I can get." [...] Concluding his review, he issued the episode an A– grade. Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffrey avouched that [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] was [...] "excellent", and added that the tension [...] "slowly <b>ratchets</b> up to an almost unbearable level." [...] Some critics were divided with the episode. Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that while the writers put a lot of substance into the characters, many of them are still underdeveloped.

500|$|Through Turkish ambassadorial {{visits and}} other contacts, Europeans gained {{a fascination with}} the [...] "barbarous", noisy sound of these bands, {{and a number of}} European courts {{established}} [...] "Turkish" [...] military ensembles in the late-17th and early 18th centuries. The music played by these ensembles, however, were not authentically Turkish music, but rather compositions in the prevalent European manner. The general enthusiasm quickly spread to opera and concert orchestras, where the combination of bass drum, cymbals, tambourines, and triangles were collectively referred to as [...] "Turkish music". The best-known examples include Haydn's Symphony No. 100, which acquired its nickname, [...] "The Military", from its use of these instruments, and three of Beethoven's works: the [...] "alla marcia" [...] section from the finale of his Symphony No. 9 (an early sketch reads: [...] "end of the Symphony with Turkish music"), his [...] "Wellington's Victory"—or Battle Symphony—with picturesque sound effects (the bass drums are designated as [...] "cannons", side drums represent opposing troops of soldiers, and <b>ratchets</b> the sound of rifle fire), and the [...] "Turkish March" [...] (with the expected bass drum, cymbals, and triangle) and the [...] "Chorus of Dervishes" [...] from his incidental music to The Ruins of Athens, where he calls for the use of every available noisy instrument: castanets, cymbals, and so forth. By the end of the 18th century, the batterie turque had become so fashionable that keyboard instruments were fitted with devices to simulate the bass drum (a mallet with a padded head hitting the back of the sounding board), cymbals (strips of brass striking the lower strings), and the triangle and bells (small metal objects struck by rods). Even when percussion instruments were not actually employed, certain alla turca [...] "tricks" [...] were used to imitate these percussive effects. Examples include the [...] "Rondo alla turca" [...] from Mozart's Piano Sonata, K. 331, and part of the finale of his Violin Concerto, K. 219.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented {{based upon the}} Linear Matching Method framework in order to directly calculate the <b>ratchet</b> limit of structures subjected to arbitrary thermo-mechanical load histories. Traditionally, <b>ratchet</b> analysis methods have been based upon the fundamental premise of decomposing the cyclic load history into cyclic and constant components respectively, {{in order to assess}} the magnitude of additional constant loading a structure may accommodate before <b>ratcheting</b> occurs. The method proposed in this paper, for the first time, accurately and efficiently calculates the <b>ratchet</b> limit with respect to a proportional variation between the cyclic primary and secondary loads, as opposed to an additional primary load only. The method is a strain based approach and utilises a novel convergence scheme in order to calculate an approximate <b>ratchet</b> boundary based upon a predefined target magnitude of <b>ratchet</b> strain per cycle. The <b>ratcheting</b> failure mechanism evaluated by the method leads to less conservative <b>ratchet</b> boundaries compared to the traditional Bree solution.

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the <b>ratcheting</b> socket wrench, often improperly called a <b>ratchet.</b> A <b>ratcheting</b> socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} <b>ratcheting</b> mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the <b>ratchet</b> loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the <b>ratchet</b> does not turn the socket but allows the <b>ratchet</b> handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This <b>ratcheting</b> action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the <b>ratchet</b> head that allows the user to apply the <b>ratcheting</b> action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket wrenches include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R
