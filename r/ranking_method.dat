40|$|Learning to rank is an {{increasingly}} important scientific field that comprises the use of machine learning for the ranking task. New learning to <b>rank</b> <b>methods</b> are generally evaluated on benchmark test collections. However, comparison of learning to <b>rank</b> <b>methods</b> based on evaluation results is hindered {{by the absence of}} a standard set of evaluation benchmark collections. In this paper we propose a way to compare learning to <b>rank</b> <b>methods</b> based on a sparse set of evaluation results on a set of benchmark datasets. Our comparison methodology consists of two components: (1) Normalized Winning Number, which gives insight in the ranking accuracy of the learning to <b>rank</b> <b>method,</b> and (2) Ideal Winning Number, which gives insight in the degree of certainty concerning its ranking accuracy. Evaluation results of 87 learning to <b>rank</b> <b>methods</b> on 20 well-known benchmark datasets are collected through a structured literature search.

3000|$|<b>Rank</b> <b>method</b> The <b>rank</b> <b>method</b> first juxtaposes all node IDs in a {{line and}} then assigns each node a rank(ID) {{according}} to the nodeâs position in the line. Then, instead of embedding a node ID directly into a packet, the rank(ID) of the node is embedded. In WSNs, hexadecimal numbers with the same length are typically used to represent node IDs, e.g., 0 Â ÃÂ  2501, 0 Â ÃÂ  2502, etc. Furthermore, if a WSN contains different types of nodes, they may not always use the same approach to represent their node IDs. As a result, by using the <b>rank</b> <b>method</b> the BS can use natural numbers 0, 1, 2,... to represent these nodes, and therefore the provenance size is compressed. As the BS knows the bijection between a node ID and its rank(ID), the subgraphs carried by each packet can be decoded.|$|R
