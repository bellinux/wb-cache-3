40|$|Background and Aims: Neuraxial {{anaesthesia}} {{has become}} popular for the <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries</b> {{during the last}} few years. This study was aimed at comparing general anaesthesia (GA) with epidural anaesthesia in patients undergoing <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Methods: One hundred American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status-I and II adult consenting patients of both gender in the age group of 25 - 55 years undergoing <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries</b> were randomly assigned to two groups of 50 patients each: Group G and Group E. Group G patients were administered conventional GA while Group E received epidural anaesthesia (EA) with 3 mg/kg of ropivacaine and 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine. Besides cardio-respiratory parameters, surgeon′s satisfaction, patient′s satisfaction and side effects were observed. Parametric data were analysed by ANOVA while non-parametric data were compared with Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test. Value of P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The demographic profile, total anaesthesia time, surgical time and haemodynamic parameters and surgeon′s satisfaction scores were comparable in both groups. Patient′s satisfaction scores were better in Group E during the post-operative period. Incidence of side-effects such as nausea and vomiting and shivering were higher in Group G (P < 0. 001) while the incidence of dry mouth was higher in Group E (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Epidural anaesthesia with ropivacaine and dexmedetomidine can be safely and effectively used in patients undergoing <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of internal drainage on the perinephric drain after open <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Materials and Methods: 68 patients who had undergone open <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries</b> were prospectively studied. Patients were divided in two groups randomly: Group A (n = 33) without double J stent and group B (n = 35) with Double J stent. In both groups, perinephric drain was placed. Results: The average drain output and duration of perinephric drain kept in group A and B were 36 ml and 29 ml and 4. 63 days and 3. 35 days, respectively. The commonest surgical complication was wound infection (9. 72 %). Complaints like frequency, dysuria, and hematuria during follow-up were less in group A than in group B. Conclusion: With the use of double J stent, there is considerable decrease in drain volume and early removal of perinephric drain. Late irritative urinary complaints were seen more in the group with double J stent...|$|R

40|$|Testicular {{arterial}} anatomy {{is important}} for testicular and <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> It may vary at the origin and arise from renal artery, suprarenal artery or lumbar artery. During routine dissection of 52 -year-old male cadaver; the right testicular artery arising from right aberrant renal artery was found. Anatomical variation of testicular arteries {{is reported to be}} 4. 7 %. Presence of aberrant renal artery is seen in 13 – 16 % of cases only. The origin of right testicular artery from right aberrant renal artery is very rare.

40|$|Percutaneous renal {{access is}} a common {{procedure}} in urologic practice. The main indications are drainage of an obstructed and hydronephrotic kidney and antegrade renal access prior to percutaneous <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries</b> such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and percutaneous endopyelotomy (EP). The contraindications for this technique are patients with history of allergy to topical or local anesthesia and patients with coagulopathy.

50|$|Hamburger {{was born}} to a Jewish family in Paris. Together with René Kuss, Hamburger defined the precise methods and rules for {{conducting}} <b>renal</b> transplantation <b>surgery,</b> and is attributed with founding the medical discipline of nephrology. In 1952, at Necker Hospital in Paris, he performed the first successful <b>renal</b> transplant <b>surgery</b> in France, on a 16-year-old carpenter, Marius Renard who damaged his only kidney when he fell off scaffolding, using a kidney donated by the subject's mother. The organ failed, but rejection was staved off for three weeks, a record at the time. In 1955, he created the very first articifial kidney. Hamburger is credited with major breakthroughs in renal transplants: first prolonged success in 1953, first unqualified success between twins in 1959 and non-twins in 1962.He also authored basic research on the immunological basis of kidney disease, graft immunology and auto-immune diseases.|$|R
40|$|Proper {{knowledge}} of {{variations of the}} vessels of the kidney {{is essential to the}} radiologists and surgeons. One such variation was observed in a 65 -year-old male cadaver at AIMST University, Kedah, Malaysia. The dissection of the abdomen revealed an additional renal artery and an additional renal vein on the right side. In addition to the normal right renal artery, an additional renal artery branched from the ventral side of abdominal aorta and passed laterally to enter into the kidney through the lower part of its hilum. The additional right renal vein emerged from the lowermost end of the hilum, passed medially below the additional renal artery to end in the inferior vena cava below the opening of normal right renal vein. Further, related literature review is done and the urological implications of these variations in <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Kidney {{transplantation}} is {{the treatment}} of choice {{for the vast majority}} of patients with end stage renal disease. Many of the current challenges with the donor grafts are the results of anatomic variants, such as multiple renal arteries, multiple. The previous studies have shown that use of vessel grafts is associated with a higher incidence of vascular and urologic complications. With this back ground the knowledge of variations in vascular pattern is very helpful for renal transplantation and <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Materials and Methods: 100 kidneys (Fifty pairs) intact with abdominal aorta were collected from department of Forensic department, JSS Medical College and Mysore Medical College.

40|$|Emergency surgery {{represents}} an independent {{risk factor for}} death and postoperative complications. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the literature data regarding outcome of daytime or nighttime <b>renal</b> transplantation <b>surgery.</b> Relevant papers, focused on <b>renal</b> transplantation <b>surgery,</b> time of the day, and complications, were searched across the PubMed database. We used the following search terms: "renal", "transplantation", "surgery", "daytime", "nighttime", and "outcome". A total of five papers, including 6, 991 adult patients were evaluated. All patients received renal transplantation from deceased donor. Daytime or nighttime surgery do not seem to negatively impact on graft survival in renal transplantation. However, two out five studies reported higher odds of complications after nighttime operation. Since it is not possible to predict the availability of a deceased donor, nighttime surgery remains a valid option when necessary, maybe deserving a higher level of caution to reduce or avoid complications...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of invasive}} diagnostic and interventional procedures in cardiovascular diseases makes it important that the type and frequency of vascular variations are well documented and understood. With the advent of laparoscopic <b>renal</b> <b>surgeries</b> and donor nephrectomies, it becomes mandatory for the surgeons to understand the abnormality or variations in the renal vasculature. Otherwise renal transplant may be jeopardized {{by the presence of}} aberrant vessels. Existence of the aberrant arteries is accountable in cases of renal pathologies, radiological interventions, renal transplants, and other surgical approach on them. Therefore this case report would serve as ray of light for knowing the possible anatomical variations associated with the renal vasculature. During routine dissection we observed an unusual variation in the vascular supply to the kidney {{on the right side of}} a 60 -year-old male cadaver. However such variation was not found on the opposite side. Patients with such variations may be asymptomatic...|$|R
