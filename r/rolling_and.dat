Just south of the village, NY199 reaches its eastern terminus.

5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, carrots and marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and less often chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the main reason it is prepared before the day it is cooked and served. Many female family members participate in the <b>rolling</b> <b>and</b> stuffing of the vegetables, relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E
5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive <b>rolling</b> <b>and</b> pitching, {{which made it}} difficult to keep the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from the aft, {{made it difficult to}} keep the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the Mk 6 Stable Element (pictured) in this fire control system {{was the same as}} the {{function of}} the Mk 41 Stable Vertical in the main battery system above. It was a vertical seeking gyroscope that supplied the system with a stable up direction on a <b>rolling</b> <b>and</b> pitching ship. In surface mode, it replaced the director's elevation signal. It also had the surface mode firing keys.|$|E

5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies, such as Musca vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of cattle in Australia. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly <b>rolling</b> <b>and</b> burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|E
5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of <b>rolling</b> <b>and</b> drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E
5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But {{in other}} respects, {{they were a}} dismal failure. They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid <b>rolling</b> <b>and</b> pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Indiana was {{commissioned}} on 20 November 1895 {{under the command}} of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction because, with them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the <b>rolling,</b> <b>and</b> they were subsequently installed on all three ships of the Indiana-class.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{regarded}} the ships as poor sea boats, with severe <b>rolling,</b> <b>and</b> {{a tendency to}} take on water. The ships had a very small turning radius, however, and were quick to answer commands from the helm. Their standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men, and while serving as a division flagship, this could be augmented by an additional seven officers and thirty-four sailors. After their reconstruction in the 1890s, the ships' crews were significantly increased, to 33 officers and 344 enlisted men, and later to 35 officers and 401 enlisted men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one launch, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{legislative}} changes within the EU {{there is an}} increased demand for improvements in car tyre <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>and</b> noise generation. Apart from measurement data, however, information {{about the relationship between}} <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> noise generation is scarce. It is the goal of this study to investigate the fundamental physical processes connecting both areas. Additionally, it is evaluated whether a simultaneous reduction of both <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> noise is possible or if this is contradicting requirement. A previously presented model for simulating the structural dynamics <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> resistance of a rolling car tyre is extended to allow rolling noise calculation. The approach is based on a waveguide finite element model of the tyre. Tyre/road contact forces are obtained using a non-linear 3 D contact model. The velocity field on the tyre surface is used to determine the radiated sound pressure based on a boundary element method. In a parameter study it is evaluated how much dissipation and sound radiation are affected by material properties, tyre construction and road surfaces. Due to the characteristics of the modelling approach, detailed information about dissipation and sound generation in different frequency regions, wave orders or parts of the tyre is available. The results show that <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>and</b> radiation are mainly low wave order, low frequency phenomena which are, at least partly, controlled by the same set of modes. This suggests that by modifying specific tyre properties reductions in both sound radiation <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> resistance can be achieved...|$|R
