Collins scored another century in the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval, batting 258 minutes for 162, helping Australia to a 119 run victory.

Besides, {{the loss of}} his {{hereditary}} offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The Staatsbewind refused to pay this, or any sum, point blank, and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).|$|E

The video {{features}} Beyoncé and her two backup female dancers all dressed in silver leotards and performing similar choreography, which has reminiscence of that of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Later, Beyoncé sits on a white glittery chair in front of the same tiled background; she is wearing black coat and the two dancers are still dancing in unison around her. There are a few shots of her on the chair facing the back of the camera with the dancers doing the same. Beyoncé then gets up to join the dance being executed by the two female around the chair. This scene ends as they walk {{to the left of the}} camera, into the next scene. Beyoncé is still with the tiled background. She and her dancers are now holding poles as props with which they dance. During the same pole scene, some shots of her singing in the chair are intercut. In the next scene, with the same tiled background, Beyoncé is leaning against the wall as the bridge of the song has been reached. Her dancers spin in heels around her, and they all then continue to dance against the wall. The last scene shows Beyoncé in the chair, without the black jacket and still dancing until the song ends.|$|E

2500|$|Like most commentators, Clausen ignores {{what the}} [...] "war warnings" [...] (and their context) {{explicitly}} warn, though indistinctly, against. Washington, with more complete intelligence than any field command, expected an attack anywhere {{on a list}} of possible locations (Pearl Harbor not among them), and since the Japanese were already committed to Thailand, it seems to have been expected another major operation by them was impossible. Clausen, like most, also ignores what actions Kimmel, Short, and Admiral Claude C. Bloch (Commander, Fourteenth Naval District, responsible for naval facilities in Hawaii) actually took. They took precautions against sabotage, widely expected as a precursor to war, and reported their preparations. The Hawaii commanders did not anticipate an air attack; no one did so explicitly. Indeed, the prevailing view at the time was Japan could not execute two major naval operations at once, so with the Thailand invasion convoy known to be at sea, the Hawaii commanders had good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> safe.|$|E

These claims were soon completed by sarcastic notes on the inflation of novels and novelists in Western countries, and their relative scarcity in Romania. Vinea argued that Romanian literature could develop without the novel: [...] "its absence isn't necessarily a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> melancholy." [...] He envisaged a literature of the lampoon, the prose poem, the reportage, and the greguería. His columns on Dada moved from half-hearted support, visibly annoyed by Tzara's [...] "buffoonery", to chronicling of the movement's [...] "ephemeral" [...] nature and inevitable demise. Ignored by Tzara, Vinea began reciprocating: he claimed that Dada was not Tzara's making, but had deeper Romanian roots in the avant-garde stories of a (still obscure) suicidal clerk, Urmuz, and {{in the work of}} sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. He depicted the primitivist streak of high modernism as a more authentic current than traditionalism, in particular Transylvanian traditionalism, and saw Muntenia as the cradle of authentic urban culture. This led to publicized polemics with Alexandru Hodoș, the nationalist columnist at Țara Noastră, but also with Benjamin Fondane, the more cautious Moldavian modernist.|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} will analyze {{the nature of}} {{cross-border}} conflicts and deterrence measures in the Horn of Africa {{with a focus on}} the pastoral communities of Pokot, Turkana, and the Karamojong. These communities in northwestern Kenya and eastern Uganda are under intolerable stress and they are involved in a violent struggle to survive. While insecurity in this area is often characterized as arising from competition over scarce resources, there are broader dimensions to local conflicts. These revolve around a long history of social, cultural, economic and political exclusion. The states' role in the provision of security and support to pastoral communities is, on the whole, poor. Both countries have a tendency to sometimes use excessive military force. Pastoral communities have <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> alienated. Lack of political will and corruption likewise frustrates efforts to keep the peace. This study seeks to examine the interplay among raids and counter-raids, internal security, the rule of law, and democratic governance.

Amanullah Khan gave the group <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> confident, even as rumours of these meetings reached the Emir.

Habibullah found these reports concerning, and discouraged expedition members from meeting with his sons except in his presence. All of Afghanistan's immediate preceding rulers save Habibullah's father had died of unnatural causes. The fact that his immediate relatives were pro-German, while he was allied with Britain, gave him justifiable grounds to fear for his safety and his kingdom. Von Hentig described one audience with Habibullah where von Hentig set off his pocket alarm clock. The action, designed to impress Habibullah, instead frightened him; he may have believed it was a bomb about to go off.

These findings have marketing implications in the context of planning ad hoc advertising strategies aimed at luxury selling to older consumers...|$|R
