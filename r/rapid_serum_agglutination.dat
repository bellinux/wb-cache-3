40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum is {{the most}} {{economically}} significant mycoplasma pathogen affecting poultry and has a worldwide distribution. M. gallisepticum infection is commonly designated as chronic respiratory disease (CRD) in chickens and infectious sinusitis in turkeys.

Routine detection of Mycoplasma spp. infection depends on isolation of the organism, with subsequent identification of the isolates or detection of specific antibodies in sera (4). Although some basic biochemical tests {{can be helpful in}} preliminary classification of Mycoplasma spp. isolates, definitive identification must be performed by serological tests. Several serological tests have been used to detect M. gallisepticum antibodies, but their specificity and sensitivity have been lacking to some degree in all of them (4).

40|$|Mycoplasma meleagridis (MM) is a {{major cause}} of disease and {{economic}} loss in turkeys. Formerly it was thought that this species was very host specific and only restricted to turkey. In this study, we report on the recovery of MM from breeding flocks of chickens located near a turkey breeding unit. Ten MM field strains were isolated (by culture on Frey broth medium) from tracheal swabs of chickens displaying clinical signs of mycoplasmosis-essentially respiratory symptoms and poor performance. Assignment of the isolated field strains to MM was confirmed by a growth inhibition assay using MM-specific polyclonal antiserum and by PCR amplification targeting the 16 S rRNA sequence as well as the Mm 14 sequence, a MM-species-specific DNA fragment previously identified and characterized in our laboratory. The nucleotide sequence of Mm 14 proved to be highly conserved among the 10 MM field strains, indicating a common source of infection. However, on the basis of slight differences in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis whole-cell proteins and western blot profiles, two groups of the isolated MM field strains could be distinguished. Evidence of MM infection of chickens was further provided by serology, since 13. 77 % (35 / 254) of sera proved positive to MM by either <b>rapid</b> <b>serum</b> <b>agglutination</b> or recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, sera of all chickens from which MM was isolated were positive for antibodies to MM. Collectively, the data unambiguously show that MM could infect chickens; thus, MM warrants further exploration to determine its pathogenicity in this unusual host...|$|E

A total of 364 sera samples were collected from chickens belonging to six MBPFs. All sera samples were examined by <b>rapid</b> <b>serum</b> plate <b>agglutination</b> (SPA) test using commercial Salmonella (SP) and MG antigens to determine the presence of Salmonella and MG specific antibodies in different age and sex of birds belonging to MBPFs. In addition to that prevalence of Salmonella and Mycoplasma infection in MBPFs during rainy and winter seasons were also recorded. The results of serological tests were analyzed statistically. The overall prevalence of Salmonella and Mycoplasma infection in six MBPFs were recorded as 23. 46 % and 46. 88 % respectively. Prevalence of salmonella was recorded highest in rainy season (25. 00 %) than the winter season (21. 88). On the contrary, Mycoplasma infection was recorded highest in winter season (61. 45 %) than the rainy season (51. 74 %). Both Salmonella and Mycoplasma infections were recorded highest in female birds (24. 10 %) than the male birds (15. 62 %). The prevalence of MG infection decreased {{with the increase of}} age. MG infection recorded highest 71. 42 % at 18 weeks of age and lowest 50 % at 22 weeks of age. On the other hand, the prevalence Salmonella infection was increased with the increase age. Salmonella infection was found highest 30. 76 % at 39 weeks of age and lowest 13. 33 % at 32 weeks of age.

40|$|Avian {{salmonellosis}} is {{a disease}} caused by bacteria of the genus Salmonella that can cause three distinct diseases in birds: pullorum diseases, fowl typhoid, and paratyphoid infection. Various wildlife species are susceptible to infections by Salmonella, {{regardless of whether they}} live in captivity or freely in the wild. The present study verified the presence of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in three captive specimens of Amazona aestiva. The study involved a total of 103 birds undergoing rehabilitation to prepare for living in the wild, after having been captured from animal traffickers and delivered to the Centrofauna Project of the Floravida Institute in São Paulo, Brazil. This is the first report of Salmonella Enteritidis isolation in A. aestiva that originated from capture associated with animal trafficking; Salmonella was detected during the study by the serologic method of <b>rapid</b> <b>serum</b> <b>agglutination</b> on a plate with bacterial isolate. The antimicrobial profile exam of the isolated samples demonstrated sensitivity to ampicillin, cefaclor, ciprofloxacin, and cloranfenicol. The three samples also presented resistance to more than four antibiotics. The presence of the genes invA and spvC was verified by PCR technique and was associated with virulence and absence of class 1 integron, a gene related to antimicrobial resistance. The commercial antigen for pullorum disease was shown to be a useful tool for rapid detection in the screening of Salmonella of serogroup D(1) in Psittaciformes. New studies on Salmonella carriage in birds involved in trafficking must be performed to better understand their participation in the epidemiologic cycle of salmonellosis in humans and other animals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{previously}} identified species-specific DNA fragments, {{referred to as}} MS 2 / 28 and Mm 14, of Mycoplasma synoviae and Mycoplasma meleagridis, respectively. In the present study, we extended our analysis of the MS 2 / 28 fragment that was found to encode a species-specific antigenic site, and we demonstrated the specificity of the Mycoplasma gallisepticum hemagglutinin protein encoded by pMGA 1. 2 (a member of the vlhA gene family). Then, we combined the Escherichia coli-expressed products of MS 2 / 28, Mm 14, and pMGA 1. 2, to develop a recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (recELISA), for the simultaneous and specific detection of antibodies to the three aforementioned major avian mycoplasma species. For comparative purposes, a novel in-house crude antigen capture ELISA (capELISA) was developed in parallel. In the latter protocol, the microtiter wells were enriched in species-specific antigens by capturing sonicated crude antigens on coated rabbit polyclonal antibodies that had been extensively adsorbed with the whole antigen of the heterologous species. With regard to <b>rapid</b> <b>serum</b> <b>agglutination,</b> both ELISA tests were highly specific, and they showed a significant correlation when field sera from naturally infected birds were tested. recELISA proved to be highly specific because absorbance values, with the heterologous species, were significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than those obtained with capELISA. Given its cost-effectiveness and simplicity, the recombinant antigen-based ELISA seems to represent a valid tool for the specific screening {{of the three major}} avian mycoplasma species. recELISA will be particularly useful with regard to trade control because a large number of samples from various fields could be rapidly processed...|$|E
40|$|Safety and {{protective}} {{efficacy of the}} attenuated strain Salmonella gallinarum SGP 695 AV in chickens. Fowl typhoid, caused by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. Gallinarum, causes heavy economic loss to the industrial poultry farms due to its strong impact in terms of mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, its management is quite difficult, as the infectious agent may remain in the poultry farms even during sanitary breaks. Therefore, many Countries have implemented strict preventive measures, leading the disease to be eradicated in many Western Countries. Notwithstanding, fowl typhoid is still widely diffused in the Mediterranean Countries, and in Africa, Asia and South America as well. Among the preventive measures needed to control the disease, the vaccination plays a pivotal role. To date, the only available vaccine consists of a rough strain of S. Gallinarum. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} protective efficacy and safety of a live attenuated strain, termed SGP 695 AV. At T 0 and 15 days after (T 15), 2 x 107, 2 x 109 and 2 x 1011 UFC of SGP 695 AV were administered per os to three group of 12 30 -day old laying hens, termed A, B and C, respectively. On the other hand, a verified pathogenic S. Gallinarum strain, SG 354 were administered per os to another group, termed P, at T 0. An equal volume of physiological solution was administered to the group N at T 0 and T 15. Thirty-seven days after the first administration (T 37), 5 randomly chosen chickens from the groups A, B, C and P were humanly sacrificed to evaluate the presence of SGP 695 AV in livers, spleens and guts. Contemporary, the other animals of groups A, B, C and N were inoculated per os with 1 x 1013 UFC of SG 354. Everyday, each animal was observed to assess its clinical score {{on the basis of its}} symptomatology. Serological test by <b>rapid</b> <b>serum</b> <b>agglutination</b> was performed at T 0, T 15, T 37 and 15 days after administration of SG 354 (T 52). Daily, cloacal swabs were collected to evaluate the fecal excretion of SGP 695 AV and/or SG 354. The data we gathered showed that vaccine did not cause significant adverse effects in chicken. Before T 37, Clinical scores was low in A, B and C groups, even when higher doses of the vaccinal strain were administered. Contrarily, the clinical score of the group P between T 15 and T 37 was up to 200 times higher than those of the groups A, B and C. After infection with SG 354, the clinical scores remained low in the three vaccinated groups. The excretion of SGP 695 AV was low and limited to the first 15 days. The fecal elimination of SG 354 after T 37 was equally low in the groups A, B and C, while was significantly more consistent in the group N...|$|E
