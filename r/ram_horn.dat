50|$|A giant, Viking-like racer who, {{despite his}} intimidating {{appearance}}, {{is a very}} friendly, good natured person. His first appearance was in Hostilities Break Out when Molly nearly gets run over by his star-racer {{on her way to}} get fuel. He saves Molly from drowning after she becomes trapped inside flooding ruins. When asked why he was following them, he tells Molly and Jordan that he came to congratulate them on beating him in the race earlier that day. Apparently, on his planet the people are known for being optimistic and looking on the bright side of things. He then says his <b>ram</b> <b>horn</b> was half-full. Rush abandoned the race to duel Toros after it was revealed to him that he was the Crog who led the invasion of his home world Byrus. He lost both the duel and the race when Toros drove his ship into a bridge over the race course, burying him in a pile of rubble and knocking him out of the playoffs. Rush had wanted to use the Ultimate Prize to undo the damage that the Crogs had done to his home world. Rush's star-racer is made of a unique metal from his homeworld that is nigh-unbreakable. However, it is also faster than it looks, thanks to its powerful magma-fueled engines. Rush sits atop his racer, controlling it and its two extendable arms with a pair of circular control yokes.|$|E

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the production of}} prodigiosin from <b>ram</b> <b>horn</b> peptone (RHP) using MO- 1, a local isolate in submerged culture. First, a novel gram-negative and rod-shaped bacterial strain, MO- 1, was isolated {{from the body of}} the grasshopper (Poecilemon tauricola Ramme 1951), which was collected from pesticide-contaminated fields. Sequence analysis of 16 S rDNA classified the microbe as Serratia marcescens. The substrate utilization potential (BIOLOG) and fatty acid methyl ester profile (FAME) of S. marcescens were also determined. The effect of RHP on the production of prodigiosin by S. marcescens MO- 1 was investigated, and the results showed that RHP supplementation promoted the growth of MO- 1 and increased the production of prodigiosin. A concentration of 0. 4 % (w/v) RHP resulted in the greatest yield of prodigiosin (277. 74 mg/L) after 48 h when mannitol was used as the sole source of carbon. The pigment yield was also influenced by the types of carbon sources and peptones. As a result, RHP was demonstrated to be a suitable substrate for prodigiosin production. These results revealed that prodigiosin could be produced efficiently by S. marcescens using RHP...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how {{wildlife}} populations {{respond to}} selection pressures imposed by environmental and anthropogenic conditions {{is important in}} wildlife management. Sport harvest, habitat alteration, climate change and population density are all selective pressures that may affect individual fitness, population dynamics and ultimately population viability. Our knowledge of how management practices and the multitude of ecological conditions are affecting the evolution of wildlife populations is extremely limited. I analyzed a 25 -year data set on horn growth and age of bighorn sheep rams in two populations in the southern interior of British Columbia. I examined how harvest regulations, weather, and habitat degradation affected horn length of harvested bighorn rams. I found that age-specific horn growth can predict {{the age at which}} rams are harvested: rams with rapidly growing horns are harvested at younger ages than rams with slow-growing horns. Management regimes that result in an average harvest age much below the reproductive peak of males, {{are based on a minimum}} horn or antler size and remove mature reproductive males disproportionately to subordinate males are likely to have a selective effect. I found that over 25 years of records, the age-adjusted horn length of bighorn sheep rams in the South Okanagan declined by 10 %. That decline could be attributed to intense selective hunting, as well as severe habitat deterioration that became worse over time. In addition, <b>ram</b> <b>horn</b> growth was slowed in years with hot summer temperatures, suggesting that weather in summer may be important in horn growth. We know little about how wildlife populations are reacting and changing to novel selection pressures, such as introduced species, human-induced habitat and climate change. In general, wildlife management regimes aim to maintain large, healthy populations and attempts to harvest wildlife at a sustainable level. Management actions, however do not necessarily meet the intended goals. Knowledge of biological systems allows us to ask and answer important questions about the directions of adaptations in natural populations. My research examines possible selective pressures on a wildlife population over a short time period, considering management strategies, habitat change and climate and suggests that human actions may have resulted in evolutionary change. While wildlife management has contributed well to population dynamics and habitat relationships, it cannot ignore the possible evolutionary consequences of human behavior and management strategies that can result in rapidly occurring genetic change. In order to develop sustainable harvests, potential evolutionary consequences must be considered...|$|E
