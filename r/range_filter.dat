40|$|The {{objective}} of this preliminary experiment was to investigate two head-up surveillance symbology (HUSS) display issues. The first issue was concerned with the benefits of adding a <b>range</b> <b>filter</b> to the current HUSS concept. A <b>range</b> <b>filter</b> limits the amount of traffic symbols displayed head-up by setting a range boundary (e. g., 7 -nmi) around the ownship. The second issue was concerned {{with the need to}} incorporate HUSS in the inboard field-of-view (IFOV) display of the eXternal Visibility System (XVS) concept. The hypothesis tested was that adding a <b>range</b> <b>filter</b> to the XVS display and HUSS to the IFOV display would enhance the pilot's effectiveness in traffic surveillance tasks. Using a high-resolution graphics flight simulator, each of three pilots flew departure and arrival scenarios under visual meteorological conditions. The pilots' main tasks, while managing flight path, were to detect and assess potential airborne traffic hazards and to maintain overall situation awareness. Upon completing all the runs, each pilot completed a subjective questionnaire. Results showed that having both the HUSS on the IFOV and the <b>range</b> <b>filter</b> on each of the XVS displays enhanced the effectiveness of the XVS surveillance display concept.

In this paper, we propose a simple method to obtain satisfied restoration results for sinogram of LDCT. That is, the <b>range</b> <b>filter</b> weighs the similarity by Gaussian smoothed sinogram. Since smoothed sinogram can reduce the influence of both noises and nonstationary artifacts for similarity measurement greatly, our new method can provide more satisfied denoising results for sinogram restoration of LDCT.

40|$|Abstract—A Wide Tuning Range Gm-C Continuous-Time Analog Filter is a CMOS {{operation}} nal transconductance amplifier for low-power {{and wide}} tuning <b>range</b> <b>filter</b> application is proposed. The transconductor can {{work from the}} weak inversion region to the strong inversion region to maximize the transconductance tuning range. The trasconductance can be tuned by changing its bias current. A fifth-order Elliptic low-pass filter implemented with the transconductors is proposed to be implemented in SPICE using CMOS. The filter can operate with the cutoff frequency of 250 Hz to 1 MHz. The wide tuning <b>range</b> <b>filter</b> would be suitable for multi-mode applications, especially under the consideration of saving chip areas. The third-order inter-modulation of- 40 dB was measured over the tuning range with two tone input signals. The power consumption is 0. 8 mW at 1 MHz cutoff frequency and 1. 8 -V supply. Cost and power consumption are two most important factors for these products. For the power consumption, digital circuits can benefit from the supply voltage reduction, but analog circuits can not necessarily decrease the power consumption with the decrease of supply voltage. To meet different specifications for low power consumption, new basic analog building blocks should be re-designed. Many of the previously published papers made efforts on improving the speed, linearity, or dynamic range of transconductor circuits.
