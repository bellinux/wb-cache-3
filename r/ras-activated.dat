DNA methylation alteration unlikely occurred. <b>Ras-activated</b> cells senesced with nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated SMAD 1 / 5 / 8. Senescence was bypassed in <b>Ras-activated</b> cells when Bmp 2 /Smad 1 signal was blocked by Bmp 2 knockdown, Smad 6 induction, or Noggin induction.

Immunodepletion of B-Raf abolished the effect of the activator on Raf- 1. Furthermore, B-Raf and <b>Ras-activated</b> Raf- 1 co-operatively, when co-transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. On the other hand, Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase stimulator (a complex of B-Raf and 14 - 3 - 3) failed to activate Raf- 1 in our cell-free system.

We show here that the actin cytoskeleton-linked GTPase Rac- 1 binds to DMPK, and coexpression of Rac- 1 and DMPK activates its transphosphorylation activity in a GTP-sensitive manner. DMPK can also bind Raf- 1 kinase, the <b>Ras-activated</b> molecule of the MAP kinase pathway. Purified Raf- 1 kinase phosphorylates and activates DMPK.

However, whether both domains are active and which domain is responsible for its various identified phosphotransferase activities have not been determined. Here we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain is responsible for its phosphotransferase activity towards a variety of substrates which contain an RXXS motif at the site of in vitro phosphorylation, including serum response factor, c-Fos, Nur 77, and the 40 S ribosomal protein S 6. We also provide evidence that the C-terminal domain is catalytically active and can be further activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesis is {{fundamental}} to physiological and pathological processes. Despite intensive efforts, {{little is known about}} the intracellular circuits that regulate angiogenesis. The transcription factor Net is activated by phosphorylation induced by Ras, an indirect regulator of angiogenesis. Net is expressed at sites of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during early mouse development, suggesting that it could have a role in blood vessel formation. We show here that down-regulation of Net inhibits angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. <b>Ras-activated</b> phosphorylated Net (P-Net) stimulates the mouse VEGF promoter through the - 80 to - 53 region that principally binds Sp 1.

40|$|SummaryGuidance receptors detect {{extracellular}} cues and instruct migrating cells how {{to orient}} in space. Border cells perform a directional invasive migration during Drosophila oogenesis and use two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), EGFR and PVR (PDGF/VEGF Receptor), to read guidance cues. We find that spatial localization of RTK signaling within these migrating cells is actively controlled. Border cells lacking Cbl, an RTK-associated E 3 ubiquitin ligase, have delocalized guidance signaling, resulting in severe migration defects. Absence of Sprint, a receptor-recruited, <b>Ras-activated</b> Rab 5 guanine exchange factor, gives related defects. In contrast, increasing {{the level of}} RTK signaling by receptor overexpression or removing Hrs and thereby decreasing RTK degradation does not perturb migration. Cbl and Sprint both regulate early steps of RTK endocytosis. Thus, a physiological role of RTK endocytosis is to ensure localized intracellular response to guidance cues by stimulating spatial restriction of signaling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRIN 1 was {{originally}} identified by {{its ability to}} inhibit activated Ras and likely participates in multiple signaling pathways because it binds c-ABL and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins, in addition to Ras. RIN 1 also contains a region homologous to the catalytic domain of Vps 9 p-like Rab guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Here, we show that this region is necessary and sufficient for RIN 1 interaction with the GDP-bound Rabs, Vps 21 p, and Rab 5 A. RIN 1 is also shown to stimulate Rab 5 guanine nucleotide exchange, Rab 5 A-dependent endosome fusion, and EGF receptor-mediated endocytosis. The stimulatory effect of RIN 1 on {{all three of these}} processes is potentiated by activated Ras.

40|$|Raf is a mitogen-stimulated {{protein kinase}} that {{functions}} {{as a component of}} the signaling cascade that leads to the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Here we show that the native structure of Raf is a large multi-subunit protein complex with an apparent mass of 300 - 500 kDa that interacts with Ras and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase Mek. Analysis {{of the structure of the}} Raf complex demonstrates that it contains a single Raf protein kinase together with the molecular chaperones hsp 90 and p 50. The Raf-hsp 90 -p 50 complex was observed in starved cells and in cells activated with serum or phorbol ester. Thus, changes in complex formation with hsp 90 and p 50 are not required for activation of the Raf protein kinase. However, Raf activation caused by Ras was associated with the translocation of the cytoplasmic Raf-hsp 90 -p 50 complex to the cell membrane. Significantly, it is only the membrane-bound complex that exhibits increased protein kinase activity. Thus, the <b>Ras-activated</b> Raf protein kinase {{functions as a}} membrane-bound multi-subunit complex...|$|E
40|$|Attachment of Ras protein to the membrane, which {{requires}} farnesylation at its C terminus, {{is essential for}} its biological activity. A promising pharmacological approach of antagonizing oncogenic Ras activity is to develop inhibitors of farnesyltransferase. We use Caenorhabditis elegans vulval differentiation, which is controlled by a Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway, as a model system to test previously identified farnesyltransferase inhibitors. We show here that two farnesyltransferase inhibitors, manumycin and gliotoxin, suppress the Multivulva phenotype resulting from an activated let- 60 ras mutation, but not the Multivulva phenotype resulting from mutations in the lin- 1 gene or the lin- 15 gene, which act downstream and upstream of let- 60 ras, respectively, in the signaling pathway. These {{results are consistent with}} the idea that the suppression of the Multivulva phenotype of let- 60 ras by the two inhibitors is specific for Ras protein and that the mutant Ras protein might be more sensitive than wild-type Ras to the farnesyltransferase inhibitors.

40|$|Protein kinase C zeta (zeta PKC) is {{critically}} {{involved in the}} control {{of a number of}} cell functions, including proliferation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation. Previous studies indicate that zeta PKC is an important step downstream of Ras in the mitogenic cascade. The stimulation of Ras initiates a kinase cascade that culminates in the activation of MAP kinase (MAPK), which is required for cell growth. MAPK is activated by phosphorylation by another kinase named MAPK kinase (MEK), which is the substrate of a number of <b>Ras-activated</b> serine/threonine kinases such as c-Raf- 1 and B-Raf. We show here that MAPK and MEK are activated in vivo by an active mutant of zeta PKC, and that a kinase-defective dominant negative mutant of zeta PKC dramatically impairs the activation of both MEK and MAPK by serum and tumour necrosis factor (TNF alpha). The stimulation of other kinases, such as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) or p 70 S 6 K, is shown here to be independent of zeta PKC. The importance of MEK/MAPK in the signalling mechanisms activated by zeta PKC was addressed by using the activation of a kappa B-dependent promoter as a biological read-out of zeta PKC...|$|E
40|$|Integration {{of protein}} kinases into {{transcription}} activation complexes influences {{the magnitude of}} gene expression. The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) group of proteins are critical transcription factors that direct gene expression in immune and nonimmune cells. A balance of phosphotransferase activity is necessary for optimal NFAT activation. Activation of NFAT requires dephosphorylation by the calcium-mediated calcineurin phosphatase to promote NFAT nuclear accumulation, and the <b>Ras-activated</b> extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, which targets NFAT partners, to potentiate transcription. Whether protein kinases operate on NFAT and contribute positively to transcription activation is not clear. Here, we coupled DNA affinity isolation with in-gel kinase assays to avidly pull down the activated NFAT and identify its associated protein kinases. We demonstrate that p 90 ribosomal S 6 kinase (RSK) is recruited to the NFAT-DNA transcription complex upon activation. The formation of RSK-NFATc 4 -DNA transcription complex is also apparent upon adipogenesis. Bound RSK phosphorylates Ser 676 and potentiates NFATc 4 DNA binding by escalating NFAT-DNA association. Ser 676 is also targeted by the ERK MAP kinase, which interacts with NFAT at a distinct region than RSK. Thus, integration of the ERK/RSK signaling pathway provides a mechanism to modulate NFATc 4 transcription activity...|$|E

The purpose of this phase I/II study was to assess RT 3 D combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with advanced cancers. Experimental Design: Patients were initially treated in a dose-escalating, phase I trial with intravenous RT 3 D days 1 to 5, carboplatin [area under curve (AUC) 5, day 1] and paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2, day 1) 3 -weekly. RT 3 D was escalated through three dose levels: 3 × 109, 1 × 1010, and 3 × 1010 TCID 50 in cohorts of three. Primary endpoints were to define the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity and to recommend a dose for phase II studies. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, immune response, and antitumor activity. A subsequent phase II study using the 3 × 1010 TCID 50 dose characterized the response rate in patients with head and neck cancer.

40|$|Extracellular {{superoxide}} dismutase (SOD 3) is a secreted enzyme that uses superoxide anion {{as a substrate}} in a dismutase reaction that results {{in the formation of}} hydrogen peroxide. Both of these reactive oxygen species affect growth signaling in cells. Although SOD 3 has growth-supporting characteristics, the expression of SOD 3 is downregulated in epithelial cancer cells. In the current work, we studied the mechanisms regulating SOD 3 expression in vitro using thyroid cell models representing different stages of thyroid cancer. We demonstrate that a low level of RAS activation increases SOD 3 mRNA synthesis that then gradually decreases with increasing levels of RAS activation and the decreasing degree of differentiation of the cancer cells. Our data indicate that SOD 3 regulation can be divided into two classes. The first class involves RAS-driven reversible regulation of SOD 3 expression that can be mediated by the following mechanisms: RAS GTPase regulatory genes that are responsible for SOD 3 self-regulation; RAS-stimulated p 38 MAPK activation; and <b>RAS-activated</b> increased expression of the mir 21 microRNA, which inversely correlates with sod 3 mRNA expression. The second class involves permanent silencing of SOD 3 mediated by epigenetic DNA methylation in cells that represent more advanced cancers. Therefore, the work suggests that SOD 3 belongs to the group of ras oncogene-silenced genes...|$|E
40|$|Rin 1 is a Rab 5 guanine {{nucleotide}} exchange factor that {{plays an important}} role in <b>Ras-activated</b> endocytosis and growth factor receptor trafficking in fibroblasts. In this study, we show that Rin 1 is expressed at high levels in a large number of non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, including Hop 62, H 650, HCC 4006, HCC 827, EKVX, HCC 2935, and A 549. Rin 1 depletion from A 549 cells resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation that was correlated to a decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Expression of wild type Rin 1 but not the Rab 5 {{guanine nucleotide}} exchange factor-deficient Rin 1 (Rin 1 Δ) complemented the Rin 1 depletion effects, and overexpression of Rin 1 Δ had a dominant negative effect on cell proliferation. Rin 1 depletion stabilized the cell surface levels of EGFR, suggesting that internalization was necessary for robust signaling in A 549 cells. In support of this conclusion, introduction of either dominant negative Rab 5 or dominant negative dynamin decreased A 549 proliferation and EGFR signaling. These data demonstrate that proper internalization and endocytic trafficking are critical for EGFR-mediated signaling in A 549 cells and suggest that up-regulation of Rin 1 in A 549 cell lines may contribute to their proliferative nature...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies have demonstrated that}} the level of the central transcription factor TATA-binding protein (TBP) is increased in cells expressing the hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein through the activation of the Ras signaling pathway, which serves to enhance both RNA polymerase I and III promoter activities. To understand the mechanism by which TBP is regulated, we have investigated whether enhanced expression is modulated at the transcriptional level. Nuclear run-on assays revealed that the HBV X protein increases the number of active transcription complexes on the TBP gene. In transient-transfection assays with both transformed and primary hepatocytes, the human TBP promoter was shown to be induced by expression of the HBV X protein in a Ras-dependent manner, requiring both Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (Ral-GDS) and Raf signaling. Transient overexpression of TBP did not affect TBP promoter activity. To further delineate the downstream Ras-mediated events contributing to TBP promoter regulation in primary rat hepatocytes, the best-characterized Ras effectors, Raf, phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI- 3 kinase), and RalGDS, were examined. Activation of either Raf or RalGDS, but not that of PI- 3 kinase, was sufficient to induce TBP promoter activity. Both Raf- and RalGDS-mediated induction required the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). In addition, another distinct <b>Ras-activated</b> pathway, which does not require MEK activation, appears to induce TBP promoter activity.

40|$|Gas 6 is {{a growth}} factor related to protein S that was {{identified}} as the ligand for the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. In this study, we show that Gas 6 induces a growth response in a cultured mammalian mammary cell line, C 57 MG. The presence of Gas 6 in the medium induces growth after confluence and similarly causes cell cycle reentry of density-inhibited C 57 MG cells. We show that Axl RTK but not Rse is efficiently activated by Gas 6 in density-inhibited C 57 MG cells. We have analyzed the signaling required for the Gas 6 proliferative effect and found a requirement for PI 3 K-, S 6 K-, and <b>Ras-activated</b> pathways. We also demonstrate that Gas 6 activates Akt and concomitantly inhibits GSK 3 activity in a wortmannin-dependent manner. Interestingly, Gas 6 induces up-regulation of cytosolic β-catenin, while membrane-associated β-catenin remains unaffected. Stabilization of β-catenin in C 57 MG cells is correlated with activation of a T-cell factor (TCF) -responsive transcriptional element. We thus provide evidence that Gas 6 is mitogenic and induces β-catenin proto-oncogene stabilization and subsequent TCF/Lef transcriptional activation in a mammary system. These results suggest that Gas 6 -Axl interaction, through stabilization of β-catenin, may {{have a role in}} mammary development and/or be involved in the progression of mammary tumors...|$|E

We report that in T 24 H-ras-transformed NIH 3 T 3 cells enhanced transcription contributes to the increased expression of OPN. Transient transfection studies, DNA-protein binding assays, and methylation protection experiments have identified a novel <b>ras-activated</b> enhancer, distinct from known ras response elements, that appears responsible for part of the increase in OPN transcription in cells with an activated RAS. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the protein-binding motif GGAGGCAGG was found to be essential for the formation of several complexes, one of which (complex A) was generated at elevated levels by cell lines that are metastatic. Southwestern blotting and UV light cross-linking studies indicated the presence of several proteins able to interact with this sequence. The proteins that form these complexes have molecular masses estimated at approximately 16, 28, 32, 45, 80, and 100 kDa. Because the approximately 16 -kDa protein was responsible for complex A formation, we have designated it MATF for metastasis-associated transcription factor.

40|$|The RECK (reversion-inducing {{cysteine}} rich protein with Kazal motifs) protein {{was initially}} discovered by {{its ability to}} induce reversion in <b>ras-activated</b> fibroblasts. The key action of RECK is to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved in breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and angiogenesis-namely MMP- 2, MMP- 9 and MTP- 1. To this effect, it plays important physiological roles in embryogenesis and vasculogenesis. Additionally, it has {{a significant effect on}} tumorigenesis by limiting angiogenesis and invasion of tumours through the ECM. RECK has been studied {{in the context of a}} number of human tumours including colorectal, breast, pancreas, gastric, hepatocellular, prostate, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. In many of these tumours, RECK is down-regulated most likely as a result of inhibition at the Sp 1 promoter site. MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 generally show an inverse association with RECK expression, but there are exceptions to this rule. Likewise, a reduction in tumour microvascular density (MVD) and VEGF have also been correlated with increased RECK levels, although more studies are required to define this effect. The predominant finding across all human tumour studies is a significantly improved prognosis (due to decreased invasion and metastasis) in tumours with preserved RECK expression. Although further research is required, RECK is a promising prognostic marker and potential therapeutic agent in multiple cancers. ...|$|E

Proliferation of tubular epithelial cells underlies {{the development of}} cystic lesions and the subsequent impairment of renal function after renal mass reduction. The effect of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (HRI) on cell proliferation was investigated in rat renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in primary culture. Treatment of renal tubular epithelial cells with three different HRI reduced fetal calf serum (FCS) -induced [3 H]-thymidine incorporation (IC 50 values were 0. 7 µM, 1. 7 µM, and 1. 6 µM for simvastatin, lovastatin, and compactin, respectively), and lovastatin blocked BrdUrd incorporation, as assessed by immunocytochemical studies. The proliferative effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) was similarly abolished by lovastatin. The effect of lovastatin (1 µM) was prevented by 100 µM mevalonate, 5 µM farnesyl-pyrophosphate and 5 µM geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (in percent of control value, 31 % vs. 102 %, 60 %, and 82 %, respectively) while cholesterol and other products of the mevalonate pathway were inactive. Immunoblot analysis showed that lovastatin decreased membrane-bound p 21 ras and inhibited FCS-induced c-fos and c-jun protein expression. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the functional impairement of AP- 1 DNA binding activity in lovastatin-treated cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HRI are antiproliferative in epithelial tubule cells and that this effect is exerted, at least in part, via {{inhibition of}} the p 21 <b>ras-activated</b> and AP- 1 dependent mitogenic cascade...|$|E

A functional Ras-dependent Ets-binding site (EBS) was located downstream from the proximal VDRE and was critical to 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -mediated induction. Cotransfection of Ets- 1 and Ets- 2 stimulated induction, which was lost when the EBS was mutated. Multiple nuclear-protein complexes from COS- 1 cells bound to the EBS in which three complexes were immunologically related to Ets- 1. Transcriptional synergy was observed between the proximal VDRE and adjacent EBS as was the attendant formation of a ternary complex between vitamin D receptor- retinoid X receptor (VDR·RXR) and Ets- 1. In the absence of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 or {{in the presence of}} an inactive proximal VDRE, the EBS failed to respond to exogenous Ets- 1. However, Ets- 1 increased basal expression when cotransfected with a mutant VDR. The inductive action of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 was substantially increased by Ras, which was ablated by mutagenesis of the EBS or by expression of a mutated Ets- 1 protein (T 38 A). EBS contribution to hormone induction was prevented by manumycin A, an inhibitor of Ras farnesylation.

Activation of RAS signalling pathways through oncogenic RAS mutations is a hallmark of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of Harvey-Ras oncogene induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Caco- 2 cells. We focused {{on the role of}} epigenetic modifications of histone H 3 and its dependence on RAS signal transduction pathways and oncogenic transformation. Using cell lines stably overexpressing oncogenic Harvey-RAS with EMT phenotype, we studied the acquired changes in the H 3 histone modification patterns. Two genes show inverse protein expression patterns after Ha-RAS overexpression: Cyclin D 1, a cell cycle-related gene, and the EMT marker-gene E-cadherin. We report that these two genes demonstrate matching inverse histone repression patterns on their promoter, while histone markers associated with an active state of genes were affected by the <b>RAS-activated</b> signalling pathway MEK-ERK-MSK 1. Furthermore, we show that though the level of methyltransferases enzymes was increased, the status of H 3 three-methylation at lysine 27 (H 3 K 27 me(3)), associated with gene repression on the promoter of Cyclin D 1, was lower. Together, these results suggest that histone covalent modifications can be affected by oncogenic RAS pathways to regulate the expression of target genes like Cyclin D 1 or E-cadherin and that the dynamic balance of opposing histone-modifying enzymes is critical for the regulation of cell proliferation...|$|E

However, little information is available in relation to underlying mechanisms of host responses during the WSSV acute infection stage in naturally infected shrimp. In this study, we employed next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic techniques to observe the transcriptome differences of the shrimp between latent infection stage and acute infection stage. A total of 64, 188, 426 Illumina reads, including 31, 685, 758 reads from the latent infection group and 32, 502, 668 reads from the acute infection group, were generated and assembled into 46, 676 unigenes (mean length: 676 bp; range: 200 - 15, 094 bp). Approximately 24, 000 peptides were predicted and classified based on homology searches, gene ontology, clusters of orthologous groups of proteins, and biological pathway mapping. Among which, 805 differentially expressed genes were identified and categorized into 11 groups based on their possible function. Genes in the Toll and IMD pathways, the <b>Ras-activated</b> endocytosis process, the RNA interference pathway, anti-lipopolysaccharide factors and many other genes, {{were found to be}} activated in shrimp from latent infection stage to acute infection stage. The anti-bacterially proPO-activating cascade was firstly uncovered to be probably participated in antiviral process. These genes contain not only members playing function in host defense against WSSV, but also genes utilized by WSSV for its rapid proliferation. In addition, the transcriptome data provides detail information for identifying novel genes in absence of the genome database of shrimp...|$|E

Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD 3) is a secreted enzyme that uses superoxide anion as a substrate in a dismutase reaction that results {{in the formation of}} hydrogen peroxide. Both of these reactive oxygen species affect growth signaling in cells. Although SOD 3 has growth-supporting characteristics, the expression of SOD 3 is downregulated in epithelial cancer cells. In the current work, we studied the mechanisms regulating SOD 3 expression in vitro using thyroid cell models representing different stages of thyroid cancer. We demonstrate that a low level of RAS activation increases SOD 3 mRNA synthesis that then gradually decreases with increasing levels of RAS activation and the decreasing degree of differentiation of the cancer cells. Our data indicate that SOD 3 regulation can be divided into two classes. The first class involves RAS–driven reversible regulation of SOD 3 expression that can be mediated by the following mechanisms: RAS GTPase regulatory genes that are responsible for SOD 3 self-regulation; RAS-stimulated p 38 MAPK activation; and <b>RAS-activated</b> increased expression of themir 21 microRNA, which inversely correlates with sod 3 mRNA expression. The second class involves permanent silencing of SOD 3 mediated by epigenetic DNA methylation in cells that represent more advanced cancers. Therefore, the work suggests that SOD 3 belongs to the group of ras oncogene-silenced genes. 1...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet B {{irradiation}} {{is thought}} to enable skin cancer progression as clones of genetically damaged keratinocytes escape apoptosis and expand {{at the expense of}} adjacent normal cells. Mechanisms through which potentially malignant cells in human skin undergo clonal expansion, however, are not well understood. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the role of ultraviolet B irradiation on the intraepithelial expansion of early stage human tumor cells in organotypic skin cultures. To accomplish this, we have studied the effect of ultraviolet B irradiation on organotypic cultures that were fabricated by mixing normal human keratinocytes with β-galactosidase-marked, intraepithelial tumor cells (HaCaT-ras, clone II- 4), which bear mutations in both p 53 alleles and harbor an activated H-ras oncogene. We found that when organotypic mixtures were exposed to an ultraviolet B dose of 50 mJ per cm 2, intraepithelial tumor cells underwent a significant degree of proliferative expansion compared to nonirradiated cultures. To understand this response, organotypic cultures of nor-mal keratinocytes were exposed to ultraviolet B and showed a dose-dependent increase in numbers of sunburn cells and TUNEL-positive cells although their proliferation was suppressed. In contrast, neither the apoptotic nor the proliferative response of II- 4 cells was altered by ultraviolet B in organotypic cultures. The differential response of these cell types suggested that II- 4 cells were resistant to ultraviolet-B-induced alterations, which allowed these intraepithelial tumor cells to gain a selective growth and survival advantage relative to neighboring normal cells. These findings demonstrate that ultraviolet B exposure can induce the intraepithelial expansion of apoptosis-resistant, p 53 -mutant, and <b>ras-activated</b> keratinocytes, suggesting that this agent can act to promote the early stages of epithelial carcinogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Several evidences {{suggest that}} cancer cells have {{abnormal}} cholesterol biosynthetic pathways and prenylation of small guanosine triphosphatase proteins. Tomato lycopene {{has been suggested}} to have beneficial effects against certain types of cancer, including that of prostate, although the exact molecular mechanism(s) is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that lycopene may exert its antitumor effects through changes in mevalonate pathway and in Ras activation. Incubation of the <b>Ras-activated</b> prostatic carcinoma LNCaP cells with a 24 h lycopene treatment (2. 5 - 10 microM) dose dependently reduced intracellular total cholesterol by decreasing 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase expression and by inactivating Ras, as evidenced by its translocation from cell membranes to cytosol. Concomitantly, lycopene reduced the Ras-dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB). Such a reduction was parallel to an inhibition of reactive oxygen species production and to {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation ofc-jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 and p 38. These effects were also accompanied by an arrest of cell cycle progression and by apoptosis induction, as evidenced by a decrease in cyclin D 1 and phospho-AKT levels and by an increase in p 21, p 27 and p 53 levels and in Bax:Bcl- 2 ratio. The addition of mevalonate prevented the growth-inhibitory effects of lycopene as well as its increase in Ras cytoplasmatic accumulation and the subsequent changes in NF-kB. The ability of lycopene in inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase expression and cell growth and in inactivating Ras was also found in prostate PC- 3, colon HCT- 116 and HT- 29 and lung BEN cancer cells. These findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the growth-inhibitory effects of lycopene in cance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, ERK 2, is {{a tightly}} {{regulated}} enzyme in the ubiquitous <b>Ras-activated</b> protein kinase cascade. ERK 2 is activated by phosphorylation at two sites, Y 185 and T 183, that {{lie in the}} phosphorylation lip {{at the mouth of}} the catalytic site. To ascertain the role of these two residues in securing the low-activity conformation of the enzymes we have carried out crystallographic analyses and assays of phosphorylation-site mutants of ERK 2. Results The crystal structures of four mutants, T 183 E (threonine at residue 183 is replaced by glutamate), Y 185 E, Y 185 F and the double mutant T 183 E/Y 185 E, were determined. When T 183 is replaced by glutamate, few conformational changes are observed. By contrast, when Y 185 is replaced by glutamate, 19 residues become disordered, including the entire phosphorylation lip and an adjacent loop. The conservative substitution of phenylalanine for Y 185 also induces relatively large conformational changes. A binding site for phosphotyrosine in the active enzyme is putatively identified on the basis of the high-resolution refinement of the structure of wild-type ERK 2. Conclusion The remarkable disorder observed throughout the phosphorylation lip when Y 185 is mutated shows that the stability of the phosphorylation lip is rather low. Therefore, only modest amounts of binding energy will be required to dislodge the lip for phosphorylation, and it is likely that these residues will be involved in conformational changes associated both with binding to kinases and phosphatases and with activation. Furthermore, the low-activity structure is specifically dependent on Y 185, whereas there is no such dependency on T 183. Both residues, however, participate in forming the active enzyme, contributing to its tight control...|$|E
