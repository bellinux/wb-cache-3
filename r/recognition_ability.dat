25|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} incorrect pitch (musical) is most often tested by using the Distorted Tunes Test (DTT). The DTT was originally developed in the 1940s and was used in large studies in the British population. The DTT measures musical pitch <b>recognition</b> <b>ability</b> on an ordinal scale, scored {{as the number of}} correctly classified tunes. More specifically the DTT is used to evaluate subjects on how well they judge whether simple popular melodies contain notes with incorrect pitch. Researchers have used this method to investigate genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Drayna, Manichaikul, Lange, Snieder and Spector (2001) determined that the variation in musical pitch recognition is primarily due to highly heritable differences in auditory functions not tested by conventional audiologic methods. Therefore, the DTT method may provide a benefit to advancing research studies similar to this one.|$|E

50|$|While it {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} that many cognitive abilities, such as general intelligence, have genetic bases, evidence for the genetic basis of facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> specifically is fairly recent. Some of the earliest published research {{on the relationship between}} facial recognition and genetics focused on the genetic bases of facial recognition in the context of genetic disorders which impair facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities,</b> such as Turner syndrome. In a study by Lawrence, K. et al. in 2003 the authors found significantly poorer facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> in individuals with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder which results in impaired amygdala functioning, suggesting that amygdala functioning may impact face perception. Evidence for the genetic basis of facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> in the general population, however, comes from studies on face perception in twin participants by Wilmer, J. B. et al. in 2009, in which the facial recognition scores on the Cambridge Face Memory test were twice as similar for monozygotic twins in comparison to dizygotic twins. This finding was supported by a twin study on the genetic bases of facial recognition by Zhu, Q. et al. in (2009) which found a similar difference in facial recognition scores when comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins and Shakeshaft, N. G. & Plomin, R. (2015), which determined the heritability of facial recognition to be approximately 61%, using a similar set of twin studies. There was also no significant relationship identified between facial recognition scores and measures of any other cognitive abilities, most notably the lack of a correlation with general object <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities.</b> This suggests that facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> are not only heritable, but that their genetic basis is independent from the bases of other cognitive abilities and are specialized for face perception. Research by Cattaneo, Z. et al. (2016) and suggest that the more extreme examples of facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities,</b> specifically hereditary prosopagnosics, are also highly genetically correlated. For hereditary prosopagnosics, an autosomal dominant model of inheritance has been proposed by Kennerknecht, I. et al. (2006). Research by Cattaneo, Z. et al. (2016) also correlated the probability of hereditary prosopagnosia with the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms along the Oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), specifically at nucleotides rs2254298 and rs53576 on OXTR intron three, suggesting that these alleles may serve a critical role in normal face perception. Mutation from the wild type allele at these loci has also been found to result in other disorders in which social and facial recognition deficits are common, such as autism spectrum disorder, which may imply that the genetic bases for general facial recognition are complex and polygenic. This relationship between the OXTR gene and facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> is also supported by studies of individuals who do not suffer from hereditary prosopagnosia by Melchers, M. et al. (2013) and Westberg, L. et al. (2016) which correlated general facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> with different polymorphisms of the OXTR gene, specifically rs7632287 and rs2268498. Further research is needed to confirm the specific mechanisms of these genetic components on face perception; however, current evidence does suggest that facial <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> are highly linked to genetic, rather than environmental, bases.|$|R

40|$|To date, {{only two}} studies have {{examined}} the accuracy of people’s perceptions of their romantic partners’ sexual satisfaction. These have yielded inconsistent results, with one study suggesting that men tend to overestimate their partners’ sexual satisfaction while women do not, and the other suggesting that women tend to overestimate their partners’ sexual satisfaction while men do not. Both studies have significant methodological limitations that make it difficult to interpret their findings. The first purpose of the current study was to investigate how similar people’s perceptions of their partners’ sexual satisfaction were to the levels of sexual satisfaction their partners reported, using an improved research methodology that addressed the limitations of past research. The second purpose of the current study was to better understand the factors that predict bias in perceptions of partner sexual satisfaction, using an integrative model that included both interpersonal and intrapersonal factors. Participants were 84 heterosexual couples who were married or cohabiting. They completed measures of sexual satisfaction (their own and their partners’), relationship satisfaction, quality of communication about sexual issues within their relationships, and also completed a task designed to assess emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities.</b> We found that partner perceptions of sexual satisfaction were strongly correlated with self-reported sexual satisfaction for both males and females. We also found that males’ perceptions of their female partners’ sexual satisfaction were significantly biased, such that they underestimated their partners’ levels of sexual satisfaction. Females neither over nor underestimated their partners’ sexual satisfaction. Additionally, we found that better quality of sexual communication predicted decreased bias, while there was a trend toward better emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> predicting decreased bias. Further, quality of sexual communication and emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> interacted such that when the quality of sexual communication was good, there was no association between emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> and bias, but when the quality of sexual communication was poor, better emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> were associated with less bias.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{describing}} a face entails thinking about its features independently, but people process faces configurally (as a whole, encoding the features {{in relation to}} one another). So, the process of describing the face often impairs the memory of it—this is the verbal overshadowing effect. A verbal overshadowing effect typically refers to the negative effect on memory recall {{as a result of}} giving a verbal description of a visual object. For example, a witness who gives a verbal description of a face is likely to have subsequent impaired recognition for that face. However, Perfect et al. (2002) predicted that the verbal overshadowing effect would also be seen in voice recognition; that is that verbally describing a voice should also impair subsequent recognition of that voice. They predicted this because they argued that voices were difficult to articulate and so it is likely they would be vulnerable to the verbal overshadowing effect. This was found to be the case. Moreover, a dissociation between accuracy and confidence was observed. Participants' confidence that they had identified the correct voice in the audio-lineup was not influenced by the verbal overshadowing effect; in other words, verbal overshadowing had the effect of decreasing earwitnesses' <b>recognition</b> <b>ability</b> but without their knowledge.|$|E

50|$|As {{opposed to}} meganucleases, the concept behind ZFNs and TALEN {{technology}} {{is based on}} a non-specific DNA cutting enzyme, which can then be linked to specific DNA sequence recognizing peptides such as zinc fingers and transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs). The key to this was to find an endonuclease whose DNA recognition site and cleaving site were separate from each other, a situation that is not common among restriction enzymes. Once this enzyme was found, its cleaving portion could be separated which would be very non-specific as it would have no <b>recognition</b> <b>ability.</b> This portion could then be linked to sequence recognizing peptides that could lead to very high specificity. A restriction enzyme with such properties is FokI. Additionally FokI has the advantage of requiring dimerization to have nuclease activity and this means the specificity increases dramatically as each nuclease partner would recognize a unique DNA sequence. To enhance this effect, FokI nucleases have been engineered that can only function as heterodimers and have increased catalytic activity. The heterodimer functioning nucleases would avoid the possibility of unwanted homodimer activity and thus increase specificity of the DSB. Although the nuclease portions of both ZFNs and TALEN constructs have similar properties, the difference between these engineered nucleases is in their DNA recognition peptide. ZFNs rely on Cys2-His2 zinc fingers and TALEN constructs on TALEs. Both of these DNA recognizing peptide domains have the characteristic that they are naturally found in combinations in their proteins. Cys2-His2 Zinc fingers typically happen in repeats that are 3 bp apart and are found in diverse combinations in a variety of nucleic acid interacting proteins such as transcription factors. TALEs on the other hand are found in repeats with a one-to-one recognition ratio between the amino acids and the recognized nucleotide pairs. Because both zinc fingers and TALEs happen in repeated patterns, different combinations can be tried to create a wide variety of sequence specificities. Zinc fingers have been more established in these terms and approaches such as modular assembly (where Zinc fingers correlated with a triplet sequence are attached in a row to cover the required sequence), OPEN (low-stringency selection of peptide domains vs. triplet nucleotides followed by high-stringency selections of peptide combination vs. the final target in bacterial systems), and bacterial one-hybrid screening of zinc finger libraries among other methods have been used to make site specific nucleases.|$|E

This, however, does not improve their ability to link pronunciation with characters, which suggests that these learners need more than orthography aids to help them in mastering the language in both writing and speech.|$|R
40|$|Background: Impaired emotion {{recognition}} in dementia {{is associated with}} increased patient agitation, behavior management difficulties, and caregiver burden. Emerging evidence supports the presence of very early emotion recognition difficulties in mild cognitive impairment (MCI); however, {{the relationship between these}} impairments and psychosocial measures is not yet explored. Methods: Emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> of 27 patients with nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), 29 patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI), and 22 control articipants were assessed. Self-report measures assessed patient functional disability, while informants rated the degree of burden they experienced. Results: Difficulties in recognizing anger was evident in the amnestic subtype. Although both the patient groups reported greater social functioning disability, compared with the controls, a relationship between social dysfunction and anger recognition was evident only for patients with naMCI. A significant association was found between burden and anger {{recognition in}} patients with aMCI. Conclusions: Impaired emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> impact MCI subtypes differentially. Interventions targeted at patients with MCI, and caregivers are warranted. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Probabilistic phonotactics {{refers to}} the {{frequency}} with which segments and sequences of segments occur in syllables and words. Knowledge of phonotactics {{has been shown to be}} an important source of information in segmenting and recognizing speech in normal hearing listeners. A post-perceptual task (nonword rating) and two on-line tasks (an auditory same-different and an auditory lexical decision task) were used in the present set of experiments to examine the use of phonotactic information by post-lingually deafened adults who have received a cochlear implant. The results of all three experiments showed that both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners are sensitive to differences in phonotactic information to varying degrees. Furthermore, cochlear implant patients with better word <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities</b> (as measured by the NU- 6) tended to be more sensitive to phonotactic information than cochlear implant patients with poorer word <b>recognition</b> <b>abilities.</b> The implications of these results for outcome assessments and clinical interventions are discussed...|$|R
