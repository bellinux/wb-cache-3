40|$|Abstract:- The {{importance}} of <b>metering</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> is increasing {{with the development}} of electricity market. But there are obvious defects in <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> in the presence of harmonics mainly due to mistake in phase shifting. This paper analyzes the phase-shift errors of common used varhour meters through sequence component analysis. The frequency response tests and harmonic <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> tests are done to induction varhour meter and solid-state meter. The test data are analyzed by least square method. The analysis show that the error contribution of varhour meter’s registration in the presence of harmonics are due to amplitude effects and phase effects through analysis of theory and experiments: the phase contribution will be large to both induction varhour meter and solid-state meter and may cause metering errors of double harmonic apparent power, the amplitude is decreased with increasing harmonic order and that of the induction varhour is decreased more dramatically.

40|$|Abstract—Power meters are {{critical}} for submetering loads in residential and commercial settings, but high installation cost and complexity hamper their broader adoption. Recent approaches address installation burdens by proposing non-invasive meters that easily clip onto a wire, or stick onto a circuit breaker, to perform contactless metering. Unfortunately, these designs require regular maintenance (e. g. battery replacement) or reduce measurement accuracy (e. g. work poorly with non-unity power factors). This paper presents Gemini, a new design point in the <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> space. Gemini addresses the drawbacks of prior approaches by decoupling and distributing the AC voltage and current measurement acquisitions, and recombining them wirelessly using a low-bandwidth approach, to offer non-invasive real, <b>reactive,</b> and apparent <b>power</b> <b>metering.</b> Battery maintenance is eliminated by using an energy-harvesting design that enables the <b>meter</b> to <b>power</b> itself using a current transformer. Accuracy is substantially improved over other non-invasive meters by virtualizing the voltage channel—effectively allowing the <b>meter</b> to calculate <b>power</b> {{as if it could}} directly measure voltage (since true power requires sample-by-sample multiplication of current and voltage measurements acquired with tight timing constraints). Collectively, these improvements result in a new design point that meters resistive loads with 0. 6 W average error and a range of reactive and switching loads with 2. 2 W average error—matching commercial, mains-powered solutions.

30|$|There {{are three}} aspects of {{differentiating}} <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> from active power in power system operation, {{and they should}} be considered in reliability evaluation. First, it is not efficient to transfer <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> over a long distance because <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> losses in transmission lines are significant and the bus voltage is very sensitive to <b>reactive</b> <b>power.</b> Therefore, the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> shortage is usually compensated locally in weakly connected grids. Second, the major role of <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> is to maintain voltage stability/security of power systems. Therefore, the impact of <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> on system reliability in terms of energy not supplied is indirect and is calculated based on the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> shortage and voltage violations. Finally, the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> losses change with system configuration and operation conditions [23, 24]. <b>Reactive</b> <b>power</b> requirements for voltage restoration after a contingency are heavily dependent on <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> reserve distributions in a power system. In order to reasonably determine the real and <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> dispatch and post contingency load shedding, the characteristics of real and <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> corresponding to bus voltage and their correlation have to be considered.|$|R

40|$|AC <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> {{require both}} {{voltage and current}} to be sampled {{concurrently}} to obtain real, <b>reactive,</b> and apparent <b>power.</b> Typically, the two measurements are taken in close physical proximity and fed into a single <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> device. In this paper, we explore the viability of decoupling the voltage and current channels, and placing them in physically disparate locations. Such decoupling could ease the installation of metering infrastructure and enable new sensing scenarios. However, decoupling the voltage and current channels raises a new question: how should they be recombined? Of the various approaches, we propose the voltage channel be virtualized: a voltage sensor measures the voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase, typically near the root of a circuit branch. The extracted phase is time-stamped relative to a global clock and disseminated wirelessly, along with the magnitude and frequency measurements, to <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> throughout the network. The <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> synthesize a suitably scaled replica of the voltage waveform locally, based on the parameters reported by the voltage sensor, and combine it with locally-measured current readings. This paper demonstrates – through empirical characterization of the line voltages, a proof-of-concept <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> implementation, and house-scale evaluation – that the design holds promise and offers substantially lower measurement errors than other distributed <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> approaches for non-resistive loads...|$|R
