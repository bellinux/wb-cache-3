40|$|AbstractVehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) {{rely on the}} {{cooperation}} of the nodes to forward packets for each other. Some nodes may decide not to cooperate to save their resource while still using network resources. These nodes are called selfish. It has been shown that presence of such selfish nodes degrades the overall performance of a vehicular ad hoc network. To address this problem, we propose a fuzzy reputation system to discipline selfish behavior and encourage packet forwarding. Different from traditional reputation based solutions, our scheme doesn’t rely on judgments about a node by its neighbors. So the misjudgments about a node which is a serious vulnerability in existing solutions have been eliminated. Our solution consists of two major components: The Forward Manager and the Fuzzy <b>Reputation</b> <b>Manager.</b> The Forward Manager in each node keeps track of the number of received forwarding requests and the number of packets which have been forwarded so far. The Fuzzy <b>Reputation</b> <b>Manager</b> checks each packet's source node to see whether it is selfish or not. Packets belong to selfish source nodes eliminate from the network. The simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme can successfully increase network performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Service-oriented {{computing}} {{promotes the}} construction of applications by composing distributed services that are advertised in an open service market. In such an environment, individual services may change and evolve dynamically, requiring composite services to adapt to such changes. The prevailing strategy is to react on failures and replace the defective component of the composite service. However, this reactive approach does not fully exploit the opportunities of a dynamic market where older services may be replaced by better ones. In this paper we promote a novel architecture for automated, dynamic, pro-active, and transparent maintenance and improvement of composite services. We leverage fine-grained client-side monitoring techniques to generate information regarding functional and non-functional properties of service behavior. A <b>reputation</b> <b>manager</b> is responsible for collecting and aggregating this information, and provides economical incentives for honest sharing of feedback. Composite services can thus use reliable reputation information to pro-actively improve their aggregate performance. ...|$|E

In this paper, {{we address}} {{the task of}} {{detecting}} the reputa-tion alert in social media updates, that is, deciding whether a new-coming content has strong and immediate implications for the reputation of a given entity. This content is also submitted to a standard typology of rep-utation dimensions that consists in a broad classification of the aspects of an under public audience company. <b>Reputation</b> <b>manager</b> needs a real-time database and method to report what is happening right now to his brand. However, typical Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to these tasks require external resources and show non-relational mod-eling. We propose a fast supervised approach for extracting textual fea-tures, which we use to train simple statistical reputation classifiers.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of empirical tests and theoretical works exploring how the corporate <b>reputation</b> influences <b>manager’s</b> earnings management decisions. Building and protecting corporate reputation {{is one of}} the challenges to CEOs today. Some researchers suggest that corporate reputation is one important factor when investors evaluate a firm. The other scholars indicate that corporate reputation has an impact on manager’s information disclosure and strategies making. Earnings management occurs when managers bias financial reporting or construct transactions strategically to impact the cash flow. I am curious whether the corporate reputation has an effect in earnings management behaviour to mislead investors. Firstly, I test how the corporate <b>reputation</b> affects <b>manager’s</b> earnings management behaviour in both accruals manipulation and real manipulations. I find that firms with worse reputation use more increasing discretionary accruals and intend to manipulate sales. Then, I study the reputation effect on discretionary accruals in a repeated cheap-talk game. I find that for managers in firms without prior good reputation among investors, smoothing earnings is an effective way to alter the investors’ opinion...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine and extend {{research}} on the burgeoning area of a <b>manager's</b> <b>reputation.</b> Not only is current theory still being developed regarding how a reputation is formed, but even less is known about whether and how a <b>manager's</b> <b>reputation</b> could change.

Such actions are a way of "signaling" to their audience that change is occurring. In turn, this study proposes that an audience will reassess the focal-manager in question, assigning a new <b>reputation</b> to the <b>manager</b> based upon these observable changes.

Vehicular nodes are allowed to forward the road related information like traffic condition, congestion in road, accident, weather condition etc to other vehicles. This information is very useful and valuable to nearby vehicles which will increase the road safety and hence it reduces the congestion. Message transmission will not be effective unless it is reliable. This paper demonstrates Reliable Fuzzy Reputation System (RFRS) which is reliable in terms of forwarding the information in vehicular network. Reliability is achieved by introducing RFRS and Universal Generating Function Techniques (UGFT) method in VANET. RFRS is used to find the selfish nodes from non-selfish nodes and gather the information from selfish nodes and finally forward to other ongoing vehicles effectively. Successful transmission of packets from source node to target node is calculated by using node UGF, UGF of FM (Forward Manager) and UGF of FRM (Fuzzy <b>Reputation</b> <b>Manager).</b> Also we projected an EMAP system- trusted authority, which is responsible for sharing secret keys to all OBUs in network that improves the security.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} how business news {{reports on the}} activities of business organizations in Nigeria set agenda for the opinions, attitudes and perceptions of their stakeholders. Design/method/approach: Content analysis of business newspapers and semi-structured interviews were employed to test the validity of four theoretical propositions on the second level agenda-setting effects. Findings: Our findings confirm existing theories {{that the amount of}} news coverage received by a corporation connects positively to public awareness and perception of the corporation; that the amount of news coverage dedicated to specific attributes of some business organizations in Nigeria connects to the proportion of the stakeholders who define the corporation by these attributes; that the more media cover specific corporate attributes from a positive perspective, the more positively will the general public perceive these attributes; and that the more negative that the media coverage is for some specific corporate attributes, the more negative will the general public perceive those attributes. Theoretical implication: One can reasonably argue that based on the outcomes of this study, corporate reputation theories as propounded in international marketing studies bear significant corollary to reputation studies in Nigeria. Practical implication: The study suggests the need for <b>reputation</b> <b>managers</b> in Nigeria and in the western world to learn from one another by forming strategic alliances. Limitation of study: This study is devoted to the Nigerian business environment. Whilst this may prevent the generation of a theory, it offers an opportunity to examine the subject on comparative national study. </p...|$|R
40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{explore how}} speculators can destabilize {{financial}} markets by amplifying negative shocks in periods of market turmoil, and confirm the main {{predictions of the}} theoretical analysis using data on money market funds (MMFs). I propose a dynamic trading model with two types of investors - long-term and speculative - who interact in a market with search frictions. During periods of turmoil created by an uncertainty shock, speculators react to declining asset prices by liquidating their holdings in hopes of buying them back later at a gain, despite the asset's cash flows remaining the same throughout. Interestingly, I show that a reduction in trading frictions leads to more severe fluctuations in asset prices. At the root of this result are the strategic complementarities between speculators expected to follow similar strategies in the future. Using a novel dataset on MMFs' portfolio holdings during the European debt crisis, I gauge the strength of funds' strategic interactions {{as the number of}} funding relationships each issuer has with MMFs. I show that funds are more likely to liquidate the securities of issuers that have fewer funding relationships with other funds, obliging them to borrow at shorter maturity and higher interest rates. In Chapter 2, co-authored with Marco Pagano, I study a model where some investors ("hedgers") are bad at information processing, while others ("speculators") have superior information-processing ability and trade purely to exploit it. The disclosure of financial information induces a trade externality: if speculators refrain from trading, hedgers do the same, depressing the asset price. Market transparency reinforces this mechanism, by making speculators' trades more visible to hedgers. As a consequence, asset sellers will oppose both the disclosure of fundamentals and trading transparency. This is socially inefficient if a large fraction of market participants are speculators and hedgers have low processing costs. But in these circumstances, forbidding hedgers' access to the market may dominate mandatory disclosure. In Chapter 3, I show that reputation concerns are important sources of discipline for institutional investors, but their effectiveness varies along the business cycle. I propose a dynamic model of reputation formation in which investors learn about fund managers' skill upon observing past returns. Managers can generate active returns at a disutility and determine the fund's exposure to tail risk. The model delivers rich dynamics for managers' behavior. Good <b>reputation</b> <b>managers</b> exploit their status by extracting higher rents from investors, while intermediate <b>reputation</b> <b>managers</b> tend to improve their returns to attract more funds. Finally, for bad performers there exists a reputation trap: their perceived low quality prevents them from attracting investors' capital and then also from improving their track record. Furthermore, when the economy is subject to aggregate shocks, fund managers tend to exacerbate fluctuations by exposing the fund to tail risk to increase short-term returns. The model provides a framework to analyze the investment strategies adopted by mutual funds and hedge funds during the recent financial crisis. by Marco Di Maggio. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to investigate whether communicating corporate social responsibility (CSR) to stakeholders through social networking sites (SNSs) could be regarded as a new avenue for reputation management. This was achieved by exploring how two South African financial institutions, FNB and Capitec, communicated their CSR initiatives to stakeholders on platforms such as their annual integrated reports, websites, and two SNSs, Facebook and Twitter. This research was a phenomenological, exploratory inquiry into the phenomenon of CSR and had an empirical and a non-empirical component. The research‟s non-empirical component comprised of an extensive literature review of the research‟s three primary themes, reputation management, CSR and ethics, as well as SNSs. As part of the non-empirical component, different secondary data sets were collected that included FNB‟s and Capitec‟s CSR communication as communicated in their annual integrated reports of 2013, their websites, as well as data entries on their Facebook and Twitter accounts. The empirical component consisted of interpreting textual, qualitative data sourced from the aforementioned CSR communicative products. The different data sets were analysed through discourse analyses in conjunction with two computer-aided qualitative data analysis software programs (CAQDAS), Leximancer and Centim. Throughout the research the researcher acted as a phenomenologist and aimed to explore the multi-faceted constructs of reputation and CSR. With the rise of SNSs <b>reputation</b> <b>managers</b> are compelled to manage corporate reputations in an online environment. This includes evaluating stakeholder sentiment and enhancing meaningful communicative interactions with stakeholders. As part of the findings on stakeholder engagement, a framework for reputation management on SNSs was proposed. It was posited that this framework had three functions: strategic, academic, and pragmatic. Firstly, when CAQDAS programs are used to analyse the dialogue, interactions and sentiment of stakeholders on SNSs it could enable the organisation to react timeously and strategically when negative sentiments (threats) arise. Secondly, when SNSs are re-theorised as active media where stakeholder sentiment could be measured instead of acting as mere communication platforms, it contributed to literature on stakeholder theory. Thirdly, this framework provided the reputation management discipline with a holistic and integrated analysis technique that could assist <b>reputation</b> <b>managers</b> in developing <b>reputation</b> management strategies that are more responsive and stakeholder-specific. As such, this framework could be adapted to suit the needs of any organisation. Although the establishment of a new conceptual framework for online reputation management formed a crucial part of this research, constructs such as CSR, ethics and moral philosophy were also explored. The research showed that African philosophy on ethics and morality, along with the construct of Ubuntu was not far removed from Eurocentric thought pertaining to morality as a universal phenomenon. Lastly, from the data analysed it was construed that the embeddedness of CSR in FNB‟s values, brand narrative and identity was directly related to the establishment of a strong corporate moral philosophy. It was also argued that the two financial institutions under investigation consciously executed reputation management strategies with the purpose of enhancing their reputations, improving stakeholder relations and/or creating competitive advantage when CSR messages were communicated to stakeholders.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} legal, social, and architectural dimensions of {{three sets of}} platform-specific reputational disputes {{in order to understand}} how people negotiate the reputational impact of personally critical speech. The cases involve individuals criticized on nominal “consumer review” websites, bloggers writing as “professional-amateur” journalists, and crowd-sourced criminal investigations on the social media platform Reddit. 	Techno-utopian optimism about the decline of traditional media gatekeepers has given way to widespread lament over the apparent vulnerability of our “online reputations. ” Such lament is steeped in a thoroughly neoliberal conception of increased personal responsibility to protect one’s reputation as an exchangeable asset. This perceived imperative has prompted several responses. 	Some call for the law to afford greater control over the speech of others. Such calls challenge the conventional wisdom in First Amendment theory that “counterspeech” is the preferred remedy for critical speech that is not false or egregiously invasive. Yet efforts to compel search engines to de-index links or impose greater liability on platform operators for third-party speech are largely legal and political dead ends in the U. S. 		More vexing are some emergent combinations of law and private action that have conflicting implications within theories of free speech and democracy. The search engine optimization tactics of the “reputation management” industry often obviate litigation through direct counterspeech. My case studies demonstrate that some of its efforts achieve the kind of non-judicial resolution of reputational disputes that legal reformers have sought for decades. 	On the other hand, <b>reputation</b> <b>managers</b> and their clients routinely use “reputational” concerns as a rhetorical pretext for silencing an expanded range of critical speech than is traditionally actionable. Reputation management thus simultaneously embodies a broader reactionary ethos regarding public discussion. This ethos is at odds with liberal speech norms that valorize the cacophony of competing views and the promotion of “republican virtue” when citizens collectively confront troubling ideas or sentiments. Ultimately, the paradox of reputation management demonstrates how the neoliberal imperative to fashion oneself as a “brand” perhaps threatens robust public discussion as much as overly stringent libel and privacy laws would...|$|R

However, less is known about how colleagues within internal labor markets respond when they believe fellow managers have managed earnings. Designers of responsibility accounting systems need to understand the reputational costs managers impose on one another within internal labor markets. In an experimental study, 159 evening MBA students were asked to assume the role of a manager in a company and respond to a scenario in which another manager (the target manager) has the opportunity to engage in earnings management. Participants provided causal attributions, assessed the morality of the target manager, and indicated whether they would change their judgments about the target <b>manager’s</b> <b>reputation.</b> The study manipulated three between-subjects factors: (1) whether the target manager chose to engage in earnings management, (2) whether the company’s budgetary control system was rigid or flexible, and (3) whether the target manager’s work history was average or above average. We found that causal attributions are affected more by the budgetary systems when the target did not manage earnings than when the manager did. We also found that morality judgments were significantly associated with the target manager’s behavior, but not with the budgetary system. In addition, participants’ judgments about the target <b>manager’s</b> <b>reputation</b> were more strongly associated with morality judgments than with causal attributions.
