25|$|In this context, {{the most}} useful measure of {{profitability}} is Return on capital (ROC). The result is shown as a percentage, determined by dividing relevant income for the 12 months by capital employed; <b>Return</b> <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> (ROE) shows this result for the firm's shareholders. As above, firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital exceeds the cost of capital.|$|E

40|$|The firm should pursue both maximum <b>return</b> rate <b>on</b> {{capital and}} maximum <b>return</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> simultaneously. Maximum <b>return</b> rate <b>on</b> capital {{is the primary}} goal for firms because maximum <b>return</b> rate <b>on</b> capital {{guarantees}} efficiency. Therefore, maximum profit, maximum {{market value of the}} firm, maximum value of equity and maximum <b>return</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> are inappropriate to be the primary goal. Since gross profit is independent of capital structure, capital structure just distributes <b>return</b> <b>on</b> capital into <b>equity</b> and debt (i. e., maximum <b>return</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> determines capital structure).

25|$|The {{dominant}} {{performance measures}} change over time. A compilation of surveys examining the stated financial goals of companies over the century found the following: companies strove to maximize {{market share in}} the late 1960s; earnings per share in the mid-1970s; <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> in the early 1980s; and cash flow and share prices in present day. Other surveys found that organizations' preferences for evaluating performance related to capital expenditures have shifted dramatically over time. For instance, in 1959, 13% of firms focused on internal rates of return while 86% of firms did so in 1988. In addition, the percentage of firms utilizing accounting measures decreased from 50% in 1959 to 12% in 1988. One potential reason that dominating performance measures change over time is that as organizations replace old measures when they discover their limitations.|$|E
25|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have designed numerous ways to measure performance {{and continue to}} do so at an increasing rate. Evidence for this observation can be found by tracking changes in performance measures over time. In the 19th century, companies measured their performance via industry-specific output and cost measures, such as newspaper circulation. By the 1920s, companies also began utilizing accounting-based returns measures, such as return on investment. And the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of purely financial measures of performance relating information on dividends and <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>equity.</b> This dependence on performance measures has not diminished in recent years – on the contrary, the number of metrics that exist is growing at an even more accelerated rate. Today, in addition to financial measures, organizations examine nonfinancial metrics regarding leadership, information, planning, human resource utilization, and customer satisfaction. This proliferation in performance measurements has led to corresponding growth in the performance measurement industry – there has been a notable {{increase in the number of}} personnel {{and organizations}} devoted to examining performance-related metrics, such as certified public accountants and financial analysts.|$|E

[...] The battles between Ebner and UBS management proved a distraction to the bank in the mid-1990s. Looking {{to take advantage of}} the situation, Credit Suisse approached UBS about a merger that would have created the second largest bank in the world in 1996. [...] UBS's management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger. [...] Ebner, who supported the idea of a merger, led a major shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of UBS's chairman, Robert Studer.

The effect of the time configuration of expected growth in earnings and investment on the specification of the valuation model is demonstrated. An econometric model is developed and applied to cross-sectional data to estimate the required rate of <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>equities</b> of electric and gas utilities. An iterative least-squares procedure is proposed for handling the value of growth in models of this form, whereby the non-linearity among the parameters in the valuation model is explicitly recognized. Estimates of required rates of <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>equities</b> are obtained for a national utility sample in 1958 - 1969 and for firms in four regional sectors in 1963 - 1969. The estimated rates tend to move synchronously with bond yields over the twelve-year period, with a mean value approximately one percentage point larger than the interest rate on high grade utility bonds. ...|$|R
