5|$|The Tour of Qatar {{is one of}} {{the early}} <b>races</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season, coming in the middle of three <b>races</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East (alongside the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Oman) that see high levels of {{participation}} from the top European teams. The race is particularly popular as a preparation race for riders aiming for the spring classics. The significant challenge in the Tour of Qatar is the strong winds across the desert, which frequently cause the peloton to split into echelons. As well as attracting the top classics riders, the flat nature of the course means many stages can be won by sprinters; the individual time trial also attracts many of the time trial specialists, who have a chance of overall victory.|$|E

The distinctive feature of the Tour of Oman is the annual inclusion of the climb of Jebel Akhdar, the Green Mountain, which means the general classification is generally won by climbers. Many Grand Tour contenders start their seasons racing in Oman for this reason.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also the}} host {{to one of the}} oldest car <b>races</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, the Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race, which has been held on and off since 1904.

Kišerlovski and Clarke took seventh places at two early-season classics, respectively the Classica Sarda and the Giro del Friuli, the latter a race run in such difficult conditions that only 25 riders finished.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{presence}} at other single-day <b>races</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring season was paltry. Only two other races featured top-ten finishes from the team.

Antón similarly made all the day's selections and finished 11th in this group, as he built his form for the Giro d'Italia. Later in April at the Gran Premio de Llodio, Nieve rode to eighth place finishing with the first chase group behind a solo winner.|$|E

American Pharoah was the 3–5 morning line favorite in an eight-horse field that included Tale of Verve, as well as five rivals from the Kentucky Derby who had skipped the Preakness, and one horse, Madefromlucky, who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races, but, like Tonalist the year prior, had instead won the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park.
