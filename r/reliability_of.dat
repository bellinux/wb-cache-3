5|$|In 1946, the Labour {{government}} in Britain, exhausted by recent {{events such as}} World War II and numerous riots, realized that it had neither the mandate at home, the support internationally, nor the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the British Indian Army for continuing to control an increasingly restless British India. The <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the native forces for continuing their control over an increasingly rebellious India diminished, and so the government decided to end the British rule of the Indian Subcontinent. In 1946, the Indian National Congress, being a secular party, demanded a single state. The Muslim majorities, who disagreed {{with the idea of}} single state, stressed the idea of a separate Pakistan as an alternative. The 1946 Cabinet Mission to India was sent to try to reach a compromise between Congress and the Muslim League, proposing a decentralized state with much power given to local governments, but it was rejected by both of the parties and resulted in a number of riots in South Asia.|$|E
