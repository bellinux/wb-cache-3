5|$|Apart {{from its}} greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, {{by having a}} larger and heavier black beak, shaggy {{feathers}} around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the <b>rustle</b> <b>of</b> silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.|$|E

25|$|The most noted of the palace's ghosts is the Vita frun (the White lady). A White Lady, White woman, Weiße Frau or Dame Blanche is said {{to exist}} in many European castles and {{likewise}} in Stockholm. According to legend, the White Lady is a messenger of death for someone in the Royal Family. She showed up when someone was about to die. She is supposedly tall and wears a white silk dress, only the <b>rustle</b> <b>of</b> the silk is heard as she approaches. There are several theories as to who she might be and where she comes from. According to one theory she is the Duchess Agnes of Merán, a German noble lady from the House of Hohenzollern {{who lived in the}} 1200s. She was married to Count Otto of Orlamünde until he died in 1293. She murdered both her children by him to be able to marry Albrect, a Count from Nurnberg also known as The Fair, but he abandoned her. She died in prison and is since then showing herself as a white lady in the Hohenzollern castles in connection to important family events.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Looking Glass' {{previous}} first-person games—Ultima Underworld, Ultima Underworld II and System Shock—Terra Nova {{takes place}} in outdoor environments. The game's engine, named TED, supports weather conditions, day and night environments, real-time water reflections and moving clouds, among other effects. Most of {{the work on the}} outdoor renderer was done by programmer Eric Twietmeyer; however, contemporary computers were not powerful enough to display fully three-dimensional (3D) outdoor environments. The problem was solved by programmer James Fleming: the game's engine renders and applies textures to foreground objects in full 3D graphics, but—according to PC Gamer US—it displays a [...] "bitmapped background in the distance" [...] to provide the [...] "illusion of detail". As with Flight Unlimited and the CD-ROM release of System Shock, Terra Nova was designed to support head-mounted displays. The game features QSound technology. Describing QSound's effect before the game's release, Suzanne Kantra Kirschner of Popular Science wrote that [...] "you'll hear the <b>rustle</b> <b>of</b> leaves from the right speaker a split second before you hear it in the left signaling you that the enemy is approaching from the right".|$|E
500|$|The {{philosophical}} album closer [...] "Africa" [...] celebrates D'Angelo's heritage, while reaffirming his contemporary {{mission in}} life. It {{has been cited}} by Questlove as his favorite song on the album. The theme of [...] "Africa" [...] concerns the finding of a spiritual home amid geographical displacement, and of passing that sense of belonging on to one's children. [...] "Africa" [...] was originally written in honor of D'Angelo's son, Michael Archer, Jr., and ended up as a dedication to history, Africa, and God. Opening with a shimmery <b>rustle</b> <b>of</b> chimes, the song contains a drum interpretation of Prince's [...] "I Wonder U" [...] from his Parade (1986), which was also utilized for the Ursula Rucker and The Roots track [...] "The Return to Innocence Lost" [...] from Things Fall Apart. Questlove discussed producing the opening chime sounds for [...] "Africa", stating [...] "we took the cover off the rhodes and mic'd 'em". One critic described C. Edward Alford's guitar work for [...] "Africa" [...] as [...] "backward guitar solos (at least they sound backward)". Another critic described the song as a [...] "lullaby" [...] and [...] "a gorgeous, opalescent closer ... a prayer of sorts". Voodoos coda, which consists of chopped-up track snippets run backwards, plays at the song's conclusion.|$|E

I would like to paint portraits against a background that is so lively and yet so still."
