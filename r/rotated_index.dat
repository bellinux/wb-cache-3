To solve this problem, Image Comparison Search Engine (ICSE) makes use of “Fractal Image processing “to create a database using image Eigen values. When a user input is an image query, this system will generate image Eigen value data, compare this with the data in the database of image Eigen value, and output the results. ICSE can not only find the exact input image for the source image, but also find the “right image” when the source image is <b>rotated.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — fractal image compression, search engine, mean, range block, domain block I...|$|E
40|$|Research Objective: Feasibility {{study of}} the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus {{considering}} the expansion of information {{in the field of}} women and family studies, as well as the wide span of related vocabulary and the development of vocabulary lists and bibliographies, the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus can be a professional tool for indexing and retrieval of women’s information in databases, library collections, archives and documentation centers as well as the Internet. Using this thesaurus, an indexing system will be developed which can be used for indexing, storage and retrieval of family and women’s databases. Methodology: The research method used in this study is documentary-based and the data gathering method was through library search in printed and electronic resources as well as interviewing professionals in the field of family and Women’s Studies. Through building a concept network between the terms, first the main structure of the thesaurus was determined using the inductive method and then the detailed structure was developed. Using this concept network, terms of the field were determined in a specific system and their interrelations were clarified. Findings: By studying resources including books, theses and articles in the field of women and family studies, and using ISO 25964 - 1 standard, the following 13 major categories were determined for the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus : 1. Religion; 2. Health and Hygiene; 3. Politics; 4. Economics; 5. Social Sciences; 6. Education; 7. Psychology; 8. History; 9. Culture and Literature; 10. International Relations; 11. Law; 12. Science and Technology; 13. Sports. There exists a rich vocabulary pool in the above categories; in fact around 6000 terms were identified. Conclusion: Based upon the collected vocabulary and after building the references and scope notes, 243 keywords including 160 preferred terms, 124 related terms, 83 scope notes and 82 non-preferred terms were identified and entered into the Thesaurus Builder software. The alphabetical index, tree index, <b>rotated</b> <b>index</b> and the English-Persian index were developed {{as a model for the}} main thesaurus. As a result, the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus can be developed based upon the vocabulary and the model at hand...|$|E

50|$|Some {{tachymeter}} {{scales are}} on a <b>rotating,</b> <b>indexed</b> bezel. This allows two additional modes of use: The tachymeter bezel can be aligned with a free running second hand, and, more subtly, {{can be used to}} find the average speed over longer times/distances. Set the rotary bezel index to the position of the minute hand, note the current mileage/distance. Glance at the position of the minute hand on the tachymeter scale 60 units of distance later, and average speed will be indicated. A little mental math allows interim averages, easiest at 1/4 (15 unit) and other integer values. Alternatively, instead of using minute hand, align index bezel to the second hand and observe passing one unit of distance when position of the second hand will then indicate average speed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—volumetric 3 D {{displays}} {{allow the}} user to explore a 3 D scene free of joysticks, keyboards, goggles, or trackers. For nontrivial scenes, computing and transferring a 3 D image to the display takes hundreds of seconds, which is a serious bottleneck for many applications. We propose to represent the 3 D scene with an occlusion camera reference image (OCRI). The OCRI is a compact scene representation that stores only and all scene samples that are visible from a viewing volume centered at a reference viewpoint. The OCRI enables computing and transferring the 3 D image {{an order of magnitude}} faster than when the entire scene is processed. The OCRI approach can be readily applied to several volumetric display technologies; we have tested the OCRI approach with good results on a volumetric display that creates a 3 D image by projecting 2 D scene slices onto a <b>rotating</b> screen. <b>Index</b> Terms—Three-Dimensional Displays, computer graphics, image-based rendering, rendering acceleration...|$|R

Eddy current loss models of permanent magnets used in electrical machines are frequently discussed in research papers. In magnetic steel materials we have, in addition to eddy current losses, hysteresis losses when AC or a rotating flux travels through the material. Should a similar phenomenon also {{be taken into account}} in calculating the losses of permanent magnets? Actually, every now and then authors seem to assume that some significant hysteresis losses are present in rotating machine PMs. This paper studies the mechanisms of possible hysteresis losses in PMs and their role in PMs when used in <b>rotating</b> electrical machines. <b>Index</b> Terms—Permanent magnet, permanent magnet material, permanent magnet losses, hysteresis, hysteresis in permanent magnets.

The ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the gravitational potential energy ranges from 0. 13 to 0. 20. The systems oscillate axisymmetrically; the oscillations are interpreted as superpositions of a mode of radial pulsation and a Kelvin-like mode of oscillation. The experimental frequencies of these modes agree very well with theoretical predictions. When these modes are suppressed, {{the states of the}} experimental systems are very steady. The systems are dynamically unstable with respect to a toroidal mode when the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the gravitational potential energy exceeds a value lying between 0. 16 and 0. 17...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{constructs}} simple two-component (dark + bright) {{models for the}} Milky Way, where both the density distribution and the rotation curve are deduced from known observations.

A specific angular momentum is derived for the Milky Way's younger and flatter population and, if angular momentum conservation holds during the evolution, for the whole system.

30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of information technology, {{the sizes of}} digital libraries become larger and larger. How to quickly and effectively search the desired images in huge digital libraries becomes the challenge needed to resolve with high priority. In this study, we firstly propose two motif-based matrices, i.e., the motif average matrix (MAM) and motif excessive matrix (MEM), to describe the color and texture features of an image. Subsequently, {{in terms of the}} inference of MAM and MEM, a motif matrix (MM) is further proposed to <b>index</b> <b>rotated</b> images and resolve the issue of rotated image retrieval. That is, in the light of such an inference, MM incorporates the color and texture characters and reveals the consistent relevance between the original and rotated images, which can be effectively used for rotated image retrieval. To extensively test the performance of our method, we carry out the experiments on the benchmark Corel image dataset, Brodatz texture image dataset, WIPO global brand dataset, and the experimental results show that our approach of motif matrix inference improves the retrieval performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art image retrieval approaches.|$|R
40|$|A self-consistent, {{three-dimensional}} numerical {{experiment is}} performed on an N-body system whose initial {{state is a}} realization of a certain theoretical model of a rotating triaxial galaxy. The model is a stellar-dynamical counterpart of a uniformly <b>rotating</b> polytrope of <b>index</b> equal to 0. 5. The aim of the experiment is to study the equilibrium of the system and, in particular, to test its stability. The experimental system behaves in the mean like a realization of the theoretical model for at least seven crossing times. The principal departure of the system from equilibrium is an oscillation which is identified as a radial pulsation. There is no indication in its behavior {{that the system is}} unstable with respect to anu mode with an e-folding time shorter than or of the order of two crossing times. Certain changes that occur {{in the state of the}} system are interpreted, with the aid of the theoretical model, as secular changes which result from a slight failure of our numerical methods to conserve the mass, energy, and angular momentum of the system; these effects are small enough that they do not vitiate the experiment on a dynamical time scale...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates a {{semi-automatic}} {{method for}} creation of topical labels representing the topical concepts in information objects. The method is called <b>rotated</b> latent semantic <b>indexing</b> (rLSI). rLSI has found application in text mining {{but has not}} been used for topical labels generation in digital libraries (DLs). The present study proposes a theoretical model and an evaluation framework {{which are based on}} the LSA theory of meaning and investigates rLSI in a DL environment. The proposed evaluation framework for rLSI topical labels is focused on human-information search behavior and satisfaction measures. The experimental systems that utilize those topical labels were built for the purposes of evaluating user satisfaction with the search process. A new instrument was developed for this study and the experiment showed high reliability of the measurement scales and confirmed the construct validity. Data was collected through the information search tasks performed by 122 participants using two experimental systems. A quantitative method of analysis, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), was used to test a set of research hypotheses and to answer research questions. The results showed a not significant, indirect effect of topical label type on both guidance and satisfaction. The conclusion of the study is that topical labels generated using rLSI provide the same levels of alignment, guidance, and satisfaction with the search process as topical labels created by the professional indexers using best practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many {{practical}} applications require {{the reconstruction of}} images from irregularly sampled data. The spline formalism offers an attractive framework for solving this problem; the currently available methods, however, are hard to deploy for large-scale interpolation problems in dimensions greater than two (3 -D, 3 -D+time) because of an exponential increase of their computational cost (curse of dimensionality). Here, we revisit the standard regularized least-squares formulation of the interpolation problem, and propose to perform the reconstruction in a uniform tensor-product B-spline basis {{as an alternative to}} the classical solution involving radial basis functions. Our analysis reveals that the underlying multilinear system of equations admits a tensor decomposition with an extreme sparsity of its one dimensional components. We exploit this property for implementing a parallel, memory-efficient system solver. We show that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is essentially linear in the number of measurements and that its dependency on the number of dimensions is significantly less than that of the original sparse matrix-based implementation. The net benefit is a substantial reduction in memory requirement and operation count when compared to standard matrix-based algorithms, so that even 4 -D problems with millions of samples become computationally feasible on desktop PCs in reasonable time. After validating the proposed algorithm in 3 -D and 4 -D, we apply it to a concrete imaging problem: the reconstruction of medical ultrasound images (3 -D+time) from a large set of irregularly sampled measurements, acquired by a fast <b>rotating</b> ultrasound transducer. <b>Index</b> Terms—B-spline, CANDECOMP, reconstruction from irregular samples, tensor, tensor decomposition, variational reconstruction, 4 -D ultrasound reconstruction...|$|R
