5|$|The {{expansion}} of Toronto in the east, in the 19th century, {{led to the}} development of housing stock along the Kingston Road and Danforth Road corridors in Scarborough. This led to the creation of a transit line. In 1893, the Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company built a single-track <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> along Kingston Road to Blantyre. Over the next 13 years this was extended to West Hill. In 1904, the line became the Scarboro Division of the Toronto and York Radial Railway. Service continued along this line until 1936 when it was replaced by bus service.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the left}} is shown a {{schematic}} drawing of an orb web. [...] The red lines represent the dragline, <b>radial</b> <b>line,</b> and frame lines, the blue lines represent the spiral line, and {{the centre of the}} orb web is called the “hub”. [...] Sticky balls drawn in blue are made at equal intervals on the spiral line with viscous material secreted from the aggregate gland. [...] Attachment cement secreted from the piriform gland is used to connect and fix different lines. [...] Microscopically, the spider silk secondary structure is formed of fibroin and is said to have the structure shown on the right side. In the dragline and <b>radial</b> <b>line,</b> a crystalline β-sheet and an amorphous helical structure are interwoven. [...] The large amount of β-spiral structure gives elastic properties to the capture part of the orb web. [...] In the structural modules diagram, a microscopic structure of dragline and radial lines is shown, composed mainly of two proteins of MaSp1 and MaSp2, as shown in the upper central part. [...] In the spiral line, there no crystalline β-sheet region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Under visual {{guidance}} normal subjects usually misbisect <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> {{farther than}} the true midpoint (distal bias). We investigated whether this distal bias is constant across the peripersonal space or it varies by varying {{the distance of the}} stimulus from the subject. Subjects were asked to bisect <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> presented below eye level either in the near or far peripersonal space. The results showed an increase of distal bias in the far-space. This Wnding suggests that the inXuence of spatial factors on bisection of <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> is not constant across the peripersonal space. Distal bias increases {{as a function of the}} distance of the stimulus from the subject, according to a spatiotopic processing scheme...|$|R

40|$|A new visual {{phenomenon}} {{that we call}} flashing anomalous color contrast is described. This phenomenon arises from the interaction between a gray central disk and a chromatic annulus surrounded by black <b>radial</b> <b>lines.</b> In an array of such figures, the central gray disk no longer appears gray, but assumes a color complementary {{to that of the}} surrounding annulus. The induced color appears: (1) vivid and saturated; (2) self-luminous, not a surface property; (3) flashing with eye or stimulus movement; (4) floating out of its confines; and (5) stronger in extrafoveal than in foveal vision. The strength of the effect depends on the number, length, width, and luminance contrast of the <b>radial</b> <b>lines.</b> The results suggest that the chromatic ring bounding the inner tips of the black <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> induces simultaneous color contrast, whereas the <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> elicit, in conjunction with the gray disk and the ring, the flashing, vividness, and high saturation of the effect. The stimulus properties inducing the illusion suggest that flashing anomalous color contrast may be based on asynchronous interactions among multiple visual pathways...|$|R

50|$|On August 16, 1922, the City of Toronto {{formally}} {{acquired the}} T&YRR lines. The plan {{was that the}} city portions of the T&YRR radial lines would {{be incorporated into the}} TTC, and the portions outside the city would be managed by Ontario Hydro as the Hydro-Electric Railways: Toronto and York Division. Thus, the Toronto streetcar system replaced the <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> between Queen Street and Victoria Park Avenue, making the latter street the western terminal of the <b>radial</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|The private Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company had {{operated}} the single track Scarboro <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> along Kingston Road to West Hill. When the TTC assumed the route between Queen Street and Victoria Park in 1922, they double tracked {{the line and}} built the return loop at Bingham. In 1927, the TTC took over operation of the Scarboro <b>radial</b> <b>line,</b> which terminated {{on the east side}} of Victoria Park Avenue, and connected it to the Bingham Loop so that radial cars could be stored at Russell Carhouse. In 1928, the TTC extended the double track east to Birchmount Loop replacing the Scarboro <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> to that point. The Bingham Loop was rebuilt in 1954, with one track removed to accommodate buses as it is today, and streetcar service east of Victoria Park was discontinued.|$|E
