DeGeneres said she wanted to homage Meryl Streep's record 17 Oscar nominations by setting a new record with her, and invited other Oscar celebrities to join them. The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous <b>retweet</b> record within forty minutes, and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour. By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times; less than 24 hours later, it had been retweeted over 2.8 million times. , it has been retweeted over 3.4 million times. The group selfie effort was parodied by Lego, and Matt Groening with The Simpsons. It beat the previous record, 778,801, which was held by Barack Obama, following his victory in the 2012 presidential election.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines retweeting {{activities as}} the information spreading function of Twitter. First, we investigated {{what kind of}} features of a tweet help to get <b>retweets.</b> We construct a model that describes peoples' decision making on <b>retweets,</b> and with related observation, we show that more <b>retweeted</b> tweets get <b>retweeted</b> more. In terms of specific features of tweets, {{it has been shown}} that the number of followers and the number of <b>retweets</b> are positively correlated, and hashtags attract more <b>retweets</b> than the tweets without hashtags. On the other hand, we also found that including hashtags and getting one or more <b>retweets</b> are statistically independent. Moreover, we showed including URLs or user-mentions in tweets and getting one or more <b>retweets</b> are statistically independent. In our results, including a picture is slightly effective to get this sense of retweetability. Second, we compare the retweeters of tweets including a picture and only text, especially focusing on distance from the original tweeters. Comparing the ratio of <b>retweets</b> by followers of the author of the original tweets among the initial 50 <b>retweets,</b> tweets with a picture have a slightly lower ratio, though there is no significant difference between the average for tweets with pictures and without pictures at the 95 % significance level. We also investigate how many <b>retweets</b> are posted by users in followers' network connected to the original tweeter, and show that the depths of retweeters' network for tweets with picture have larger variance than that of tweets without pictures. This result implies that a tweet including picture can reach more people than a tweet without a picture potentially. by Tomoaki Sakamoto. Thesis: S.

Using time series and regression analysis we observe that the likelihood of a politician using replies increases with typical leisure times while <b>retweets</b> occur constant over time.

This hints to a more professional use for <b>retweets</b> while replies tend to have a personal connotation. Comment: 6 pages, ACM Web Science 201...|$|R
40|$|Twitter is ever-present in British {{political}} life and many politicians {{use it as}} part of their campaign strategies. However, little is known about whether their tweets engage people, for example by being <b>retweeted.</b> This research addresses that gap, examining tweets sent by MPs during the 2015 UK General Election campaign to identify which were <b>retweeted</b> and why. A conceptual model proposes three factors which are most likely to influence retweets: the characteristics of (1) the tweet’s sender, (2) the tweet and (3) its recipients. This research focuses on the first two of these. Content and sentiment analysis are used to develop a typology of the politicians’ tweets, followed by CHAID analysis to identify the factors that best predict which tweets are <b>retweeted.</b> The research shows that the characteristics of tweet and its sender do influence whether the tweet is <b>retweeted.</b> Of the sender’s characteristics, number of followers is the most important – more followers leads to more <b>retweets.</b> Of the tweet characteristics, the tweet’s sentiment is the most influential. Negative tweets are <b>retweeted</b> more than positive or neutral tweets. Tweets attacking opponents or using fear appeals are also highly likely to be <b>retweeted.</b> The research makes a methodological contribution by demonstrating how CHAID models can be used to accurately predict <b>retweets.</b> This method has not been used to predict <b>retweets</b> before and has broad application to other contexts. The research also contributes to our understanding of how politicians and the public interact on Twitter, an area little studied to date, and proposes some practical recommendations regarding how MPs can improve the effectiveness of their Twitter campaigning. The finding that negative tweets {{are more likely to be}} <b>retweeted</b> also contributes to the ongoing debate regarding whether people are more likely to pass on positive or negative information online...|$|R

Further, this would also remove personal chats, opinions and initial misinformation not considered credible. The fact that a tweet has not been <b>retweeted</b> also indicates that the probability of it spreading to a sizeable proportion of the population is minimal.|$|R

Bayes’ Theorem scores hashtags by the probability of co-occurring with each term in a tweet, and k-Nearest Neighbor score is the number of hashtags that occurred in similar tweets. Their comparison result showed that the hybrid model performed slightly better than using only one model. Our method, however, delves into the impact of <b>retweets</b> as they can be identical to a target tweet and the hashtags in <b>retweets</b> often receive the highest score. In our method, we removed <b>retweets</b> from the training set so that the recommendation results do not get affected by <b>retweets.</b>|$|R

Using data of who and what was <b>retweeted,</b> we train a probabilistic collaborative filter model to predict future <b>retweets.</b> We find that the most important features for prediction are the identity of the source of the tweet and <b>retweeter.</b> Our methodology is quite flexible and be used as a basis for other prediction models in social networks. ...|$|R

30|$|To find similar tweets {{that are}} {{possibly}} <b>retweets</b> of test tweets, {{we used the}} result scores in the kNN method, which computed Cosine similarity between each tweet in the training set and each tweet in the test set. We then set a similarity threshold, r, that we use to distinguish likely <b>retweets</b> from non-retweets. For example, when r= 0.9, we stratify the training set into: <b>retweets</b> only (0.9) which is the set of training tweets that have a Cosine similarity of 0.9 or greater with some tweet in the test set; and no <b>retweets</b> (0.9) which is the set of training tweets that have a Cosine similarity of less than 0.9 will all tweets in the test set. To observe the impact of Tweet similarity between the training and testing set, we examined the performance with r= 0.75 and r= 0.9 and compared these against the unstratified (complete) training data.|$|R
30|$|The {{credibility}} of the source is the next important factor to be considered. For this we identified and segregated the <b>retweets</b> as per the source. This step would enable us to estimate the unique tweets of the source which are being <b>retweeted</b> and the unique number of users who are retweeting the same. The pattern of retweeting was analysed. Human annotation was done to determine the {{credibility of}} the information. We found greater unevenness amongst the users retweeting tweets of a source, when the {{credibility of the}} source was poor. The sources spreading misinformation were being <b>retweeted</b> heavily by a limited proportion of users who have at least <b>retweeted</b> the source once. This points towards collusion between the users and deliberate attempts being made to spread misinformation. Favouritism in the retweeting behaviour is most often due to questions of credibility as has been validated in all the data sets studied.|$|R
