5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are <b>rimmed</b> with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E

25|$|Simon {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for President in 1988. Mostly unknown outside of Illinois and in low single digits in national polls after his March 1987 announcement, Simon {{made a name}} for himself as the oldest, some thought old-fashioned, candidate, with horn <b>rimmed</b> glasses and bow tie, and one who proudly associated himself with the New Deal liberalism associated with Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman.|$|E
25|$|A camping, cowboy, or chuckwagon Dutch oven {{has three}} legs, a wire bail handle, and a {{slightly}} concave, <b>rimmed</b> lid so that coals from the cooking fire can be placed on top as well as below. This provides more uniform internal heat and lets the inside act as an oven. These ovens are typically made of bare cast iron, although some are aluminum. Dutch ovens are often used in Scouting outdoor activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} a well-preserved {{historical}} centre, {{which is the largest}} among Slovak towns. There are many heritage protected buildings in Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Art Nouveau styles with Slovakia's largest church: the St. Elisabeth Cathedral. The long main street, <b>rimmed</b> with aristocratic palaces, Catholic churches, and townsfolk's houses, is a thriving pedestrian zone with many boutiques, cafés, and restaurants. The city is well known as the first settlement in Europe to be granted its own coat-of-arms.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal is}} easily {{identified}} by its markings, {{most notably the}} light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its rear end. The rest of its hair is black, except for the tips of its ears, which, as with other tapirs, are <b>rimmed</b> with white. This pattern is for camouflage; the disrupted coloration {{makes it more difficult}} to recognize it as a tapir, and other animals may mistake it for a large rock rather than prey when it is lying down to sleep.|$|E
25|$|DeStefano {{would give}} his loan shark victims presents, {{such as a}} gold watch with his name {{engraved}} on the back, so {{that if he had}} to kill his victim and the police accused him he could use the watch as proof of how close he was to the victim and why he could never have killed him. He wore thick black <b>rimmed</b> glasses, making people believe he couldn't see without them, when in truth he could see everything that was going on and would take mental notes on how people operated.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} {{would open up}} almost {{a mirror image of}} the first half. Louisville outscored Oklahoma 15-1 to take their first lead. Oklahoma did not get a basket until more than seven minutes had elapsed. The game would stay close from then on, with never more than a six-point margin by either team. With 18 seconds left in the game Courtney Paris would hit a basket to bring the margin to one. After Candyce Bingham hit one of two free throws, Nyeshia Stevenson took a three-point shot with two seconds left in the game. Her shot <b>rimmed</b> out, and Louisville hung on to win 61-59.|$|E
25|$|They also {{possess the}} {{characteristic}} pair of humps {{on the front}} side of their abdomen, somewhat resembling 'shoulders' and giving them the distinctive triangular shape. On the upper side are eight prominent sigilla (small pit-like depressions) arranged in two rows. The abdomen is subrectangular, with somewhat flat sides, and has small tubercules at the front. It is longer than it is wide and tapers down towards the rear. The bottom side of the abdomen is usually brown with yellow book lungs. The spinnerets are <b>rimmed</b> with white. The epigynum in females possesses a short triangular scape (or ovipositor). The sperm receptacles (spermathecae) are globular.|$|E
25|$|Lithuania {{started the}} tournament against New Zealand. After a tough first quarter, Lithuanians {{took control of}} the game and kept ahead by a {{comfortable}} lead, finishing 92–79. The second game was against Canada. After reducing a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter, Lithuanians finally gained a small lead {{towards the end of the}} game. Canada had a chance to win the game, but Jermaine Anderson's game winning three <b>rimmed</b> out at the last second and Lithuania celebrated their second victory 70–68. The next match was against the defending champion Spain, and after another comeback from an 18-point deficit, the Lithuanians won the upsetting game 76–73, Linas Kleiza's free-throws sealing the victory.|$|E
25|$|The Reffye mitrailleuse used a 13mm (.512inch) {{centerfire}} cartridge, {{designed by}} Gaupillat, which represented {{the state of}} the art in ammunition design at the time. It was rather similar to an elongated modern shotgun shell: centerfire with a <b>rimmed</b> brass head and a dark blue hardened cardboard body. The , 13mm (0.512inch) patched bullet was propelled by 185 grains (12 grams) of compressed black powder at a muzzle velocity of , three and a half times more powerful than Chassepot or Dreyse rifle ammunition. This was, by far, the most potent rifle caliber ammunition in existence at the time. The Montigny and Reffye mitrailleuse systems were not designed to function with paper cartridges such as the 11mm Chassepot combustible paper cartridge.|$|E
25|$|A {{main source}} for the {{construction}} of racing bigae is a number of bronze figurines found throughout the Roman Empire, a particularly detailed example of which is held by the British Museum. Other sources are reliefs and mosaics. These show a lightweight frame, to which a minimal shell of fabric or leather was lashed. The center of gravity was low, and the wheels were relatively small, around 65cm in diameter in proportion to a body 60cm wide and 55cm deep, with a breastwork of about 70cm in height. The wheels may have been <b>rimmed</b> with iron, but otherwise metal fittings are kept to a minimum. The design facilitated speed, maneuverability and stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} end of Yewbarrow rises steeply from the shore of Wastwater, {{the crest of the}} fell running a little east of north for about two miles. Just beyond the second top, the ridge swings sharply to the west at the depression of Dore Head (475 m. / 1,560ft) continuing then onto Red Pike. The strath of Wasdale Head forms the eastern boundary of the fell with the quiet valley of Over Beck to the west. The ridge-top is <b>rimmed</b> by crags, particularly above Over Beck, and at either end. Stirrup Crag lies below the north summit, sometimes lending its name to the top, while Dropping Crag and Bell Rib guard the {{southern end}} of the crest.|$|E
25|$|All three Buttermere Fells {{throw out}} a rocky spur toward the lake, these walls {{enclosing}} Birkness and Bleaberry Combs. Birkness Comb, also called Burtness Comb on Ordnance Survey maps, lies between the truncated and unnamed northern ridges of High Crag and High Stile. Drained into Buttermere by Comb Beck, its headwall is <b>rimmed</b> by crags on all sides. Sheepbone Buttress flanks High Crag, {{which also has}} a share in Comb Crags, lining the onward ridge. It is the great scooped hollow of the Comb which results in the narrowness of Buttermere Edge. The northern spur also ends abruptly as High Crag Buttress, a further tier of rock lying just above the lakeshore.|$|E
25|$|The Buttermere- Ennerdale {{watershed}} descending from Brandreth {{is initially}} indistinct, running north west {{across a broad}} plateau. After half a mile it reaches the rocky protuberance of Great Round How (1,817ft) and then its character changes completely. The watershed narrows to fine ridge, steep enough on the Ennerdale side and <b>rimmed</b> by crags throughout above the head of Buttermere. The beauty of the scene is completed by a succession of rocky tops and nestling tarns, until the high point is reached at the western end. A sharp descent over rock now follows, leading to Scarth Gap (1,460ft), a walkers' pass between the two valleys. Beyond the ridge rises again to High Crag, a steep climb on scree.|$|E
25|$|Johnson’s poke check {{could also}} be used to force {{turnovers}} and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the sideboards and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately make as if he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when thirty feet from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it <b>rimmed</b> around behind the opponent’s goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot and pick up the puck as it came out the other side.|$|E
25|$|With media {{circles on}} his back for his {{complacency}} in these games (James had a then playoff career low 10 points in Game 1), James came back to will the Cavs to close victories in Games 3 and 4 in Cleveland, evening the series at 2. The series shifted back to Detroit for a Game 5 {{that proved to be}} one of the most memorable postseason games in recent NBA history. In a match that went into double overtime, the Cavaliers stunned the Pistons on their home court, thanks to LeBron James' playoff career-high 48-point performance. James scored the Cavaliers' final 25 points, including all 18 points in overtime, forced the second OT with a driving dunk and made a driving layup with 2.2 seconds left in the second OT to silence the Palace crowd. A game tying buzzer beater by Chauncey Billups <b>rimmed</b> out making it two straight 2-point wins at the Palace in Game 5.|$|E
25|$|The interpretable {{geologic}} {{history of}} the Kuiper quadrangle is primarily a record of decreasing meteoroid flux during which large craters and basins formed and plains materials were deposited. A decreasing rate of crater production is indicated by progressively fewer craters in each successively younger crater class. Approximately half of the mapped area contains a high density of craters and multiringed basins formed by the intense early bombardment. It is doubtful that any primary crustal material has been preserved without brecciation and redistribution by repeated impacts. The present crater population represents only the craters surviving {{at the end of}} the stage of highest meteoroid flux. As the impact flux decreased, cratered plains materials of possible volcanic origin were deposited in broad, low-lying areas, flooding, embaying, or partially burying preexisting craters. The youngest multiringed basins (Renoir, Rodin, and the unnamed basin at 15° S., 15°) formed near the end of this stage (about c3 time), as did the Caloris Basin on the opposite side of the planet (McCauley and others, 1981; Schaber andMcCauley, 1980). Craters that formed still later during the period of low impact rates are well preserved. During this late stage, smooth plains materials were deposited in basins, craters, and localised low areas and have low crater density. The youngest craters are sharp <b>rimmed</b> with bright rays.|$|E

500|$|Chaco Canyon {{lies within}} the San Juan Basin, atop the vast Colorado Plateau, {{surrounded}} by the Chuska Mountains to the west, the San Juan Mountains to the north, and the San Pedro Mountains to the east. Ancient Chacoans drew upon dense forests of oak, piñon, ponderosa pine, and juniper to obtain timber and other resources. The canyon itself, located within lowlands circumscribed by dune fields, ridges, and mountains, is aligned along a roughly northwest-to-southeast axis and is <b>rimmed</b> by flat massifs known as mesas.

500|$|The unusual pear-like {{shape of}} the coffin ray distinguishes it from all other rays. Its body is flabby, with two large, {{kidney-shaped}} electric organs visible {{on both sides of}} the head. The pectoral fins form a greatly enlarged disc about as wide as long, that is thick at the center and thin at the margins. The leading margin of the disc is straight to gently concave. The eyes are minute and can be elevated on short stalks. Close behind the eyes and slightly larger are the spiracles, which are <b>rimmed</b> by small [...] in some individuals. The nostrils are located just ahead of the mouth, and are connected to it by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The capacious mouth forms a very long, wide arch; the slender jaws can be distended dramatically, though are not particularly protrusible. Adults have over 60 rows of small teeth in either jaw; each tooth has three long cusps. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.|$|E
