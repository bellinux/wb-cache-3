40|$|The first {{realization}} of a designed, rather than natural, <b>biochemical</b> <b>filter</b> process is reported and analyzed as a promising network component {{for increasing the}} complexity of biomolecular logic systems. Key challenge in biochemical logic research has been achieving scalability for complex network designs. Various logic gates have been realized, but a "toolbox" of analog elements for interconnectivity and signal processing has remained elusive. Filters are important as network elements that allow control of noise in signal transmission and conversion. We report a versatile <b>biochemical</b> <b>filtering</b> mechanism designed to have sigmoidal response in combination with signal-conversion process. Horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chromogenic electron donor by hydrogen peroxide, was altered by adding ascorbate, allowing to selectively suppress the output signal, modifying the response from convex to sigmoidal. A kinetic model was developed for evaluation {{of the quality of}} filtering. The results offer improved capabilities for design of scalable biomolecular information processing systems.

40|$|We {{report the}} first study {{of a network of}} {{connected}} enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with added chemical and enzymatic processes that incorporate the recently developed <b>biochemical</b> <b>filtering</b> steps into the functioning of this biocatalytic cascade. New theoretical expressions are derived to allow simple, few-parameter modeling of network components concatenated in such cascades, both with and without filtering. The derived expressions are tested against experimental data obtained for the realized network's responses, measured optically, to variations of its input chemicals' concentrations with and without filtering processes. We also describe how the present modeling approach captures and explains several observations and features identified in earlier studies of enzymatic processes when they were considered as potential network components for multi-step information/signal processing systems.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Organisms use {{a variety}} of {{mechanisms}} to protect themselves against perturbations. For example, repair mechanisms fix damage, feedback loops keep homeostatic systems at their setpoints, and <b>biochemical</b> <b>filters</b> distinguish signal from noise. Such buffering mechanisms are often discussed in terms of robustness, which may be measured by reduced sensitivity of performance to perturbations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: I use a mathematical model to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of robustness in order to understand aspects of organismal design by natural selection. I focus on two characters: one character performs an adaptive task; the other character buffers the performance of the first character against perturbations. Increased perturbations favor enhanced buffering and robustness, which in turn decreases sensitivity and reduces the intensity of natural selection on the adaptive character. Reduced selective pressure on the adaptive character often leads to a less costly, lower performance trait. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The paradox of robustness arises from evolutionary dynamics: enhanced robustness causes an evolutionary reduction in the adaptive performance of the target character, leading to a degree of maladaptation compared to what could be achieved by natural selection in the absence of robustness mechanisms. Over evolutionary time, buffering traits may become layered on top of each other, while the underlying adaptive traits become replaced by cheaper, lower performance components. The paradox of robustness has widespread implications for understanding organismal design...|$|R
40|$|Aims:  To {{develop a}} {{computer}} processable algorithm, capable of running automated searches of routine data that flag miscoded and misclassified cases of diabetes for subsequent clinical review. Method: Anonymized computer {{data from the}} Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney Disease (QICKD) trial (n =  942   031) were analysed using a binary method to assess the accuracy of data on diabetes diagnosis. Diagnostic codes were processed and stratified into: definite, probable and possible diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by using prescription compatibility and temporally sequenced anthropomorphic and biochemical data. Bayesian false detection rate {{analysis was used to}} compare findings with those of an entirely independent and more complex manual sort of the first round QICKD study data (n =  760   588). Results:  The prevalence of definite diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes were 0. 32 % and 3. 27 % respectively when using the binary search method. Up to 35 % of Type 1 diabetes and 0. 1 % of Type 2 diabetes were miscoded or misclassified on the basis of age/BMI and coding. False detection rate analysis demonstrated a close correlation between the new method and the published hand-crafted sort. Both methods had the highest false detection rate values when coding, therapeutic, anthropomorphic and <b>biochemical</b> <b>filters</b> were used (up to 90 % for the new and 75 % for the hand-crafted search method). Conclusions:  A simple computerized algorithm achieves very similar results to more complex search strategies to identify miscoded and misclassified cases of both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. It {{has the potential to be}} used as an automated audit instrument to improve quality of diabetes diagnosis...|$|R

These hydrophilic filters {{are used in the}} medical, industrial, and <b>biochemical</b> fields to <b>filter</b> such elements as bacteria, viruses, proteins, particulates, drugs, and other contaminates. Common hydrophilic molecules include colloids, cotton, and cellulose (which cotton consists of). Unlike other membranes, hydrophilic membranes do not require pre-wetting: they can filter liquids in their dry state. Although most are used in low-heat filtration processes, many new hydrophilic membrane fabrics are used to filter hot liquids and fluids.|$|R
40|$|Information {{transmission}} {{in biological}} signaling circuits {{has often been}} described using the metaphor of a noise filter. Cellular systems need accurate, real-time data about their environmental conditions, but the biochemical reaction networks that propagate, amplify, and process signals work with noisy representations of that data. Biology must implement strategies that not only filter the noise, but also predict {{the current state of}} the environment based on information delayed due to the finite speed of chemical signaling. The idea of a <b>biochemical</b> noise <b>filter</b> is actually more than just a metaphor: we describe recent work that has made an explicit mathematical connection between signaling fidelity in cellular circuits and the classic theories of optimal noise filtering and prediction that began with Wiener, Kolmogorov, Shannon, and Bode. This theoretical framework provides a versatile tool, allowing us to derive analytical bounds on the maximum mutual information between the environmental signal and the real-time estimate constructed by the system. It helps us understand how the structure of a biological network, and the response times of its components, influences the accuracy of that estimate. The theory also provides insights into how evolution may have tuned enzyme kinetic parameters and populations to optimize information transfer. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Neuroinvasive {{microbes}} {{are capable}} of applying their influences on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) of the host followed by the involvement of central nervous system (CNS) by releasing extracellular metabolites that may cause alterations in the biochemical and neurophysiological environment. Consequently synaptic, neuroendocrine, peripheral immune, neuro-immune, and behavioural responses of the host facilitate the progression of infection. The present {{study was designed to}} extrapolate the effects of crude and purified extracellular peptides of neuropathogenic bacteria on behavioural responses and neurotransmission of Sprague Dawley (SD) models. Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and Neisseria meningitides (Nm) were isolated from the 92 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from mentally compromised patients. Bacillus cereus (Bc) and Clostridium tetani (Ct) were also included in the study. All bacterial strains were identified by the standard <b>biochemical</b> procedures. <b>Filter</b> sterilized cell free cultural broths (SCFBs) were prepared of different culture media. Behavioural study and neurotransmitter analysis were performed by giving an intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of each bacterial SCFB to four groups (Test; n = 7) of SD rats, whereas two groups each (Control; n = 7) received a nutrient broth (NB) control and sterile physiological saline control, respectively. Extracellular bioactive peptides of these bacteria were screened and purified. All experiments were repeated using purified bacterial peptides on SD rat cohorts. Our study indicated promising behavioural changes, including fever, swelling, and hind paw paralysis, in SD rat cohorts. Purified bacterial peptides of all bacteria {{used in the present study}} elicited marked changes in behaviour through the involvement of the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, these peptides of meningitis bacteria were found to potently affect the dopaminergic neurotransmission in CNS...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{last decade}} {{has contributed to}} our {{understanding}} of the three-dimensional structure of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV- 1) integrase (IN) and to the description of how the enzyme catalyzes the viral DNA integration into the host DNA. Recognition of the viral DNA termini by IN is sequence-specific, and that of the host DNA does not require particular sequence, although in physicochemical studies IN fails to discriminate between the two interactions. Here, such discrimination was allowed thanks to a model system using designed oligonucleotides and peptides as binding structures. Spectroscopic (circular dichroism, NMR, and fluorescence anisotropy) techniques and <b>biochemical</b> (enzymatic and <b>filter</b> binding) assays clearly indicated that the amphipathic helix alpha 4, located at the catalytic domain surface, is responsible for the specific high affinity binding of the enzyme to viral DNA. Analogues of the alpha 4 peptide having increased helicity and still bearing the biologically relevant lysines 156 and 159 on the DNA binding face, and oligonucleotides conserving an intact attachment site, are required to achieve high affinity complexes (Kd of 1. 5 nm). Data corroborate previous in vivo results obtained with mutated viruses...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{stabilisation}} ponds {{have been}} used for treating a great variety of wastewaters around the world for many decades. More advanced systems combine anaerobic or advanced facultative ponds with high rate algal ponds (HRAP) followed by a number of algae settling ponds and maturation ponds to achieve enhanced and more reliable removal of wastewater pollutants, while yielding possibly valuable by-products such as biogas and algal biomass. In recent years a growing number of scientists and engineers have proposed the use of HRAP treating domestic wastewater for carbon dioxide (CO 2) scrubbing from biogas and CO 2 sequestration. The experiments presented in this thesis sought to determine if the treatment performance of HRAP is affected by the addition of CO 2 and subsequent reduction of pond pH. Experiments with algae cultures grown on domestic wastewater in laboratory microcosms, outside mesocosms and outside pilot-scale HRAP were conducted. Carbon dioxide addition to algae wastewater cultures restricted the maximum pH level to ~ 8. Key wastewater quality parameters of CO 2 added cultures, were compared to control cultures without CO 2 addition. The wastewater quality parameters monitored include temperature, pH, and concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), ammoniacal-nitrogen (NH 4 -N), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), <b>filtered</b> <b>biochemical</b> oxygen demand (fBOD 5) and the faecal indicator Escherichia coli (E. coli). Carbon dioxide addition to algae wastewater cultures was found to promote algal growth and increased the TSS concentrations. Over 8 day culture length CO 2 addition in laboratory and outside batch experiments increased algal growth (indicated by TSS) by up to 76 % and 53 %, respectively. During semi-continuous outside experiments CO 2 addition increased algal growth by ~ 20 % in comparison to the control cultures. Despite enhancing algal growth (TSS), CO 2 addition appeared to have little effect on algae cell morphology, species composition and zooplankton activity in the algae wastewater cultures. Monitoring of the key nutrients NH 4 -N and DRP in cultures with and without CO 2 addition indicated that CO 2 addition can lead to an increase or a decrease in nutrient removal. Under culture conditions which allowed the control cultures to achieve high day-time pH levels CO 2 addition, and subsequent pH restriction, appeared to reduce overall nutrient removal. Only slight changes or an increase in nutrient removal as a result of CO 2 addition were observed under culture conditions which allowed only for a moderate or small elevation of the control culture pH. However, the increases in algal biomass, observed in all CO 2 added cultures indicate a greater potential for the reclamation of potentially valuable wastewater nutrients in the form of algal biomass. Monitoring of fBOD 5 levels during several outside experiments showed that CO 2 addition had no effect on the fBOD 5 removal by the algae wastewater cultures under those conditions. During several outside batch experiments (of up to 8 day culture length) the removal of the faecal indicator bacteria E. coli was monitored. It was shown that CO 2 addition reduced E. coli removal by 1. 4 to 4. 9 log units compared to control cultures. Basic modelling of carbon flows indicated that under New Zealand conditions the CO 2 volumes required for the changes described above would be available from the biogas produced in a wastewater pond system treating wastewater with a volatile solids (VS) concentration of ~ 500 mg/L. In systems treating weaker wastewaters additional CO 2 could be made available through the onsite combustion of biogas. In summary, the obtained results suggest that CO 2 addition to a field-scale HRAP could increase algal biomass growth year-round and slightly enhance nutrient removal during winter, but might reduce nutrient removal during summer, and reduce E. coli removal year-round, while having no effect on fBOD 5 removal. The reduction in nutrient treatment performance during summer, and especially the losses in E. coli removal resulting form CO 2 addition may require more sophisticated downstream processing of the HRAP effluent, like increase retention times in maturation ponds. Such remedial measures have to be evaluated on a case by case basis, and are dependent on the given regulations and discharge regimes of the system. This study indicates that in general HRAP can be employed for biogas purification and provide a useful sink for CO 2 rich waste streams. The beneficial effects of CO 2 addition to HRAP do not appear to allow for any design or management changes within the system, while it was indicated that most detrimental effects of CO 2 addition could be accommodated without major alternations, although in some cases significant remedial measures may be required for correcting the losses in disinfection and nutrient removal performance...|$|R
