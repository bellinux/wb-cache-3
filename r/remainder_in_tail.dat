In 1481, the manor of North Budbridge was settled on Elizabeth Bramshott for life, with <b>remainder</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> to William Bramshott, to Richard Hawles son of Elizabeth and to Agnes Hawles, daughter of Elizabeth. In 1510, George Bramshott sold the 'manor of North Budbridge' to Thomas Cooke. Sir John Oglander speaks of a Richard Cooke, captain of Sandham Castle, who lived at Budbridge, and 'came always to Arreton Church in his wrought velvet gown and 12 of his soldiers with halibardes wayghted upon him'. His estate fell to two daughters: Captain Bourly married one, and Hambrydge the other.|$|E
50|$|The {{wardship}} {{and marriage}} of Edward were granted {{to his mother}} in May 1533. However Robert Wroth in his will written in 1535 explicitly required that his ward Edward Lewknor should marry his daughter Dorothy: if either were to refuse or mislike the match, Dorothy {{was to have the}} financial benefit arising from the dissolution of the wardship. Edward and Dorothy were accordingly married. Dorothy's mother Jane was the daughter of Sir Thomas Hawte, who had died in 1505, and his wife Isabel (Elizabeth) Frowyk, sister of Sir Thomas Frowyk. The union reinforced existing ties of kinship among the numerous posterity of Sir Thomas Lewknor, and reinvested two Camoys lines. The manor of Kingston Buci was in 1537 settled upon Margaret Lewknor for life with an additional twenty years' tenure with <b>remainder</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> male to Anthony Lewknor. Anthony was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1542.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{probability}} {{models for}} BATSE gamma-ray burst (GRB) location errors are developed via a Bayesian {{analysis of the}} separations between BATSE GRB locations and locations obtained with the Interplanetary Network (IPN). Models are compared and their parameters estimated using 392 GRBs with single IPN annuli and 19 GRBs with intersecting IPN annuli. Most of the analysis is for the 4 Br BATSE catalog; earlier catalogs are also analyzed. The simplest model that provides a good representation of the error distribution has 78 % of the probability in a "core" term with a systematic error of 1. 85 deg and the <b>remainder</b> <b>in</b> an extended <b>tail</b> with a systematic error of 5. 1 deg, which implies a 68 % confidence radius for bursts with negligible statistical uncertainties of 2. 2 deg. There is evidence for a more complicated model in which the error distribution depends on the BATSE data type {{that was used to}} obtain the location. Bright bursts are typically located using the CONT data type, and according to the more complicated model, the 68 % confidence radius for CONT-located bursts with negligible statistical uncertainties is 2. 0 deg...|$|R

5000|$|... "in {{the reign}} of Ed. 4 ... the judges ... determined, that even a nominal and fictitious recompense, {{descending}} to the issue <b>in</b> <b>tail,</b> should be an effectual bar, {{not only to the}} issue <b>in</b> <b>tail,</b> but also to the persons entitled <b>in</b> <b>remainder</b> and reversion. This, though not expressly so decided, is the inference drawn from the determination of the judges in the celebrated case 12 Ed. 4, known as Taltarum's case. The case was thus:— J. S. being seised in fee of the lands in question, gave them to one William Smith, to hold to him, and the heirs of his body, by force of which he was seised. William Smith died, leaving Humphrey, his eldest son, on whom these lands descended, who entered and was seised [...] "per formam doni". Humphrey enfeoffed one Tregos of the said lands in fee, who rendered them to the said Humphrey and Jane, his wife, and to the heirs of their two bodies, <b>remainder</b> <b>in</b> fee to the said Humphrey, by force of which they were seised. Some time afterwards Jane died, on which Humphrey became sole seised of the lands <b>in</b> <b>tail,</b> and, being thus seised, one Taltarum brought a writ of right against Humphrey, and counted of his possession against him. Humphrey made defence, and vouched to warranty one R. King, who entered into the warranty, and joined the demise on the mere right. Afterwards R. King, the vouchee, made default, and departed in contempt of the court, in consequence of which final judgment was given, that the demandant, Taltarum, should recover the lands in question against Humphrey, and that Humphrey should recover lands of equal value of R. King, the vouchee. Humphrey afterwards died, without leaving heirs of his body; and the question was, whether Richard, the brother of Humphrey, who was heir <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> to those lands, should be barred by this recovery? It was determined by all the judges, that the estate tail was not barred by this recovery, because the tenant <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> was not seised of the estate tail {{at the time of the}} recovery, but of another estate; and as the recovery value goes according to the estate whereof the tenant was seised at the time of the recovery, and not in recompense of the estate he had not, the issue <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> could have no recompense in this case, and, therefore, was not barred by the recovery. It follows, therefore, that, if Humphrey had been seised of the estate tail of the gift of J. S. at the time of the recovery, Richard, who, be it observed, was tenant <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> <b>in</b> <b>remainder,</b> would have been barred" ...|$|R
