50|$|Before 2006, {{the road}} was gravel surfaced. The {{government}} of Uganda contracted for the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> to class II bitumen surface with shoulders, drainage channels, and culverts. The upgrade lasted until 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> is 54 km long and reaches Uttarakhand border from Bareilly. It would entail an {{investment}} of Rs 354 crore. It would also include construction of a flyover.|$|E
50|$|Following four fatal head-on {{collision}} accidents in 2008 alone, local residents have renewed their {{calls for the}} <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> to dual carriageway to provide a safe overtaking facility {{and deal with the}} capacity problems.|$|E
50|$|Illinois' Rte. 29 {{has long}} been slated {{as one of the}} <b>roads</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> as part of a Peoria-to-Chicago Highway. While there are no longer funded plans to build the expressway, there <b>are</b> plans <b>to</b> attempt to reduce {{congestion}} on Illinois 29 by widening it from a narrow two-lane highway to a four-lane divided highway.|$|R
50|$|The first {{bridge across}} the creek was opened in 1926. The road was then known as the Main Ocean <b>Road,</b> later <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> as the Pacific Highway and {{now known as the}} Gold Coast Highway.|$|R
50|$|A {{northbound}} off-ramp and southbound on-ramp will {{be provided}} at Groynes Road. The existing section of SH1 along Johns Road from The Groynes <b>to</b> Sawyers Arms <b>Road</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> a four lane median divided highway, with restricted access intersections, {{as part of the}} Christchurch Western Corridor programme. The contract <b>was</b> awarded <b>to</b> Fulton Hogan. Construction began on May 8, 2015 with the first sod turned by Minister of Transport Simon Bridges, and <b>is</b> expected <b>to</b> take about 3 years to complete.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Gateway WA project, which {{commenced}} in 2013 and {{was completed}} in March 2016, Leach Highway was upgraded to a controlled access four lane expressway from Orrong Road into the future consolidated Perth Airport complex. This will involve a full freeway to freeway interchange with Tonkin Highway and a compact diamond interchange with Abernethy Road. The ultimate design plan makes provision for this <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> to four lanes before 2031.|$|E
5000|$|The rise of {{motorized}} travel led the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> to automobile {{standards in}} the 1920s. To finance continued maintenance and road construction, the Alaska Road Commission instituted tolls for commercial vehicles in 1933 of up to $175 per trip, which were collected at the Tanana River ferry crossing at Big Delta. When the tolls were further increased in 1941 to boost business for the Alaska Railroad, disgruntled truckers nicknamed [...] "gypsies" [...] started a rogue ferry service in order to evade the toll.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, provincial MPP Floyd Laughren {{lobbied for}} the road to be fully paved, and secured a {{commitment}} from the Ministry of Transportation to do so shortly before the 1995 election; however, following the election the plan was cancelled by the new government of Mike Harris. Many municipal politicians and media commentators in the area have also lobbied for the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> to full provincial highway status, as the route would reduce {{the length of a}} trip from Sudbury to Wawa by fully 100 km compared to the current routing of Highway 17, and would provide an alternate route for traffic {{in the event of a}} closure of Highway 17's Montreal River Hill segment.|$|E
50|$|Kadakkad (Malayalam:കടയ്ക്കാട്, Tamil:கடக்காடு) is a Municipal {{division}} in Pandalam.

Pandalam-Pathanamthitta road is passing through here and Kadakkad-Kaipattoor <b>road</b> proposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> NH standards.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the strong}} current, fording of the Jökulsá á Dal isn't possible. The first bridge across {{it was built in}} 1625. The bridge on Iceland's Route 1 (Hringvegur) was built in 1994, when the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Egilsstaðir <b>was</b> <b>upgraded.</b> The {{previous}} bridge still stands, some distance downstream.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} road is gravel surfaced, pot-holed, and in poor general state. As {{far back}} as 2009, this road appears {{on the list of}} roads earmarked for upgrade from gravel surface to class II bitumen surface, with shoulders, drainage channels, and culverts. As at January 2016, this road remains on the list of <b>roads</b> yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded.</b>|$|R
50|$|During a {{campaign}} speech on 2 December 2015, President Yoweri Museveni stated that this road {{is among the}} next batch of <b>roads</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered for <b>upgrading</b> <b>to</b> grade II bitumen surface. No specific timetable has been set.|$|R
50|$|In Colbert County, Wilson Dam <b>Road</b> {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> a multi-lane highway. As of late 2008, {{the road}} is six lanes from the Tennessee River south through Muscle Shoals to Avalon Avenue. Plans call for the highway <b>to</b> eventually <b>be</b> four-laned from Avalon Avenue south to SR 20; however, those plans are on hold after landowners' disputed the State of Alabama's offers to purchase their land along the proposed right-of-way.|$|R
50|$|In 1871, the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Sassnitz <b>was</b> <b>upgraded,</b> in 1891 {{the town}} <b>was</b> {{connected}} <b>to</b> the railway network from Bergen; in 1878 {{there was a}} boat service to Stettin; in 1889 to the port in Sassnitz and, soon thereafter, sea links to Rønne (Bornholm), Trelleborg and Memel (now Klaipėda). The new links enabled the place to grow rapidly. The chalk industry expanded, fish and now fish products as well characterised working life, and tourism grew, even though other places with beaches were better developed.|$|R
25|$|In 1958, {{existing}} {{segments of}} the expressway were eligible for interstate highway funding. For a short time, the segment of highway between the Triborough Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> designated I-87 and continue north as the Major Deegan Expressway. By 1959, the I-278 designation <b>was</b> given <b>to</b> {{the entire length of}} the highway. Since the roadway <b>was</b> constructed prior <b>to</b> modern expressway standards, the <b>road</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> meet these standards. By the 1990s, a major multiyear project beginning in the 1980s brought upgrades to the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway.|$|R
50|$|Access <b>roads</b> <b>to</b> Roermond have <b>been</b> <b>upgraded</b> {{recently}} providing {{direct access}} to the Dutch and German highway network. From north to south the A73 (Maastricht-Nijmegen) passes east of the city, partly through tunnels. Eastwards the German A52 leads to Düsseldorf. Westbound the provincial road N280 leads towards Weert and connects to the A2 towards Eindhoven.|$|R
50|$|Most major {{junctions}} on Tiger Brennan Drive {{are controlled}} by traffic lights, however the <b>road</b> <b>is</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> freeway standard, with some suburban streets connected via limited access slip roads. Additionally, grade separated junctions are provided at Hidden Valley Road and the interchange with the Stuart Highway. Major roads intersecting Tiger Brennan Drive include Amy Johnson Avenue, Woolner Road, Berrimah Road and Tivendale Road. The road provides the primary access to Charles Darwin National Park.|$|R
50|$|In the 1968 Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS plan) the <b>road</b> <b>was</b> destined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> {{become the}} Port Freeway. The plan fell through, yet in 2005 the Government of South Australia {{announced}} a 600 m tunnel for South Road below Port Road and the railway line. The Torrens <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> River Torrens project <b>to</b> upgrade South <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> include a free-flowing {{road in a}} trench under Port Road and several other intersections started construction in 2015 and <b>is</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completed {{by the end of}} 2018.|$|R
50|$|Gilgit {{is located}} {{approximately}} 10 km from the Karakoram Highway (KKH). The roadway <b>is</b> being <b>upgraded</b> {{as part of}} the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The KKH connects Gilgit to Chilas, Dasu, Besham, Mansehra, Abbottabad and Islamabad in the south. Gilgit <b>is</b> connected <b>to</b> Karimabad (Hunza) and Sust in the north, with further connections to the Chinese cities of Tashkurgan, Upal and Kashgar in Xinjiang. Gilgit <b>is</b> also linked <b>to</b> Chitral in the west, and Skardu to the east. The <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Skardu will <b>be</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> a 4-lane <b>road</b> at a cost of $475 million.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, {{there were}} {{calls for the}} <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rebuilt and <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> dual {{carriageway}} standard {{in the vicinity of}} Kings Park. In 1940, a plan for construction of the second carriageway was announced by the King's Park Board, the Perth City Council and the Subiaco Municipal Council. The councils would be jointly responsible for the building of the road, with the King's Park Board responsible for the clearing of vegetation. The resumption of a strip of land {{along the edge of the}} park needed for the works was approved by an Act of Parliament.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a national road system was prioritized in 1948, where the {{construction of}} new roads were greatly accelerated. This led to a rise in automobile usage in Turkey. By the 1960s, traffic problems were becoming prevalent in large cities and capacity on intercity <b>roads</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>upgraded.</b> Plans <b>to</b> build new expressways were put into action in 1968, when construction of the Istanbul Inner Beltway was started. The Beltway, known as the O-1, was opened together with the Bosporus Bridge in 1973 with great fanfare. This became the first motorway <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built in Turkey. The Istanbul Beltway <b>was</b> then <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of a large expressway spanning from Edirne, in East Thrace, to İskenderun, on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Construction of this expressway first started in 1973 on a 14 km section between Pozantı and Akçatekir, on what would become the O-21. In 1975 {{construction of a}} 40 km section of the motorway from Gebze <b>to</b> Izmit <b>was</b> started. Due <b>to</b> financial problems during in the following years, construction of the two otoyols were greatly slowed down. It wasn't until 1984 that these two motorways <b>were</b> opened <b>to</b> traffic.|$|R
5000|$|The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway was {{initially}} planned in 1936 as the Brooklyn-Queens Connecting Highway, {{a link between}} the Gowanus Parkway and the Triborough Bridge. A part of the Brooklyn-Queens Connecting Highway, namely the Kosciuszko Bridge and the viaducts leading to the bridge, opened in 1939 between Meeker Avenue and NY 25. In 1940, Moses proposed an expressway between Queens and Brooklyn to relieve local streets of congestion from the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. [...] A section between the Williamsburg and Kosciuszko bridges opened on May 25, 1950; the road in its entirety was completed in 1964 at a cost of $137 million. Construction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, overseen by Moses, tore through many residential neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens instead of following the East River.In 1958, existing segments of the expressway were eligible for interstate highway funding.

500|$|Construction on the Patuxent Freeway resumed in 1981 in Howard County. [...] The freeway opened from Dorsey Run <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> US29 in 1985. The freeway was {{extended}} across the Middle Patuxent River to tie into the existing two-lane road near Cedar Lane by 1987. The new highway {{was extended}} east from Dorsey Run <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> {{just west of}} the BaltimoreWashington Parkway as a four-lane divided highway that same year. Sections of MD32's old alignment became part of MD 732. The highway from Dorsey Run <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> the Parkway <b>was</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> a freeway with the completion of interchanges at Dorsey Run Road and a ramp <b>to</b> Guilford <b>Road</b> in 1991. The interchange between MD32 and the BaltimoreWashington Parkway <b>was</b> <b>upgraded</b> <b>to</b> a full cloverleaf around 1993.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s {{access to a}} popular {{swimming}} hole known as [...] "Rawson's Pool" [...] which was located on private property downstream from the falls was stopped and the focus then shifted to Millaa Millaa Falls. The access <b>road</b> <b>to</b> the quarry <b>was</b> <b>upgraded</b> and extended down to near {{the base of the}} falls and a small car park constructed. Also at this time, public facilities <b>were</b> added <b>to</b> the site including toilets, shelter shed, and barbeques. Further safety and interpretive improvements were carried out in 2002. In 2003, the quarry was converted into a car park and a walking track and steps created which lead down to the falls viewing area. In 2005 a biological toilet facility, shelter shed and interpretive bus shelters were built.
