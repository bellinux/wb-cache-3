5000|$|During the Reformation proper, Catholic polemicists like John Eck {{accused the}} magisterial <b>Reformers</b> of Donatism, {{even though these}} <b>Reformers</b> had {{partially}} distanced themselves from Wycliffe's theology precisely to avoid such a charge. At the same time, magisterial <b>Reformers</b> like Ulrich Zwingli remained quite comfortable labeling as Donatist the more radical <b>Reformers,</b> such as the Anabaptists,; the Catholics, on the other hand, were portrayed in Reformation rhetoric as Pelagian, another early Christian heresy.|$|R
5|$|Cranmer's {{first contact}} with a Continental <b>reformer</b> was with Simon Grynaeus, a humanist based in Basel, Switzerland, and a {{follower}} of the Swiss reformers, Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius. In the summer of 1531, Grynaeus took an extended visit to England to offer himself as an intermediary between the king and the Continental reformers. He struck up a friendship with Cranmer and after his return to Basel, he wrote about Cranmer to the German <b>reformer</b> Martin Bucer in Strasbourg. Grynaeus' early contacts initiated Cranmer's eventual relationship with the Strasbourg and Swiss reformers.|$|E

50|$|By 1872, African American men in Lynchburg {{formed a}} {{local chapter of}} the Order of True <b>Reformers,</b> a fraternal organization. In 1893, they {{constructed}} the landmark building known as the True <b>Reformers</b> Hall (later known as the Harrison Theatre) in the 900 block of Fifth Street on the site of Pleasant Partin’s tobacco factory. Perhaps the first “mixed use” building on Fifth Street, the massive three-story edifice contained a large auditorium, offices, a lodge hall for the True <b>Reformers,</b> and several storefronts at street level. Perhaps as important for its cultural, social, and commercial contribution to the district as its architecture, the True <b>Reformers</b> Hall was demolished in 1985.|$|R

50|$|In Roemer's model, all {{political}} parties {{are assumed to}} consist of three types of factions—opportunists, militants, and <b>reformers.</b> Opportunists seek solely to maximize the party's vote share in an election; militants seek to announce (and implement) the preferred policy of the average party member; and <b>reformers</b> have an objective function that is a convex combination of the objective functions of the opportunists and militants. It {{has been shown that}} the existence of <b>reformers</b> has no effect on what policies the party announces.|$|R
40|$|For {{widespread}} use of fuel cells to power automobiles in the near future, {{it is necessary to}} convert gasoline or other transportation fuels to hydrogen on-board the vehicle. Partial oxidation reforming is particularly suited to this application as it eliminates the need for heat exchange at high temperatures. Such <b>reformers</b> offer rapid start and good dynamic performance. Lowering the temperature of the partial oxidation process, which requires the development of a suitable catalyst, can increase the reforming efficiency. Catalytic partial oxidation (or autothermal) <b>reformers</b> and non-catalytic partial oxidation <b>reformers</b> developed by various organizations are presently undergoing testing and demonstration. This paper summarizes the process chemistries as well as recent test data from several different <b>reformers</b> operating on gasoline, methanol, and other fuels...|$|R

5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} <b>reformer</b> distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich <b>reformer</b> Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Emma Jane Catherine Cobden (28 April 1851– 7 July 1947), {{known as}} Jane Cobden, was a British Liberal {{politician}} who {{was active in}} many radical causes.

Her election was controversial; legal challenges to her eligibility hampered and eventually prevented her from serving as a councillor.|$|E
50|$|Throughout The Short Chronicle Jeanne {{goes so far}} as to forsake {{marriage}} as heresy. She admits that she has witnessed the corruption of priests but assures the reader that those deeds would not go unpunished. At some points, she refuses to describe marriages performed by <b>Reformers</b> such as Farel to shield herself from its perversion. Eventually, <b>Reformers</b> would breach the convent and preach their ideas of marriage, attempting to force the nuns to take a spouse. At other points, she simply records those events by insulting the married couple and <b>Reformers</b> as “having a very bad reputation,” “bastard,” “wicked,” and “miserable.” Except in the case of Blaisine Varembert, the <b>Reformers</b> lost interest after the nuns refused to cooperate; they were given a safe departure from the city.|$|R
