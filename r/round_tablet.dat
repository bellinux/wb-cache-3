5000|$|There are 11 {{variants}} of Nurofen, {{all of which}} contain ibuprofen as an active ingredient. [...] The ibuprofen is variously formulated as the free acid, or the lysine salt. For oral formulations, i.e., taken by mouth, it {{is available in the}} conventional solid <b>round</b> <b>tablet,</b> a torpedo-shaped solid caplet, or may alternatively be {{in the form of a}} soft gel cap. It is also available as a topical gel, which is applied directly to the surface of the skin. [...] In some cases these are marketed as being useful for treating specific types of pain; such as back pain or period pain. The primary difference among the various formulations is speed and duration of ibuprofen absorption. According to the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA), the form of ibuprofen in 'Nurofen Tension Headache' (ibuprofen lysine) is absorbed nearly twice as fast as the form in 'Nurofen Period Pain' (ibuprofen free acid), with the former reaching peak blood concentrations in 38 minutes, compared to 80 minutes for the latter.|$|E

40|$|Pharmaceutical tablets {{have been}} the most {{dominant}} form for drug delivery {{and they need to be}} strong enough to withstand external stresses due to packaging and loading conditions before use. The strength of the produced tablets, which is characterised by their compressibility and compactibility, is usually deter-mined through a physical prototype. This process is sometimes quite expensive and time consuming. Therefore, simulating this process before hand can over-come this problem. A technique for shape modelling of pharmaceutical tablets based on the use of Partial Differential Equations is presented in this thesis. The volume and the sur-face area of the generated parametric tablet in various shapes have been es-timated numerically. This work also presents an extended formulation of the PDE method to a higher dimensional space by increasing the number of pa-rameters responsible for describing the surface in order to generate a solid tab-let. The shape and size of the generated solid tablets can be changed by ex-ploiting the analytic expressions relating the coefficients associated with the PDE method. The solution of the axisymmetric boundary value problem for a finite cylinder subject to a uniform axial load has been utilised in order to model a displace-ment component of a compressed PDE-based representation of a flat-faced <b>round</b> <b>tablet.</b> The simulation results, which are analysed using the Heckel model, show that the developed model is capable of predicting the compressibility of pharmaceutical powders since it fits the experimental data accurately. The opti-mal design of pharmaceutical tablets with particular volume and maximum strength has been obtained using an automatic design optimisation which is performed by combining the PDE method and a standard method for numerical optimisation...|$|E

40|$|The United States Pharmacopoeia/National Formulary (USP/NF) {{sets the}} {{standards}} and maintains monographs {{for the evaluation of}} tablets. These include Official Tests for uniformity of dosage units and disintegration testing, and Unofficial Tests for mechanical strength (hardness, crushing strength) and resistance to abrasion (friability). Current methods of analyzing tablet hardness involve the indirect measurement of the mechanical strength of a tablet through destructive and time-consuming procedures. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is gaining acceptance in the pharmaceutical industry as a non-invasive and non-destructive method for the analysis of finished dosage forms and raw materials. This investigation outlines methods used to evaluate various tablet parameters using NIRS and the achievement of successful predictions of those parameters. NIR models for tablet hardness and density were developed for 15 % and 20 % hydrochlorothiazide and 2 % and 6 % chlorpheniramine maleate in a 0. 5 % magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose matrix. NIR calibration models for tablet hardness were developed for flat-faced and convex <b>round</b> <b>tablets</b> containing 6 % chlorpheniramine maleate and 0. 5 % magnesium stearate, with either microcrystalline cellulose or dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate. Although the NIR response to changing hardness was the same regardless of the drug, separate models were required for tablets of different geometries. Scored tablets also required formulation specific calibrations for NIR hardness determination. Models for upper and lower compression forces were developed for flat-faced <b>round</b> <b>tablets</b> containing 6 % chlorpheniramine maleate and 0. 5 % magnesium stearate, with either microcrystalline cellulose or dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate. NIRS prediction of these parameters was at least as precise as the reference hardness test.

The methods described in this investigation may {{serve as a model for}} the future acceptance of NIRS as an alternative to current compendial methods for tablet hardness. ...|$|R

40|$|At present, {{the ease}} of {{subdivision}} of scored tablets is estimated in vivo. In order to replace such in vivo testing {{and to develop a}} surrogate test which uses in vitro techniques, the association between physical parameters of scored tablets and their ease of subdivision was studied. The physical properties of 23 brands of scored tablets of which their ease of subdivision in vivo was known were established. Statistical modeling using a logistic regression model was used to fit the data and estimate the contribution of each physical parameter to the goodness of the fit. For scored oblong tablets, the critical parameters for their ease of subdivision are: diameter; diameter/width ratio; depth of score line and resistance to crushing. Criteria for each of these parameters were derived. All criteria need to be complied with to guarantee sufficient ease of subdivision of scored oblong <b>tablets.</b> For scored <b>round</b> <b>tablets</b> the critical parameters, in decreasing order of importance, for their ease of subdivision, are: resistance to crushing, diameter, score mark (one- or two-sided), and shape (flat or biconvex). A five-parameter predictive model was developed, showing excellent discrimination. For development, the proposed surrogate tests are sufficiently reliable. For release testing and stability studies, resistance to crushing of a scored tablet is a reliable predictor of its ease of subdivision. © 2010 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{modified}} density-dependent Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) model to simulate the compaction behaviour of pharmaceutical powders. In particular, a nonlinear elasticity law is proposed to describe the observed nonlinear unloading behaviour following compaction. To extract the material parameters for the modified DPC model, a novel experimental calibration procedure is used, based on uniaxial single-ended compaction tests using an instrumented cylindrical die. The model is implemented in ABAQUS by writing a user subroutine, and a calibration process on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) Avicel PH 101 powders is detailed. The calibrated parameters are used for the manufacturing process simulation of two kinds of typical pharmaceutical tablets: the flat-face tablet and the concave tablet with single or double radius curvatures. The model developed can describe not only the compression and decompression phases, but also the ejection phase. The model is validated by comparing finite element simulations with experimental loading–unloading curves during the manufacture of 8 and 11 mm <b>round</b> <b>tablets</b> with flat-face (FF), single radius concave (SRC) and double radius concave (DRC) profiles. Moreover, the density and stress distributions during tabletting are used to analyse and explain the failure mechanism of tablets.

40|$|In this paper, the {{compaction}} of lactose powder, {{a typical}} pharmaceutical excipient, is modelled using finite element methods (FEM) {{in which the}} powder is represented by an elastic-plastic continuum medium following Drucker-Prager Cap yield criteria. In a recent numerical and experimental study by the present authors [1], {{it was found that}} cone-shaped capping failure occurs during compaction of flat-faced <b>round</b> <b>tablets,</b> and that cone capping is associated with intensive shear band formation during the decompression stage. It is hence instructive to explore possible approaches that might alleviate the propensity for capping. Two approaches to alleviate capping were therefore investigated through finite element analysis: (i) altering the surfaces of the punches, i. e. to make convex tablets using the same material properties, and (ii) altering the material properties, i. e. changing the elasticity of the materials. It was found that capping still takes place even if the surface curvatures of the punches are altered. These predictions have been confirmed by physical experiments using a compaction simulator. The experiments have also demonstrated convincingly that the capping occurs during decompression. The second approach has been investigated {{in such a way that}} only the Young’s modulus of the powder is changed to values twice and one-half that of lactose. Numerical results reveal that intensive shear bands are still developed during decompression even when the material properties are changed in this way. This implies that similar capping patterns are still possible for those materials. It is anticipated that the reason that some pharmaceutical excipients, such as microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH- 102), do not cap is because of the high bonding strength of such materials (which can be generally characterised by tensile strength) [2]...|$|R

40|$|Pharmaceutical tablets are {{the most}} popular dosage form for drug delivery. The tablets are {{generally}} produced by compacting dry powders. During pharmaceutical powder compaction, the tablets produced need to sustain their integrity during the process and have to be strong enough to sustain any possible load experienced during the post-compaction processes, such as coating, packing and handling. Hence, any defects, such as chipping, capping and laminating, are not tolerable during pharmaceutical powder compaction. However, such defects are common problems during the tabletting process. Therefore, understanding the failure mechanisms of these defects has attracted considerable attention. In this paper, only the mechanisms of capping were considered. Previous studies on capping during pharmaceutical powder compaction have been reviewed. Capping mechanisms have been further explored by conducting a combined experimental and computational study on pharmaceutical powder compaction. An instrumented hydraulic press (also known as compaction simulator) has been used to investigate the powder behaviour during the compaction. In addition, an instrumented die has also been used, which enable the material properties to be extracted for some real pharmaceutical powders. Close attentions have been paid to the occurrence of capping during tabletting. An X-ray Computed Microtomography system has also used to examine the internal failure patterns of the tablets produced using the compactions simulator. Furthermore, pharmaceutical powder compaction has also been analysed using finite element (FE) methods, in which the powder was modelled as an elastic-plastic continuum medium following Drucker-Prager-Cap yield criteria and the material properties were determined from the uniaxial compaction with an instrumented die. In both experimental and numerical studies, cylindrical tablets with different surface curvatures, including Flat-face <b>round</b> <b>tablets</b> and convex tablets, were considered. From the experimental observation, it is clear that different capping patterns were obtained for different shaped tablets: cone-shaped capping for flat-faced tablets and normal capping with essentially horizontal failure surface for convex tablets. It was also observed in the experiments that capping takes place at the early stage of decompression (unloading), i. e., the top punch begins to withdraw. Close examination of FEA results reveals that the capping is associated with an intensive shear band developed at the early stage of unloading for all cases considered. Therefore, the combined experimental and numerical studies demonstrated that the intensive shear bands developed at the early stage of unloading are responsible for the occurrence of capping...|$|R
