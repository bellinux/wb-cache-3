40|$|<b>Reconsultation</b> {{for lower}} {{respiratory}} tract infection (LRTI) is common in general practice, but those who reconsult rarely have more significant illness warranting antibiotics. Knowledge of factors that predict patient-initiated <b>reconsultation</b> may allow clinicians to address specific issues during the initial consultation that could reduce reconsultations. Thirty-three per cent of a cohort of 431 LRTI patients in a randomised controlled trial reconsulted.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are {{prescribed}} {{to the majority}} of patients consulting their general practitioner (GP) for lower respiratory tract illness (LRTi). A common reason for prescription is the belief that antibiotics reduce re-attendance; a motive supported by the high <b>reconsultation</b> rates for this largely self-limiting illness. Information about <b>reconsultation</b> following treatment of LRTi, and the factors that influence it, is scarce. AIM: To explore factors associated with <b>reconsultation</b> after initial management of LRTi. METHOD: Analysis of data collected prospectively during presentation of acute LRTi in primary care. RESULTS: Seventy-six per cent of 518 patients were prescribed antibiotics, and 30 % reconsulted for similar symptoms within the next 28 days (29 % of those who were given antibiotics and 33 % of those who were not). Forty-one per cent of patients who had seen their GP 15 or more times in the previous two years reconsulted, compared with 13 % of those who had made fewer than five visits. <b>Reconsultation</b> was more common in patients with a history of underlying disease (38. 6 % versus 24. 3 %) and in patients who reported dyspnoea (41. 5 % versus 24. 3 %). CONCLUSION: <b>Reconsultation</b> is common in acute LRTi and is associated with a heightened consulting habit prior to the index consultation, the presence of previous ill health, and dyspnoea. It appears not to be influenced by prescribing antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Current {{antimicrobial}} prescribing guidelines {{indicate that}} {{male and female}} patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated with same antimicrobials but for different durations. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the differences in reconsultations and antimicrobial prescribing for UTI for both males and females. A total of 2557 adult suspected UTI patients participating in the Supporting the Improvement and Management of Prescribing for urinary tract infection (SIMPle) study from 30 general practices were analyzed. An antimicrobial was prescribed significantly more often to females (77 %) than males (63 %). Nitrofurantoin was prescribed more often for females and less often for males (58 % vs. 41 %), while fluoroquinolones were more often prescribed for males (11 % vs. 3 %). Overall, <b>reconsultation</b> was 1. 4 times higher in females, and if the antimicrobial prescribed was not the recommended first-line (nitrofurantoin), <b>reconsultation</b> after empirical prescribing was significantly higher. However, the <b>reconsultation</b> was similar for males and females if the antimicrobial prescribed was first-line. When a urine culture was obtained, a positive culture was the most important predictor of <b>reconsultation</b> (Odds ratio 1. 8 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 5)). This suggests, when prescribing empirically, that male and female UTI patients should initially be treated with first-line antimicrobials (nitrofurantoin) with different durations (50 - 100 mg four times daily for three days in females and seven days for males). However, the consideration of a culture test before prescribing antimicrobials may improve outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Background. Unrealistic {{expectations}} about illness duration {{are likely to}} result in <b>reconsultations</b> and associated unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. An evidence-based account of clinical outcomes in patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) may help avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and <b>reconsultations.</b> Objectives. We aimed to identify clinical factors that may predict a prolonged clinical course or poor outcome for patients with LRTI and to provide an evidence-based account of duration of an LRTI and the impact of the illness on daily activities in patients consulting in general practice. Methods. A prospective cohort study of 247 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of LRTI presenting to 25 GPs in The Netherlands was carried out. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify baseline clinical and infection parameters that predicted the time taken for symptoms to resolve. A Kaplan–Meier curve was used to analyse time-to-symptom resolution. Clinical cure was recorded by the GPs at 28 days after the initial consultation and by the patients at 27 days. Results.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{strategies}} {{for advice on}} analgesia and steam inhalation for respiratory tract infections. Design: Open pragmatic parallel group factorial randomised controlled trial. Setting: Primary care in United Kingdom. Participants: Patients aged ? 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. Intervention: 889 patients were randomised with computer generated random numbers in pre-prepared sealed numbered envelopes to components of advice or comparator advice: advice on analgesia (take paracetamol, ibuprofen, or both), dosing of analgesia (take as required v regularly), and steam inhalation (no inhalation v steam inhalation). Outcomes: Primary: mean symptom severity on days 2 - 4; symptoms rated 0 (no problem) to 7 (as bad as it can be). Secondary: temperature, antibiotic use, <b>reconsultations.</b> Results: Neither advice on dosing nor on steam inhalation {{was significantly associated with}} changes in outcomes. Compared with paracetamol, symptom severity was little different with ibuprofen (adjusted difference 0. 04, 95 % confidence interval ? 0. 11 to 0. 19) or the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol (0. 11, ? 0. 04 to 0. 26). There was no evidence for selective benefit with ibuprofen among most subgroups defined before analysis (presence of otalgia; previous duration of symptoms; temperature > 37. 5 °C; severe symptoms), but there was evidence of reduced symptoms severity benefit in the subgroup with chest infections (ibuprofen ? 0. 40, ? 0. 78 to ? 0. 01; combination ? 0. 47; ? 0. 84 to ? 0. 10), equivalent to almost one in two symptoms rated as a slight rather than a moderately bad problem. Children might also benefit from treatment with ibuprofen (ibuprofen: ? 0. 47, ? 0. 76 to ? 0. 18; combination: ? 0. 04, ? 0. 31 to 0. 23). <b>Reconsultations</b> with new/unresolved symptoms or complications were documented in 12 % of those advised to take paracetamol, 20 % of those advised to take ibuprofen (adjusted risk ratio 1. 67, 1. 12 to 2. 38), and 17 % of those advised to take the combination (1. 49, 0. 98 to 2. 18). Mild thermal injury with steam was documented for four patients (2 %) who returned full diaries, but no <b>reconsultations</b> with scalding were documented. Conclusion: Overall advice to use steam inhalation, or ibuprofen rather than paracetamol, does not help control symptoms in patients with acute respiratory tract infections and must be balanced against the possible progression of symptoms during the next month for a minority of patients. Advice to use ibuprofen might help short term control of symptoms in those with chest infections and in children...|$|R

Patient-reported cure was much lower (51 %), and usual daily activities were limited in 73 % of the patients at baseline, and 19 % at final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The course of LRTI was generally uncomplicated, but the morbidity of this illness was considerable with a longer duration than generally reported, especially for patients with co-existent asthma.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} effects of {{antibiotic}} prescribing strategy on <b>reconsultation</b> in the year following presentation with acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Design of study: Balanced factorial randomised trial. Setting: Primary care. Method: Eight hundred and seven subjects, aged ? 3 years, had acute illness presenting with cough as the main symptom, plus at least one symptom or sign from sputum, chest pain, dyspnoea or wheeze. The subjects were randomised {{to one of three}} prescribing strategies (antibiotics, delayed antibiotic, no antibiotic) and a leaflet. Prior antibiotic use and <b>reconsultation</b> were assessed by medical record review. Results: Patients who had been prescribed antibiotic for cough in the previous 2 years {{were much more likely to}} reconsult (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 2. 55, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 62 to 4. 01) and use of a delayed prescription strategy is associated with reduced <b>reconsultation</b> in this group. In those with prior antibiotic exposure, there was a 34 % reduction in consultation rate in the no antibiotic group (IRR = 0. 66, 0. 30 to 1. 44, P = 0. 295) and a 78 % reduction for the delayed antibiotic group (IRR = 0. 22, 0. 10 to 0. 49, P< 0. 001) when compared with those given immediate antibiotics. This effect was not observed in patients who had not been prescribed antibiotics in the previous 2 years; there was no reduction in consultations in the no antibiotic group (IRR = 1. 23, 0. 79 to 1. 92, P = 0. 358) or the delayed antibiotic group (1. 19, 0. 78 to 1. 80, P = 0. 426). There was an increase in consultation rate with an information leaflet (IRR = 1. 27, 0. 86 to 1. 87, P = 0. 229). Past attendance with cough, or past attendance with other respiratory illness and smoking, also predicted <b>reconsultation</b> with cough. Conclusion: Delayed antibiotic prescribing for LRTI appears effective in modifying <b>reconsultation</b> behaviour, particularly in those with a prior history of antibiotic prescription for LRTI...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{direct and}} {{indirect}} evidence of active infection which may benefit from further antibiotics in adults who reconsult within 4 weeks of initial antibiotic management of acute lower respiratory tract infection in primary care. DESIGN: Observational study with a nested case-control group. SETTING: Two suburban general practices in Arnold, Nottingham, over 7 winter months. SUBJECTS: 367 adults aged 16 years and over fulfilling a definition of lower respiratory tract infection and treated with antibiotics. 74 (20 %) patients who reconsulted within 4 weeks for the same symptoms and 82 "control" patients who did not were investigated in detail at fallow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct and indirect evidence of active infection {{at the time of}} the <b>reconsultation</b> or the follow up visit with the research nurse for the controls. Investigations performed included sputum culture, pneumococcal antigen detection, serial serology for viral and atypical pathogens and C reactive protein, throat swabs for detecting viral and atypical pathogens by culture and polymerase chain reaction, and chest radiographs. RESULTS: Demographic and clinical features of the groups were similar. Two thirds of the 74 patients who reconsulted received another antibiotic because the general practitioner suspected continuing infection. Any evidence of infection warranting antibiotic treatment was uncommon at <b>reconsultation.</b> The findings for the two groups were similar for the occurrence of identified pathogens; chest x ray changes of infection (present in 13 %); and C reactive protein concentrations, which had nearly all fallen towards normal. Only three patients in the <b>reconsultation</b> group had concentrations > or = 40 mg/l. Pathogens identified at follow up in the 156 patients in both groups included ampicillin sensitive bacteria in six. Atypical infections diagnosed in 27 (Chlamydia pneumoniae in 22) and viral infections in 54 had probably been present at the initial presentation. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that active infection, which may benefit from further antibiotics, is uncommon in patients who reconsult after a lower respiratory tract infection, and a repeat antibiotic prescription should be the exception rather than the rule. Other factors, such as patients' perception of their illness, may be more important than disease and infection in their decision to reconsult...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and costs of a multifaceted flexible educational programme aimed at reducing antibiotic dispensing at the practice level in primary care. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with general practices as the unit of randomisation and analysis. Clinicians and researchers were blinded to group allocation until after randomisation. SETTING: 68 general practices with about 480, 000 patients in Wales, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 34 practices were randomised to receive the educational programme and 34 practices to be controls. 139 clinicians from the intervention practices and 124 from control practices had agreed to participate before randomisation. Practice level data covering all the clinicians in the 68 practices were analysed. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention practices followed the Stemming the Tide of Antibiotic Resistance (STAR) educational programme, which included a practice based seminar reflecting on the practices' own dispensing and resistance data, online educational elements, and practising consulting skills in routine care. Control practices provided usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total numbers of oral antibiotic items dispensed for all causes per 1000 practice patients in {{the year after the}} intervention, adjusted for the previous year's dispensing. Secondary outcomes included <b>reconsultations,</b> admissions to hospital for selected causes, and costs. RESULTS: The rate of oral antibiotic dispensing (items per 1000 registered patients) decreased by 14. 1 in the intervention group but increased by 12. 1 in the control group, a net difference of 26. 1. After adjustment for baseline dispensing rate, this amounted to a 4. 2 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 6 % to 7. 7 %) reduction in total oral antibiotic dispensing for the year in the intervention group relative to the control group (P= 0. 02). Reductions were found for all classes of antibiotics other than penicillinase-resistant penicillins but were largest and significant individually for phenoxymethylpenicillins (penicillin V) (7. 3 %, 0. 4 % to 13. 7 %) and macrolides (7. 7 %, 1. 1 % to 13. 8 %). There {{were no significant differences between}} intervention and control practices in the number of admissions to hospital or in <b>reconsultations</b> for a respiratory tract infection within seven days of an index consultation. The mean cost of the programme was £ 2923 (€ 3491, $ 4572) per practice (SD £ 1187). There was a 5. 5 % reduction in the cost of dispensed antibiotics in the intervention group compared with the control group (- 0. 4 % to 11. 4 %), equivalent to a reduction of about £ 830 a year for an average intervention practice.

40|$|Objectives Antibiotics are {{too often}} {{prescribed}} in childhood respiratory tract infection (RTI), despite limited effectiveness, potential side-effects, and bacterial resistance. We aimed to reduce antibiotic prescribing for children with RTI by online training for general practitioners (GP) and information for parents. Methods A pragmatic cluster randomised, controlled trial in primary care. The intervention consisted of an online training for GPs and an information booklet for parents. The primary outcome was the antibiotic prescription rate for children presenting with RTI symptoms, as registered by GPs. Secondary outcomes were number of <b>reconsultations</b> within the same disease episode, consultations for new episodes, hospital referrals and pharmacy dispensed antibiotic courses for children. Results After randomisation, GPs of in total 32 general practices registered 1009 consultations. An antibiotic was prescribed in 21 % of consultations in the intervention group, compared to 33 % in the usual care group, controlled for baseline prescribing (RR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 46 - 0. 91). The probability of reconsulting during the same RTI episode {{did not differ significantly}} between the intervention and control group, nor did the numbers of consultations for new episodes and hospital referrals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Data from trials {{suggest that}} {{antibiotics}} {{reduce the risk}} of complications of sore throat by at least 50 %, but few trials for complications have been done in modern settings, and datasets of delayed antibiotic prescription are underpowered. Observational evidence is important in view of poor compliance with antibiotic treatment outside trials, but no prospective observational cohort studies have been done to date. METHODS: We generated a large prospective cohort from the DESCARTE study, and the PRISM component of DESCARTE, of 12, 829 adults presenting with sore throat (≤ 2 weeks duration) in primary care. Our follow-up of the cohort was based on a detailed and structured review of routine medical records, and analysis of the comparison of three antibiotic prescription strategies (no antibiotic prescription, immediate antibiotic prescription, and delayed antibiotic prescription) to control for the propensity to prescribe antibiotics. Information about antibiotic prescription was recorded in 12, 677 individuals (4805 prescribed no antibiotics, 6088 prescribed antibiotics immediately, and 1784 prescribed delayed antibiotics). We documented by review of patients' notes (n= 11, 950) the development of suppurative complications (eg, quinsy, impetigo and cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis) or <b>reconsultation</b> with new or non-resolving symptoms). We used multivariate analysis to control for variables significantly related to the propensity to prescribe antibiotics and for clustering by general practitioner. FINDINGS: 164 (1. 4 %) of the 11, 950 patients with information available developed complications; otitis media and sinusitis were the most common complications (101 patients [62 %]). Compared with no antibiotic prescription, immediate antibiotic prescription was associated with fewer complications (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 43 - 0. 91, estimated number needed to treat [NNT 193) as was delayed prescription of antibiotics (0. 58, 0. 34 - 0. 98; NNT 174). 1787 of the 11, 950 patients (15 %) reconsulted with new or non-resolving symptoms; the risk of <b>reconsultation</b> was also reduced by immediate (0. 83, 0. 73 - 0. 94; NNT 40) or delayed antibiotics (0. 61, 0. 50 - 0. 74; NNT 18). INTERPRETATION: Suppurative complications are not common in primary care and most are not serious.

40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) prescribe antibiotics to {{three-quarters of}} patients who consult with a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTi). In spite of this management, around a quarter of patients reconsult for the same symptoms within a month. AIM: To investigate the impact of providing a simple leaflet regarding {{the natural history of}} lower respiratory tract symptoms on <b>reconsultation</b> rates for previously well adults presenting to their GP with an LRTi. METHOD: Seventy-six GPs studied 1014 previously well adults presenting with an illness defined as an LRTi. Management was left to the GP's discretion. Half of the patients were randomly allocated to receive an information leaflet {{at the end of the}} consultation, blinded from the GP. The endpoint was <b>reconsultation</b> for the same symptoms within one month. RESULTS: Follow-up data was available for 1006 adults, of whom 182 (18 %) reconsulted. Fewer patients who received the leaflet (75 / 505; 14. 9 %) returned to the surgery compared with those who did not (107 / 501; 21. 4 %; P = 0. 007). The same benefit was found for the 723 (72 %) adults treated initially with antibiotics; 16 % (60 / 369) in the leaflet group returned compared with 23 % (81 / 354) in the no leaflet group (P = 0. 02).

40|$|Background: Non-adherence to acute {{antibiotic}} prescriptions {{is poorly}} described and may impact on clinical outcomes, healthcare costs, {{and interpretation of}} research. It also results in leftover antibiotics {{that could be used}} inappropriately. Aim: To describe adherence to antibiotics prescribed for adults presenting with acute cough in primary care, factors associated with non-adherence, and associated recovery. Design and setting: Prospective observational cohort study in general practices in 14 European primary care networks. Method: GPs recorded patient characteristics and prescribing decisions for adults with acute cough or clinical presentation suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients recorded antibiotic consumption and daily symptoms over 28 days. Rates of adherence to prescribed antibiotics were assessed, and factors associated with non-adherence were identified using logistic regression. Recovery was compared using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Of 2520 patients prescribed immediate or no antibiotics at the index consultation, 282 (11. 2 %) took an antibiotic during the follow-up period that was not prescribed for them at the index consultation. Of these, 38. 1 % had no <b>reconsultations</b> during this period.

40|$|Introduction While most {{respiratory}} tract infections (RTIs) will resolve without treatment, many children will receive antibiotics and some will develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation. There have been calls for evidence to reduce uncertainty regarding {{the identification of}} children who will and will not benefit from antibiotics. The aim of this feasibility trial is to test recruitment and the acceptance of a complex behavioural intervention designed to reduce antibiotic prescribing, and to inform how best to conduct a larger trial. Methods and analysis The CHICO (Children's Cough) trial is a single-centre feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a web-based, within-consultation, behavioural intervention with usual care for children presenting to general practitioner practices with RTI and acute cough. The trial aims to recruit at least 300 children between October 2014 and April 2015, in a single area in South West England. Following informed consent, demographic information will be recorded, and symptoms and signs measured. Parents/carers of recruited children will be followed up {{on a weekly basis}} to establish symptom duration, resource use and cost of the illness to the parent until the child's cough has resolved or up to 8  weeks, whichever occurs earlier. A review of medical notes, including clinical history, primary care <b>reconsultations</b> and hospitalisations will be undertaken 2  months after recruitment. The trial feasibility will be assessed by: determining acceptability of the intervention to clinicians and parent/carers; quantifying differential recruitment and follow-up; determining intervention fidelity; the success in gathering the data necessary to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis; and collecting data about antibiotic prescribing rates to inform the sample size needed for a fully powered RCT. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the North West—Haydock Research Ethics Committee, UK (reference number: 14 /NW/ 1034). The findings from this feasibility trial will be disseminated through research conferences and peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number ISRCTN 23547970...|$|R
40|$|This thesis, of {{the natural}} history of acute cough in pre-school children, reports two studies: a {{systematic}} review and a prospective cohort study. The systematic review includes data synthesised from eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics. The patients included in these RCTs appear to be an unrepresentative, selected population. The studies in the review also used different measures and definitions of cough duration, making it difficult to estimate the usual duration of the illness. Therefore, the cohort study determines the prognostic implications of the symptom cough in terms of cough duration, <b>reconsultations</b> and complications in an unselected cohort of pre-school children presenting to primary care. Aims of the thesis: 1. To describe cough duration in terms of the different proportion of children recovering through time. 2. To compare parent and clinician expectation of cough duration with actual cough duration. 3. To identify the clinical factors associated with prolonged cough. 4. To describe reconstruction and antibiotic prescribing rates ad the factors associated with reconstructions. 5. To document the complication rate and derive a clinical prediction rule for complications. 6. To examine the inter-observer agreement between an unstandardised and standardised clinical assessment. Chapter 2 is divided into two parts. First, the general literature review I describe the physiology, aetiology, classification and epidemiology of cough, I review the reasons for parental consultation and the management of cough in primary care, I discuss the development of clinical prediction rates, and their potential role in the management of cough and I present an overview of outcome measures for respiratory tract infections in pre-school children.

40|$|Background Pharmacy-based minor ailment schemes (PMASs) {{have been}} {{introduced}} throughout the UK to reduce the burden of minor ailments on high-cost settings, including general practice and emergency departments. Aim This study aimed to explore the effect of PMASs on patient health- and cost-related outcomes; {{and their impact on}} general practices. Design and setting Community pharmacy-based systematic review. Method Standard systematic review methods were used, including searches of electronic databases, and grey literature from 2001 to 2011, imposing no restrictions on language or study design. Reporting was conducted in the form recommended in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and checklist. Results Thirty-one evaluations were included from 3308 titles identified. <b>Reconsultation</b> rates in general practice, following an index consultation with a PMAS, ranged from 2. 4 % to 23. 4 %. The proportion of patients reporting complete resolution of symptoms after an index PMAS consultation ranged from 68 % to 94 %. No study included a full economic evaluation. The mean cost per PMAS consultation ranged from £ 1. 44 to £ 15. 90. The total number of consultations and prescribing for minor ailments at general practices often declined following the introduction of PMAS. Conclusion Low <b>reconsultation</b> and high symptom-resolution rates suggest that minor ailments are being dealt with appropriately by PMASs. PMAS consultations are less expensive than consultations with GPs. The extent to which these schemes shift demand for management of minor ailments away from high-cost settings has not been fully determined. This evidence suggests that PMASs provide a suitable alternative to general practice consultations. Evidence from economic evaluations is needed to inform the future delivery of PMASs...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} whether {{elements of}} a structured history and examination predict adverse outcome of acute sore throat. DESIGN: Prospective clinical cohort. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: 14, 610 adults with acute sore throat (≤ 2 weeks' duration). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Common suppurative complications (quinsy or peritonsillar abscess, otitis media, sinusitis, impetigo or cellulitis) and <b>reconsultation</b> with new or unresolving symptoms within one month. RESULTS: Complications were assessed reliably (inter-rater κ= 0. 95). 1. 3 % (177 / 13, 445) of participants developed complications overall and 14. 2 % (1889 / 13, 288) reconsulted with new or unresolving symptoms. Independent predictors of complications were severe tonsillar inflammation (documented among 13. 0 % (1652 / 12, 717); odds ratio 1. 92, 95 % confidence interval 1. 28 to 2. 89) and severe earache (5 % (667 / 13, 323); 3. 02, 1. 91 to 4. 76), but the model including both variables had modest prognostic utility (bootstrapped area under the receiver operator curve 0. 61, 0. 57 to 0. 65), and 70 % of complications (124 / 177) occurred when neither was present. Clinical prediction rules for bacterial infection (Centor criteria and FeverPAIN) also predicted complications, but predictive values were also poor and most complications occurred with low scores (67 % (118 / 175) scoring ≤ 2 for Centor; 126 / 173 (73 %) scoring ≤ 2 for FeverPAIN). Previous medical problems, sex, temperature, and muscle aches were independently but weakly associated with <b>reconsultation</b> with new or unresolving symptoms. CONCLUSION: Important suppurative complications after an episode of acute sore throat in primary care are uncommon. History and examination and scores to predict bacterial infection cannot usefully identify those who will develop complications. Clinicians will need to rely on strategies such as safety netting or delayed prescription in managing the uncertainty and low risk of complications...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} clinical scores that predict streptococcal infection or rapid streptococcal antigen detection tests compared with delayed antibiotic prescribing. DESIGN: Open adaptive pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care in United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Patients aged ? 3 with acute sore throat. INTERVENTION: An internet programme randomised patients to targeted antibiotic use according to: delayed antibiotics (the comparator group for analyses), clinical score, or antigen test used according to clinical score. During the trial a preliminary streptococcal score (score 1, n= 1129) was replaced by a more consistent score (score 2, n= 631; features: fever during previous 24 hours; purulence; attends rapidly (within three days after onset of symptoms); inflamed tonsils; no cough/coryza (acronym FeverPAIN). OUTCOMES: Symptom severity reported by patients on a 7 point Likert scale (mean severity of sore throat/difficulty swallowing for days two to four after the consultation (primary outcome)), duration of symptoms, use of antibiotics. RESULTS: For score 1 {{there were no significant differences}} between groups. For score 2, symptom severity was documented in 80 % (168 / 207 (81 %) in delayed antibiotics group; 168 / 211 (80 %) in clinical score group; 166 / 213 (78 %) in antigen test group). Reported severity of symptoms was lower in the clinical score group (- 0. 33, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 64 to - 0. 02; P= 0. 04), equivalent to one in three rating sore throat a slight versus moderate problem, with a similar reduction for the antigen test group (- 0. 30, - 0. 61 to - 0. 00; P= 0. 05). Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse resolved significantly faster in the clinical score group (hazard ratio 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval 1. 03 to 1. 63) but not the antigen test group (1. 11, 0. 88 to 1. 40). In the delayed antibiotics group, 75 / 164 (46 %) used antibiotics. Use of antibiotics in the clinical score group (60 / 161) was 29 % lower (adjusted risk ratio 0. 71, 95 % confidence interval 0. 50 to 0. 95; P= 0. 02) and in the antigen test group (58 / 164) was 27 % lower (0. 73, 0. 52 to 0. 98; P= 0. 03). There were no significant differences in complications or <b>reconsultations.</b> CONCLUSION: Targeted use of antibiotics for acute sore throat with a clinical score improves reported symptoms and reduces antibiotic use.

40|$|Background: {{antibiotics}} {{are still}} prescribed to most patients attending primary care with acute sore throat, despite {{evidence that there}} is modest benefit overall from antibiotics. Targeting antibiotics using either clinical scoring methods or rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) could help. However, there is debate about which groups of streptococci are important (particularly Lancefield groups C and G), and uncertainty about the variables that most clearly predict the presence of streptococci. Objective: this study aimed to compare clinical scores or RADTs with delayed antibiotic prescribing. Design: the study comprised a RADT in vitro study; two diagnostic cohorts to develop streptococcal scores (score 1; score 2); and, finally, an open pragmatic randomised controlled trial with nested qualitative and cost-effectiveness studies. Setting: the setting was UK primary care general practices. Participants: participants were patients aged ? 3 years with acute sore throat. Interventions: an internet program randomised patients to targeted antibiotic use according to (1) delayed antibiotics (control group), (2) clinical score or (3) RADT used according to clinical score. Main outcome measures: the main outcome measures were self-reported antibiotic use and symptom duration and severity on seven-point Likert scales (primary outcome: mean sore throat/difficulty swallowing score in the first 2 – 4 days). Results: the IMI TestPack Plus Strep A (Inverness Medical, Bedford, UK) was sensitive, specific and easy to use. Lancefield group A/C/G streptococci were found in 40 % of cohort 2 and 34 % of cohort 1. A five-point score predicting the presence of A/C/G streptococci [FeverPAIN: Fever; Purulence; Attend rapidly (? 3 days); severe Inflammation; and No cough or coryza] had moderate predictive value (bootstrapped estimates of area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0. 73 cohort 1, 0. 71 cohort 2) and identified {{a substantial number of}} participants at low risk of streptococcal infection. In total, 38 % of cohort 1 and 36 % of cohort 2 scored ? 1 for FeverPAIN, associated with streptococcal percentages of 13 % and 18 %, respectively. In an adaptive trial design, the preliminary score (score 1; n = 1129) was replaced by FeverPAIN (n = 631). For score 1, {{there were no significant differences}} between groups. For FeverPAIN, symptom severity was documented in 80 % of patients, and was lower in the clinical score group than in the delayed prescribing group (– 0. 33; 95 % confidence interval – 0. 64 to – 0. 02; p = 0. 039; equivalent to one in three rating sore throat a slight rather than moderately bad problem), and a similar reduction was observed for the RADT group (– 0. 30; – 0. 61 to 0. 00; p = 0. 053). Moderately bad or worse symptoms resolved significantly faster (30 %) in the clinical score group (hazard ratio 1. 30; 1. 03 to 1. 63) but not the RADT group (1. 11; 0. 88 to 1. 40). In the delayed group, 75 / 164 (46 %) used antibiotics, and 29 % fewer used antibiotics in the clinical score group (risk ratio 0. 71; 0. 50 to 0. 95; p = 0. 018) and 27 % fewer in the RADT group (0. 73; 0. 52 to 0. 98; p = 0. 033). No significant differences in complications or <b>reconsultations</b> were found. The clinical score group dominated both other groups for both the cost/quality-adjusted life-years and cost/change in symptom severity analyses, being both less costly and more effective, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated the clinical score to be the most likely to be cost-effective from an NHS perspective. Patients were positive about RADTs. Health professionals’ concerns about test validity, the time the test took and medicalising self-limiting illness lessened after using the tests. For both RADTs and clinical scores, there were tensions with established clinical experience. Conclusions: targeting antibiotics using a clinical score (FeverPAIN) efficiently improves symptoms and reduces antibiotic use. RADTs used in combination with FeverPAIN provide no clear advantages over FeverPAIN alone, and RADTs are unlikely to be incorporated into practice until health professionals’ concerns are met and they have experience of using them. Clinical scores also face barriers related to clinicians’ perceptions of their utility in the face of experience. This study has demonstrated the limitation of using one data set to develop a clinical score. FeverPAIN, derived from two data sets, appears to be valid and its use improves outcomes, but diagnostic studies to confirm the validity of FeverPAIN in other data sets and settings are needed. Experienced clinicians need to identify barriers to the use of clinical scoring methods. Implementation studies that address perceived barriers in the use of FeverPAIN are needed.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether patients with an uncomplicated community-acquired {{urinary tract infection}} (UTI) and an isolate resistant to trimethoprim had worse clinical outcomes following empirical treatment with trimethoprim 200 mg twice daily for 3 days than did those with a susceptible isolate. Patients and methods: This was a prospective cohort study of clinical outcome. We enrolled 497 women (= 18 – 70 years) presenting to general practitioner surgeries in Norwich and Gloucester {{with at least two}} symptoms of acute (< 7 days) uncomplicated UTI. Significant bacteriuria was defined as ≥ 104 cfu/mL from a mid-stream urine (MSU). Results: Of enrolled patients 75 % (334 / 448) had significant bacteriuria, and trimethoprim resistance was present in 13. 9 % (44 / 317) of isolates. Patients with resistant isolates had a longer median time to symptom resolution (7 versus 4 days, P = 0. 0002), greater <b>reconsultation</b> to the practice (39 % versus 6 % in first week, P < 0. 0001), more subsequent antibiotics (36 % versus 4 % in first week, P < 0. 0001) and higher rates of significant bacteriuria at 1 month (42 % versus 20 % with susceptible isolate, P = 0. 04). Half of patients reconsulting in the first week had a resistant organism. Conclusions: Patients with uncomplicated UTI caused by trimethoprim-resistant organisms had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those with trimethoprim-susceptible organisms. Nevertheless, trimethoprim resistance was rarer than predicted from routine laboratory submissions and we calculate that 23 women require microbiological investigation to prevent one <b>reconsultation</b> arising from resistance-based treatment failure. We therefore suggest empirical antibiotic treatment in acute, uncomplicated UTIs. If patients reconsult in the first week, we suggest a change of antibiotic treatment with urine culture and susceptibility testing then done. More generally, laboratory resources should concentrate on resistance surveillance to inform empirical antibiotic choice...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Practice {{nurses are}} {{increasingly}} {{involved in the}} management of minor illnesses in primary care. However, there has been little work published that evaluates the quality of the service they offer to patients. In our practice (semi-rural, 14, 000 patients) a nursing triage system for minor illnesses has been established since 1992. AIM: To compare the quality of management of sore throats by practice nurses and general practitioners (GPs) in a routine nursing triage system. METHOD: An observational study assessing all patients over the age of two years presenting over a six-month period (February-August 1997) to either the practice nurse or GP with a sore throat as the chief presenting complaint. Patients were followed up at five to seven days by a researcher and recovery rates, analgesic requirements, <b>reconsultation</b> rates, and satisfaction rates were recorded. Patients who were still symptomatic at five to seven days were followed up again at 28 days and outcomes recorded. RESULTS: A total of 44 % of patients consulted the practice nurse and 56 % consulted the GP. Severity of presenting illness was similar in the two groups. The number of patients whose sore throats had settled, <b>reconsultation</b> rates, antibiotic prescription, and dissatisfaction rates were the same for both groups. However, the patients consulting the nurse had a more favourable outcome on indices such as patients' perception of being back to normal health (64 % versus 53 %) and median number of days for the sore throat to settle (four versus five). Nurses tended to see younger patients (mean age = 22. 5 years versus 28. 3 years) and more patients seeing the practice nurse recalled receiving advice about home remedies (76 % versus 54 %).

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{whether an}} interactive booklet on respiratory tract infections in children reduces <b>reconsultation</b> {{for the same}} illness episode, reduces antibiotic use, and affects future consulting intentions, while maintaining parental satisfaction with care. Design: Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: 61 general practices in Wales and England. Participants: 558 children (6 months to 14 years) presenting to primary care with an acute respiratory tract infection (7 days or less). Children with suspected pneumonia, asthma or a serious concomitant illness, or needing immediate hospital admission were excluded. Three withdrew and 27 were lost to follow-up, leaving 528 (94. 6 %) with main outcome data. Interventions: Clinicians in the intervention group were trained {{in the use of}} an interactive booklet on respiratory tract infections and asked to use the booklet during consultations with recruited patients (and provide it as a take home resource). Clinicians in the control group conducted their consultations as usual. Main outcome measures: The proportion of children who attended a face-to-face consultation about the same illness during the two week follow-up period. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic prescribing, antibiotic consumption, future consulting intentions, and parental satisfaction, reassurance, and enablement. Results: <b>Reconsultation</b> occurred in 12. 9 % of children in the intervention group and 16. 2 % in the control group (absolute risk reduction 3. 3 %, 95 % confidence interval - 2. 7 % to 9. 3 %, P= 0. 29). Using multilevel modelling (at the practice and individual level) to account for clustering, no significant difference in reconsulting was noted (odds ratio 0. 75; 0. 41 to 1. 38). Antibiotics were prescribed at the index consultation to 19. 5 % of children in the intervention group and 40. 8 % of children in the control group (absolute risk reduction 21. 3 %, 95 % confidence interval 13. 7 to 28. 9), P< 0. 001). A significant difference was still present after adjusting for clustering (odds ratio 0. 29; 0. 14 to 0. 60).

40|$|Abstract Background With {{an average}} {{prescription}} rate of 50 %, in German primary care antibiotics {{are still too}} frequently prescribed for respiratory tract infections. The over-prescription of antibiotics is often explained by perceived patient pressure and fears of a complicated disease progression. The CHANGE- 2 trial will test the effectiveness of two interventions to reduce the rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for adults and children suffering from respiratory tract infections in German primary care. Methods/Design The study is a three-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial that measures antibiotic prescription rates over three successive winter periods and reverts to administrative data of the German statutory health insurance company AOK. More than 30, 000 patients in two regions of Germany, who visit their general practitioner or pediatrician for respiratory tract infections will be included. Interventions are: A) communication training for general practitioners and pediatricians and B) intervention A plus point-of-care testing. Both interventions are tested against usual care. Outcome measure is the physicians’ antibiotic prescription rate for respiratory tract infections derived from data of the health insurance company AOK. Secondary outcomes include <b>reconsultation</b> rate, complications, and hospital admissions. Discussion Major aim {{of the study is}} to improve the process of decision-making and to ensure that patients who are likely to benefit from antibiotics are treated accordingly. Our approach is simple to implement and might be used rapidly among general practitioners and pediatricians.

Methods The multicenter randomized controlled trial focused on adults with LRTI not suspected for pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive either antibiotic (amoxicillin 1 g) or placebo three times daily for seven consecutive days using computer-generated random numbers (follow-up 28 days). In this secondary analysis of the trial, symptom duration (primary outcome), symptom severity (scored 0 - 6), and illness deterioration (<b>reconsultation</b> with new or worsening symptoms, or hospital admission) were analyzed in pre-specified subgroups using regression models. Subgroups of interest were patients with a (strictly) bacterial, (strictly) viral or combined infection and patients with elevated values of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein or blood urea nitrogen. Results 2058 patients (amoxicillin n= 1036; placebo n= 1022) were randomized. Treatment did not affect symptom duration (n= 1793). Patients from whom a bacterial pathogen only was isolated (n = 207) benefited from amoxicillin in that symptom severity (n= 804) was reduced by 0. 26 points (95 % CI: [- 0. 48; - 0. 03]). The odds of illness deterioration (n= 2024) was 0. 24 (95 % CI: [0. 11; 0. 53]) times lower from treatment with amoxicillin when both a bacterial and a viral pathogen were isolated (combined infection; n= 198). Conclusions Amoxicillin may {{reduce the risk of}} illness deterioration in patients with a combined bacterial and viral infection.

Diagnostic uncertainty and patient expectations and worries are major drivers of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. A C-reactive protein (CRP) {{point of care test}} may help GPs to better guide antibiotic treatment by ruling out pneumonia in cases of low test results. Alternatively, enhanced communication skills training to help clinicians address patients' expectations and worries could lead to a decrease in antibiotic prescribing, without compromising clinical recovery, while enhancing patient enablement. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the design and methods of a study to assess two interventions for improving LRTI management in general practice. Methods/Design This cluster randomised controlled, factorial trial will introduce two interventions in general practice; point of care CRP testing and enhanced communication skills training for LRTI. Twenty general practices with two participating GPs per practice will recruit 400 patients with LRTI during two winter periods. Patients will be followed up for at least 28 days. The primary outcome measure is the antibiotic prescribing rate. Secondary outcomes are clinical recovery, cost-effectiveness, use of other diagnostic tests and medical services (including <b>reconsultation),</b> and patient enablement.

DESIGN: Pragmatic, 2 x 2 factorial, cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 20 general practices in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 40 general practitioners from 20 practices recruited 431 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was antibiotic prescribing at the index consultation. Secondary outcomes were antibiotic prescribing during 28 days' follow-up, <b>reconsultation,</b> clinical recovery, and patients' satisfaction and enablement. INTERVENTIONS: General practitioners' use of C reactive protein point of care testing and training in enhanced communication skills separately and combined, and usual care. RESULTS: General practitioners in the C reactive protein test group prescribed antibiotics to 31 % of patients compared with 53 % in the no test group (P= 0. 02). General practitioners trained in enhanced communication skills prescribed antibiotics to 27 % of patients compared with 54 % in the no training group (P< 0. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{patients}} who consult with acute lower respiratory symptoms receive antibiotics, usually without evidence of significant infection. The physical signs at presentation of acute {{lower respiratory tract}} illness and {{the rate at which}} symptoms resolve and normal activities recover is not well documented. AIM: To examine in patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTi), their physical signs at presentation, their relationship to antibiotic prescribing, and symptom resolution and resumption of normal activities. DESIGN OF STUDY: Analysis of data collected prospectively during presentation of acute LRTi in primary care and from patient symptom diary cards.

Patients completed symptom diary cards for the following 10 days. RESULTS: Of the 391 {{patients who}} consulted 71 % received antibiotics. A minority had abnormal physical signs: 17 % had a pulse greater than 90 bpm, 15 % a respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute, 4 % had a temperature greater than 38 degrees C, and 25 % had an abnormality on auscultation. Antibiotic prescribing was more common in the presence of abnormal chest signs (odds ratio = 8. 71, 95 % confidence interval = 3. 69 - 20. 61) or discoloured sputum (OR = 2. 67, 95 % CI = 1. 57 - 4. 56). Ten days after consultation, 58 % of patients were still coughing and 29 % had not returned to normal activities. CONCLUSION: Abnormal physical signs at presentation do not explain the high rates of antibiotic prescribing nor do they predict persisting cough and functional impairment at 10 days. <b>Reconsultation</b> for the same symptoms within a month is common and is strongly related to persisting cough, but not abnormalities at presentation...|$|E
