5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher <b>recombination</b> <b>rate,</b> linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local <b>recombination</b> <b>rate</b> and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E
25|$|In birds, whose cells contain microchromosomes, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that there was a correlation between the presence of mega-telomeres and the number of microchromosomes present in a species, such that bird genomes with large numbers of microchromosomes also possessed larger amounts of telomeric DNA sequence. It was thought that these telomeric sequences might protect genes on these tiny chromosomes from erosion during cell division. However, subsequent studies showed that mega-telomeres are not necessarily present in all species with microchromosomes, nor are they found on all microchromosomes within a cell. Mega-telomeres are also thought contribute to the high <b>recombination</b> <b>rate</b> of chicken microchromosomes. The longest mega-telomere in chickens is associated with the W (female) chromosome, suggesting that mega-telomeres may also affect sex chromosome organization and the generation of genetic variation.|$|E

The researchers constructed a tandem DSC device with NiO on the p-DSC side and TiO2 on the n-DSC side. Photocurrent matching was achieved through adjustment of NiO and TiO2 film thicknesses to control the optical absorptions and therefore match the photocurrents of both electrodes. The energy conversion efficiency of the device is 1.91%, which exceeds the efficiency of its individual components, but is still much {{lower than that of}} high performance n-DSC devices (6%–11%). The results are still promising since the tandem DSC was in itself rudimentary. The dramatic improvement in performance in p-DSC can eventually lead to tandem devices with much greater efficiency than lone n-DSCs.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this grant was to develop new methods for {{inference}} of, in particular, <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> from population genetic data. Inferring <b>recombination</b> <b>rates,</b> and how they vary over small scales, is important for both the design and analysis of association studies for disease genes, and to gain a deeper understanding about the biology and evolution of <b>recombination</b> <b>rates.</b> It is only methods that infer <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> from population data that {{have been able to}} describe the fine-scale variation of <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> across genome-wide scales. The impact of such methods can be seen by a number of high profile papers that first demonstrated that recombination hotspots are common across the whole human genome (Crawford et al., 2004; McVean et al., 2004; Fearnhead and Smith, 2005), produced the first fine-scale recombination map for the human genome (Myers et al., 2005), and have started to find relationships between recombination hotspots and DNA sequence motifs (Myers et al., 2005).

Two comprehensive studies have been performed seeking such signatures of selection. Ayub et al.

In both cases there was no evidence for such selection signatures at a higher rate than in random genes selected for matched GC content and <b>recombination</b> <b>rate.</b> These two papers provide strong evidence against the thrifty gene idea, and indeed against any adaptive explanation which relies on selection during our recent evolutionary history, but rather provide strong support the 'drifty gene' interpretation.|$|E

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) recombines at exceedingly high rates, approximately 1 order of magnitude more frequently than simple gammaretroviruses such as murine leukemia virus and spleen necrosis virus. We hypothesize that this high frequency of genetic recombination is a common feature of primate lentiviruses. Alternatively, {{it is possible that}} HIV- 1 is unique among primate lentiviruses in possessing high <b>recombination</b> <b>rates.</b> Among other primate lentiviruses, only the molecular mechanisms of HIV- 2 replication have been extensively studied. There are reported differences between the replication mechanisms of HIV- 1 and those of HIV- 2, such as preferences for RNA packaging in cis and properties of reverse transcriptase and RNase H activities. These biological disparities could lead to differences in <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> between the two viruses. Currently, HIV- 1 is the only primate lentivirus in which <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> have been measured. To test our hypothesis, we established recombination systems to measure the <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> of two other primate lentiviruses, HIV- 2 and simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkeys (SIVagm), in one round of viral replication. We determined that, for markers separated by 588, 288, and 90 bp, HIV- 2 recombined at rates of 7. 4 %, 5. 5 %, and 2. 4 %, respectively, whereas SIVagm recombined at rates of 7. 8 %, 5. 6 %, and 2. 7 %, respectively. These high <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> are within the same range as the previously measured HIV- 1 <b>recombination</b> <b>rates.</b> Taken together, our results indicate that HIV- 1, HIV- 2, and SIVagm all possess high recombination frequencies; hence, the high recombination potential is most likely a common feature of primate lentivirus replication...|$|R

40|$|Levels of {{diversity}} vary across the human genome. This variation {{is caused by}} two forces: differences in mutation rates and the differential impact of natural selection. Pertinent {{to the question of}} the relative importance of these two forces is the observation that both diversity within species and interspecies divergence increase with <b>recombination</b> <b>rates.</b> This suggests that mutation and recombination are either directly coupled or linked through some third factor. Here, we test these possibilities using the recently generated sequence of the chimpanzee genome and new estimates of human diversity. We find that measures of GC and CpG content, simple-repeat structures, as well as the distance from the centromeres and the telomeres predict diversity as well as divergence. After controlling for these factors, large-scale <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> measured from pedigrees are still significant predictors of human diversity and human-chimpanzee divergence. Furthermore, the correlation between human diversity and recombination remains significant even after controlling for human-chimpanzee divergence.

40|$|A {{recipe for}} {{dissolving}} incipient species into {{a continuum of}} phenotypes is to recombine their genetic material. Therefore, students of speciation have become increasingly interested in the mechanisms by which recombination between locally adapted lineages is reduced. Evidence abounds that chromosomal rearrangements, via their suppression of recombination during meiosis in hybrids, {{play a major role}} in adaptation and speciation. By contrast, genic modifiers of <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> have been largely ignored in studies of speciation. We show how both types of reduction in <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> facilitate divergence in the face of gene flow, including the early stages of adaptive divergence, the persistence of species after secondary contact, and reinforcement. An often-overlooked connection between the evolution of sexual recombination and the origin of new species with gene flow suggests that the conditions for speciation with gene flow may be less restrictive than previously anticipated. Evolutionary scenarios for which mathematical models predict selection for reduced recombination can provide insights into how ecological speciation and reinforcement can proceed. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of recombination in eukaryotes have provided first insights into how <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> can be modified within and between species. In addition to the well-established role of chromosomal inversions during speciation, more subtle changes in <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> through modifier genes influencing the frequencies and distributions of crossover across the genome might also be important.

Heteroallelic diploids were analyzed for <b>rates</b> of mitotic <b>recombination</b> that occurred spontaneously and that were induced with X-rays, ultraviolet light and the near-ultraviolet light emitted by sunlamps, as well as <b>rates</b> of meiotic <b>recombination</b> that occur after sporulation. Frequencies of both mitotic and meiotic recombination do not necessarily correspond with physical distances separating altered nucleotides. The most extreme discrepancy involved two adjacent intervals of thirteen base pairs which differed approximately thirtyfold in their spontaneous and X-ray-induced <b>recombination</b> <b>rates.</b> Marked disproportions between genetic and physical distances appear {{to be due to}} the interaction of the two nucleotide sequences in the heteroallelic combination and not to the sequences of the mutant codons alone.

Relationships of the <b>recombination</b> <b>rates</b> for the various pairwise crosses are different after mitosis from those after meiosis, suggesting that these two recombinational processes are to some extent different in their dependence on particular nucleotide configurations.

We show that regions that experience less recombination have reduced divergence to chimpanzee and to baboon, as well as lower levels of diversity.
