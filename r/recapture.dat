5|$|Benedict Arnold again led a {{fleet of}} ships at the Battle of Valcour Island, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain's attempt to <b>recapture</b> the fort in 1776. The British did <b>recapture</b> the fort in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had {{abandoned}} it by November after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody: Indiana's bumbling English colleague. Elliott {{returned}} after Spielberg sought to <b>recapture</b> {{the tone of}} Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), following the actor's absence in the darker Temple of Doom (1984).|$|E
5|$|Due to disunity {{among the}} southerners, between 1991 and 1994 the NIR {{was able to}} <b>recapture</b> many places in South Sudan {{including}} Mongalla and also Ayod, Leer, Akobo, Pochalla, Pibor, Waat, Nasir, Kit, Palotaka, Yirol, Bor, Torit, Kapoeta, Parjok and Magwi.|$|E
30|$|From the listed {{assumptions}} of the <b>recaptured</b> videos, the shot-based analysis method is proposed as a favorable solution for detecting <b>recaptured</b> videos. Because the CRF signal of the <b>recapturing</b> camcorder remains clearly in <b>recaptured</b> shots and every <b>recaptured</b> shot is recorded using a single camcorder, the <b>recaptured</b> videos can be detected by verifying the coherence of the CRFs that are estimated from each shot.|$|R
30|$|This section {{presents}} {{our approach}} to detecting <b>recaptured</b> videos. First, we discuss some preliminary knowledge. Afterwards, we describe the video <b>recapturing</b> process and {{the properties of the}} <b>recaptured</b> videos. Then, we give our assumptions of the <b>recaptured</b> videos. Finally, the approach to identifying the <b>recaptured</b> videos is deduced based on the suggested assumptions.|$|R
5000|$|On 26 April 1809, Alphea <b>recaptured</b> the Pallas. Then on 14 August Alphea <b>recaptured</b> the galliot Zeemeuw. Five {{days later}} she <b>recaptured</b> the galliot Frederick William.

5|$|Francis Brown Wai (April 14, 1917 – October 20, 1944) was {{a captain}} in the United States Army and {{received}} the Medal of Honor for actions during the <b>recapture</b> of the Philippines from Japan in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{immediately}} flew to Manstein's {{headquarters at}} Zaporizhia. Manstein {{informed him that}} an immediate counterattack on Kharkov would be fruitless, but that he could successfully attack the overextended Soviet flank with his five Panzer Corps, and <b>recapture</b> the city later.|$|E
5|$|Hyakutake {{immediately}} began to prepare for another attempt to <b>recapture</b> Henderson Field. The Japanese navy promised to support Hyakutake's next offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and by stepping-up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.|$|E
50|$|Evangelakis was <b>recaptured</b> in February 1957. Firillas was <b>recaptured</b> in April 1957.|$|R
50|$|On 10 December, ISIL <b>recaptured</b> {{the towns}} of Mahin and Huwwarin, and two hills, after {{launching}} a counter-offensive. Later, government forces counter-attacked and reportedly partially <b>recaptured</b> the town of Huwwarin. Five days later, ISIL <b>recaptured</b> Hadath.|$|R
30|$|The third {{category}} is <b>recaptured</b> image detection. The {{support vector machine}} (SVM) classifier is {{the most frequently used}} means of <b>recaptured</b> image detection. Cao et al. proposed a method of identifying the images <b>recaptured</b> from LCD screens [9]. They extracted 155 features (local binary patterns, multi-scale wavelet statistics, and color features) from a single image. Gao et al. presented a general model for image <b>recapturing</b> [10] and 166 features (specularity, surface gradient, color histogram, chromaticity, contrast, and blurriness) were used to identify the <b>recaptured</b> images.|$|R
5|$|If White is {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, {{it is sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, as it {{makes it harder for}} this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to <b>recapture</b> with the Nb1, as a <b>recapture</b> by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E
5|$|John Rhys-Davies as Sallah: A {{friend of}} Indiana and a {{professional}} excavator living in Cairo. Like Elliott's, Rhys-Davies' return {{was an attempt to}} <b>recapture</b> the spirit of Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), {{former head}} of Project Alice {{and the head of}} the North American Umbrella facility, {{operated}} in Nevada, considers Alice's <b>recapture</b> to be a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's <b>recapture</b> until they are informed of her location.|$|E
25|$|Later, on 18 October, Amethyst <b>recaptured</b> {{the ship}} Susannah. Amethyst also <b>recaptured</b> the American brig Rising Sun.|$|R
2500|$|On 27 February 1810, Skylark <b>recaptured</b> {{the ship}} Ann.

That same day Skylark <b>recaptured</b> Iris, and Cordelia shared in the prize money by agreement.|$|R
25|$|Fantome <b>recaptured</b> the brig Endeavour, {{which had}} been sailing from Lisbon to Guernsey when an American {{privateer}} had captured her. The <b>recaptured</b> Endeavour reached Bermuda {{at the end of}} June. Fantome also <b>recaptured</b> an unnamed brig that had been sailing from Newfoundland to Barbados.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{successful}} campaign to <b>recapture</b> Guadalcanal from the Japanese {{was an important}} strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat {{and the end of}} World War II.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May 1948, the Indian Army {{captured}} Tithwal from Pakistani troops, but the Pakistanis quickly {{launched a}} counter-attack to <b>recapture</b> the area. The Indian troops, unable {{to withstand the}} attack, withdrew from their positions to the Tithwal ridge, preparing to regain their positions at the right moment.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{returned}} to the Aleutians, occupying Kiska on that day and Attu Island the next. Despite the U.S. not posting any forces to oppose the occupation of those islands, the Japanese public was informed of a great triumph over U.S. forces on the islands. It was {{the desire of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff to <b>recapture</b> these islands as quickly as possible, and on August 30, 1942, 4,500 U.S. Army troops secured the island of Adak, {{to be used as a}} staging post to <b>recapture</b> Kiska. In two weeks, Army engineers had constructed an airfield on the island, and on September 14, a number of Consolidated B-24 Liberators took off from Adak to attack Kiska. Repeated bombings during the fall season convinced the Japanese of the Americans' desire to <b>recapture</b> Kiska and Adak, and by November the Japanese had bolstered troop numbers on the ground on both islands. During the winter months, the short daily sunshine period and inclement weather protected the Japanese from attack.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} counter {{camcorder}} theft, we present an automated <b>recaptured</b> video detection method {{that is based}} on the characteristics of sensor pattern noise (SPN). The proposed method is based on the <b>recaptured</b> video being recorded by a single digital camcorder. In the experiments, 400 <b>recaptured</b> videos were used to verify the performance of the proposed method. Originally, video <b>recapturing</b> included screen camcording, and screencasting, among other methods. However, this study focuses on the detection of screen camcording.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} on 9 June, a Royalist force led by Sir Michael Woodhouse {{attempted to}} <b>recapture</b> the castle, now garrisoned by Parliament. The counter-attack was unsuccessful, ending in the rout of the Royalist {{forces in a}} skirmish at the nearby village of Wistanstow.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} {{have changed}} over time, reflecting: territorial losses to Ottoman conquest and subsequent Croatian <b>recapture</b> of some territory; changes in the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Istria; and political circumstances, including the personal union and settlement between Croatia and Hungary.|$|E
5|$|The {{first attempt}} by the Japanese Army to <b>recapture</b> Henderson Field was on 21 August, in the Battle of the Tenaru, and the next, the Battle of Edson's Ridge, from 12–14 September; both failed.|$|E

5|$|The new {{triangular}} arrangement between the Southern Song, Jin, and Western Xia continued {{the age of}} division and conflict in China. The region of Huainan (between the Yangzi and Huai rivers) became a new borderland and battleground between Song and Jin from 1128 to 1141, displacing {{hundreds of thousands of}} families who had lived there for generations. The Southern Song deployed several military commanders, among them Yue Fei and Han Shizhong, to resist the Jin as well as <b>recapture</b> territory, which proved successful at times. Yue Fei in particular had been preparing to <b>recapture</b> Kaifeng (or Bianjing as the city was known during the Song period), the former capital of the Song dynasty and the then southern capital of the Jin, after a streak of uninterrupted military victories.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{patterning}} {{may also}} be used for individual identification in field studies. Clipping of specific scales, such as the subcaudals, to mark individual snakes is a popular approach to population estimation by mark and <b>recapture</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|When the British paratroopers had withdrawn, two of {{the guns}} were put back into action by the Germans. Another attack the next day by British Commandos failed to <b>recapture</b> the battery, which {{remained}} under German control until 17August, when the German Army started {{to withdraw from the}} area.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the numbers}} of enslaved people seeking freedom in the North grew, so did the reward for their capture. In 1806 the reward offered for the <b>re{{captured}}</b> slaves was $6, but by 1833 it had risen to $30. In 1844 <b>recaptured</b> freedom seekers fetched $15 if <b>recaptured</b> within [...] of the owner, $50 if captured more than [...] away.|$|R
