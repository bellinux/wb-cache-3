25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} rabies from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes <b>rabies</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E

40|$|WHO's {{reference}} {{protocol for}} post-exposure rabies vaccination advises five intramuscular injections on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 30; in addition, <b>rabies</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> (RIG) {{must be given}} to serious cases of exposure (grade III severity). Some studies indicate that these immunoglobulins suppress the immunogenicity of rabies vaccine when administered according to an alternative protocol of four injections (2 - 1 - 1) on days 0, 7, and 21, which was therefore not recommended for grade III exposures. To test this effect, we conducted a multicentre study in Indonesia using three groups of subjects. One group received only the Vero-cell rabies vaccine (PVRV, Verorab, usual commercial lot) according to the 2 - 1 - 1 schedule. The second and third groups received the same schedule of PVRV, plus either equine <b>rabies</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> (ERIG, 40 IU/kg body weight) or human <b>rabies</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> (HRIG, 20 IU/kg body weight). Our results confirmed the immunoglobulin suppressant effect, which was more pronounced with human than equine immunoglobulins. In both groups receiving immunoglobulins, the seroconversion rates did not reach 100 % on day 28 and the geometric mean antibody titre was lower. Thus, WHO's recommendation in 1992 of the reference protocol plus immunoglobulins for severe cases is substantiated by these results in Indonesian subjects. If the 2 - 1 - 1 regimen is chosen by the treating physician and immunoglobulins are indicated, preference should be given to purified equine RIG, which also costs less than human RIG...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRabies is a fatal disease {{transmitted}} by infected animals by bite, scratch, licking on broken skin or contamination of mucosis by saliva.

In the present study, we report the generation of a trivalent single-chain Fv (scFv 50 AD 1 -Fd), that recognizes the rabies virus glycoprotein, genetically fused to the trimerization domain of the bacteriophage T 4 fibritin, termed 'foldon' (Fd). scFv 50 AD 1 -Fd was expressed as soluble recombinant protein in bacterial periplasmic space and purified through affinity chromatography. The molecular integrity and stability were analyzed by polyacrylamide gradient-gel electrophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography and incubation in human sera. The antigen-binding properties of the trimeric scFv were analyzed by direct and competitive-ELISA. Its apparent affinity constant was estimated at 1. 4 ± 0. 25 × 10 (9) M(- 1) and was 75 -fold higher than its monovalent scFv (1. 9 ± 0. 68 × 10 (7) M(- 1)). The scFv 50 AD 1 -Fd neutralized rabies virus in a standard in vitro and in vivo neutralization assay. We showed a high neutralization activity up to 75 -fold compared with monovalent format and the WHO standard serum. The gain in avidity resulting from multivalency along with an improved biological activity makes the trivalent scFv 50 AD 1 -Fd construct an important reagent for rabies protection.

40|$|In recent years, {{requests}} for <b>rabies</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> have increased at Amsterdam's Academic Medical Center's travel clinic.

This study describes which travellers {{are at risk of}} rabies exposure and would benefit from PrEP. The secondary aim was to specify which factors influence decision-making on taking PrEP. We reviewed electronic patient files of travellers attending our clinic for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis between January 2009 and February 2014. Demographic and travel characteristics were compared with a sample of patients who were seen for pre-travel advice at our clinic.

40|$|Abstract Background Rabies {{is a major}} public-health {{problem in}} {{developing}} countries such as China. Although the recent re-emergence of human rabies in China was noted in several epidemiological studies, little {{attention was paid to}} the reasons behind this phenomenon paralleling the findings of the previous reports. The {{purpose of this study is}} thus first to characterize the current trends of human rabies in China from 1990 to 2007, and then to define better recommendations for improving the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) schedules delivered to rabies patients. Methods The most updated epidemiological data for 22527 human rabies cases from January 1990 to July 2007, retrieved from the surveillance database of reportable diseases managed by the Ministry of Health of China, were analysed. To investigate the efficiency for the post-exposure treatment of rabies, the details of 244 rabies patients, including their anti-rabies treatment of injuries or related incidents, were ascertained in Guangdong provincial jurisdiction. The risk factors to which the patients were predisposed or the regimens given to 80 patients who received any type of PEP were analysed to identify the reasons for the PEP failures. Results The results from analysis of the large number of human rabies cases showed that rabies in China was largely under control during the period 1990 – 1996. However, there has been a large jump in the number of reported rabies cases since 2001 up to a new peak (with an incidence rate of 0. 20 per 100000 people) that was reached in 2004, and where the level has remained until present. Then, we analysed the PEP in 244 rabies cases collected in the Guangdong province in 2003 and 2004, and found that 67. 2 % of the patients did not seek medical services or did not receive any PEP. Further analysis of PEP for the 80 rabies patients who received any type of PEP indicated that almost all of the patients did not receive proper or timely treatment on the wounds or post-exposure vaccination or <b>rabies</b> <b>immunoglobulins.</b> Conclusion While the issue of under-reporting of rabies in previous years may well be a factor in the apparent upwards trend of human rabies in recent years, the analysis of PEP in the Guangdong province provides evidence that suggests that the failure to receive PEP was a major factor in the number of human cases in China. Thus, the data underline the need for greatly improved availability and timely application of high-quality anti-rabies biologicals, both vaccines and immunoglobulins, in the treatment of human bite victims. Controlling dog rabies through pet vaccination schemes may also play a huge role in reducing the rate of human exposure. Education of the public, health care staff and veterinarians will also help to change the current situation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although fatal if untreated, human rabies can be {{prevented}} through post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which involves a course of vaccination and immunoglobulin administered immediately after exposure.

Using data from a detailed study of rabies in Tanzania, we calculate a cost-effectiveness ratio for PEP when the WHO-recommended Essen regimen, a 5 -dose intramuscular vaccination schedule, is adopted. Our analyses indicate a cost-effectiveness ratio for PEP of $ 27 /quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from a health care perspective and $ 32 /QALY from a societal perspective in Tanzania.

40|$|Rabies is {{a highly}} fatal {{zoonotic}} disease which is primarily caused by rabies virus (RABV) although {{other members of the}} genus Lyssavirus can cause rabies as well. As yet, 14 serologically and genetically diverse lyssaviruses have been identified, mostly in bats. To assess the quality of <b>rabies</b> vaccines and <b>immunoglobulin</b> preparations, virus neutralization tests with live RABV are performed in accordance with enhanced biosafety standards. In the present work, a novel neutralization test is presented which takes advantage of a modified vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) from which the glycoprotein G gene has been deleted and replaced by reporter genes. This single-cycle virus was trans-complemented with RABV envelope glycoprotein. Neutralization of this pseudotype virus with RABV reference serum or immune sera from vaccinated mice showed a strong correlation with the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). Importantly, pseudotype viruses containing the envelope glycoproteins of other lyssaviruses were neutralized by reference serum to a significantly lesser extent or were not neutralized at all.

40|$|Background: In {{spite of}} many years’ suppression, the rabies is still present {{worldwide}} {{and as a}} consequence poses a risk for human infection. A review of the system and evaluation of the efficacy of procedures performed by veterinary and health services for the prevention of rabies in Slovenia were carried out. Methods: Using retrospective investigation, the following data were analyzed: number of laboratory confirmed rabid animals (in the period from 1980 to 2009) and number of persons treated in antirabies outpatient departments, number of post-exposure vaccinated persons and number of persons that received human <b>rabies</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> (in the period from 1992 to 2009). Results: Vaccination of foxes by dumping baits from the planes in Slovenia started in the year 1995. After that, the number of rabid wild animals decreased rapidly. In spite of that, the reduction of rabid animals has only limited influence on the post-exposure treatment of people. In the period 1992 – 2009 the number of treated persons ranged from 2681 to 4434 per year and declined over the years. The decision for the post-exposure vaccination of treated persons against rabies was made in 21. 6 % of cases and for the application of human <b>rabies</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> in 6. 7 % of vaccinated persons. In 64 % of cases the postexposure vaccination was necessary owing to the bites caused by a dog of an unknown owner. Conclusion: As a result of good cooperation between veterinary and health services, Slovenia has been free of human rabies for 60 years. But nevertheless, {{we have not been able}} to eradicate the animal rabies yet. Because of great migration of people and animals there is also a permanent risk of imported rabies.

Practical or perceived difficulties have restricted widespread uptake of economical methods. These could largely be overcome by introducing a new, simpler regimen, involving 4 site injections on the first day. We vaccinated volunteers to compare the antibody levels induced by the 4 -site intradermal regimen with those induced by the current 2 -site and 8 -site regimens and the “gold standard” intramuscular regimen favoured internationally. All the economical intradermal regimens were at least as immunogenic as the intramuscular method. The results provide sufficient evidence that the 4 -site regimen meets the criteria necessary for its recommendation for use wherever the cost of vaccine is prohibitive and especially where 2 or more patients are treated on the same day...|$|R
40|$|A direct rapid {{immunohistochemical}} test (dRIT) {{was evaluated}} under field and laboratory conditions to detect rabies virus antigen in frozen and glycerol-preserved field brain samples from northwestern Tanzania. Compared to the direct fluorescent antibody test, the traditional standard in rabies diagnosis, the dRIT was 100 % sensitive and specific. In {{much of the}} developing world, rabies surveillance and diagnosis in domestic and wild animals are severely constrained. High ambient temperatures hinder the collection and preservation of fresh specimens. The use of the direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA), the traditional standard in rabies diagnosis (1, 2), {{is limited by the}} costs of acquiring and maintaining a fluorescent microscope. Difficulties in obtaining diagnostic results from field material have led to widespread underreporting of disease. Consequently, the true public health impact of rabies has been greatly underestimated (3 – 5), and political commitment for its control has been lacking. Moreover, the absence of a confirmatory test can result in the inappropriate management of animal bite injuries, with human deaths a potential consequence of delays in rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and unnecessary administration of PEP. The latter is a particular concern, given the scarcity and costs of human <b>rabies</b> vaccines and <b>immunoglobulin</b> {{in many parts of the}} world. A rapid immunohistochemical test (RIT) to detect rabies virus (RABV) antigen has been developed in the Rabies Section of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by incorporating various components of existing immunoperoxidase techniques (6). Like the DFA, the RIT is performed on brain touch impressions, but th...|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} research model was utilised to enhance communicable disease policy, public health practice and patient management in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The value {{and scope of}} this approach for improving malaria, measles, leprosy and cholera control was investigated. Confidential inquiries identified contributory health system related factors in deaths due to malaria and cholera in Mpumalanga Province. A multi-disciplinary medical, laboratory and public health team carefully reviewed the clinical records and special investigations of patient deaths attributed to malaria between 1 January and 30 June 1996. The record review was supplemented by interviews with next-of-kin and confidential reports by health staff to determine the presence of avoidable factors or deviations from minimum acceptable standards of case management that {{may have contributed to}} the deaths. Confidential inquiries were conducted into all suspected cholera deaths between 1998 - 2001. This approach resulted in corrective action to prevent future deaths. Malahapanga, a remote spring in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, has proven a valuable site for original research on the behaviour of Anopheles arabiensis, the most important malaria vector in southern Africa. An evolving {{operational research}} agcnda has defined preferred feeding periods and anatomical feeding sites, biting patterns, including distance from breeding site, and the effect of mechanical barriers and application of topical N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) to ankles and feet on Anopheles arabiensis feeding. Research findings have directly influenced national malaria prevention guidelines, larviciding around residential camps in nature reserves, and malaria outbreak response in a rural African village. The Mpumalanga Malaria Control Programme traditionally relied on light microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick blood films for malaria diagnosis. A series of operational research studies documented the shortcomings of microscopic diagnosis, the appropriateness and accuracy of rapid malaria card tests and led to the first introduction of card tests for primary diagnosis of malaria in a public health program. The Mpumalanga results highlighted the potential role of rapid tests for "Rolling Back" malaria in selected areas. A resulting national appreciation of the importance of standardised field evaluation of malaria diagnostic tests has led to Mpumalanga being requested to perform routine evaluation of new malaria diagnostic tests prior to introduction through the national purchasing system. The first African sentinel surveillance site for routinely evaluating in vivo efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimetbamine(SP) against Plasmodium falciparum by 42 -day follow-up was established in Mpumalanga Province. This followed a successful chloroquine in vivo study during 1997 that led to a change in treatment policy from chloroquine to SP for first-line P. falciparum malaria therapy. In vivo SP studies in 1998 and 2000 in Mpumalanga and in KwaZulu-Natal, a neighbouring province in 2000, confirmed treatment efficacy, provided a more comprehensive understanding of drug resistance evolution, and allowed investigation of the differential resolution of clinical symptoms and peripheral parasitaemia, an initial evaluation of the adequacy of the recommended SP dosage for adults exceeding 60 kilograms, and determination of gametocyte levels at different stages following therapy. The recognised success of the Mpumalanga sentinel surveillance site for influencing treatment policy has resulted in a sentinel surveillance network for epidemiological research into malaria in South Africa. The feasibility of measles elimination in southern Africa was studied in Mpumalanga using an operational research model. Coverage levels, obtained from a comprehensive district-based population survey in 1997, make elimination highly improbable by routine vaccination alone, and a strong negative correlation between routine and campaign coverage supported the complimentary approach of combining routine and supplementary immunisation for measles elimination. Mass immunisation campaigns have dramatically impacted on the measles disease burden, reflected by notified deaths and admissions reviewed during a Mpumalanga hospital register review in April 1999. Analysis of coverage levels achieved during recent inununisation campaigns in South Africa supported the contention that judicious timing of campaigns is essential if high coverage is to be achieved. A simple telephonic survey during March 2001 proved valuable for verifying the availability of appropriate patient management following potential rabies exposures. This rapid survey technique provided valuable information for correcting the official database of <b>rabies</b> vaccine and <b>immunoglobulin</b> availability and resulted in training of provincial pharmaceutical managers on rabies. Rapid telephonic surveys may be appropriate for auditing other health programs, particularly where a means for independently validating responses is readily available. To explore positive and negative attributes of operational research that impact on its value for influencing communicable disease control policy and practice, the grounded theory approach was used with groups of experienced Masters of Public Health students in South Africa and Australia to analyse the series of operational research studies conducted between 1995 and 1999 to refine malaria diagnosis in Mpumalanga Province. A key theme was the extraordinary relevance of local operational research, which takes account of disease epidemiology, available material and human resources, and the local biological, political, soeio-economic and technological environment. It emerged that where research is planned and conducted in equal partnership with control program staff, there is rapid application of research findings for control and decreased resistance from decision-makers. The central role which operational research can play in gathering the evidence necessary for effectively planning communicable disease control programs and bridging the gap between evidence and enhanced policy and practice, is illustrated in this thesis by drawing all a wide range of operational research interventions conducted in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, between 1995 and 2001...|$|R
