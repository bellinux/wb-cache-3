40|$|Abstract]: Security is a {{critical}} issue in mobile commerce, especially in mobile database systems since mobile environments are dynamic and traditional protection mechanisms do not work very well in such environments. Mobile database access usually across multiple service domains, traditional access mechanisms rely {{on the concept of}} starting home location and cross domain authentication using roaming agreements. However, the cross domain authentications involve many complicated authentication activities when the roam path is long. This limits the future mobile applications. This paper presents a solution for all kinds of mobile ser- vices through short message service (SMS) systems and a ticket-based service access model that allows anonymous ser- vice usage in mobile applications. A service provider can avoid roaming to multiple service domains, only contact- ing the Credential Centre in the model to check a user's certification. The user can preserve anonymity and read a clear <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> in the Credential Centre at anytime, and the identity of misbehaving users can be revealed by a Trusted Centre. Furthermore, the solution has been demon- strated by the implementation with SMS and RS 232...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into low-voltage (LV) residential distribution networks inevitably increases the overall demand, especially peak demand, which may cause thermal or voltage issues. In this paper, a 400 V practical residential distribution network is modelled {{and used to}} quantify these impacts due to the growing penetration of EVs. Residential load profiles in 1 -minute resolution and EV charging profiles with <b>recorded</b> State <b>of</b> <b>Charge</b> (SOC) are randomly and statistically created. Then, a simple charging management algorithm with locally made decision is suggested at EV users' charging points. Results prove that this approach can mitigate the negative impacts <b>of</b> EV <b>charging</b> on network assets. Moreover, it can reduce EV users' electricity cost for charging based on existing UK electricity price scheme 'Economy 7,' without compromising EV usage or substantial network infrastructure reinforcement or installation of extensive monitor, control and communication system. The simulation models and analysis are implemented in MATLAB/OpenDSS as an LV distribution network simulation platform...|$|R
