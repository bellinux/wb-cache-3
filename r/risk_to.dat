5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> vehicle occupants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{summarizes}} research linking long {{work hours}} {{to a wide}} range of <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> workers, families, employers, and the community. The <b>risks</b> are theorized <b>to</b> stem from less time to recover from work, longer exposure to workplace hazards, and less time to attend <b>to</b> non-work responsibilities. <b>Risks</b> <b>to</b> workers include sleep deprivation, poor recovery from work, decrements in neuro-cognitive and physiological functioning, illnesses, adverse reproductive outcomes, and injuries. <b>Risks</b> <b>to</b> families include delayed marriages and child bearing, and obesity in children. <b>Risks</b> <b>to</b> employers include reduced productivity and increases in workers errors. Mistakes by fatigued workers have broad reaching impacts to the community: medical errors, automobile crashes with other drivers on the road, and industrial disasters that damage the environment...|$|R

5|$|If a {{woman is}} untreated, two years of {{breastfeeding}} results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%. Treatment decreases this <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> 1 to 2% per year.

5|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} can be {{afflicted by}} psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD).

Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose a high <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> smaller stressed populations.|$|E
