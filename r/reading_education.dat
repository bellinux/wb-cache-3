Following its closure, Taylor Wimpey applied to build 193 new homes on the site, {{competing}} with a proposal by a community group (the West <b>Reading</b> <b>Education</b> Network) to reopen the site as a free school known as the WREN. The housing plan was rejected, but Taylor Wimpey then appealed to Reading Borough Council and submitted a revised plan for 120 homes, which left room for the school. The appeal was taken to the High Court, which ruled that the site should be used solely for education; the school opened for Year Seven pupils on 7 September 2015.|$|E

The Raumer Library celebrated its 55th anniversary in the current location in 2010 with a little exhibition of photos from the opening in the current building in 1955. Between 27January to 7February 2012 the library was closed in order to install devices automatising the circulation procedures.|$|E
25|$|While she {{was writing}} popular novels, Eliza Haywood was also working on periodicals, essays and manuals on social {{behaviour}} (conduct books). The Female Spectator (4 volumes, 1744–46), a monthly periodical, was written in answer to the contemporary journal The Spectator by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. In The Female Spectator, Haywood wrote in four personas (Mira, Euphrosine, Widow of Quality and The Female Spectator) and took positions on public issues such as marriage, children, <b>reading,</b> <b>education</b> and conduct. It was the first periodical written for women by a woman and arguably one of Haywood’s most significant contributions to women's writing. Haywood followed a lead by contemporary John Dunton who issued the Ladies' Mercury as a companion to his successful Athenian Mercury. Even though The Ladies' Mercury was a self-proclaimed women’s journal, it was produced by men (Spacks xii).|$|E
