John Madden, who appeared on television for the NFL Thanksgiving Day game from 1981 to 2001, frequently advocated his fondness for the turducken, deboned turkey, duck and chicken nested inside each other then cooked. In a few areas of the West Coast of the United States, Dungeness crab is common as an alternate main dish, as crab season starts in early November. Similarly, Thanksgiving falls within deer hunting season in the Northeastern United States, which encourages the use of venison as a centerpiece.

I was in two minds when I began whether I had enough in me to make a book of, and now I know that I could write one about Friar's Oak alone, and the folk whom I knew in my childhood. They were hard and uncouth, some of them, I doubt not; and yet, seen through the golden haze of time, they all seem sweet and lovable. There was our good vicar, Mr. Jefferson, who loved the whole world save only Mr. Slack, the Baptist minister of Clayton; and there was kindly Mr. Slack, who was all men's brother save only of Mr. Jefferson, the vicar of Friar's Oak. Then there was Monsieur Rudin, the French Royalist refugee who lived over on the Pangdean road, and who, when the news of a victory came in, was convulsed with joy because we had beaten Buonaparte, and shaken with rage because we had beaten the French, so that after the Nile he wept for a whole day out of delight and then for another one out of fury, alternately clapping his hands and stamping his feet. Well I remember his thin, upright figure {{and the way in which}} he jauntily twirled his little cane; for cold and hunger could not cast him down, though we knew that he had his share of both.

40|$|More than 900 {{real-time}} ultrasound {{images from}} ribeye muscles across the 11 th to 13 th <b>ribs</b> <b>of</b> live <b>beef</b> animals were collected {{over the period}} of four years. Fat has acoustic properties appreciably {{different from those of}} other soft tissues, causing the transmitted ultrasound to be reflected from the interfaces between fat and muscle. As fat deposits (and hence marbling) increase, the speckle content of B-mode images also increased. Because speckle alters the texture of the image, intramuscular %-fat (IMFAT) can be estimated using texture analysis. A region of interest (ROI) was selected from the acquired image subjectively so that it contained a good image of the ribeye area between and above the 12 th and 13 th ribs. Image-processing techniques were applied for extracting features to analyze textures. The features showing good correlations with the actual IMFAT were used to develop statistical classification models. Because overall accuracy of prediction was improved by developing different regression models for the low-IFAT (less than 8 %) and high-IFAT (more than 8 %) groups (refer to R 1325), statistical pattern recognition and classification techniques were applied to pre-classify the images into the low- or high-IFAT groups.

2500|$|St. Anthony's {{was erected}} in {{the thirteenth century}} (some time before 1254), in the heart of London on Threadneedle Street, atop the less than ideal site of a Jewish synagogue. [...] The chapel of St. Anthony's was built in 1310 without {{permission}} of the bishop of London. To prevents its degradation, the hospital petitioned for a chapel on the bishops terms. Unlike St. Giles, there was insufficient land at St. Anthony's, London, for recreation or food production. As a result, herbs or 'erbys' and vegetables had to be bought on a daily basis for consumption by the entire community. Accounts of foreign expenses at St. Anthony's also show the purchase of various spices, often with intrinsic medicinal qualities that could alter the level of heat and moisture within the body. Some of the spices bought include, saffron, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, lavender, pepper and mustard. Interestingly, the amount spent on herbs, produce, and spices were far surpassed by the amount spent on fish and meat. According to quarterly expenditure reports, fifty-eight percent of the quarterly budget was spent on meat, thirty-four percent on fish, three percent on pottage, two percent on dairy, one percent herbs and one percent on eggs. The unusually detailed records of diet and expenditures at St. Anthony's have revealed that the diet of the clerical establishment ('the hall') and the diets of the almsmen, patients and children ('the hospital') were quite different and class-based. During a typical week, [...] "the entire community shared dishes of pottage, veal, mutton and eggs; the hall alone consumed pork, <b>ribs</b> <b>of</b> roast <b>beef,</b> duck, fresh salmon and eels; and the hospital was supplied with mutton, plaice and haddock."

An instrumental tenderness detection system used at the time of grading to sort beef carcasses on their predicted tenderness would be valuable for the beef industry. A biosensor to accurately predict calpastatin, the inhibitor of the enzyme responsible for increased tenderness due to aging, has been investigated as a detection system. Longissimus dorsi samples from between the 12 th and 13 th <b>rib</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beef</b> carcass (n = 21 and n = 11) were extracted at 0, 24, 36 and 48 h postmortem for trial one and at 0 and 48 hr for trial two. These samples were assayed for calpastatin by traditional laboratory methods and with the developed biosensors. The biosensor used in trial one was an optical fiber and trial two was a capillary tube. Warner-Bratzler shear force was also performed on a steak from each carcass. In trial one, correlations were generated from each sampling period to determine the most closely correlated sampling times between the traditional assay and the biosensor. The highest correlations between the calpastatin and optical fiber were taken at 48 hr postmortem, suggesting that this is the best time for use of the biosensor in an online grading system. The correlation was lower for the capillary tube but there was less variation in the 0 hr capillary tube than the 0 hr precolumn and post-column optical fiber, therefore this is a more promising system. This research further advances the development of the biosensor and makes online assessment of calpastatin one step closer to reality...|$|R
40|$|December 2013. ""A thesis {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Master of Science. "Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Carol L. Lorenzen. Tenderness {{has been identified as}} one of the most important attributes for consumers concerning their meat quality desire, so there is a clear need to accurately determine and grade meat accordingly to tenderness. A tenderness grading system has been proposed to be used to segregate carcasses in order to provide a more consistent prediction of eating quality to the consumers and also enable more carcasses to be segregated into the highest USDA quality grade and categorized as guaranteed tender. Known as an endogenous specific inhibitor of calpain, an enzyme responsible for proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins during post-mortem degradation of muscle, calpastatin presence in the muscle indicates that the activity of calpain can potentially be down regulated, resulting in meat toughness. Thus tenderness can be predicted with the assessment of calpastatin activity in the meat. Independent contribution of the sarcomere length to tenderness is also well established as classic scientific works have demonstrated that muscles with longer sarcomere lengths have lower resistance to shear force. Previous research have been done using enzymatic biosensor to predict calpastatin activity, this being a faster method compared to the traditional method, but the previous biosensor research might have been detecting fragments of inactive calpastatin. Hence more research was necessary in order to determine the rate of calpastatin degradation in samples, comparing quantity versus activity of calpastatin. In order to investigate the degradation of calpastatin mechanism and its activity an experiment was conducted using three different methodologies to measure calpastatin activity or quantity over a period of 180 total days. Longissimus dorsi samples from between the 12 th and 13 th <b>rib</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beef</b> carcass (n = 12) were extracted at 0 hour postmortem. These samples were assayed for calpastatin by the traditional method at day 0, and then kept under refrigeration until day 90 and day 180, when the same traditional assay was performed.
