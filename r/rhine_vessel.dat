50|$|ENI was {{introduced}} by the Inland Transport Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in their meeting on 11-13 October 2006 in Geneva. It {{is based on the}} <b>Rhine</b> <b>Vessel</b> certification system previously used for ships navigating the Rhine, and is comparable to the IMO ship identification number.|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of the MoorMasterTM system by Cavotec MSL in inland shipping is researched. It is an innovative mooring system using vacuum pads with active motion control, utilising a PID controller. A {{case study of}} a 110 m Large <b>Rhine</b> <b>vessel</b> moored directly beside the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal (ARK) is performed. In order for the system to be suitable, the ship motions have to remain within certain mooring criteria, while passing vessels {{should not have to}} reduce speed. The forces on the moored vessel caused by the passing vessels are simulated using ROPES, a numerical method based on a 3 D flow model, using the panel method. Three different passing vessels at three different passing distances are simulated. All passing vessels are simulated to sail at the maximum allowed speed in the ARK. Next, the manoeuvring model is used to set up the equations of motion of the moored vessel. The external force consists of the forces calculated in the Ropes simulations and the modelled forces of the MoorMasterTM units. Solving these equations results in the ship motions.

40|$|To enable {{efficient}} management of inland navigation processes,specialized information systems should be developedthrough {{the application of}} modern information and communicationtechnology (ICT). For this purpose, individual Europeanwaterway and port authorities have developed their ownlocal information systems and databases. Due to the non-conformityof these databases, their integration at the Europeanlevel is confronted with selious problems (COMPRIS, 2003). One of the major problems {{is the lack of}} a common Europeanunique identification number for inland barges. For this reason,in some locally managed databases several different identificationnumbers are attributed to one and the same inlandbarge or certain identification numbers are not available. Thesame problem occurs in the communication between waterwayautholities and between waterway and port authorities. Therefore,a unique identification number for all floating objects onthe European waterways should be introduced. At the momentthere are only two official numbers for vessels. The first, the!MO number, introduced in 1978, is only used by maritimevessels. The second, the OFS number (Official Ship Number),is used only for vessels that have a Rhine patent (issued by theCCNR). The OFS number cannot satisfy all the requirementsof RIS Directive 2005 / 44 /EC and the amendment to Directive 82 / 714 /EEC on technical requirements for inland navigationvessels in the enlarged European Union. The fact is that only 20 % of the ranges of codes are reserved for the non-Rhinecountries. A special Electronic Reporting International group(ER!) was appointed to formulate a new system for uniqueidentification of inland vessels and also define a databasemodel for vessel characteristics. The initial suggestion of ERIwas to add one character in front of the OFS number in orderto increase its coding capacity. The intention was to make asfew as possible differences/modifications to the system currentlyused under the regime of the <b>Rhine</b> <b>Vessel</b> InspectionRegulations in order to minimize the administrative efforts ofharmonization. As members of the ER! group, we made a proposalfor such a new identification number (the so calledERN), which was discussed by the ERI expert group takinginto account the input from the Joint Working Group ofCCNR and EC. In this paper, we will desclibe our proposal toER!, which was later slightly modified within a special ER! expertgroup...|$|E
5000|$|Ships {{which have}} a vessel number in {{accordance}} to the Rhine Inspection Rules receive an ENI beginning with [...] "0" [...] and followed by the seven digit <b>Rhine</b> number. A <b>vessel</b> which has been issued an IMO number may only receive an ENI number if it has appropriate certifications for inland water travel.
