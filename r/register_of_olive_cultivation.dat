Bactrocera oleaeinfested fruits induced a strong ethylene burst and transcript levels of several putative ethylene-responsive transcription factors became significantly upregulated.

The emission of VOCs was also changed quantitatively and qualitatively in insect-damaged fruits, indicating that B. oleae larval feeding can specifically affect the volatile blend of fruits.

It has been hypothesized by many scholars that <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> originated somewhere within the eastern Mediterranean region. From this point, <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> diffused throughout the Mediterranean basin. It is suggested that the fruit was first introduced into Spain by the Phoenicians around 1000 B. C. From Spain, the practice <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> was transmitted to the New World by Spanish agriculturalists who sailed to the West Indies with Christopher Columbus [...] possibly as early as 1493. <b>Olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> then diffused within the New World, via the various Spanish settlements and missionary outposts, until it reached California shortly after 1769. <b>Olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> diffused {{to most of the}} California Franciscan missions by 1800, and subsequently spread to the present-day production areas in the inland valleys of the State, where there are currently over 40, 000 acres devoted to the cultivation of this crop.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} as {{a review of the}} current situation regarding the impact <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> in Southern Spain (Andalusia) on soil degradation processes and its progression into yield impacts, due to diminishing soil profile depth and climate change in the sloping areas where it is usually cultivated. Finally, it explores the possible implications in the regional agricultural policy these results might have. It tries to show how the expansion and intensification <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> in Andalusia, especially since the late 18 th century, had as a consequence an acceleration of erosion processes that can be identified by several indicators and techniques. Experimental and model analysis indicates that the rate of soil erosion accelerated since the expansion of mechanization in the late 1950 s. In addition, that unsustainable erosion rates have prevailed in the region since the shift to a more intense <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> systems {{by the end of the}} 17 th Century. Although agroenvironmental measures implemented since the early 2000 s have reduced erosion rates, they are still unsustainably high in a large fraction <b>of</b> the <b>olive</b> area in the region. In the case <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> orchards located in steeper areas with soils of lower water-holding capacity (due to coarse texture and stone content), cumulative erosion has already had a high impact on reducing their potential productivity. This is one of the factors that contributes towards increasing the gap between these less intensified orchards in the mountainous areas and those in the hilly areas with more gentle slopes, such as for instance the lower stretches of the Guadalquivir River Valley. In the case <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> orchards in the hilly areas with better soils, easier access to irrigation and lower production costs per unit, the efforts on soil conservation should be oriented towards limiting off-site damage, since the soil water-storage function of these soils may be preserved in the medium term even at the current soil erosion rates. The assessment made in this manuscript should be regarded as an initial approximation, since additional efforts in terms of increasing experimental records (for current or historical erosion) and of improving model analysis, with more comprehensive studies and more robust calibration and validation processes, are required.

As a result of these processes, the landscape has maintained an acceptable level of connectivity, diversity of land uses and spatial heterogeneity. This situation enabled us to infer a good situation for biodiversity conservation and for the potential restoration of the rural landscape studied. Our results highlight the need for an agro-environmental model at landscape-scale for the conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of a reasonable level of profitable productivity. We therefore recommend the abandonment of less productive farmland and a spatial landscape configuration based upon the ‘land sparing’ alternative. This alternative involves the persistence of remnants of useful native vegetation such as: natural or semi-natural habitats (essential for species specialised in agricultural systems); discontinuous corridors (stepping stones) and the potential restoration of native vegetation.

40|$|Anthracological {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} in the archaeological site of Punta di Zambrone on the Tyrrhenian coast of Calabria in southern Italy. Archaeological excavation documented at the site settlement deposits dated mainly to Early Bronze Age (EBA, 21 st– 18 th century BC) and the Recent Bronze Age (RBA, 13 th to early 12 th century BC). In the phase of the EBA village, the high frequency of Olea europaea in the charcoal data suggests the tree may well have been cultivated by favouring the spread <b>of</b> the scant <b>olive</b> trees growing wild. Comparison with existing archaeobotanical data indicates that <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> spread over a large portion of southern Italy from the EBA and the early Middle Bronze Age (MBA, 17 th– 15 th century BC), thus calling into question the hypothesis of its first cultivation related to the interaction between Mycenaean Greece and local cultures in southern Italy.

Additionally to its economic importance the multifunctional character of agriculture and its wide territorial presence entails that it has a high potential incidence in the environmental and social dimensions of the sustainable development of the region.

Contrasting this hypothesis entails to evaluate with a holistic and systemic approach the multiple impacts of the different technical alternatives to diverse agricultural practices.

40|$|The several uses <b>of</b> the <b>olive</b> tree, Olea europaea L., {{have long}} been {{recognized}} and celebrated by human civilization. Olive trees have been cultivated since prehistoric times in Asia Minor, and introduced with human migration and trade throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, into Africa, and eventually into New Zealand and North America. Thomas (1995) lists the beginning <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> as aproximately 3000 B. C. Olives appear {{in one of the}} first cookbooks ever discovered. As long ago as the 17 th century B. C., the olive was considered sacred. In Greek mythology, Athena is said to have placed an olive tree on the Acropolis in order to win over the denizens of Attica, a favor for which the city became her namesake, Athens (Anonymous 1997). The champion at the Olympic Games was crowned with its leaves. "Offering an olive branch " is synonymous with peaceful intentions. The oil was burned in the lamps of sacred temples, as well as being the "eternal flame " of the Olympic games. There are many references to the olive in the Bible. One of the most significant is in the tale of Noah and the Flood. The dove, sent out to search for a sign of land and life, returned with none other than an olive branch. Moses proclaimed that all men who worked to cultivate olives were exempt from military service (Grieve 1995). The olive {{is often referred to as}} a symbol of goodness, purity, and life.

The objectives were to determine the diversity and distribution pattern of Colletotrichum spp. populations prevalent in olives and their relatedness to anthracnose pathogens in other hosts, assess their pathogenic variability and host preference, and develop diagnostic tools. A total of 128 Colletotrichum spp. isolates representing all olive-growing areas in Portugal and a few isolates from other countries were characterized by molecular and phenotypic assays and compared with reference isolates. Arbitrarily primed PCR data, internal transcribed spacer of rRNA gene and beta-tubulin 2 nucleotide sequences, colony characteristics, and benomyl sensitivity showed Colletotrichum acutatum to be dominant (> 97 %) with limited occurrence of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (< 3 %). Among C. acutatum populations, five molecular groups, A 2 to A 6, were identified. A 2 was widely prevalent (89 %), coinciding with {{a high incidence of}} anthracnose and environmental conditions suitable to disease spread. A 4 was dominant in a particular region, while other C. acutatum groups and C. gloeosporioides were sporadic in their occurrence, mostly related to marginal areas <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> C. gloeosporioides, isolated from olive fruits with symptoms indistinguishable from those of C. acutatum, showed same virulence rating as the most virulent C. acutatum isolate from group A 2. C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides isolates tested in infected strawberry fruits and strawberry and lupin plants revealed their cross-infection potential. Diagnostic tools were developed from beta-tubulin 2 sequences to enable rapid and reliable pathogen detection and differentiation of C. acutatum groups...|$|R

40|$|Olive (Olea europaea L.) is a crop well {{adapted to}} the {{environmental}} conditions prevailing in the Mediterranean Basin. Nevertheless, the increasing international demand for olive oil and table olives {{in the last two}} decades has led to expansion <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> in some countries of the southern hemisphere, notably in Argentina, Chile, Perú and Australia. While the percentage of world production represented by these countries is still low, many of the new production regions do not have typical Mediterranean climates, and some are located at subtropical latitudes where there is relatively little information about crop function. Thus, the primary objective of this review was to assess recently published scientific literature on <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> in these new crop environments. The review focuses on three main aspects: (a) chilling requirements for flowering, (b) water requirements and irrigation management, and (c) environmental effects on fruit oil concentration and quality. In many arid and semiarid regions of South America, temperatures are high and rainfall is low in the winter and early spring months compared to conditions in much of the Mediterranean Basin. High temperatures have often been found to have detrimental effects on olive flowering in many olive cultivars that have been introduced to South America, and a better understanding of chilling requirements is needed. Lack of rainfall in the winter and spring also has resulted in an urgent need to evaluate water requirements from the flower differentiation period in the winter to early fruit bearing. Additionally, in some <b>olive</b> growing areas <b>of</b> South America and Australia, high early season temperatures affect the timing of phenological events such that the onset of oil synthesis occurs sooner than in the Mediterranean Basin with most oil accumulation taking place in the summer when temperatures are very high. Increasing mean daily temperatures have been demonstrated to decrease fruit oil concentration (%) and negatively affect some aspects of oil quality based on both correlative field studies and manipulative experiments. From a practical standpoint, current findings could be used as approximate tools to determine whether the temperature conditions in a proposed new growing region are appropriate for achieving sustainable oil productivity and quality...|$|R
40|$|The vegetational {{history of}} Greece was studied {{by means of}} pollen analysis. Six pollen {{diagrams}} from {{various parts of the}} Greek mainland are presented, which between them cover a time from around 30, 000 years ago to the present day. The development of the vegetation from a steppe {{during the time of the}} last glaciation through a transitional stage in the late-glacial period to a post-glacial forest, and the degradation of the vegetation to the present day scrub is represented by three main pollen assemblage zones. Zone I covers part or all of the time of the last glacial period when the dominant vegetation was an Artemisia steppe with little woodland, in response to a cool dry climate with a temperature comparable with that of northern Europe today but probably less rainfall than is usual in Greece now. Zone II covers the vegetational development during the time of the late-glacial and early post-glacial where evidence from southern Greece shows a pioneer scrub vegetation being succeeded by mixed-oak forest in response to a temperature and rainfall increase, with a temporary reversion to cool and dry conditions deduced from a vegetational reversion. This sequence probably corresponds to the lower Dryas-Allerd-Upper Dryas sequence known in northern Europe. Zone III covers the degradation of the forest vegetation which appears to have taken place earlier in southern Greece than in the north, where there appears to have been substantial forest up to at least the year A. D. and possibly until Medieval times before clearance by man and animal. Two periods <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> are recognisable, one in Middle Bronze Age – Mycenean times and the other in Late Dark Ages – Early Classical times. There is no sign of climatic change in the Post-glacial sequence. The pollen rain from some modern Greek vegetation shows that tara which are abundant there may be seriously under-represented in the pollen rain...|$|R
