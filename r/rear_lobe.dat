5|$|The larvae of inarticulates swim as {{plankton}} {{for months}} and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a pedicle that coils in the mantle cavity, and a small lophophore, which is used for both feeding and swimming—except that Craniids have no pedicle. As the shell becomes heavier, the juvenile sinks {{to the bottom and}} becomes a sessile adult. The larvae of articulate species live only on yolk, and remain among the plankton for only a few days. This type of larva has a ciliated frontmost lobe that becomes the body and lophophore, a <b>rear</b> <b>lobe</b> that becomes the pedicle, and a mantle like a skirt, with the hem towards the rear. On metamorphosing into an adult, the pedicle attaches to a surface, the front lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls up over the front lobe and starts to secrete the shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and the animals often lose weight in winter. These variations in growth often form growth lines in the shells. Members of some genera have survived for a year in aquaria without food.|$|E
2500|$|Ribbon {{microphones}} use a thin, usually {{corrugated metal}} ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically {{connected to the}} microphone's output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones {{in the sense that}} both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a bi-directional (also called figure-eight, as in the diagram below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides. [...] Also, because the ribbon is much less mass it responds to the air velocity rather than the sound pressure. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the <b>rear</b> <b>lobe</b> picks up sound only from the cymbals. Crossed figure 8, or Blumlein pair, stereo recording is gaining in popularity, and the figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for that application.|$|E
5000|$|... balanolobus {{is derived}} from the Greek 'balanos', acorn, and 'lobos', lobe, in {{reference}} to the outline of the <b>rear</b> <b>lobe</b> of the rhachis.|$|E
2500|$|Shotgun {{microphones}} are {{the most}} highly directional of simple first-order unidirectional types. [...] At low frequencies they have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid but at medium and higher frequencies an interference tube gives them an increased forward response. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of off-axis waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique {{is the presence of}} some <b>rear</b> <b>lobes</b> that vary in level and angle with frequency, and can cause some coloration effects. [...] Due to the narrowness of their forward sensitivity, shotgun microphones are commonly used on television and film sets, in stadiums, and for field recording of wildlife.|$|R
40|$|The {{different}} dependences of NMR spin-spin coupling constants of {{a medium-sized}} molecule {{on the quality}} of the ground-state wavefunction is studied using three different basis sets of increasing size, namely, 6 - 31 G, 6 - 31 G* and 6 - 31 G**. Calculations of the Fermi contact terms were also carried out using partially uncontracted s and p atomic orbitals with the same exponents as those of the 6 - 31 G basis set. Bicyclo[1. 1. 1]pentane was chosen as a model compound; it was synthesized for the measurement of several couplings as part of this work in order to compare theoretical results with experimental values. The through-space transmission of couplings via the interaction of <b>rear</b> <b>lobes</b> of orbitals inside the bicyclic cage were studied with the IPPP approach using the above basis sets...|$|R
50|$|Trinodus, Arthrorhachis and Geragnostus {{are closely}} related {{and it may be}} {{appropriate}} to assign their species to just one genus. All species in these three genera have virtually identical cephalons, but of T. agnostiformes, the type species of Trinodus only one poorly preserved cephalon was known. However, relatively recent, pygidia assignable to T. agnostiformes were found. Although this material is distorted or incompletely preserved, it is very similar to the pygidium of Arthrorhachis tarda. Species with a <b>rear</b> rhachis <b>lobe</b> longer than the postaxial region are henceforth combined in Geragnostus, all others are assigned to Trinodus.|$|R
50|$|Condylopyge is a genus of {{very small}} trilobites, that lived during the latest Early {{and the early}} Middle Cambrian, in what are today Canada (Newfoundland and New Brunswick), Czech Republic, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, the Russian Federation (North-East Siberia), Spain, Turkey and Sweden. It can easily be {{distinguished}} from all other Agnostida because the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the headshield (or glabella) is wider than the <b>rear</b> <b>lobe.</b> It looks like Pleuroctenium but the frontal glabellar lobe does not fold around the <b>rear</b> <b>lobe,</b> {{as it does in}} Pleuroctenium.|$|E
5000|$|Like all Agnostida, Condylopyge is diminutive, {{with the}} headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) of {{approximately}} the same size (or isopygous) and outline, and only two thorax segments. The characteristic sidewise expansion of the frontal lobe of the glabella, occipital structures instead of basal lobes, and a rhachis with three pairs of side lobes and a <b>rear</b> <b>lobe</b> differentiate Condylopygidae from all other agnostids. Condylopyge can easily be distinguished from its sister taxon Pleuroctenium because the frontal glabellar lobe does not wrap around {{the sides of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>lobe,</b> giving it a mushroom-like appearance. The frontal glabellar lobe is never dissected lengthwise, unlike in Pleuroctenium, where this is often clearly visible. The pygidium may carry a pair of backwardly directed spines, but this also occurs regularly in Pleuroctenium.|$|E

5000|$|Unique among extant brachiopods, Argyrotheca and Joania are hermaphrodite. Another {{most unusual}} {{specialization}} in both these genera, {{is that the}} eggs (or ovae) are retained in the enlarged nephridia that act as a brood pouch. Fertilization takes place with its own sperm or after sperms have entered with the inhalant water current. Here early larval development takes place. The fertilized ova develop into ciliated larvae with a feebly free-swimming life of at most {{a few days before}} settling and metamorphosis into a tiny brachiopod fixed to the substrate. In A. cordata and A. cistellula in the Mediterranean, ripe eggs and larvae are present year round. A. cuneata however breeds in the autumn. Eggs hatch into gastrulas, followed by a two- and a three-lobed phase during their stay in the brood pouch. The frontal (or apical) lobe has a girdle of long cilia, a middle (mantle) lobe carries a band of cilia {{in the middle of the}} belly (or vertral side) and a <b>rear</b> (or pedicle) <b>lobe</b> is without cilia. A. cordata and A. cuneata larvae have 4 bundles of bristles (or setae), while these are lacking in A. cistellula. Extant brachiopods with brood pouches (Megathyridoidea: Argyrotheca and Joania, Gwynioidea: Gwynia, and all Thecideoidea) are very small or minute and have short lives (2 years reported for A. cuneata [...] ). This implies that reproduction needs to be both quick and efficient. Being hermaphrodite allows for quick and efficient self-fertilisation, and the brood pouch would reduce predation of the larvae.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of soil temperatures, frost heave, thaw consolidation, pore water pressures and downslope soil movements are reported from a turf-banked solifluction lobe at Steinhøi, Dovrefjell, Norway from August 2002 to August 2006. Mean annual air temperatures over the monitored period were slightly below 08 C, but mean annual ground surface temperatures were around 28 C warmer, {{due to the}} insulating effects of snow cover. Seasonal frost penetration was highly dependent on snow thickness, and at the monitoring location varied from 30 – 38 cm over the four years. The shallow annual frost penetration suggests that the site may {{be close to the}} limit of active solifluction in this area. Surface solifluction rates over the period 2002 – 06 ranged from 0. 5 cm yr 1 at the <b>rear</b> of the <b>lobe</b> tread to 1. 6 cm yr 1 just behind the lobe front, with corresponding soil transport rates of 6 cm 3 cm 1 yr 1 and 46 cm 3 cm 1 yr 1. Pore water pressure measurements indicated seepage of snowmelt beneath seasonally frozen soil in spring with artesian pressures beneath the confining frozen layer. Soil thawing was associated with surface settlement and downslope soil displacements, but following clearance of the frozen ground, later soil surface settlement was accompanied by retrograde movement. Summer rainfall events caused brief increases in pore pressure, but no further soil movement. Surface displacements exceeded maximum potential frost creep values and it is concluded that gelifluction was an important component of slow near-surface mass movements at this site. Temporal and spatial variations in solifluction rates across the area are likely to be considerable and strongly influenced b...|$|R
50|$|The pygidial axis (or rhachis) is - {{times as}} long as the pygidium, almost parallel-sided, very {{slightly}} constricted at the middle lobe (M2), broadly rounded, and - {{times as long}} as wide. It has three distinct pairs of lobes, and is defined by shallow furrows. The forward lobe of the rhachis (M1) is a bit shorter and wider than the middle lobe (M2) and separated from it by a furrow (F1) which is directed outward and slightly backward from the dorsal furrow, and then curved strongly forward adaxially. The <b>rear</b> <b>lobe</b> (M3) is - longer than both others together, and the furrow is directed outward and slightly forward from the dorsal furrow. The middle lobe has a prominent tubercle, which extends backwards above the anterior portion of <b>rear</b> <b>lobe.</b> It is the highest point of the pygidium. The border is moderately wide, gently convex, defined by a shallow furrow, and widest at the rear corners which carry a pair of strong, backwardly directed spines.|$|E

50|$|Eight colour {{varieties}} are recognised for the Mericanel della Brianza, including white, black, silver, gold, pyle and white-spotted black. The skin and legs are yellow. The comb is single, with 5 points and a pronounced <b>rear</b> <b>lobe.</b> The ear-lobes are red. Average weight is 0.7 - 0.8 kg for cocks, 0.6 - 0.7 kg for hens.

5000|$|The Condylopygidae are {{a family}} of very small trilobites, that lived during the Middle Cambrian, and {{has been found in}} Canada (Newfoundland and Nova Scotia), the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Spain, England, Wales, Sweden, and the Russian Federation (Siberia).

50|$|Like {{all members}} of the {{suborder}} Agnostina, Glyptagnostus reticulatus is completely blind and only has two thoracic segments. The cephalon and pygidium are {{more or less the same}} size and shape (isopygous). The glabella of the cephalon has two lobes. The front lobe is roughly squarish in shape, while the <b>rear</b> <b>lobe</b> is elongated and split along the middle. The cephalon has a narrow well-defined border. The pygidium has a long tapering central axis which can be divided into three lobes. The axis is connected to the rear margin by a central furrow. At both sides of the axis are a row of four or more pits. The border of the pygidium is also well-defined, widening towards the back, and with short, backward facing marginal spines.|$|E
50|$|Acadagnostus has a round cephalon without spines. The cephalic {{border is}} narrow, while the border furrow is wide. The lateral furrows of {{posterior}} lobe of glabella {{can be seen}} as sets of pits or a narrow straight or slightly curved backward furrow. It carries a node at or slightly behind the center of the <b>rear</b> <b>lobe.</b> The pygidium is subquadrate, has a flat border, that is sometimes posteriorly widened and has a weak bifurcation. A pair of small spines at the outer rear corners is present. The border furrow is wide. The rhachis has parallel sides or is conical, but the second segment is not narrower than its neighbours. Furrows crossing the rhachis are absent or weak. The segments are shown by differences in relief of the rhachis. There is a large median node, and a postaxial furrow is present, but usually very short.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{method is}} {{presented}} for estimating the calibration error affecting L-band ground-based radiometers, using {{the sky as}} a cold source. In a first step, the optimum conditions to perform this calibration are limited by removing sky areas where large radiation contributors (Sun and Moon) are present. In the region thus selected, an accurate computation of the brightness temperature measured by the antenna is performed using available sky background temperature survey charts (radio continuum and hydrogen HI line) and integrating the sky temperature over the directional gain pattern of a representative radiometer L-band antenna. Contributions from <b>rear</b> <b>lobe</b> are not considered. After adding the atmospheric contribution, maps of the noise temperature and its error are produced for the region of interest. The best calibration orientation for a sky-looking radiometer at medium northern latitude would be 0 ° in azimuth (northward) and an elevation equal to the radiometer's latitude. It is found that the computed total sky noise contribution is 6. 6 K, with 24 hour variations of ± 0. 2 K and a maximum bias of ± 0. 6 K. The results are valid for the whole year, assuming low to moderate solar activity and no rain...|$|E
