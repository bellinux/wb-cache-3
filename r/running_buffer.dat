50|$|In {{the first}} step of the Strep-tag {{purification}} cycle, the cell lysate containing Strep-tag fusion protein is applied to a column with immobilized Strep-Tactin (step 1). After the tagged protein has specifically bound to Strep-Tactin, a short washing step with a physiological buffer (e.g. PBS) removes all other host proteins (step 2). This is due to its extraordinary low tendency to bind proteins non specifically. Then, the purified Strep-tag fusion protein is gently eluted with a low concentration of desthiobiotin, which specifically competes for the biotin binding pocket (step 3). To regenerate the column, desthiobiotin is removed by application of a HABA containing solution (a yellow azo dye). The removal of desthiobiotin is indicated by a color change from yellow-orange to red (step 4+5).Finally, the HABA solution is washed out with a small volume of <b>running</b> <b>buffer,</b> thus making the column ready to use for the next purification run.|$|E

40|$|The CE {{separation}} of alpha-helical polypeptides composed of 14 - 31 amino acid residues {{has been investigated}} using aqueous and nonaqueous BGEs. The <b>running</b> <b>buffers</b> were optimized with respect to pH. Generally, higher separation selectivities were observed in nonaqueous electrolytes. This {{may be explained by}} a change in the secondary structure when changing from water to organic solvents. Circular dichroism spectra revealed a significant increase in helical structures in methanol-based buffers compared to aqueous buffers. This change in secondary structure of the polypeptides contributed primarily to the different separation selectivity observed in aqueous CE and NACE. For small oligopeptides of two to five amino acid residues no significant effect of the solvent was observed in some cases while in other cases a reversal of the migration order occurred when changing from aqueous to nonaqueous buffers. As these peptides cannot adopt secondary structures the effect may be attributed to a shift of the pKa values in organic solvents compared to water...|$|R

Coupling of SPRM with MALDI-mass spectrometer (SUPRA-MS) enables the multiplex quantification of binding and molecular characterization {{on the basis}} of different masses.

Glass slides were taken to prepare gold chips via coating with thin layers of chromium and gold by sputtering process.

Abnormal protein phosphorylation causes many human diseases. Experimental procedures for {{the determination of the}} phosphorylation status of certain proteins are therefore very important in relation to studies on a diverse range of physiological and pathological processes. We have previously reported a novel phosphate-affinity sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) technique using a dizinc(II) complex of the phosphate-binding ligand Phos-tag in conjunction with a neutral-pH gel system to detect shifts in the mobilities of phosphoproteins (Zn 2 + –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE). However, this handmade gel-based procedure is often laborious and time-consuming to perform, and requires a skillful analyst. More recently, SuperSep Phos-tag precast gel has been developed {{on the basis of the}} Zn 2 + –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE methodology. This novel ready-to-use system employs a neutral-pH gel containing 12. 5 % (w/v) polyacrylamide and the immobilized Zn 2 + –Phos-tag (50 µM), which is generally used in conjunction with a Tris–glycine-based electrophoretic <b>running</b> <b>buffer.</b> We examined the potential usage of a Tris– N -[2 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycine (Tris–Tricine) buffer as an alternative <b>running</b> <b>buffer</b> for the SuperSep Phos-tag precast gel system in the analysis of low-molecular-mass phosphoproteins.

40|$|Some of the D-amino acids (D-Ser, D-Asp, D-Glu) {{have gained}} an {{increasing}} attention {{during the last}} decades, due {{to the discovery of}} their role as neurotransmitters and their implication in different neurological pathologies (Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia etc.). Nevertheless, their use as biomarkers is particularly relevant when correlated with the levels of other neurotransmitters. In order to develop a fast and efficient separation method widely accessible for the quantitation of these molecules, we used only common separation tools such as RP- 18 stationary phases for reversed phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) or bare fused capillaries for capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). For achieving chiral resolution, a derivatization procedure was implemented. (-) -FLEC was the chiral derivatization agent of choice due to its fast and quantitative reaction with primary and secondary amines and the ability of performing in-capillary derivatization. Moreover, the derivatization process implies only a simple mix of the sample and reagent, at room temperature. The separation of the FLEC derivatives of several biologically relevant D- and L- amino acids (Asp, Glu, Ser, Tyr, Trp, Phe, His) together with certain neurotransmitter molecules have been optimized using CZE or RP-LC, chiral resolution being achievable for all amino acids of interest. By the CZE approach the <b>running</b> <b>buffer’s</b> pH turned out to be critical in achieving baseline separation of the targeted analytes. The derivatives of most amino acids could be separated using 60 mM acetate buffer at pH 5, while for Asp derivatives the separation could be achieved only at pH 4. Being stronger bases, a third run at a more alkaline pH was needed for the separation of the remainder neurotransmitters. Moreover, the implemented in-capillary derivatization allows a fast and fully automated separation procedure. As for the RP-LC approach 50 mM acetate buffer in combination with an organic modifier (methanol, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran (THF)) was tested as mobile phase using gradient elution. Once again, the strong influence of pH on the resolution was observed.
