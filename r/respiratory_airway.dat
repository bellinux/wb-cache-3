40|$|Inhalation of {{pharmaceutical}} aerosols is a convenient {{way to treat}} lung or even systemic diseases. For effective treatment {{it is very important}} to understand air flow characteristics within <b>respiratory</b> <b>airways</b> and determine deposition hot spots. In this paper the air flow in trachea was investigated by numerical simulations. To validate these results we carried out particle image velocimetry experiments and compared resulting velocity fields. Simplified geometry of <b>respiratory</b> <b>airways</b> from oral cavity to 4 th generation of branching was employed. Air flow characteristics were analysed during sinusoidal breathing pattern for light activity conditions (period 4 s and tidal volume 1 l). The observed flow fields indicated that the flow in trachea is turbulent during the sinusoidal flow except phases of flow turnarounds. The flow was skewed to front side of the trachea during inspiration and had twin-peak profile during expiration because of the mixing from daughter branches. The methods were compared and good agreement was found. This validation of CFD simulation can result into its further usage in respiratory airflow studies...|$|R

5000|$|The {{respiratory}} epithelium {{lining the}} upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>airways</b> {{is classified as}} ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium.

Particles are released from different upstream locations and their trajectories are shown, which revealed that the trajectory paths of 80 um particles that are inhaled are the same from the three different upstream planes evaluated. Smaller particles, 1 and 10 um, exhibited different inhalation paths when released from different upstream distances. The free-stream velocity also has an effect on the particle trajectory particularly for larger particles. The aspiration efficiency for an extended range of particle sizes was evaluated. Reverse particle tracking matches the deposition in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>airway</b> with its initial particle source location.

40|$|It {{seems to}} be very {{convenient}} to receive a medicine by inhalation instead of injection. Unfortunately transport of particles and targeted delivery of a drug in human <b>respiratory</b> <b>airways</b> is very complicated task. Therefore we carried out experiments and tested different methods for evaluation of particle deposition in a model of human lungs. The model included <b>respiratory</b> <b>airways</b> from oral cavity to 7 th generation of branching. Particles were dispersed by TSI Small-scale Powder Disperser 3433 and delivered to the model. The model was disassembled into segments after the deposition of the particles and local deposition was measured. Two methods were used to analyse the samples, fluorescence spectroscopy and optical microscopy. The first method was based on measuring the intensity of luminescence, which represented the particle deposition. The second method used the optical microscope with phase-contrast objective. A dispersion of isopropanol and particles was filtrated using a vacuum filtration unit, a filter was placed on glass slide and made transparent. The particles on the filter were counted manually and the deposition was calculated afterwards. The results of the methods were compared and both methods proved to be useful...|$|R
