The expression of Fas and Fas ligand was immunohistochemically detected on <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells from GSR-induced mice, although neither Fas nor Fas ligand was found in cells from untreated control mice or in cells from mice receiving a single injection of LPS.

40|$|The {{intracellular}} mechanisms underlying <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> {{epithelial cell}} proliferation and tubular repair following ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remain poorly understood. In this report, we demonstrate that activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS 3), an unconventional receptor-independent regulator of heterotrimeric G-protein function, influences <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> regeneration following IRI. In rat kidneys exposed to IRI, {{there was a}} temporal induction in renal AGS 3 protein expression that peaked 72 h after reperfusion and corresponded to the repair and recovery phase following ischemic injury. Renal AGS 3 expression was localized predominantly to the recovering outer medullary proximal tubular cells and was highly coexpressed with Ki- 67, a marker of cell proliferation. Kidneys from mice deficient in the expression of AGS 3 exhibited impaired <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> recovery 7 d following IRI compared to wild-type AGS 3 -expressing mice. Mechanistically, genetic knockdown of endogenous AGS 3 mRNA and protein in <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells reduced cell proliferation in vitro. Similar reductions in <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell proliferation were observed following incubation with gallein, a selective inhibitor of Gβγ subunit activity, and lentiviral overexpression of the carboxyl-terminus of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2 ct), a scavenger of Gβγ subunits.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 50 -year old male patient {{presenting}} with a combination of chondrocalcinosis and osteoporosis related to a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorder. Laboratory studies revealed hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia with renal wastage and metabolic alkalosis, compatible with a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> transport disorder with similarities to Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome. Calcifications of the menisci and cartilage on X-rays of knee joints suggested chondrocalcinosis, which has been associated with Gitelman's syndrome. Radiologically suspected osteopenia was confirmed by a bone density scan that revealed osteoporosis of the vertebral column. An association of osteoporosis with hypercalciuria, which commonly occurs in Bartter's syndrome patients, has been reported. Upon treatment of the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorder with spironolactone and a thiazide diuretic in combination with calcium and magnesium supplementation, the electrolyte abnormalities resolved and arthralgias disappeared. Our case demonstrates a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> dysfunction with features of both Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome along with concurrent chondrocalcinosis and osteoporosis. Furthermore, the occurrence of osteoporosis in this relatively young patient, in the absence of other risk factors, demonstrates that <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorders should be suspected in presenile osteoporosis.

The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule) or by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule). Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with renal insufficiency, the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys.

40|$|Introduction. Capreomycin is a second-line drug {{often used}} for multidrug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} which can result in nephrotoxic effects similar to other aminoglycosides. We describe a case of capreomycin induced Bartter-like syndrome with hypocalcemic tetany. Case Report. 23 -year-old female patient presented with carpopedal spasms and tingling sensations in hands. Patient was being treated with capreomycin for two months for tuberculosis. On further investigation, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis were noted. Vitamin D and serum PTH levels were within normal limits. Hypercalciuria was confirmed by urine calcium/creatinine ratio. Calcium, potassium, and magnesium supplementation was given and capreomycin was discontinued. Electrolytes normalized in two days after cessation of capreomycin with no further abnormalities on repeat investigations. Discussion. Aminoglycosides can result in <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> dysfunction leading to Fanconi syndrome, Bartter syndrome, and distal <b>tubular</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Impaired mitochondrial function in the tubular cells has been hypothesized as the possible cause of these tubulopathies. Acquired Bartter-like syndrome phenotypically resembles autosomal dominant type 5 Bartter syndrome.

Previous {{studies have suggested that}} berberine (BBR) has antifibrotic effects in the kidney and can reduce apoptosis and inhibit the EMT of podocytes in DN. However, the effect of BBR on the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> EMT in DN and its mechanisms of action are unknown. This study was performed to explore the effects of BBR on the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> EMT and the molecular mechanisms of BBR in DN model KKAy mice and on the high glucose (HG) -induced EMT in mouse <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. Our results showed that, relative to the model mice, the mice in the treatment group had an improved general state and reduced blood glucose and 24 -h urinary protein levels. Degradation of renal function was ameliorated by BBR. We also observed the protective effects of BBR on renal structural changes, including normalization of an index of renal interstitial fibrosis and kidney weight/body weight. Moreover, BBR suppressed the activation of the Notch/snail pathway and upregulated the α-SMA and E-cadherin levels in DN model KKAy mice. BBR was further found to prevent HG-induced EMT events and to inhibit the HG-induced expression of Notch pathway members and snail 1 in mouse <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. Our findings indicate that BBR has a therapeutic effect on DN, including its inhibition of the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> EMT and <b>renal</b> interstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, the BBR-mediated EMT inhibition occurs through Notch/snail pathway regulation. Keywords: berberine, EMT, renal interstitial fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, Notch/snail pathwa...|$|R
