5|$|Poe's first {{published}} collection is so <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> after Poe's death, Rufus Wilmot Griswold believed {{it had never}} existed until one was found in 1859. It has since been {{recognized as one of}} the rarest first editions in American literature.|$|E
5|$|Snow in {{the city}} is so <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> it has been {{observed}} only five times in the century-and-a-half that records have been kept. In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed on the ground for a few hours in higher locations like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E
5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely <b>rare,</b> <b>that</b> part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of mistral: the [...] "white mistral" [...] which clears the entire sky and accentuates the brightness; and the [...] "black mistral", which is <b>rarer,</b> <b>that</b> is {{accompanied}} by rain.|$|R

50|$|It {{is based}} on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations. Where BLEU simply calculates n-gram {{precision}} adding equal weight to each one, NIST also calculates how informative a particular n-gram is. That is to say when a correct n-gram is found, the <b>rarer</b> <b>that</b> n-gram is, the more weight it will be given.|$|R
5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, {{it is recommended that}} an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case it is needed to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the antivenom from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution for infusion over 30 minutes. While it is <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following a bite, there are case reports from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or months after a bite, however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|While local {{sources of}} gold are attested during the Aksumite era, silver {{seems to have}} been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was {{imported}} as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, given the preponderance of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> it had to be mainly imported. Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum. Copper and bronze do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E

25|$|The One-day series lasts {{from three}} to seven matches. Usually, the shorter one-day series are played {{at the same time}} as longer Test series – {{although}} the one-day matches and Test matches are usually played in groups. These days, it is <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> a Test series is interrupted by One Day Internationals. T20 Series last from one to three matches.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater quality must be {{regularly}} monitored {{across the}} aquifer to determine trends. Effective groundwater monitoring should {{be driven by}} a specific objective, for example, a specific contaminant of concern. Contaminant levels {{can be compared to}} the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking-water quality. It is not <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> limits of contaminants are reduced as more medical experience is gained.|$|E
25|$|Despite these orders, Nureddin's {{resources}} were limited. On paper, an Ottoman division was authorized between thirty and forty thousand men. However, it was <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> an Ottoman division was ever supplied to its authorized strength. On average, Ottoman divisions could muster approximately 17,500 men. The Sixth Army's available manpower for defending against Force D totaled about 10,000 men and 32 artillery pieces. Not only were his battalions severely understrength, Nurredin's force was composed primarily {{at this time}} of unreliable Arab conscripts.|$|E

25|$|There {{are thus}} two main classes of {{metamorphic}} komatiite; carbonated and hydrated. Carbonated komatiites and peridotites form {{a series of}} rocks dominated by the minerals chlorite, talc, magnesite or dolomite and tremolite. Hydrated metamorphic rock assemblages are dominated by the minerals chlorite, serpentine-antigorite, brucite. Traces of talc, tremolite and dolomite may be present, as it is very <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> no carbon dioxide is present in metamorphic fluids. At higher metamorphic grades, anthophyllite, enstatite, olivine and diopside dominate as the rock mass dehydrates.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{the sample}} {{standard}} deviation implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger population of fulmars. If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population (perhaps the last 14 surviving fulmars), then instead {{of the sample}} standard deviation, the calculation would use the population standard deviation. In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator is N instead of N-1. It is <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, statistical software packages calculate the sample standard deviation. Similarly, journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> {{recipes for}} use in dire {{situations}} were included in recipe collections, but one example from a cookbook in Low German has been preserved. It gives instructions for a wartime stew consisting of any available greens and vegetables to be boiled in animal stomachs or intestines, an effective method in situations where no proper kitchenware would be available. In the First Margrave War, the city of Nuremberg was able to feed its citizens properly and still emerge victorious through careful planning, extensive stockpiling of grain and meat and strict control of prices by the town council.|$|E

5000|$|Bilabial [...] is {{thus the}} easiest implosive to {{pronounce}} {{and so it}} is the most common one around the world. Velar , on the other hand, is quite rare (uvular [...] is even <b>rarer).</b> <b>That</b> is the opposite pattern to the ejective consonant in which it is the velar articulation that is most common and the bilabial articulation <b>that</b> is <b>rare.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Missouri revised {{its state}} {{harassment}} statutes to include stalking and harassment by telephone and electronic communications (as well as cyber-bullying) after the Megan Meier suicide case of 2006. In {{one of the}} few cases where a cyberstalking conviction was obtained the cyberstalker was a woman, which is also much <b>rarer</b> <b>that</b> male cyberstalkers. The conviction was overturned in on appeal in 2009 however.|$|R
25|$|For {{a number}} of years in the 2000s, it became <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> the station would {{announce}} its call letters. To most, it was simply 102.1 The Edge. Perhaps due to CRTC regulations requiring radio stations to announce their call letters, the station began in August 2005 to identify itself as both CFNY and the Edge during identification breaks. In 2006, however, the station fell afoul of the CRTC. The regulating body opted to give CFNY only a four-year license renewal, rather than the customary seven. The regulator's concerns reportedly involved the station failing once to meet its mandated Canadian content targets.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{accepted}} by the scientific community that rocks have been blasted from both the Martian and lunar surface during impact events, {{and that some of}} these have landed on the Earth as meteorites. However, the first Antarctic lunar meteorite was found in 1979, and its lunar origin was not recognized until 1982. Furthermore, lunar meteorites are so <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> it is unlikely that they could account for the 380 kilograms of Moon rocks that NASA gathered between 1969 and 1972. Only about 30 kilograms of lunar meteorites have been found on Earth thus far, despite private collectors and governmental agencies worldwide searching for more than 20 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{second game}} airs at 10 p.m. ET (7 p.m. PT, 8 p.m MT) {{originating}} from a Mountain or Pacific Time Zone city and usually featuring {{one of the}} three teams from Western Canada (the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks, or occasionally Winnipeg Jets). Since hurry-up faceoffs were introduced, it is extremely <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> a regular season game runs longer than three hours, and every double-header game is seen in its entirety. The broadcast team usually consists of Dave Randorf, Louie DeBrusk and Cassie Campbell-Pascall, although sometimes Hughson and Simpson call the late game if it is deemed to be the marquee game of the night. Scott Oake is usually the ice-level reporter.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Court of Appeal hears appeals from {{decisions}} rendered by the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada and {{a certain}} group of federal administrative tribunals like the National Energy Board and the Canada Industrial Relations Board. All judges of the Federal Court are ex officio judges of the Federal Court of Appeal, and vice versa, although it is <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> a judge of one court will sit {{as a member of}} the other. The Federal Court of Appeal is a travelling court. The judges of its Court, who sit in panels of three, hear cases in English and in French in 18 cities, from Vancouver to St. John's, including locations in northern Canada.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in Spain, for example, {{only public}} TV {{channels}} show subtitled foreign films, usually at late night. It is extremely <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> any Spanish TV channel shows subtitled versions of TV programs, series or documentaries. With {{the advent of}} digital land broadcast TV, it has become common practice in Spain to provide optional audio and subtitle streams that allow watching dubbed programmes with the original audio and subtitles. In addition, only {{a small proportion of}} cinemas show subtitled films. Films with dialogue in Galician, Catalan or Basque are always dubbed, not subtitled, when they are shown {{in the rest of the}} country. Some non-Spanish-speaking TV stations subtitle interviews in Spanish; others do not.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{cardinals}} are bishops. Domenico Bartolucci, Karl Josef Becker, Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye {{are examples}} of 21st-century non-bishop cardinals. The 1917 Code of Canon Law introduced the requirement that a cardinal {{must be at least}} a priest. Previously, they need only be in minor orders and not even deacons. Teodolfo Mertel, who died in 1899, was the last non-priest cardinal. In 1962, Pope John XXIII made it a rule that a man who has been nominated a cardinal is required to be consecrated a bishop, if not one already, but some ask for and obtain dispensation from this requirement. It is <b>rare</b> <b>that</b> the Pope will appoint Cardinals who are priests only and not consecrated as a bishop.|$|E
