Brill invented the hydrazine <b>resistojet</b> propulsion system in 1967 for which she holds U.S. Patent No. 3,807,657.

25|$|Brill's work in {{satellite}} {{propulsion systems}} {{resulted in a}} number of significant developments. She developed the concept for a new rocket engine, the hydrazine <b>resistojet,</b> and she proposed the use of a single propellant because of the value and simplicity that it would provide. Her invention resulted in not only higher engine performance but also increased reliability of the propulsion system. Due to the reduction this created in propellant weight requirements this resulted in either increased payload capability or extended mission life.|$|E
25|$|All current {{spacecraft}} use chemical rockets (bipropellant or solid-fuel) for launch, {{though some}} (such as the Pegasus rocket and SpaceShipOne) have used air-breathing engines {{on their first}} stage. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant rockets) or <b>resistojet</b> rockets for orbital station-keeping and some use momentum wheels for attitude control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a control system that uses small (0. 1 -N) hydrogen-fueled, high-expansion-ratio <b>resistojets</b> {{to control a}} Space Station's position and attitude. The number {{and size of the}} <b>resistojets</b> is calculated based on requirements for stationkeeping, compensation for steady-state gravity-gradient and aerodynamic torques, momentum loading due to mobile remote manipulator motion, Shuttle Orbiter docking, and translational evasive maneuvering. The all-resistojet control system performs continuous orbit maintenance while keeping the linear accelerations on the spacecraft lower than they would be without any control system operating...|$|R
50|$|AlSat-1 {{is built}} on the SSTL-100 platform. The onboard {{instrumentation}} consists of two banks with three Earth imaging cameras each that, in total, has a resolution of 32 meters in three spectral bands (NIR, red, and green). The imaging swath of the cameras is 600 km. The satellite was constructed in a fifteen-month time period by the British and Algerians, of which eleven Algerian engineers were trained by SSTL. The satellite uses <b>resistojets</b> for propulsion, and butane as its propellant. The <b>resistojets</b> provide more than 20 m/s of delta velocity.|$|R
50|$|Alsat-1B uses three body mounted {{solar panels}} for power generation, and a 15 Amp-hour Li-Ion battery for power storage. It uses warm gas, butane powered <b>resistojets</b> for propulsion. The {{attitude}} control system uses sun sensors and magnetometers.|$|R
50|$|Resistojets {{have been}} flown in space since 1965 on board {{military}} Vela satellites. However, they only became used in commercial applications in 1980 with {{the launch of}} the first satellites in the INTELSAT-V program. Many GEO spacecraft, and all 95 Iridium, used Aerojet MR-501/MR-502 series <b>resistojet</b> engines. Nowadays <b>resistojet</b> propulsion is used for orbit insertion, attitude control, and deorbit of LEO satellites, and do well in situations where energy is much more plentiful than mass, and where propulsion efficiency needs to be reasonably high but low thrust is acceptable.|$|E
50|$|A <b>resistojet</b> is {{a method}} of {{spacecraft}} propulsion (electric propulsion) that provides thrust by heating a (typically non-reactive) fluid. Heating is usually achieved by sending electricity through a resistor consisting of a hot incandescent filament, with the expanded gas expelled through a conventional nozzle.|$|E
50|$|ATS-3 {{experiments}} included VHF and C-band communications, a color spin-scan camera (principally {{developed by}} Verner E. Suomi), an image dissector camera, a mechanically despun antenna, <b>resistojet</b> thrusters, hydrazine propulsion, optical surface experiments, and {{the measurement of}} the electron content of the ionosphere and magnetosphere.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Resistojets</b> {{have also}} been {{proposed}} as means of using biowaste as reaction mass, particularly in conjunction with hydrazine. Studies focus {{on the characteristics of}} steam and carbon dioxide as major constituents of a biowaste stream, and typically use cubic zirconia as a heating element.|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{requirements}} for future electric propulsion cover an extremely large range of technical and programmatic characteristics. A NASA program is to provide options for the many potential mission applications, taking into account work on electrostatic, electromagnetic, and electrothermal propulsion systems. The present paper is concerned with developments regarding the three classes of electric propulsion. Studies concerning electrostatic propulsion are concerned with ion propulsion for primary propulsion for planetary and earth-orbit transfer vehicles, stationkeeping for geosynchronous spacecraft, and ion thruster systems. In connection with investigations related to electromagnetic propulsion, attention is given to electromagnetic launchers, the Hall current thruster, and magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters.

40|$|The {{selection}} of the propulsion system for the Space Station (SS) is reassessed. The propulsion system consists of two distinct elements. The first of these combusts gaseous oxygen and hydrogen produced from water electrolysis, to maintain the SS altitude and perform higher thrust maneuvers for backup attitude control, collision avoidance, and other contingencies. The second consists of gas <b>resistojets,</b> which augment altitude maintenance. The results of a parametric comparison {{of the life cycle}} costs of this electrolysis/resistojet propulsion with those of other system options, carried out over a range of probable performance requirements, confirmed the baseline superiority of the SS propulsion system for most anticipated conditions. However, relative costs among impulse requirements vary so much that major changes in the design conditions may warrant implementation of another system (such as hydrazine with water <b>resistojets)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Other publicized Busek {{technologies}} include RF ion {{engines and}} a <b>resistojet</b> rocket. Another focus is CubeSat propulsion, {{proposed for the}} 2018 Lunar IceCube mission. , Busek was also working on a DARPA-funded program called DARPA Phoenix, which aims to recycle some parts of on-orbit spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{carrying}} {{remote sensing}} imaging sensors, the satellite also carries experimental payloads: the CLEO Cisco router in Low Earth Orbit, an experiment demonstrating GNSS reflectometry, and a water <b>resistojet</b> propulsion system. The UK-DMC demonstrated the {{first use of}} the Interplanetary Internet in space. In November 2010, {{nearing the end of}} its operational life, UK-DMC was placed into a lower orbit.|$|E

50|$|Because the gas {{is usually}} unheated, speed at the throat {{is low and}} very low {{performance}} is achieved; in a vacuum with nitrogen gas a specific impulse of 73 seconds can be achieved. The maximum theoretical specific impulse for nitrogen gas is 76 seconds. In the simplest approximation, the specific impulse is modelled as proportional to the square root of the (absolute) gas temperature, so performance rises as the gas temperature is increased. A thruster in which the performance is increased by heating the gas by an electrical resistance {{is known as a}} <b>resistojet.</b>|$|E

50|$|CubeSat {{electric}} propulsion typically uses electric energy to accelerate propellant to high speed, {{which results in}} high specific impulse.
