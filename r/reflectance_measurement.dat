50|$|Spectrophotometry uses photometers, {{known as}} spectrophotometers, that can measure a light beam's {{intensity}} {{as a function}} of its color (wavelength). Important features of spectrophotometers are spectral bandwidth (the range of colors it can transmit through the test sample), the percentage of sample-transmission, the logarithmic range of sample-absorption, and sometimes a percentage of <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a {{transmission}} measurement, the radiation {{goes through a}} sample and is measured by a detector placed {{on the far side}} of the sample. The energy transferred from the incoming radiation to the molecule(s) can be calculated as the difference between the quantity of photons that were emitted by the source and the quantity that is measured by the detector. In a diffuse <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement,</b> the same energy difference measurement is made, but the source and detector are located on the same side of the sample, and the photons that are measured have re-emerged from the illuminated side of the sample rather than passed through it. The energy may be measured at one or multiple wavelengths; when a series of measurements are made, the response curve is called a spectrum.|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that only {{hemispherical}} <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurements</b> can be directly compared with emissivity measurement of samples under thermal equilibrium with the surrounding medium (Salisbury and Walter 1989). Therefore, strictly speaking our bi-conical <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurements</b> (with angles incidence = emission =  13 °, no correction for grazing angles needed) can only qualitatively be compared to our emissivity measurements made under vacuum (where the lack of air between the grains gives rise to vertical thermal gradients). However, bi-conical <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurements</b> are more representative of the way spacecraft instruments obtain <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurements</b> than hemispherical <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurements.</b> Therefore, data obtained by combining bi-conical <b>reflectance</b> and emission <b>measurements</b> can be applied directly to the analysis of data returned by NIR/TIR instruments.|$|R

5000|$|The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) is a <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement</b> {{developed}} by John Gamon {{during his tenure}} as a postdoctorate fellow supervised by Christopher Field at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University. The PRI is sensitive to changes in carotenoid pigments (e.g. xanthophyll pigments) in live foliage.

As such, it is used in studies of vegetation productivity and stress. Because the PRI measures plant responses to stress, {{it can be used}} to assess general ecosystem health using satellite data or other forms of remote sensing.

5000|$|White Portland cement differs {{physically}} from gray cement only {{in terms}} of its color. Its setting behavior and strength development are essentially the same as that expected in gray cement, and it meets standard specifications such as ASTM C 150 and EN 197. In practice, because much white cement is used in pre-cast concrete products, it is commonly made to a high-early strength specification such as ASTM C 150 Type III. This aids concrete manufacturers' production rate. Higher potential strength also helps to counteract the strength-diminishing effects of pigment addition. In addition to the usual specifications, manufacturers guarantee the whiteness of the product, typically in terms of a <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement,</b> such as L*a*b L-value, or tristimulus. In the latter case, because off-color white cement tends to be greenish, the Tri-Y (green) value is used. Because the color so much depends upon the [...] "bleaching" [...] and [...] "quenching" [...] operations, merely specifying a low iron content does not guarantee good whiteness.|$|E

Edge-losses {{occur during}} {{reflectance}} measurements of pigmented maxillofacial elastomer when light is scattered within a sample beyond {{that part of}} the surface exposed to the observation system of the optical device. A custom sample-holder is presented which redirects light that would not be measured during conventional <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement</b> back into the sample. The amount of edge-loss occurring within thin layers of maxillofacial elastomer with tan pigment on black-and-white backings was found to depend on sample thickness, the backing, the beam size used during conventional <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement,</b> and the optical term bS = (2 KS + K 2) 12.

Additionally, the edge-loss occurring during the tristimulus <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement</b> of thick samples of maxillofacial elastomer with various concentrations of tan and black pigment was found to be linearly related to bS up to a limiting value, with no additional edge-loss occurring for bS values above this limiting value.

However, the ground, helicopter, and satellite based normalized difference spectral vegetation indices showed low sensitivity to changes in F(sub ipar). <b>Reflectance</b> <b>measurements</b> were only moderately well correlated with measurements of F(sub ipar) (r = 0. 82 for hand-held radiometer, 0. 84 for helicopter measurements, and 0. 75 for the LANDSAT Thematic Mapper and SPOT).
