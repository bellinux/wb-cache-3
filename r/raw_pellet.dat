40|$|RADIOCHPure {{and single}} phase thorium-uranium(IV) phosphate-diphosphate -TUPD (orthorhombic form) dense pellets were {{prepared}} by two wet chemical routes from low-temperature precursors. The first method {{was based on}} the "direct evaporation" of a mixture containing tetravalent actinides and phosphoric acid while the second one involved the initial precipitation of the thorium-uranium(IV) phosphate-hydrogenphosphate hydrate (TUPHPH). Both methods led to single phase sintered samples following a two-step procedure using a uniaxial pressing at room temperature and then a heat treatment at high temperature. The dilatometric study and the determination of the linear shrinkage of the pellets showed that the best densification of the samples prepared via the "precipitation" method was obtained after heating the <b>raw</b> <b>pellet</b> at 1250 C for 5 h, for initial uranium amount lower than 44. 5 wt %(U). For samples prepared via "direct evaporation", the heat treatment must be prolonged for at least 15 h at this temperature. Moreover, the complete characterization of the samples (EPMA, and so forth) confirmed that the homogeneity of the samples was significantly improved when using TUPHPH as a precursor, probably due to the better reactivity of the initial powder (higher specific surface area, smaller grain size, and so forth). Several leaching tests were performed in various acidic media and in natural waters on -TUPD sintered samples. All the corresponding normalized dissolution rates remained low (10 - 6 to 10 - 5 g/(m 2 day)) even in aggressive media which confirms the high chemical durability of -TUPD, thus enhancing the potential use of this ceramic in the field of the efficient immobilization of tetravalent actinides...|$|E

MPO subunits present in semen were characterized by Western 3 blot. Purified active MPO was added in PBS and freezing extender to control its activity during freezing procedure. Differences between medians were determined using Kruskal– Wallis test, and correlations were determined using Spearman’s test for nonparametric data. Active MPO concentration was low in seminal plasma and thawed semen, but high in pellet (p = 0. 0058), as the opposite relation was observed for total MPO concentration (p < 0. 0001). In seminal plasma and post- thaw semen, inactive 86 -kDa MPO precursor was mainly observed. Purified MPO activity was decreased in the extender (p = 0. 0286). MPO activity in pellet was highly correlated with thawed progressive motility (r = - 0. 5576, p = 0. 0086).

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{engineering}} {{economic analysis}} of a biomass pelleting process was performed for conditions in North America. The pelletization of biomass consists {{of a series of}} unit operations: drying, size reduction, densifying, cooling, screening, and warehousing.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville, 2007. We {{present a}} study of the synthesis, {{structural}} and magnetic properties of bulk and nanosized (Zn, Cd, Cu) 0 : 5 Ni 0 : 5 Fe 2 O 4 and NiFe 2 O 4 compounds. The e®ects of electronic con¯guration and atomic sizes of Zn, Cd, Cu and Ni on the magnetic properties of the ferrites are the primary focus of the study. Di®erent synthesis routes, preparation conditions and how they a®ect single phase formation are explored. The synthesis was undertaken by solid{state reaction, combustion, hydrothermal and glycothermal techniques. The structure determination was by Xray di®raction. The magnetic measurements were performed using MÄossbauer spectroscopy (from 79 K to about 850 K) and a vibrating sample magnetometer (at about 300 K). The bulk densities of the sintered pellets were deduced by Archimedes principle. The bulk oxides were produced by solid{state reaction and combustion techniques. Fine powders with grain sizes of about 10 nm were produced from bulk compounds by a Retsch planetary ball mill and by the hydrothermal and glycothermal processes. The e®ects of the applied pressure used to make pellets (related to green density of the <b>raw</b> <b>pellets)</b> and the sintering temperature on the properties were investigated. An anomalous variation of bulk densities of (Zn, Cd) 0 : 5 Ni 0 : 5 Fe 2 O 4 oxides with increase in pelletizing pressure was observed which appears to suggest evidence for trapped porosity. Di®erent states of pelletizing the samples appear to be related to a systematic change of the hyper¯ne ¯eld distributions derived from the MÄossbauer spectra. The temperature dependence of the magnetic hyper ¯ne ¯elds at tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites were observed to vary with temperature according to the equations Bhf (T) = Bhf (0) [1 ¡ (T=TC) n]¯n where n = 1 (based on the Landau{Ginzburg theory) and n = 2 (based on the Stoner theory). The equation Bhf (T) = Bhf (0) [1 ¡(T=TC) 2]¯ 2 appears to ¯t the hyper¯ne ¯eld data over a wider temperature range. The Zn{ and Cd{based oxides were found to be ferrimagnetic with Curie temperature TC = 548 § 3 K (measured by zero velocity technique). The Cu{based compound exhibited antiferromagnetic behavior with a magnetic transition temperature of 825 § 3 K. The di®erence in behavior between Zn{, Cd{ and Cu{based compounds is due to di®erence in electronic con¯guration and atomic or ionic sizes. The stronger magnetic coupling between spins in the Cu{based sample {{can be explained by the}} presence of RKKY interactions in addition to superexchange interactions. The larger ionic size for Cd appears to favour smaller grain sizes in Cd{based oxides. An anomalous increase in TC is obtained in the Zn 0 : 5 Ni 0 : 5 Fe 2 O 4 compound with reduction in grain size. This increase in TC is attributed to a distribution of Zn ions on both A and B sites. The MÄossbauer spectra of the milled nanosized samples show a combination of ferrimagnetic and paramagnetic behavior. The coercive ¯eld (HC) at room temperature was found to increase with reduction in grain size (G) according to the equation HC = am+bm=G, which is consistent with multidomain particles. With further reduction in grain sizes, the coercive ¯eld reduced according to the equation HC = as ¡bs=G 2. This equation is associated with the onset of single domain particles. The samples produced by hydrothermal and glycothermal processes show evidence of transformation from single domain to multidomain structure with increasing sintering temperature. The ease of single{phase formation in the compounds studied is shown to depend on the technique used to prepare the samples. Single phase formation of the spinel structure was easier to achieve in samples prepared by wet chemical methods because lower sintering temperatures (T < 1000 oC) were required...|$|R

The mean archeointensity values per pottery fragments range from 14.6 ± 1.5 to 59.5 ± 13.8 μT, while the corresponding virtual axial dipole moments range from 2.5 ± 0.3 to 10.0 ± 2.4 × 1022 A m 2. These new data, although not numerous, are of high quality and definitively contribute to the Mesoamerican, still insipient, archeointensity database.|$|R
40|$|Wood pellets are an {{environmentally}} friendly biofuel with no net contribution to global warming. Today, {{the demand for}} wood pellets for residential heating is rapidly increasing in Sweden and many other countries. Therefore, alternative <b>raw</b> materials for <b>pellet</b> production, such as wheat straw and peat, are of great interest. Before these new fuels are widely used, {{it is important to}} study the emissions to air during combustion. The smoke contains a large number of compounds which, to varying degrees, can affect health and the environment. Specific organic compounds from five sequential combustion stages; initial smouldering, early flaming, late flaming, after-flame smouldering and final glowing, were determined for incomplete combustion of straw and peat/wood pellets on a laboratory scale and compared to those from softwood pellets. The emissions from incomplete combustion reflect the chemical composition of the fuel. During initial smouldering of the studied fuels, methoxyphenols from the lignin of the fuels were released at high concentrations. Relatively high concentrations of 1, 6 -anhydroglucose and furan-related compounds, originating from the polysaccharides of the fuel, were also found during this stage, especially in peat/wood pellet smoke. During flaming burning, wood pellets burned more efficiently and with even lower emissions than the other fuels. After-flame smouldering of the studied pellets, especially straw pellets, released high concentrations of compounds that are hazardous to health and the environment...|$|R

Article is aimed to give an insight to {{results of the study}} and to initiate discussion related on topical questions among pellet industry: what is the quality of pellets produced of undebarked young thinning wood (pine and pine-birch mixture) or debarked young thinning wood. Other topics of the study are to find out: has felling timing or growing habitat any influence to the chemical composition of pellets. Fuel quality indicates that high quality pellets can be produced of alternative raw materials. Key findings of this study are that there is a big opportunity to use undebarked small diameter pine and undebarked small diameter pine pinebirch mixture as a raw material for wood pellets. According chemical analysis small diameter thinning wood with bark is useful raw material for EN 14961 - 2 (2011) A 1 wood pellets. In Finland traditionally small diameter wood {{has been used as a}} raw material for wood chips and for pulp and paper industry. Due to the changes in of pulp and paper industry new production opportunities for using small diameter wood should be found. In the future using small size thinning wood as a <b>raw</b> material for <b>pellets</b> can boost the demand of thinning wood and so help to manage young forests in Finland...|$|R
40|$|Polypropylene (PP) is {{a common}} {{thermoplastic}} and frequently adapted permanently with increasing requirements by adding fillers as well as reinforcing materials. Because of incompatibility of non-polar PP and polar inorganic filler, resulting composites are brittle which has a detrimental effect on the desired properties. Improvements in mechanical properties {{can be reached by}} compatibilization, creating of chemical couplings between phases and by increasing of inhomogeneity. Thus, maleic anhydride grafted PP is used as well as reactive processing of PP in presence of peroxide radical initiators. The temperature dependence of peroxide decay as well as the dependence of radical generation rate on time are two disadvantages of peroxide induced reactive processing. Modification of polymers with high energy electron treatment is also well known and used to form parts (after) molding as well as <b>raw</b> materials (<b>pellets,</b> powders, fibers) in solid state and at room temperature. The spatially and temporally precise input of energy is used to produce desired material properties on radical-induced chemical reactions. Coupling of high energy electron modification of polymers and melt mixing offers a new possibility of reactive processing. In this case, radical generation is independent of temperature, can be easily controlled by beam current and kept constant over time. Absence of any crystallinity, high reaction rates as well as intensive macromolecular mobility and intensive mixing are reasons to expect novel structures and properties. Electron beam induced reactive processing is a novel technique where chemical reactions are induced by spatial and temporal precise energy input via high energy electrons under dynamic conditions of melt mixing. This method gives the possibility to increase surface energy of polypropylene (PP) effectively as well as to generate chemical couplings between filler and PP. The process was applied to a proved system consisting of PP (38 wt%), magnesium hydroxide (MH) (60 wt%), triallyl cyanurate (TAC) (2 wt%). This composite system was successful tested in peroxide induced conventional reactive processing. Absorbed dose imparted per rotation of rotors is a new parameter controlling mechanical properties of polymer composites. Improved properties were found in tensile strength (150 %), elongation at break (175 %), and impact strength (175 %). It can be shown that chemical couplings are generated during electron induced reactive processing in comparison to only compatibilized material...|$|R
40|$|Self-heating {{in storage}} {{facilities}} of biomass pellet {{can lead to}} spontaneous combustion. This has resulted in many fires over the years, causing both financial and environmental losses. In order to assess the risk for spontaneous combustion of biomass pellets during storage, {{it is important to}} know how prone the fuel is to self-heating, i. e. to determine its reactivity. This thesis presents experimental work performed to develop a sensitive screening test procedure for biomass pellets, using isothermal calorimetry for direct measurement of the heat production rate. This method can be used to compare the reactivity of different biomass pellets. This could be useful for e. g. facility owners to gain better knowledge of their fuels propensity for self-heating and thereby facilitate safer storage. The screening test procedure can also be used for research purposes. Experiments have been performed with 31 different biomass pellet batches to investigate how the pellet composition, origin, etc. influence the reactivity of the pellets. The results from these experiments clearly show a significant difference in reactivity between different types of pellets. The results indicate that pine/spruce mix pellets are significantly more reactive than all other types of pellets tested, and that pellets consisting of 100 % pine are more reactive than pellets consisting of 100 % spruce. Pellets produced from winery wastes, straw, or eucalyptus, have low reactivity compared to pellets consisting of pine and/or spruce. The reactivity of the pellets was shown to be reduced by either introducing certain types of anti-oxidants into the pellets or by extracting lipids from the <b>raw</b> material of <b>pellets.</b> The screening test procedure is already being used today by some facility owners for assessing their fuels propensity for self-heating. The procedure is also one of the suggested test methods in “ISO/CD 20049 Solid biofuels — Determination of self-heating of pelletized biofuels”. This thesis presents experimental work performed to develop a sensitive screening test procedure for biomass pellets, using isothermal calorimetry for direct measurement of the heat production rate. This method can be used to directly compare the reactivity, that is how prone the fuel is to self-heating, of different batches of biomass pellets. The results could be used for safety assessment by the industry or for research purposes to investigate how different factors influence the self-heating potential. Experiments were performed with 31 different biomass pellet batches to investigate how the pellet composition, origin, etc. influence the heat release rate.
