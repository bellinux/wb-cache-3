40|$|Background and PurposeThe connexin 43 (Cx 43) mimetic peptide Gap 27 was {{designed}} to transiently block the function of this gap junction. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of Gap 27 on corneal healing, inflammation and neovascularization. Experimental ApproachThe effect of Gap 27 on wound healing, inflammation and vascularization was assessed in primary human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) in vitro and whole human corneas ex vivo, and in an in vivo rat wound healing model. Key ResultsGap 27 enhanced the wound closure of HCEC in vitro and accelerated wound closure and stratification of epithelium in human corneas ex vivo, but did not suppress the corneal release of inflammatory mediators IL- 6 or TNF- in vivo. In human corneas ex vivo, F 4 / 80 positive macrophages were observed around the wound site. In vivo, topical Gap 27 treatment enhanced the speed and density of early granulocyte infiltration into rat corneas. After 7 days, the expressions of TNF- and TGF 1 were elevated and correlated with inflammatory cell accumulation in the tissue. Additionally, Gap 27 did not suppress VEGF release in organotypic culture, nor did it suppress early or late VEGFA expression or neovascularization in vivo. Conclusions and ImplicationsGap 27 can be effective in promoting the healing of superficial epithelial wounds, but in deep stromal wounds {{it has the potential}} to promote inflammatory cell migration and accumulation in the tissue and does not suppress the subsequent neovascularization response. These results support the proposal that Gap 27 acts as a healing agent in the transient, early stages of corneal epithelial wounding.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} organisational {{strategies that}} support early <b>career</b> <b>researchers</b> {{in building a}} successful track record {{which can lead to}} a successful academic research career. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on {{more than a decade of}} experience designing, implementing, and evaluating professional development programs for early <b>career</b> <b>researchers</b> in universities. Findings: If an early <b>career</b> <b>researcher</b> is to achieve long-term success, the first five years after graduating with a doctorate are critical in establishing long-term career success. Professional development programs for early <b>career</b> <b>researchers</b> are more successful if they are supported by organisational strategies around workload, performance management, and accountability. Originality/value: If implemented these organisational strategies can assist early <b>career</b> <b>researchers</b> to build a successful track record which can lead to a successful research career and contribute towards increasing aggregate institutional research performance for universities...|$|R
30|$|Scientists {{described}} cross-sectoral {{hiring practices}} {{that made it}} possible to return to university in case a start-up fails as a further way in which research organisations reduced career risk and supported AE: some scientists had changed quite frequently between employment at universities and start-ups, especially when they had reasons to expect that the start-up would not be a sustainable success. Such a flexible hiring practice in one case made it possible for a network of scientists to try to commercialise the same analytical technology over the past 15 [*]years, even though the first two start-ups they founded never took off in terms of economic success. Some of the core scientists thus had decided to opt for more secure <b>researcher</b> <b>career</b> option again, but were later encouraged by new funding opportunities and the willingness of both, a research institute and the technical university to negotiate economically favourable employment conditions for scientists to create another start-up. In this context, the agency of research managers can be observed in supporting high-risk AE by adapting employment and cross-sectoral hiring practices allowing for non-linear <b>researcher</b> <b>careers.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{stochastic}} model for an author’s production/citation process {{in order to}} investigate the recently proposed h-index for measuring an author’s research output and its impact.

We are able to draw tentative results regarding the dependence of Hirsch’s h-index on each of these fundamental parameters.

The study analysed the publication records of a sample of organizational psychologists, and focused on the outcome measures of productivity (number of articles published per 2 -year period) and research impact (number of times each article was cited within five years of publication). Regression and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analyses identified a trend of decreasing productivity over time, consistent with previous research. However, research impact showed an early-career peak, followed by a decline to a minimum approximately 21 years after first publication, followed by a dramatic increase over approximately the last decade of a <b>researcher’s</b> <b>career...</b>|$|R

30|$|Other {{factors such}} as gender, age, funding, and {{scientific}} equipment also play important roles in research productivity. Gender {{has long been known}} to be associated with significant differences in research productivity, with gender-related differences in research productivity assumed {{to be the result of}} sociological factors, especially females’ tendency towards occupying relatively lower positions in power hierarchies (Zuckerman et al. 1991; Sonnert and Holton 1996; Reskin 1979). Older age has also been found to correspond with a decrease in research productivity (Stephan 1996; Stephan and Levin 1992); this is likely due to the fact that the profits following personal knowledge-based investment decline with advanced age. <b>Researcher</b> <b>career</b> and age tend to have an inverted U-shaped relationship, which reaches its peak at the early stageof the career (Baser and Pema 2004; Oster and Hamermesh 1998).|$|R
40|$|As {{researchers}} we {{are constantly}} working with our literature domains.

Literature Knowledge Domain Visualizations exist which assist users in extracting and interpreting interesting patterns. However, these visualizations tend to be developed without reference to the particular needs of researchers or without addressing the specific challenges of the literature knowledge domain. This paper therefore targets the needs of researchers as they work with their literature. We conducted a qualitative study to understand how researchers make sense of their literature domains. Such information assisted us in coming up with a set of design considerations and guidelines which we believe will assist in building visualizations that are useful for the general research population...|$|R
