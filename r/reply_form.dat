40|$|Background: Communication between {{primary care}} doctors and specialists/hospital doctors {{is vital for}} smooth {{functioning}} of a health care system. In many instances referral and reply letters are the sole means of communication between general practitioners and hospital doctors/specialists. Despite the obvious benefits to patient care, answers to referral letters are the exception worldwide. In Sri Lanka hand written conventional letters are used to refer patients and replies are scarce. Materials and Methods: This interventional {{study was designed to}} assess if attaching a structured <b>reply</b> <b>form</b> with the referral letter would increase the rate of replies/back-referrals. It was conducted at the Family Medicine Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya. A structured referral letter (form) was designed based on guide lines and literature and it was used for referral of patients for a period of six months. Similarly a structured <b>reply</b> <b>form</b> was also designed and both the referral letter and the reply letter were printed on A 4 papers side by side and these were used {{for the next six months}} for referrals. Both letters had headings and space underneath to write details pertaining to the patient. A register was maintained to document the number of referrals and replies received during both phases. Patents were asked to return the reply letters if specialists/hospital doctors obliged to reply. Results: Total of 90 patients were referred using the structured referral form during 1 st phase. 80 letters (with <b>reply</b> <b>form</b> attached) were issued during the next six months. Patients were referred to eight different specialties. Not a single reply during the 1 st phase and there were six 6 (7. 5 %) replies during the 2 nd phase. Discussion: This was an attempt to improve communication between specialists/hospital doctors and primary care doctors. Even though there was some improvement it was not satisfactory. A multicenter island wide study should be conducted to assess the acceptability of the format to primary care doctors and specialists and its impact on reply rate...|$|E

40|$|Background. Pre-conception {{counselling}} has {{the potential}} to reduce pregnancy complications and congenital disorders. The timing of counselling, before conception, is crucial to maximize the benefit. As many couples are unaware of their risk status {{and the fact that the}} first period of pregnancy is crucial, they do not seek information before pregnancy occurs. To reach couples with timely information, it seems that a health care worker needs to take the initiative. In The Netherlands, the GP is in an ideal position to offer pre-conception counselling. Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the interest of women aged 18 - 40 in preconception counselling if this is offered to them by their own GP. Method. A cohort of women (n = 1206) received a personal letter from their own GP with an offer of pre-conception counselling. The women were requested to fill in a <b>reply</b> <b>form,</b> indicating if they were interested, might be interested (if they decided to become pregnant) or were not interested in an invitation for pre-conception counselling. When interested, they were asked to give an indication as to when they were planning a pregnancy. Women who were not interested were requested to give a reason. Results. Almost 70 % of the women returned the <b>reply</b> <b>form.</b> Up to the age of 29 years, at least 80 % of the respondents were interested or might be interested should they decide to have children. Most women, especially the younger women, do not know exactly when they wish to become pregnant. Regardless of age, > 70 % of the respondents were interested. Only 11 % of the respondents indicated specifically that they were not interested in advice. Conclusion. Women are interested in GP-initiated pre-conception counselling. Further research is needed to assess the effect of programmed and systematic pre-conception counselling, offered by GPs, on pregnancy outcome and the health of the children. A randomized controlled trial to assess these effects currently is being conducted at the Department of General Practice in Leiden...|$|E

60|$|At length on the 9th April, Sir T. Shepstone {{informed}} the Government of the Republic {{that he was}} about to declare the Transvaal British territory.

This intimation was received in silence, though all the later proceedings with reference to the Annexation were in reality carried out in concert with the Authorities of the Republic. Thus on the 13th March the Government submitted a paper of ten questions to Sir T.

Since the termination detection of the proposed algorithm is isolated from deadlock detection, it minimizes the message length into a constant without using any explicit technique. It is the significant improvement over the existing algorithms. It also minimizes additional rounds of messages to resolve deadlocks...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: No {{consent for}} health and medical {{research}} is appropriate when the criteria for a waiver of consent are met, yet some ethics committees and data custodians still require informed consent. METHODS: A single-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial: 1129 families of children born at a South Australian hospital were sent information explaining data linkage of childhood immunisation and hospital records for vaccine safety surveillance with 4 weeks to opt in or opt out by <b>reply</b> <b>form,</b> telephone or email. A subsequent telephone interview gauged the intent of 1026 parents (91 %) {{in relation to their}} actions and the sociodemographic differences between participants and non-participants in each arm. RESULTS: The participation rate was 21 % (n¼ 120 / 564) in the opt-in arm and 96 % (n¼ 540 / 565) in the opt-out arm (c 2 (1 df) ¼ 567. 7, p< 0. 001). Participants in the opt-in arm were more likely than non-participants to be older, married/de facto, university educated and of higher socioeconomic status. Participants in the opt-out arm were similar to non-participants, except men were more likely to opt out. Substantial proportions did not receive, understand or properly consider study invitations, and opting in or opting out behaviour was often at odds with parents’ stated underlying intentions. CONCLUSIONS: The opt-in approach resulted in low participation and a biased sample that would render any subsequent data linkage unfeasible, while the opt-out approach achieved high participation and a representative sample. The waiver of consent afforded under current privacy regulations for data linkage studies meeting all appropriate criteria should be granted by ethics committees, and supported by data custodians.

40|$|Even though philanthropy {{tends to}} be {{considered}} a sociological theme rather than an economic one, it poses a number of questions that challenge economists as well. We chose to address the following: How can economists contribute to the theories related to philanthropy? We examine some terms that are used in public economics theory and use them to explore the issues of philanthropy like Samaritan’s Dilemma, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and the Free-Rider Problem, which we consider to be interesting and inspiring (Stone, 2008). We have to find and identify the social values of donors and volunteers rather than their economic values, because economists are not fully able to explain empathy, altruism, and helpful behaviour using traditional economic principles (Rutherford, 2008). The theoretical frame is supported by relevant empirical data. Before starting a large-scale survey, we decided to conduct smaller pre-research probes into people’s attitudes towards altruism, philanthropy, and giving. Even though our sample was not fully representative, the responses that we collected generated interesting findings about people’s views and attitudes. The first wave of data was collected between February and April 2009; the second wave between February and April 2010. Because of this pilot research mission and because of the budget restriction too, the non-representative sample of 823 respondents has been used; students of our Public Economics study programme were used as interviewers. They have also obtained a proper training of the professional sociologist. Students utilized the face to face interviewing method; non-standardized questions were immediately recorded into the <b>reply</b> <b>form.</b> Questions were divided into three groups with typical characteristics. The first one focuses on personal (individual) motives for financial donating (only financial gifts for non-profit organizations). Second part examines the attitudes of individual towards the non-profit sector and its transparency, while the third part analyses the profile of particular groups of donors, which are stratified according to selected characteristics as age, field of activity, income level, etc. This paper deals with the second group of questions. Because of the limited representativeness of the sample, the data are not linked to other observed socio-demographic characteristics and indicators (although we have collected them). Currently we are working on similar, but fundamentally extended and representative survey. In this paper presented preliminary research should serve basically as a reference for identifying dominant donor strategies, motives and attitudes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{examined}} parents' consent {{preferences and}} understanding of an opt-in or opt-out invitation to participate in data linkage for post-marketing safety surveillance of childhood vaccines. METHODS: A single-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial: 1129 families of babies born at a South Australian hospital in 2009 were sent information at 6 weeks post-partum, explaining data linkage of childhood immunisation and hospital records for vaccine safety surveillance, with 4 weeks to opt in or opt out by <b>reply</b> <b>form,</b> telephone, or email. At 10 weeks post-partum, 1026 (91 %) parents were followed up by telephone interview. RESULTS: In both the opt-in (n = 564) and opt-out arms (n = 565), four-fifths of the parents recalled receiving the information (81 % vs. 83 %, P = 0. 35), three-fifths reported reading it (63 % vs. 67 %, P = 0. 11), but only two-fifths correctly identified the health records to be linked (43 % vs. 39 %, P = 0. 21). Parents who actively consented (opted in) {{were more likely than}} those who passively consented (did not opt out) to recall the information (100 % vs. 83 %, P < 0. 001), report reading it (94 % vs. 67 %, P < 0. 001), and correctly identify the data sources (60 % vs. 39 %, P < 0. 001). Most parents supported data linkage for vaccine safety surveillance (94 %) and trusted its privacy protections (84 %). Most parents wished to have minimal or no direct involvement, preferring either opt-out consent (40 %) or no consent (30 %). A quarter (24 %) of parents indicated opt-in consent should be sought; of these, 8 % requested consent prior to every use, 5 % preferred to give broad consent just once and 11 % preferred periodic renewal. Three-fifths of the parents gave higher priority to rapid vaccine safety surveillance (61 %) rather than first seeking parental consent (21 %), and one in seven was undecided (15 %). Although 91 % of parents reported that their babies were fully immunised (76 %) or under-immunised (15 %), and trusted vaccines as safe (90 %), three-fifths (62 %) were very or somewhat concerned about serious reactions. LIMITATIONS: The context of data linkage is limited to vaccine safety surveillance. Only recall and understanding retained at 1 month post enrolment were measured. CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates that informed consent for a population-based surveillance programme cannot realistically be achieved using mail-based opt-in and opt-out approaches. While recall {{and understanding of}} the study's purpose were better among parents who actively consented (opted in) compared with parents who passively consented (did not opt out), participation was substantially lower (21 % vs. 96 % respectively). Most parents appeared to have a poor understanding of data linkage for vaccine safety surveillance; nonetheless, they supported data linkage. They preferred a system utilising opt-out consent or no consent to one using opt-in consent.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{includes three}} theoretical contributions and three empirical studies on peer assessment, a general introduction and final reflections including {{a discussion of}} the results, {{a discussion of the}} educational implications and a discussion of some methodological issues. The first contribution delineates the role that peer assessment can play in raising the consequential validity of an assessment system. First, it clarifies the type of effects that assessment in general can have on learning, and formulates the design principles for increasing the consequential validity of an assessment system. Then, it is shown that peer assessment helps to meet the identified design principles that enhance consequential validity of an ‘assessment system’. More specifically, this dissertation shows that peer assessment can make it more feasible to include challenging and authentic tasks in one’s assessment system; it can help making the assessment demands more clear to the students; it can provide a supplement or a substitute for formative staff assessment; and finally, it can support the response to teacher feedback. The second contribution goes beyond the impact of peer assessment on the consequential validity, and addresses the problem that the output of peer assessment is evaluated against a variety of quality criteria in the literature, resulting in a cluttered picture. The different conceptualisations of quality that appear in the literature are analysed. It is shown that discussions about the most appropriate quality criteria for the output of peer assessment should be brought back to the underlying differences in goals. The most obvious goal is its use as an assessment tool. The learning goal of peer assessment has also been well-established. Investigating the literature more closely yields three additional goals: installation of social control in the learning environment; preparation of students for self-monitoring and self-regulation in lifelong learning; and active participation of students in the classroom. Each of these goals results in different quality criteria. It is argued that only the criteria that are congruent with the goal that one is trying to achieve should be considered when evaluating the quality of peer assessment. The third contribution starts from the observation that, together with the expansion of peer assessment research in the last decade also the diversity of peer assessment practices has increased exponentially. This diversity poses difficulties for practitioners as well as researchers. An inventory of peer assessment diversity is developed that may be of interest to practitioners, as a checklist of important decisions to take or an overview of possible alternatives to a specific practice, and to researchers as a guideline of which information to provide on the particularities of their peer assessment design. The fourth contribution compares the impact of peer feedback and teacher feedback on student learning, addressing the question whether peer feedback can serve as a substitute for expert feedback. A pretest posttest control group design examines the long term learning effects of individual peer feedback and collective teacher feedback on writing assignments in secondary education (N= 85). Moreover, it examines the addedvalue of two measures to support the response of the assessee to peer feedback: an a priori question form and an a posteriori <b>reply</b> <b>form.</b> The study showed no significant difference in students’ progress on essay marks between the condition with plain substitutional peer feedback and the control condition with teacher feedback. However, both groups (plain peer feedback ànd teacher feedback) appeared to make significantly less progress then the groups in the ‘extended’ feedback conditions with the question or the <b>reply</b> <b>form.</b> The fifth contribution examines a group of 68 first year students in secondary education who experienced formative peer assessment for three successive writing assignments. They were divided in two experimental conditions (similar to the ‘extended’ feedback conditions in the previous contribution) and a control condition with plain peer feedback. Students’ progress in writing performance is examined against the constructiveness of the peer feedback they gave and received, and against the condition in which they participated. The effect of the constructiveness of feedback is studied from two directions: {{from the point of view}} of the receiver of the peer feedback (‘assessment for learning’) and from the point of view of the assessor who gave peer feedback (‘assessing for learning’). The results of a repeated measures analysis show a significant positive effect of the composition of the received peer feedback on student performance. The constructiveness of feedback that students provided themselves was not found to improve their learning. Nevertheless, the overall level of constructiveness of the feedback was low. Possible barriers preventing students from providing good feedback, and solutions to these, are discussed in the paper. Finally, the study could not replicate the effect of condition that was found in the fourth contribution. The sixth contribution compares strengths and weaknesses of peer feedback and staff feedback, from the student’s perspective. The study is situated in a university course with 192 first year students in educational sciences. Generic, collective staff feedback on the draft versions of a series of cumulative assignments is complemented with a formative peer assessment system. Starting from a hypothetical forced choice, a further in-depth study addresses the perceived characteristics of both sources of feedback and their perceived contribution to a learning environment that attends the learner’s needs. These perspectives are complemented with reasons reported by students to prefer one of both sources of feedback. Closed-ended questionnaire items are triangulated with qualitative data from open-ended questions. Results show that approximately half of the students were willing to trade in the credibility of staff feedback for the specificity of peer feedback if they have to choose. However, both sources of feedback showed to have their own strengths and weaknesses from the student’s perspective. They were complementary and they even provided the conditions under which the complementary source became better. TABLE OF CONTENTS Preface	 (p. 5) Chapter 1. General introduction	(p. 11) Chapter 2.

40|$|Background: Linked {{electronic}} administrative {{health care}} databases are {{a valuable resource}} {{that can be used}} for postmarketing safety surveillance of medicines and vaccines. Australian legislation mandates that individual consent is required for the collection, use and dissemination of health information. However, the requirement for consent is not absolute; a waiver of consent may be granted by an appropriately constituted human research ethics committee, provided certain qualifying criteria are met and the research (or other activity) is deemed to be substantially in the public interest. In Australia, data linkage research projects are recommended to abide by a best practice protocol, whereby individual privacy is preserved as researchers only receive files of pre-linked data with no personal identifiers. Ethical approval of a waiver of consent is required for the disclosure of identifiable demographic information to an authorised data linkage unit for the purpose of creating a master linkage key. However, some ethics committees and data custodians still require informed consent. Objective: The overall objective of this thesis was to examine the issue of consent in the context of postmarketing surveillance of vaccine safety using data linkage. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was used for the primary aim of determining which method of obtaining parental consent (opt-in or opt-out) provided the highest participation rate. The secondary aims of the RCT were to examine reasons for participation and nonparticipation, socio-demographic factors, consent preferences and attitudes towards a data linkage study of vaccine safety. For this, a follow-up telephone interview of a parent from each family enrolled in the RCT was conducted. The generalisability of findings from the follow-up telephone interview was examined by repeating selected questions in a population-based survey sample of South Australians. Method: A total of 1129 families of children born at a South Australian hospital in 2009 were enrolled in a single-blind parallel group RCT of opt-in and opt-out consent at six weeks post-partum, with four weeks to respond by <b>reply</b> <b>form,</b> telephone or email. Interviews were conducted at 10 weeks post-partum (response rate 91 %, n= 1026). Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) of rural and metropolitan South Australian residents was conducted in 2010 (response rate 56 %, n= 2002). Results: The participation rate was 21 % (n= 120 / 564) in the opt-in arm and 96 % (n= 540 / 565) in the opt-out arm [χ² (1 df) = 567. 7, P< 0. 001]. Participants in the opt-in arm were more likely than non-participants to be older, married or in a de facto relationship, university educated and of higher socioeconomic status. Participants in the opt-out arm were similar to non-participants, except men were more likely to opt out. Substantial proportions did not receive, understand or properly consider study invitations, and opting in or opting out behaviour was often at odds with parents’ stated underlying intentions. Three-fifths of the parents in the opt-in and opt-out arms reported reading the information (63 % vs 67 %, P= 0. 11), but only two-fifths correctly identified the health records to be linked (43 % vs 39 %, P= 0. 21). Parents who actively consented (opted in) were more likely than those who passively consented (did not opt out) to correctly identify the data sources (60 % vs 39 %, P< 0. 001). Data linkage for postmarketing surveillance of vaccines was widely supported by parents enrolled in the RCT and by the wider community (96 % and 94 % respectively) and there was trust in its privacy protections (84 % and 75 %). The majority also preferred minimal or no direct involvement: either opt-out consent (40 % and 40 %) or no consent (30 % and 31 %). Only a quarter preferred opt-in consent (24 % and 25 %). Over half gave higher priority to rapid vaccine safety surveillance (61 % and 56 %) rather than first seeking parental consent (21 % and 27 %), while one in seven was undecided (15 % and 15 %). Despite generally vaccinating their children (91 % and 96 %) and trusting vaccines as safe (90 % and 92 %), many were concerned that vaccines may be ineffective (42 % and 40 %) and may cause serious reactions (62 % and 53 %). Conclusions: The opt-in approach resulted in low participation and a biased sample that would render any subsequent data linkage to be not feasible, whereas the opt-out approach achieved high participation and a representative sample. Neither the opt-in nor opt-out approach was effective in achieving informed consent. The study’s purpose was poorly understood, although comprehension was moderately better when parents actively rather than passively consented. Nonetheless, most parents and the general public supported data linkage for vaccine safety surveillance. A system utilising opt-out consent or no consent was preferred to one using opt-in consent. These findings should inform public health policy and practice; the waiver of consent afforded under current privacy regulations for data linkage studies meeting all appropriate criteria should be granted by ethics committees, and supported by data custodians.
