40|$|The health {{implication}} {{associated with}} exposure from telecommunication masts is demanding attention {{due to the}} expansion of networks and base station installation. This study measures the power density from various telecommunication masts of the different network providers using a <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>meter,</b> an Electrosmog from LESSEMF, USA at a radial distance of 360 m around some selected areas in Delta State. The readings obtained ranges from 0. 03 µW/m- 2 to 5. 66 µW/m- 2. Comparing the result with the recommended international maximum permissible exposure limit of 10 7 µW/m 2 reveals that the exposure levels in these areas are low and as such not able to produce significant health risks among the people of these areas...|$|E
