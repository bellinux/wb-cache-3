2500|$|Commando Club was a US {{operation}} of the Vietnam War that used command guidance of aircraft by the Laos Site 85 radar for ground-directed bombing (GDB) of targets in North Vietnam and clandestine targets in Laos. [...] The Detachment 1, 1043rd <b>Radar</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Squadron, technicians and officers at LS-85 performed radar/computer/communications operations with the Reeves AN/TSQ-81 Bomb Directing Central as Lockheed civilians (volunteers discharged from the USAF for cover). [...] The Combat Skyspot site used typical GDB procedures for Commando Club, including planning missions, providing coordinates to LS-85 and bomber crews, handoff of the bomber from air controllers to LS-85, tracking the aircraft by radiating the bomber's 400 Watt transponder, and radioing of technical data from the bomber such as the airspeed to LS-85 for the AN/TSQ-81 to estimate wind speed on the bomb(s). [...] Due to limited reliability of the LS-85 radios (callsign [...] "Wager Control" [...] at 396.2MHz), an intermediary aircraft (EC-121 or [...] "usually a C-135…decoy ship") provided a [...] "radio relay [...] surveillance/control channel" [...] (callsign: WAGER) between LS-85 and the bomber.|$|E
2500|$|Only the FAA radar {{facility}} in North Truro, Massachusetts, using specialized processing software from the United States Air Force 84th <b>Radar</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Squadron, {{was capable of}} estimating the altitude of TWA 800 after it lost power due to the CWT explosion. Because of accuracy limitations, this radar data {{could not be used}} to determine whether the aircraft climbed after the nose separated. Instead, the NTSB conducted a series of computer simulations to examine the flightpath of the main portion of the fuselage. Hundreds of simulations were run using various combinations of possible times the nose of TWA 800 separated (the exact time was unknown), different models of the behavior of the crippled aircraft (the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft without its nose could only be estimated), and longitudinal radar data (the recorded radar tracks of the east/west position of TWA 800 from various sites differed). These simulations indicated that after the loss of the forward fuselage the remainder of the aircraft continued on in crippled flight, then pitched up while rolling to the left (north), climbing to a maximum altitude between [...] from its last recorded altitude, [...]|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{continuing}} pursuit in developing an ultra-wideband (UWB) time-domain microwave impulse <b>radar</b> nondestructive <b>evaluation</b> (NDE) system at the University of Ilinois at Urbana-Champaign [1]. The UWB time-domain microwave NDE system employs a low power and UWB monocycle pulse source [1]. The advantages of the UWB time-domain system are its better spatial resolution, more information of the test targets, and shorter measurement time. However, the time-domain system suffers a worse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the frequency-domain system. In order to improve the SNR of the time-domain system, the averaging (stacking), time-gating, and wavelets techniques [8, 9] {{can be applied to}} the measurement data...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution ground-penetrating <b>radar</b> (GPR) <b>evaluations</b> of {{structures}} are usually carried out using antennas with high nominal centre frequencies (between 1 and 2 GHz). A comprehensive characterization {{of such an}} antenna would {{make it possible to}} determine the capabilities of a system and obtain accurate data interpretations. This paper describes the experimental determination of the radiation pattern of a commercial 1. 6 GHz antenna, which forms part of a comprehensive experimental characterization. Radiation patterns are closely related to spatial resolution, so the horizontal and vertical resolutions are evaluated first. The footprint of the antenna is then measured in air using simple devices at different distances. The final result is the approximate spatial radiation pattern of the emitted energy, measured in air. Finally, these measurements are also taken in sand to obtain the radiation pattern and footprint of the antenna in this medium. Postprint (published version...|$|R
