2500|$|The car used Ford's {{contemporary}} {{design language}} of the period with the black <b>louvred</b> <b>radiator</b> grille and straked rear lamp clusters, as well as introducing the aerodynamic [...] "bustle-back" [...] bootlid stump (trademarked by Ford as Aeroback) which would be further developed in the forthcoming Sierra and Scorpio; the stump was proven to reduce the car's aerodynamic drag co-efficient significantly, which was a class leading 0.37 at launch.|$|R
50|$|The {{converted}} {{units were}} fitted with two 300 hp Cummins NT-855-R2 in-line six cylinder, four stroke diesel engines coupled to Twin Disc DFFR 10034 automatic lock-up torque converter transmissions. They were also fitted with 620 Class control systems and were then {{able to work}} in multiple with the 900/950 and 620 Class units. During the reconstruction, side mounted radiators were fitted in {{the centre of the}} power car. The original window arrangement of the luggage compartment was not changed, retaining the three original windows. However, one window was removed from the No.2 End passenger compartment to accommodate the larger <b>radiators.</b> The <b>louvred</b> side <b>radiator</b> vents are an aid to distinguish them from their earlier 600 Class sisters. Apart from control system and driver's cab changes, the layout of the trailer cars was unaltered.|$|R

50|$|Essentially the {{new model}} was a revised and updated version of the 308 GTS, which had survived for eight years without any radical change to the overall shape, albeit with various changes to the 3-litre engine. The 328 model {{presented}} a softening of the wedge profile of its predecessor, with a redesigned nose that had a more rounded shape, which was complemented by similar treatment to the tail valance panel. The revised nose and tail sections featured body colour bumpers integral with the valance panels, which reflected the work done concurrently to present the Mondial 3.2 models, with which they also shared a similar radiator grille and front light assembly layout. Thus all the eight-cylinder cars in the range shared fairly unified front and rear aspects, providing a homogeneous family image. The exhaust air louvres behind the retractable headlight pods on the 308 series disappeared, coupled {{with an increase in}} the size of the front lid <b>radiator</b> exhaust air <b>louvre,</b> which had been introduced on the 308 Quattrovalvole models, whilst a new style and position of exterior door catch was also provided. The interior trim also had a thorough overhaul, with new designs for the seat panel upholstery and stitching, revised door panels and pulls, together with more modern switchgear, which complemented the external updating details. Optional equipment available was air conditioning, metallic paint, Pirelli P7 tyres, a leather dashboard, leather headlining to the removable roof panel plus rear window surround, and a rear aerofoil (standard on Japanese market models).|$|R
