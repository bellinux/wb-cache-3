50|$|Part of {{the problem}} Shostakovich had in writing the symphony was that people {{expected}} a successor to his First Symphony, and he no longer believed in writing in the same compositional style. He also had other projects toward which he wanted to direct his attention as soon as possible, and the First Symphony had taken him nearly a year to write. As it turned out, the Commissariat for Enlightenment's propaganda department, Agitotdel, regularly commissioned single-movement works <b>on</b> <b>topical</b> <b>subjects.</b> These works often featured revolutionary tunes and invariably employed sung texts to make the required meaning clear. Furthermore, because of the non-musical orientation of potential audiences, these pieces were not expected to last more than 15 or 20 minutes at most.|$|R

This volume presents 13 papers <b>on</b> <b>topical</b> <b>subjects</b> in ore deposit research viewed in the context of Earth evolution. These diverse, yet interlinked, papers cover topics including: controls on the temporal and spatial distribution of ore deposits; the sources of fluid, gold and other components in orogenic gold deposits; the degree of oxygenation in the Neoproterozoic ocean; bacterial immobilization of gold in the semi-arid near-surface environment; and mineral resources for the future, including issues of resource estimation, sustainability of supply and the criticality of certain elements to society...|$|R

It further examines the political pressure creditors may apply to make vulnerable countries adapt their economic and other policies in line with their wishes. These raise obvious constitutional issues for the debtor country and pose questions of whether and how the inequality of bargaining power in such situations could influence the validity of any measures taken, whether contractual or legislative. Argentina has been chosen as a case study because as a large debtor country, it represents these sorts of issues...|$|R
