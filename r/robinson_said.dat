25|$|The {{construction}} and hospitality industries were strongly {{affected by the}} energy shortage. Brick producers Midland Brick and Austral closed their kilns within the first week after the blast, and on 11 June, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry warned that 14% of local businesses could close. UnionsWA said thousands of workers were being stood down or made to take annual leave, and the secretary Dave <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> mining, timber, beef, pork, laundries and transport industries workers were worst affected. Supplies of gas and electricity to residential customers are protected by state government legislation introduced in 2006.|$|E

25|$|<b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> his {{interest}} in music started after hearing the groups Nolan Strong & the Diablos and Billy Ward and his Dominoes on the radio as a child. Robinson later listed Barrett Strong, a Detroit native, as a strong vocal influence. In 1955, he formed the first lineup of the Five Chimes with childhood friend Ronald White and classmate Pete Moore. Two years later, in 1957, they were renamed the Matadors and included Bobby Rogers. Another member, Emerson Rogers, was replaced by Bobby's cousin Claudette Rogers. The group's guitarist, Marv Tarplin, joined them sometime in 1958. The Matadors began touring Detroit venues around this time. They later changed their name to the Miracles.|$|E
25|$|In late 1989, Robinson gave an {{interview}} with Stern in West Germany accusing a number of figures in American track and field of using and distributing performance-enhancing drugs. In October, The Athletics Congress (later USA Track & Field) had allowed the voluntary resignation of Robinson's former coach Chuck DeBus for giving banned substances to his athletes. <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> in Stern that, while staying at his house in 1982, he had seen Carl Lewis inject himself with a white fluid – what he believed to be testosterone. Furthermore, {{he said he had}} seen Tom Tellez (Lewis' coach) distribute blue pills to his athletes and claimed that these were banned steroids. Robinson had begun training with Bob Kersee in 1987 and he claimed that the coach had advised him on steroid use and given him two types of tablets; oxandrolone and metandienone. Robinson also claimed that he had personally sold a 10-cubic centimetre vial of human growth hormone to Florence Griffith-Joyner in March 1988, just months before she ran two world records and won an Olympic gold medal.|$|E

500|$|The leading Australian cricket {{writer of}} the time, Ray <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "In McCabe the cricketer, you saw McCabe the manurbane, sociable, unpretentious, straightforward, {{incapable}} of anything mean-spirited. In all the pre-war Test series {{he was the best}} liked by both his own team and his opponents." ...|$|E
500|$|Popjustice writer Peter <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> Porcelain Black {{was one of}} pop music's most confusingly styled artists, {{attributing}} {{the shift}} from her edgier, rock-inspired look to one resembling Jennifer Lopez as an attempt by her team to make her image more marketable. Despite the appraisal, he critiqued her song [...] "Rich Boi" [...] as being influenced by rock icons, Def Leppard and Steve Miller Band. In another review, Robinson commented on another record called [...] "One Woman Army" [...] from Porcelain Black's private Hollywood show. Stylistically in vein with Porcelain Black's pop rock genre hybrid, [...] "One Woman Army" [...] contains rapping, which <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> was [...] "completely ridiculous and we love it." [...] Blogging [...] "What a chorus!", he {{called attention to the}} chorus, saying [...] "...haven't we all at some point in our lives been on a battlefield like 'oh my God'?" ...|$|E
5000|$|One oft-quoted anecdote, first {{recorded}} by Cardus, concerned Yorkshire's 1926 captain, Arthur Lupton, who started padding {{up after a}} wicket fell. <b>Robinson</b> reportedly <b>said</b> to him: [...] "Tha's no need to pad up, Major. Wilfred's declaring at t'end o' t'over".|$|R
2500|$|The letter — later {{known as}} the [...] "Danite Manifesto" [...] — {{displayed}} the signatures of eighty-three Mormons, including that of Joseph Smith's brother, and fellow member of the First Presidency, Hyrum. <b>Robinson</b> later <b>said</b> {{that all of the}} signers were Danites.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Robinson</b> later <b>said</b> that [...] "the {{film is a}} human {{story of}} how a {{friendship}} can develop among enemies and how human spirit rises above the atrocities of war. It is an anti-war film set in a period remembered for horrendous slayings of civilians." ...|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert has {{commented that}} in Casablanca [...] "very few shots... are memorable as shots," [...] as Curtiz wanted images {{to express the}} story rather than to stand alone. He contributed {{relatively}} little to development of the plot. Casey <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> Curtiz [...] "knew nothing whatever about story... he saw it in pictures, and you supplied the stories." ...|$|E
500|$|After Wiggins died, several {{well-known}} baseball figures {{commented on}} his death. Longtime Oriole Frank <b>Robinson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "He {{was a very}} bright individual, and you could like the guy. But {{there was always something}} there to back you off." [...] Former Padres player Garry Templeton said that he might have been Wiggins' closest friend, but he said {{that he did not know}} that Wiggins had been ill.|$|E
500|$|Few players enjoyed as {{much success}} as Seymour {{as both a}} pitcher and hitter; only Babe Ruth {{recorded}} more combined pitching victories and hits. As a pitcher, Seymour threw a fastball, a curveball, and a screwball. Orioles catcher Wilbert <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> {{that he had never}} caught a pitcher as wild as Seymour, as opposing batters did [...] "not know whether their head or feet were in most danger." ...|$|E
5000|$|David Laughing Horse <b>Robinson,</b> who <b>said</b> he was {{an elder}} of the tribe of Native Americans, claimed in an e-mail that Tejon Ranch did not own the land beneath the {{proposed}} project.

500|$|Assessing himself, <b>Robinson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'm not {{concerned}} with your liking or disliking me... all I ask is that you respect me as a human being." [...] Regarding Robinson's qualities on the field, Leo Durocher said, [...] "Ya want a guy that comes to play. This guy didn't just come to play. He come to beat ya. He come to stuff the goddamn bat right up your ass." ...|$|E
500|$|Personnel {{changes and}} label {{interference}} frustrated The Black Crowes' attempts {{to follow up}} their 1996 album Three Snakes and One Charm. [...] During May and June 1997, they recorded an album called Band, but it was rejected by their label, American Recordings. [...] Lead singer Chris <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> American [...] "couldn't go with the vibe" [...] and wanted something more [...] "safe". [...] In August, guitarist Marc Ford was fired due to a heroin habit that impaired his performances. [...] Guitarist Rich <b>Robinson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We would be onstage playing 'Remedy', {{and he would be}} playing a completely different song.... We told him to clean up or get out. [...] We assumed, since he loved music and the band, that he would clean up." [...] Bassist Johnny Colt had been losing interest in the band since the recording of Three Snakes and One Charm; his contributions to that album were minimal, as Rich played bass in his stead on all but one track. Colt quit in October to become a yoga instructor.|$|E
500|$|The 1942 {{cover of}} Detective Comics #69, known as [...] "Double Guns" [...] (with the Joker {{emerging}} from a genie lamp, aiming two guns at Batman and Robin), {{is considered one of}} the greatest superhero comic covers of the Golden Age and is the only image of the character using traditional guns. <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> that other contemporary villains used guns, and the creative team wanted the Joker—as Batman's adversary—to be more resourceful.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, Hank Greenberg, as {{a member}} of the Pittsburgh Pirates and playing his final season, was one of the few ballplayers to give the Brooklyn Dodgers' Jackie Robinson, the majors' first black player in many years, a warm welcome. <b>Robinson</b> later <b>said,</b> [...] "Class tells. It sticks out all over Mr. Greenberg".|$|R

25|$|Alex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister {{and leader}} of the Scottish National Party, agreed with the view that the BBC was biased in favour of {{retaining}} the union. However, in an interview given after his clash with <b>Robinson,</b> he <b>said</b> he believed it was the fault of the BBC's London-based staff rather than BBC Scotland itself.|$|R
500|$|Trumble {{was tall}} and thin, [...] in height. His long face {{featured}} prominent ears and a large nose, while his long arms and uncommonly long and strong fingers assisted his bowling. The cricket writer Ray <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> of Trumble: [...] "El Greco, with his lengthening touch {{would have liked to}} draw Trumble. Hugh's lantern shaped head set on a column of a neck would have given the Spaniard a halfway start." [...] English cricketer and author Plum Warner called him [...] "That great camel, Hughie Trumble." ...|$|E
500|$|Booth had a {{reputation}} for walking when {{he knew that he was}} out, without waiting for the umpire's decision, and he was regarded as a player and leader of the highest principles. He was known for his record of instilling high standards of conduct into his players and prevented them from showing dissent towards unfavourable umpiring decisions. <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "if a prize were offered for fairplaymanship among Australia's post-war cricketers Brian Booth ought to win it hands down". Lawry regarded Booth as one of the most gentlemanly cricketers that he knew.|$|E
500|$|In June 1947, {{after four}} non-title bouts, Robinson was {{scheduled}} to defend his title {{for the first time}} in a bout against Jimmy Doyle. Robinson initially backed out of the fight because he had a dream that he was going to kill Doyle. A priest and a minister convinced him to fight. Sadly, his dream proved true. On June 25, 1947 Robinson dominated Doyle and scored a decisive knockout in the eighth round that knocked Doyle unconscious and resulted in Doyle's death later that night. <b>Robinson</b> <b>said</b> that the impact of Doyle's death was [...] "very trying".|$|E

5000|$|Lee <b>Robinson</b> later <b>said,</b> [...] "I don't {{think it}} was a good script and I don't think that we had a very strong {{supporting}} cast and it was the first picture that we had done in which Chips didn't play the lead... I think our mistake there was to make a picture not geared for Chips." ...|$|R
