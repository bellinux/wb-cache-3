Then, the calculation for acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficient</b> at different frequencies and critical frequency of building members are carried out, also the <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficient</b> curves varied with frequency are gained. Comparison with the results of the <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficient</b> with different thicknesses and materials, the results show that: the sound <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficient</b> is so low to be neglected below the critical frequency; while it tends to a constant value of 1 above the critical frequency, and the maximum value occurs at critical frequency.

40|$|A {{careful study}} {{of the effect of}} a {{metallic}} reflector upon cyclotron radiation emanating from a uniform plasma is made in which the angular polarization and frequency dependence of both the cyclotron radiation and the metallic reflector is taken into account. The properties of the metallic reflector then enter in a natural way and share equal status with the properties of the plasma. The <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the ratio of the cyclotron radiation absorbed by the reflector to that generated by the plasma, becomes a function of the electron temperature and the plasma depth to cyclotron radiation (or simply plasma depth). The <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficient</b> is determined for both slab and cylindrical geometries for electron temperatures from 20 to 120 keV and plasma depths from 10 to the 19 th to 10 to the 27 th MKS. A simple analytic approximation is given for the <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficient</b> for each geometry, and the results are then applied to a low-beta thermonuclear device based on the D-D reaction.

40|$|Abstract Evaluation of {{the effect}} of {{radiation}} on evapotranspiration estimates and drought indices The severity of drought can be inferred from water balance, of which evapotranspiration is a component. The evapotranspiration estimates are often based on the FAO 56 methodology with the net radiation as the main input. Usually, however, the latter is not directly measured. This study investigates to which extent can the direct solar radiation and the long-wave net radiation measurements be replaced by calculation according to FAO 56 with constant or locally optimised <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficients</b> or, for the long-wave net <b>radiation,</b> the <b>coefficients</b> according to Penman (1948). The problem is demonstrated on data from the Solar and Ozone Observatory in Hradec Králové for 2011 and 2012. On average, the estimates of solar radiation are satisfactory even with the standard coefficients and can be improved by local optimisation of the coefficients. The estimates for particular days may considerably differ from reality. The long-wave net radiation estimate according to FAO 56 is, on average, by about 30 % lower than the measured long-wave net radiation or an estimate thereof based on locally optimised or Penman's coefficients, with the average differences between any two of the last three methods much smaller (less than 9 %). The inaccuracy of estimates for particular days is considerable, too. The average reference crop evapotranspiration according to FAO 56 with standard coefficients is therefore considerably higher (by about 15 %) than analogous evapotranspiration obtained from the measured radiation or according to FAO 56 with optimised or Penman's <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The cause is that grass in the observatory was not irrigated. It therefore occasionally suffered from water stress and got overheated. The use of FAO 56 with the radiation inputs measured or calculated using other than the standard <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficients</b> may underestimate the evapotranspiration and the need for irrigation...|$|R

We particularly study the evolution of the zero-velocity surfaces for various values of the <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficient</b> b 0 and investigate also the cases with b 0 > 1 (that is, radiation surpasses gravity) since for these cases, significant changes in the dynamics occur. We then locate numerically the onset of three-dimensional periodic motion from planar periodic motion by calculating the orbits' vertical critical stability. Many families of three-dimensional periodic motions are presented and the regions of the three-dimensional space where these motions take place, are determined.

It is shown that the magnetic field produces a totally reflecting layer. Consequently, the atmosphere can be divided into two distinct regions. In the lower region, the solution can be written as a linear combination of an upward and a downward propagating wave, and in the upper region the solution, which satisfies the upper boundary condition, decays exponentially or behaves like a constant. These two regions are connected by a region in which the reflection and transmission of the waves takes place. Moreover, the heat radiation affects only the lower region and changes the sound speed from the adiabatic value to the isothermal one.

40|$|Summary. We {{propose a}} {{simplified}} method for {{the calculation of}} near field accelerogranis. It {{is based upon the}} hypothesis that, in the course of dynamic faulting, tlie dominating part of the seismic radiation is emitted by the rupture front. As tlie rupture moves smoothly it radiates continuously, generating the low-frequency part of the field. High-frequency waves are produced by jumps in the rupture velocity and abrupt changes in the stress intensity factor. The wave-front discontinuities created in this fashion are evaluated by asymptotic methods and may be propagated away from the source by ray theoretical methods. We apply our technique t o the evaluation of asymptotic near field accelerograms for a circular fault buried in a half-space. The agreement with numerical accelerograms calculated by full-wave theory is very satisfactory. Two problems are given particular emphasis: (1) the phase shifts introduced by focusing and (2) a simpler method, based on dislocation theory, is proposed for the calculation of tlie <b>radiation</b> <b>coefficients</b> from a discontinuously moving rupture front. ...|$|R
