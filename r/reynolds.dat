5|$|In 1927, <b>Reynolds</b> and <b>Reynolds</b> won a {{contract}} to provide all of the business forms for Chevrolet dealerships. The company opened new offices throughout the U.S. in the 1930s, and had 19 sales offices {{by the end of}} the decade. A controlling interest in the company was acquired in 1939 by Senior Richard Hallam Grant, ending the <b>Reynolds</b> family ownership. He became the company's president in 1941. A new printing facility was built in 1948 in Celina, Ohio, and another in 1953 in Dallas, Texas, in addition to the one built in Los Angeles in 1928. <b>Reynolds</b> became a public company in 1961. In the 1960s, <b>Reynolds</b> opened new printing facilities in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, New Jersey and Canada. In 1963, <b>Reynolds</b> expanded into Canada through the acquisition of the automotive business unit of Windsor Office Supply, forming <b>Reynolds</b> and <b>Reynolds</b> (Canada) Ltd. By the end of the decade it had about $50 million in revenues.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, <b>Reynolds</b> and <b>Reynolds</b> signed {{agreements}} {{with the rest of}} the Big Three automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, <b>Reynolds</b> had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. <b>Reynolds</b> acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. <b>Reynolds</b> and <b>Reynolds</b> acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming <b>Reynolds</b> Healthcare Systems. <b>Reynolds</b> Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists. From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business forms and computer businesses outside the automotive industry for a total of $155 million. By 2000, <b>Reynolds</b> and <b>Reynolds</b> had revenues of $800 million and more than one-third of its users were General Motors dealerships. It sold the Information Solutions Group (ISG), which primarily sold business forms and supplies to non-automotive companies, that year to the Carlyle Group for $360 million.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Chrysler Building was the <b>Reynolds</b> Building, {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. <b>Reynolds.</b> Prior to his involvement in planning the building, <b>Reynolds</b> was best known for developing Coney Island's Dreamland amusement park. However, when the amusement park was destroyed in a fire in 1911, <b>Reynolds</b> turned his attention to Manhattan real estate, where {{he set out to}} build the tallest building in the world.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} legal {{disputes}} between <b>Reynolds</b> and General Motors (GM) began in 2007. Through a GM program called the Integrated Dealership Management System (GMIDMS), <b>Reynolds</b> provided software to GM dealerships through GM. When <b>Reynolds</b> {{would not make}} changes to its software requested by GM, GM alleged it was a breach of contract. A settlement was reached in 2008, which ended Reynolds' participation in GM's program.|$|E

40|$|Heat Exchanger Is an {{equipment}} to exchange heat between {{two kinds of}} fluid or more. As a device to exchange heat from hot fluid to colder fluid, a heat exchanger {{is supposed to have}} a great Nusselt and <b>Reynold</b> number. Theoretically, the increase of fluid flow would increase the Nusselt and <b>Reynold</b> number. Based on this phenomenon, a research is carried on to find out how the fluid flow affects the Nusselt and <b>Reynold</b> number of a Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger. The experimental results demonstrated by the increasing speed of the flow direction of hot fluid on the hot fluid inlet temperature is constant, then Nusselt and <b>Reynold</b> number would increase...|$|R

5|$|At first clients sent hole-punched {{accounting}} records to a <b>Reynolds</b> processing center, which would print a complete accounting that is {{sent back to}} the client by mail. The development of modems and internet technology in the 1970s led to several advancements. <b>Reynolds</b> provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand minicomputers at 80 <b>Reynolds</b> locations, which provided computing power and printed forms. This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to <b>Reynolds</b> in tapes and allowed daily access to online services. By the end of the 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership. In the years 1978 and 1982, <b>Reynolds</b> introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, the VIM-based dealer {{management}} {{computer systems}} had helped <b>Reynolds</b> acquire a 45 percent market-share {{and was on}} its fifth generation with 9,000 installations. In 1987 <b>Reynolds</b> moved to a software model with its first release of the ERA dealer management software, which was a complete rewrite of its prior programming. ERA allows users to manage logistics for sales, finance, service and parts across departments. That same year <b>Reynolds</b> developed a digital, graphical parts catalog program for selecting and ordering automotive parts. This {{was followed by the}} Vehicle Locators and Marketing Network sales toolsets.|$|E
5|$|He {{began the}} 1943 {{season in the}} Indians' bullpen, making his first start on June 20. Indians player-manager Lou Boudreau used <b>Reynolds</b> as a {{reliever}} in between starts due to his resiliency. <b>Reynolds</b> led the American League (AL) in strikeouts in 1943 with 151 and hits allowed per nine innings pitched with 6.34; however, he was third in walks allowed with 109. <b>Reynolds</b> led the AL in walks with 130 in 1945.|$|E

40|$|More general {{correlations}} between pressure drop and gas-solid flow variables are {{developed from the}} present experimental data. The correlation was modeled for a pneumatic conveying system in a vertical pipe. The transition boundary between dense and dilute regimes is constructed from the pressure drop correlations. The gas-solid particle flow variables are quantified by the gas <b>Reynold</b> (Nref) and the solid Froude (Frp) numbers. The dense flow regime is indicated by the decrease of the pressure drop {{with the increase of}} the gas <b>Reynold</b> number. In contrary, the dilute regime exhibits the increase of the pressure drop with the gas <b>Reynold</b> number. The proposed correlations were built at the range of gas <b>Reynold</b> number f from 360 to 500 and solid Froude from 0, 01 to 0, 02...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Reynold’s</b> {{number is}} {{directly}} proportional to the velocity and diameter of the tube. Note that NR is {{directly proportional to}} the mean velocity {{as well as the}} diameter. A <b>Reynold’s</b> number of less than 2300 is laminar fluid flow, which is characterized by constant flow motion, whereas a value of over 4000, is represented as turbulent flow. Due to its smaller radius and lowest velocity compared to other vessels, the <b>Reynold’s</b> number at the capillaries is very low, resulting in laminar instead of turbulent flow.|$|R
5|$|In 1921, <b>Reynolds</b> {{rented a}} large {{plot of land}} {{at the corner of}} Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street with the {{intention}} of building a tall building on the site. After several years of delays, <b>Reynolds</b> hired the architect William van Alen in 1927 to build a forty-story building on the plot.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Heublein was {{acquired}} by R. J. <b>Reynolds,</b> the tobacco giant. In July 1986, <b>Reynolds</b> sold KFC to PepsiCo for $850 million (around US$1.8 billion in 2013). PepsiCo made the chain a part of its restaurants division alongside Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The Chinese market was entered in November 1987, with an outlet in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, <b>Reynolds</b> {{fell ill}} with {{multiple}} myeloma, {{a type of}} blood cancer that often attacks the bones, {{and was forced to}} stop anchoring in April. His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for <b>Reynolds</b> while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, <b>Reynolds</b> died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.|$|E
