Moreover, they suggested correctly, as was later verified by Simon (1934), that this quantity was responsible for the difficulty in solidifying helium even at absolute zero. In 1924 Robert Mulliken provided direct evidence for the zero-point energy of molecular vibrations by comparing the band spectrum of B10O and B11O: the isotopic difference in the transition frequencies between the ground vibrational states of two different electronic levels would vanish if there were no zero-point energy, in contrast to the observed spectra. Then just a year later in 1925, with the development of matrix mechanics in Werner Heisenberg's famous article [...] "Quantum theoretical re-interpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations" [...] the zero-point energy was derived from quantum mechanics.|$|E
50|$|In {{a further}} study, Rhodewalt (1991) {{presented}} the handicap to {{only half of}} the participants and gave success and failure feedback. The <b>results</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for self-protection but not for self-enhancement. Participants in the failure feedback, handicap absent group, attributed their failures to their own lack of ability and reported lower self-esteem to the handicap-present, failure-feedback condition. Furthermore, the handicap-present failure group reported levels of self-esteem equal to that of the successful group. This evidence highlights the importance of self-handicaps in self-protection although it offers no support for the handicap acting to self-enhance.|$|E
50|$|In the past, it was {{suggested}} that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., & Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased mortality rate of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The <b>results</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.|$|E

50|$|In April 2014, the U.S. Senate {{debated the}} Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress).

The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Later in 2014, voters in the Republican-controlled states of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota considered ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage above the national rate of $7.25 per hour, which were successful in all 4 states.

50|$|Crick's work on {{childhood}} aggression demonstrated that, as a group, {{boys are}} more physically aggressive than girls. Her study hypothesized that this finding reflects {{a lack of}} research on forms of aggression {{that are relevant to}} girls rather than an actual gender difference in levels of overall aggressiveness.The form of aggression hypothesized to be typical of girls, relational aggression, was assessed with a peer nomination instrument in third- through sixth-grade children. <b>Results</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for the validity and distinctiveness of the construct of relational aggression, defined as acts intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships. In addition to finding that girls tended to be more relationally aggressive than boys, she found evidence that relationally aggressive children were at risk for serious adjustment difficulties.|$|E

[...] That is, as the degree of structure in an interview increases, the more likely interviewers can successfully predict how well the person will do on the job, especially when compared to unstructured interviews. In fact, one structured interview that included a) a predetermined set of questions that interviewers were able to choose from, and b) interviewer scoring of applicant answers after each individual question using previously created benchmark answers, showed validity levels comparable to cognitive ability tests (traditionally {{one of the best}} predictors of job performance) for entry level jobs.|$|E

50|$|Neurophysiological {{evidence}} {{has also been}} presented to prove an ACE. This research used a behavioural paradigm as well as Event-Related Potential (ERP) to record brain activity, allowing the researchers to explore the neural brain markers of the ACE paradigm in semantic processing and motor responses. ERP was particularly beneficial in helping the researchers to investigate the bi-directional hypothesis of action-sentence comprehension, which proposes that language processing facilitates movement and movement also facilitates language comprehension. In the study participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand or no manual action. They were then required to press a button to indicate {{their understanding of the}} sentence. Each participant was assigned a hand-shape, either closed or open, which was required to activate the button. As well as two groups (closed or open hand-shapes), there were three different categories relating to hand-shape: compatible, incompatible and neutral. Behavioural results from the study showed that participants responded quicker when the hand-shape required to press the response-button was compatible with the hand-shape inferred by the sentence. ERP <b>results</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> to support the bi-directional hypothesis, showing that cortical markers of motor processes were affected by sentence meaning, therefore providing evidence for a semantics-to-motor effect. ERP results also demonstrated a motor-to-semantics effect as brain markers of comprehension were modified by motor effects.|$|E
