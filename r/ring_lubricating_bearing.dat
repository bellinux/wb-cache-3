Lubrication was achieved by flowing oil through axial grooves and radial holes machined in the inner ring of the bearing. Test conditions were a thrust load of 667 N (150 lb), shaft speeds from 48, 000 to 72, 000 rpm, and an oil inlet temperature of 394 K (250 F). Data from tests where the distribution of the total oil supplied to the inner ring was 50 percent for bearing lubrication and 50 percent for bearing inner ring cooling were compared with those where the distribution pattern was 25 percent lubrication and 75 percent cooling.

In calculations of oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> oil viscosity changes resulting from increasing temperature are usually taken into consideration. In water <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> the isothermal model is usually applied. In most cases, it is a correct method because of negligible viscosity changes resulting from increasing pressure and temperature in the lubrication film. In reality, water has surprisingly unique properties. One of them is strong influence of pressure and temperature on viscosity. In addition, salinity of sea water influences viscosity, as well.

In the case of product <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings,</b> the present mechanical limits, film thickness, and temperature limits, as related to different material and lubricant combinations, are reviewed by reference to bearing theory of operation and actual pump application. The role of various lubricant and material properties and mechanical design features are reviewed for these types of bearings. In addition, the importance of proper lubricant circulation and filtering is highlighted. The relationship of the above design parameters to specific load, speed, and temperature is examined to produce limiting operating envelopes for these types of bearings, similar to that previously developed for oil <b>lubricated</b> tilting pad <b>bearings.</b> Magnetic bearing applications completely circumvent the dry running and contamination issues raised by product <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> and offer unmatched capabilities in pump diagnostic.

40|$|An {{important}} issue in hydropower and other industries {{is the increasing}} demand for introduction of environment friendly solutions. Mineral oil based lubricants have long been used in various sliding bearings in hydropower stations. Their use in aqueous environments however raises concerns about the environmental impact if they leak into downstream water. This has necessitated research in replacing mineral oils with more bio-degradable lubricants and {{the ultimate goal of}} ‘oil-free’ hydropower generating machines. Replacing oil with water however poses many challenges. Due to considerably lower viscosity of water compared to that of turbine oils, the water <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> are likely to operate in boundary/mixed lubrication regime for relatively longer period. Therefore choice of the materials and their tribological performance are very important for the bearings operating in the boundary/mixed lubrication regimes. Application of compliant polymers in water <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> introduces many advantages which cannot be achieved with coatings (DLC, etc.) or ceramics. Most previous tribological studies on polymers have been carried out in dry conditions and only a few studies in presence of water have been reported. This work is thus aimed at investigating the tribological behavior of some selected polymer materials in water lubricated conditions. The results of these studies provide an insight into polymers’ tribological performance in boundary/mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication regime and associated wear mechanisms in presence of water. Polymers also enhance performance of oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings.</b> Application of polymers in the oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> provides a smooth transition from oil <b>lubricated</b> Babbitt <b>bearings</b> to water <b>lubricated</b> polymer <b>bearings.</b> Therefore a part of this thesis is also aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics of several polytetrafluoroethylene based materials at the onset of sliding (break-away friction) at different pressures and temperatures. The results of this study show significantly lower breakaway friction of PTFE materials compared to Babbitt at all pressures and temperatures. SEM investigations revealed wear modes of the PTFE materials and the abrasive nature of hard fillers. Bronze-filled, carbon-filled and pure PTFE were found to provide lower and more stable break-away friction and generally superior properties compared to the other materials.

Graphite lubricants containing three additives (silver, phosphate glass, and zinc orthophosphate) were evaluated from room temperature to 540 C. Two hard coats were also evaluated. The evaluation of these lubricants, using a burnishing method of application, shows a reasonable transfer of lubricant and wear protection for short duration testing except in the 200 C temperature range. The graphite lubricants containing silver and zinc orthophosphate additives were {{more effective than the}} phosphate glass material over the test conditions examined. Traction coefficients ranged from a low of 0. 07 to a high of 0. 6. By curve fitting the traction data, empirical equations for slope and maximum traction coefficient as a function of contact pressure (P), rolling speed (U), and temperature (T) can be developed for each lubricant.

Furthermore, {{it is well known}} that, unlike for liquid <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings,</b> tribologically valid accelerated lifetests can be carried out for self-lubricating and other solid-lubricated bearings simply by increasing the operational speed of the lifetest unit.

This paper draws data from a number of sources to review some of the benefits and constraints associated with use of self-lubricating bearings and proposes a “hybrid ” accelerated lifetest methodology by which still more highly accelerated lifetests, achieving acceleration factors of 20 - 30 or more can be justified for self-lubricating bearing systems.
