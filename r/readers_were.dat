5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his <b>readers</b> <b>were</b> already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common during the 17th century—11 people were made Benchers between 1600 and 1630—and in 1614 {{one of the}} Benchers appointed was explicitly allowed {{to be a member}} of Pension. This became more common, creating a two-rank system in which both Readers and Benchers were members of Pension. However far more <b>Readers</b> <b>were</b> appointed than Benchers—50 between 1600 and 1630—and it appeared that Readers would remain the higher rank despite this change.|$|E

5|$|During Romania's {{restrictive}} communist period, {{which lasted}} between 1948 and 1989, the critical evaluation of Ion Creangă's work went through several periods, complementing political developments. Throughout {{the first part}} of this interval, when socialist realism was politically imposed on Romanian letters, Creangă was spared the posthumous censorship which affected several other classical writers (see Censorship in Communist Romania). His work was officially praised for its aesthetic qualities, but its association with the condemned Junimea was omitted from critical commentary, and <b>readers</b> <b>were</b> instead referred to Creangă as a realist critical of bourgeois society. In 1948, the new authorities granted him posthumous membership in the Romanian Academy. The following year, at the height of Soviet occupation, official critic Barbu Lăzăreanu controversially described Creangă as a writer indebted to Russian folklore.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and <b>Readers</b> <b>were</b> those who had been called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First English Civil War led to a complete suspension of legal education, and from November 1642 until July 1644 no Pension meetings were held. Only 43 students were admitted during the four years of the war, and none were called to the Bar. Meetings of Pension resumed after the Battle of Marston Moor but the education system remained dormant. Although <b>Readers</b> <b>were</b> appointed, none read, and no moots were held. In 1646, {{after the end of}} the war, there was an attempt to restore the old system of readings and moots, and in 1647 an order was made that students were required to moot at least once a day. This failed to work, with Readers refusing to read, and the old system of legal education completely died out.|$|E
