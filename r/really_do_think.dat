2500|$|On September 2, Gun Runner {{made his}} next {{start in the}} Woodward Stakes at Saratoga, going off as the {{prohibitive}} favorite {{in a field of}} five. Trainer Todd Pletcher entered two horses, with Neolithic assigned to set a fast early pace in the hopes of tiring Gun Runner, while Rally Cry was intended to close from behind. The race went much as expected, with Gun Runner stalking Neolithic for the first 6 furlongs before swinging to the lead on the far turn. Gun Runner maintained his momentum and eventually won by [...] lengths over the late-closing Rally Cry. His time of 1:47.43 was the fastest Woodward Stakes since the race was moved to Saratoga in 2006 and earned Gun Runner a career high Beyer Speed Figure of 115. He was also given a Timeform US rating of 142, the highest Timeform US rating ever achieved. [...] "That was better than the Whitney, just stronger, faster overall," [...] said Geroux.

2500|$|Initially {{there existed}} a {{fluidity}} between all three national orientations, with people changing their allegiance throughout their lives, and until approximately {{the turn of}} the 20th century members of all three groups frequently identified themselves by the ethnonym Ruthenians (Rusyny). Initially the most prominent ideology was Ruthenianism, or Rutenstvo. Its proponents, referred to as [...] "Old Ruthenians", were mainly wealthier or more influential priests and the remnants of the nobility who had not been Polonized, and were quite loyal to the Habsburgs to whom they owed their higher social standing. While emphasizing their separateness from the Poles in terms of religion and background, these people nevertheless maintained an elitist attitude towards the peasantry. They frequently spoke the Polish language among themselves, and tried to promote a version of Church Slavonic with elements of the local Ukrainian vernacular as well as the Russian language as a literary language for western Ukraine [...] This language was never standardized, however. The language actually spoken by the common people was viewed with contempt. Old Ruthenians rejected both Ukrainophilism and Russophilism. [...] The Ukrainian thinker Mykhailo Drahomanov wrote [...] ironically of them, that [...] "you Galician intellectuals <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> of creating some kind of Uniate Paraguay, with some kind of hierarchical bureaucratic aristocracy, just like you have created an Austro-Ruthenian literary language!" [...] Old Ruthenianism dominated Galicia's cultural scene until the mid-19th century, when it was supplanted by Russophilia (many of the proponents of old Ruthenianism eventually became Russophiles).|$|E
