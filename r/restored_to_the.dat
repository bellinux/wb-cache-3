5|$|In 1660 Charles II was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne and {{ownership}} of the castles changed once again. Beaumaris was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> control of the Bulkeley family, traditionally the constables of the castle, who promptly stripped the castle of any remaining materials, including the roofs, and Conwy was returned to the Conway family, who stripped down the castle for lead and timber, reducing it to a ruin as well. Charles' new government regarded Caernarfon's castle and town walls as a security risk and ordered them to be destroyed, but this order was never carried out, possibly because of the costs involved in doing so.|$|E

5|$|After Charles II was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne in 1660, Eyre was {{dismissed}} {{and replaced by}} Edward Strange. The future of the castle was uncertain; Charles gave orders to demobilise the garrison and briefly considered having the fortress demolished altogether. Instead of maintaining a regular garrison, in 1666 {{it was decided to}} staff the castle using soldiers deployed from the Isle of Wight instead, from a unit belonging to Sir Robert Holmes, the island's governor. Hurst had meanwhile fallen into disrepair, delaying the plans to deploy Holmes' men until 1671. Repairs were carried out and, by 1675, a conventional garrison and almost thirty guns were stationed at Hurst.|$|E

A counterattack by Mahmud Pasha from Euboea was repulsed in January 1829. In April, Naupaktos was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greeks; in May, Augustinos Kapodistrias recaptured the symbolic town of Messolonghi. However, it took the military victory of Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 and the Treaty of Adrianople before the independence of Greece was recognised.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of {{terminating}} in {{the park}} at the outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed to follow US16 to the car ferry docks. The last section of gravel highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US131 freeway was opened north of Cedar Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway it used in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US131 again.|$|E
5|$|Charles II was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne in 1660 {{and reduced}} both {{the size and}} the wages of the garrisons across the kingdom. The Device Forts {{initially}} remained {{at the heart of}} the defences along the south coast, but their design was by now badly antiquated. Deal continued to play an important role in defending the Downs during the Second and Third Dutch Wars, supported by local trained bands, and castles such as Hurst, Portland and Sandgate remained garrisoned. Others, however, were decommissioned with Sandsfoot closing in 1665 following a dispute over the control of the defences, and Netley being abandoned to fall into ruin.|$|E

5|$|During the Interregnum, Gallants Bower was {{decommissioned}} but {{the castle}} itself remained in use; the Carews' house was pulled down. A governor, Sir John Fowell, {{was appointed to}} run the castle and the local defences, and to prevent smuggling. Charles II was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne in 1660 and initially granted Dartmouth Castle, and the former annual subsidy, to the town once again. By 1662, however, the fortifications in Dartmouth were garrisoned by a royal force of 23 men and Sir John, who continued in his post as captain and governor until 1677. Fears of a Dutch and French attack resulted in the castle being maintained until the 1690s.|$|E
