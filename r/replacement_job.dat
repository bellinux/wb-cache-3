30|$|Similarly, Berk et al. (2010) {{show that}} low debt levels {{consistent}} with those in practice can be fully attributed to the human costs associated with financial distress.

In this situation, managers limit the use of debt to mitigate their exposure to bankruptcy risk. In contrast to Jaggia and Thakor (1994), the approach chosen by Berk et al.

30|$|Such {{conflicts}} {{can play}} out {{in a number of}} ways, all of which potentially undermine flexibility and the willingness to engage in problem-solving tasks. The parties may haggle over work assignments, which may be costly in terms of lost production time, but by remaining within the area of potential agreement, neither side pushes the other to the point of termination. Alternatively, one might take advantage of the difficulty the other faces to find a <b>replacement</b> <b>job</b> or employee, and threaten termination in order to push the other party outside its zone of acceptance. These are sometimes referred to as ‘Dove’ and ‘Hawk’ strategies respectively. Both can be destructive of cooperation as they both send a signal to the other party that its partner is no longer seeking the joint benefit. Game theorists show that the best strategy, sometimes called ‘Bourgeois’, is to cooperate but be prepared to punish breaches should they occur. Its success requires that expected costs of sanctions facing the party in breach should exceed its expected gains, and that the offended party should always be ready to punish breaches if necessary (Maynard Smith 1982; Bowles 2004; Gibbons and Henderson 2012). 17 Following this line of argument, one can see that the greater the loss of benefit from foregone cooperation compared with the immediate gain from breach, the stronger the incentive for continued cooperation, which can then give rise to a virtuous circle comprising further on-the-job learning and growing mutual benefits.|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{pipeline}} assets {{systems are}} crucial to society. The deterioration of these assets and the optimal allocation of limited budget for their maintenance correspond to crucial challenges for water utility managers. Decision makers should be assisted with optimal solutions to select the best maintenance plan concerning available resources and management strategies. Much research effort has been dedicated {{to the development of}} optimal strategies for maintenance of water pipes. Most of the maintenance strategies are intended for scheduling individual water pipe. Consideration of optimal group scheduling replacement jobs for groups of pipes or other linear assets has so far not received much attention in literature. It is a common practice that replacement planners select two or three pipes manually with ambiguous criteria to group into one <b>replacement</b> <b>job.</b> This is obviously not the best solution for job grouping and may not be cost effective, especially when total cost can be up to multiple million dollars. In this paper, an optimal group scheduling scheme with three decision criteria for distributed pipeline assets maintenance decision is proposed. A Maintenance Grouping Optimization (MGO) model with multiple criteria is developed. An immediate challenge of such modeling is to deal with scalability of vast combinatorial solution space. To address this issue, a modified genetic algorithm is developed together with a Judgment Matrix. This Judgment Matrix is corresponding to various combinations of pipe replacement schedules. An industrial case study based on a section of a real water distribution network was conducted to test the new model. The results of the case study show that new schedule generated a significant cost reduction compared with the schedule without grouping pipes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Sickness absence has an {{important}} impact on employers (e. g. reduced productivity, high costs) and employees (e. g. <b>replacement,</b> <b>job</b> loss). Therefore, we investigated possible reduction by exploring avoidable sickness absence. Methods A questionnaire was filled out by 2, 954 Dutch workers (internet panel of a marketing research company, 2005). We obtained data on self reported sickness absence (6. 5 months), including {{the main reason for}} each sickness absence spell (4 health and 3 non-health reasons), self-reported work-relatedness of absence and workers' opinion on whether their absence could have been shorter or prevented, and on 12 listed factors that might have contributed to sickness absence. For each of these factors we calculated the avoidable absence fraction (AAF), analogous to the epidemiological population attributable risk. Results A total of 1, 233 workers reported sickness absence. The absence rate was 4. 46 %. For 11 % of the absence rate health was not the main reason. Yet, when non-health was reported as the main reason for absence, health still contributed in half the cases. 35 % of the absence rate was mainly work-related. 15 % of the workers mentioned that their sickness absence could have been shorter or prevented. The AAFs of contributory factors were 0. 129 for home related factors, 0. 136 for work-related factors and 0. 101 for (occupational) health care and guidance factors. In total, the AAF showed that 21. 5 % of the absence rate can be considered possibly avoidable. Conclusion According to the studied workers sickness absence rate can be reduced. In reducing the absence, one should not only consider factors from the home and work situation, but also from (occupational) health care. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

In Help Wanted: Projections of Jobs and Education Requirements through 2018, Anthony Carnevale, Nicole Smith, and Jeff Strohl (2010) attempt to quantify this need. They project that, by 2018, about two-thirds (63 percent) of all jobs (including both new and <b>replacement</b> <b>jobs)</b> will require at least some postsecondary education or training, up from 59 percent in 2008 and just 28 percent in 1973 (Carnevale, Smith, and Strohl 2010).

40|$|AbstractSodium cooled {{fast breeder}} {{reactors}} constitute {{the second stage}} of India's three -stage nuclear energy programme, for effective utilization of the country's limited reserves of natural uranium and exploitation of its large reserves of thorium. The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, is a loop type, sodium cooled fast reactor. Its main aim is to provide experience in fast reactor operation, large scale sodium handling and to serve as a test bed for irradiation of fast reactor fuels & materials. FBTR was built on the lines of the French Rapsodie-Fortissimo reactor, with modifications to make it a generating plant. FBTR went critical on 18 th Oct 1985 with a small core of 22 fuel subassemblies of a unique, high Pu carbide fuel. The core was rated for 10. 5 MWt. The TG was rolled and synchronized to the grid in July 1997. Reactor power was progressively increased by enlarging the core, to reach 18. 6 MWt. Several challenges in reactor operation came on the way, which were successfully overcome. A large number of modifications were carried out to improve the plant performance. The reactor coolant used (Sodium) is highly reactive when exposed to atmosphere and also becomes highly active on exposure to neutron radiation. These properties of sodium make it essential to handle it carefully and safely within a leak tight containment. During course of operation of the reactor, a number of sodium laden components viz. pumps, valves, cold traps, Rupture discs, level probes, shielding plugs, control rod drive mechanisms, experimental assemblies, piping etc. are required to be removed for various maintenance, modification and <b>replacement</b> <b>jobs.</b> This paper details the experience with operation and maintenance of India's only one fast reactor power station...|$|R
