5000|$|Gram-positive cell {{walls are}} thick and the {{peptidoglycan}} ( [...] {{also known as}} murein) layer constitutes almost 95% of the cell wall in some gram-positive bacteria and as little as 5-10% of the cell wall in gram-negative bacteria. The gram-positive bacteria take up the crystal violet dye and are stained purple. The cell wall of some gram-positive bacteria can be completely dissolved by lysozymes which attacks the bonds between GA and MA. In other gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, the walls are resistant to the action of lysozymes. They have O-acetyl groups on carbon-6 of some MA residues.The matrix substances in the walls of gram-positive bacteria may be polysaccharides or teichoic acids. The latter are very widespread, but have been found only in gram-positive bacteria. There are two main types of teichoic acid: <b>ribitol</b> teichoic acids and glycerol teichoic acids.

The structure of LTA varies between the different species of Gram positive bacteria and may contain long chains of <b>ribitol</b> or glycerol phosphate. LTA is anchored to the cell membrane via a diacylglycerol. It acts as regulator of autolytic wall enzymes (muramidases). It has antigenic properties being able to stimulate specific immune response and is released from the bacterial cells mainly after bacteriolysis induced by lysozyme, cationic peptides from leucocytes, or beta-lactam antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Haemophilus influenzae type b is a {{bacterium}} with a polysaccharide capsule; {{the main component of}} this capsule is polyribosyl <b>ribitol</b> phosphate (PRP). Anti-PRP antibodies have a protective effect against Hib infections. Thus, purified PRP {{was considered a}} good candidate for a vaccine. However, the antibody response to PRP diminished rapidly after administration. This problem was due to recognition of the PRP antigen by B cells, but not T cells. In other words, even though B cell recognition was taking place, T cell recruitment (via MHC class II) was not, which compromised the immune response. This interaction with only B cells is termed T-independent (TI). This process also inhibits the formation of memory B cells, thus compromising long term immune system memory.|$|E
50|$|Pseudallescheria boydii is a saprotrophic fungus {{with broad}} hyphae growing up to 2-5 µm in width. Colonies change in colour from white to pale brown {{and develop a}} cottony texture with maturity. After a 2-3 week {{incubation}} period, cleistothecia may form containing asci filled with eight fusiform, one-celled ascospores measuring 12-18 × 9-13 µm in diameter. This fungus grows on most standard media, maturing in 7 days. Its primary nutrients are the sugars xylose, arabinose, glucose, sucrose, <b>ribitol,</b> xylitol and L-arabinitol. It cannot assimilate maltose or lactose; however, {{it is able to}} assimilate urea, asparagine, potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate. The optimal temperature for growth is 25 C and the fungus is generally considered to be mesophilic, although it can grow at higher temperatures (up to 37 C) as well. Asexual reproduction manifests in one of two forms: the Scedosporium type (the most common type) and the Graphium type. Scedosporium apiospermum forms greyish-white colonies with a grey-black reverse. The conidia are single-celled, pale brown and oval in form. Their size ranges from 4-9 x 6-10 µm and their development is annellidic.|$|E
40|$|The {{incubation}} of Aerobacter aerogenes PRL-R 3 with <b>ribitol</b> {{resulted in}} the induction of <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase and d-ribulokinase, coordinately controlled enzymes of the pathway of <b>ribitol</b> catabolism. A dehydrogenase-negative mutant was unable to induce d-ribulokinase activity following incubation with <b>ribitol.</b> Similar experiments using a kinase-negative mutant resulted in normal induction of <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase, {{as compared to the}} wild-type PRL-R 3 strain. Constitutive or induced cells for l-fucose isomerase were capable of catalyzing the isomerization of d-arabinose to d-ribulose. In contrast to the experiments using <b>ribitol</b> as the substrate, the isomerization of d-arabinose {{resulted in the}} induction of d-ribulokinase with dehydrogenase-negative cells. These data indicated that d-ribulose, rather than <b>ribitol,</b> acts as the inducer of the enzymes for <b>ribitol</b> degradation...|$|E
40|$|Induction {{studies on}} Aerobacter aerogenes strain PRL-R 3, using <b>ribitol</b> as the inducer-substrate, {{indicated}} that two enzymes of <b>ribitol</b> catabolism, <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase and d-ribulokinase, are coordinately induced. The utilization of d-arabinose {{as a substrate}} resulted in the induction of <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase as well as d-ribulokinase. Mutants which were constitutive for <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase were also constitutive for d-ribulokinase. In contrast, d-xylulokinase and d-arabitol dehydrogenase {{did not appear to}} be coordinately controlled. Induction studies and examination of d-arabitol dehydrogenase constitutive mutants indicated that the three enzymes of the converging pathways for d-arabitol and d-xylose catabolism are under separate control...|$|E

40|$|Wild-type {{strains of}} Escherichia coli {{were unable to}} utilize L-ribose for growth. However, L-ribose-positive mutants could be {{isolated}} from strains of E. coli K- 12 which contained a <b>ribitol</b> operon. L-ribose-positive strains of E. coli, isolated after 15 to 20 days, had a growth rate of 0. 22 generation per h on L-ribose. Growth on L-ribose was found to induce the enzymes of the L-arabinose and <b>ribitol</b> pathways, but only ribitol-negative mutants derived from strains originally L-ribose positive {{lost the ability to}} grow on L-ribose, showing that a functional <b>ribitol</b> pathway was required. One of the mutations permitting growth on L-ribose enabled the mutants to produce constitutively an NADPH-linked reductase which converted L-ribose to <b>ribitol.</b> L-ribose is not metabolized by an isomerization to L-ribulose, as would be predicted on the basis of other pentose pathways in enteric bacteria. Instead, L-ribose was metabolized by the reduction of L-ribose to <b>ribitol,</b> followed by the conversion to D-ribulose by enzymes of the <b>ribitol</b> pathway...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the wall}} <b>ribitol</b> teichoic acid and the {{membrane}} glycerol teichoic acid (lipoteichoic acid) from Lactobacillus plantarum NCIB 7220 have α-d-glucosyl substituents.

The specificity of antibodies to the wall <b>ribitol</b> teichoic acid depends primarily on the α-d-glucosyl substituents, as the antibodies cross-react with α-d-glucosyl-substituted glycerol teichoic acids but not with an unsubstituted <b>ribitol</b> teichoic acid.

40|$|Klebsiella aerogenes strain W 70 has {{separate}} inducible pathways for {{the degradation}} of the pentitols <b>ribitol</b> and d-arabitol. These pathways are closely linked genetically as determined by transduction with phage PW 52. There are two regulatory sites for the <b>ribitol</b> catabolic pathway as defined by loci for mutations to constitutive synthesis of <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase and d-ribulokinase, rbtB and rbtC. The two control sites are separated by a site represented by the dalB 22 mutation. This mutation deprives the cell {{of the ability to}} induce synthesis of d-arabitol dehydrogenase and d-xylulokinase activities. Two additional regulatory mutations for the d-arabitol pathway, dalC 31 and dalC 37, map to the opposite side of rbtB 13 relative to dalB 22. The order of the genetic sites thus far determined for this region is dalK-dalD-dalC 31, dalC 37 -rbtB 13 -dalB 22 -rbtC 14 -rbtD-rbtK, where dalK and dalD represent structural genes for the kinase and dehydrogenase of the d-arabitol pathway, respectively, and rbtK and rbtD represent the corresponding genes for the <b>ribitol</b> pathway. The two mutations that lead to constitutive synthesis of the d-arabitol-induced enzymes, dalC 31 and dalC 37, have different phenotypes with regard to their response to xylitol. The growth of dalC 31 is inhibited by xylitol, but the toxicity can be reduced by increasing the levels of <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase either by induction with <b>ribitol</b> or by selection of a <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase-constitutive mutation...|$|E
40|$|In Escherichia coli C, the {{catabolism}} of the pentitols <b>ribitol</b> and D-arabitol proceeds through separate, inducible operons, each {{consisting of}} a dehydrogenase and a kinase.

40|$|Mutations in genes {{required}} for the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan lead to muscle and brain diseases known as dystroglycanopathies. However, the precise structure and biogenesis of the assembled glycan are not completely understood. Here we report that three enzymes mutated in dystroglycanopathies can collaborate to attach <b>ribitol</b> phosphate onto α-dystroglycan. Specifically, we demonstrate that isoprenoid synthase domain-containing protein (ISPD) synthesizes CDP-ribitol, present in muscle, and that both recombinant fukutin (FKTN) and fukutin-related protein (FKRP) can transfer a <b>ribitol</b> phosphate group from CDP-ribitol to α-dystroglycan. We also show that ISPD and FKTN are essential for the incorporation of <b>ribitol</b> into α-dystroglycan in HEK 293 cells. Glycosylation of α-dystroglycan in fibroblasts from patients with hypomorphic ISPD mutations is reduced. We observe {{that in some cases}} glycosylation can be partially restored by addition of <b>ribitol</b> to the culture medium, suggesting that dietary supplementation with <b>ribitol</b> should be evaluated as a therapy for patients with ISPD mutations...|$|E
40|$|Many gram-positive {{bacteria}} form substituted polymers of glycerol and <b>ribitol</b> {{phosphate esters}} known as teichoic acids. Utilizing the relative specificity of cold concentrated hydrofluoric acid in the hydrolysis of polyphosphate esters it proved possible to quantitatively assay the teichoic acid-derived glycerol and <b>ribitol</b> from gram-positive bacteria added to various soils and sediments. The lipids are first {{removed from the}} soils or sediments with a one phase chloroform-methanol extraction and the lipid extracted residue is hydrolyzed with cold concentrated hydrofluoric acid. To achieve maximum recovery of the teichoic acid <b>ribitol,</b> a second acid hydrolysis of the aqueous extract is required. The glycerol and <b>ribitol</b> are then acetylated after neutralization and analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. This technique together with measures of the total phospholipid, the phospholipid fatty acid, the muramic acid and the hydroxy fatty acids of the lipopolysaccharide lipid A of the gram-negative bacteria {{makes it possible to}} describe the community structure environmental samples. The proportion of gram-positive bacteria measured as the teichoic acid glycerol and <b>ribitol</b> is higher in soils than in sediments and increases with depth in both...|$|E

Similarly, <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase was purified after growth on <b>ribitol,</b> d-arabinose, and xylitol, and from the <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase-constitutive mutant. d-Arabitol dehydrogenase was obtained after growth on d-arabitol or d-xylose, and xylitol dehydrogenase was obtained after growth on xylitol.

These kinases could be distinguished only by their substrate and immunological specificity. <b>Ribitol</b> dehydrogenase and d-arabitol dehydrogenase could be distinguished by several properties, but the properties of xylitol dehydrogenase were always similar to <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase. In all cases, individual kinases or dehydrogenases produced by different inducers had identical properties.
