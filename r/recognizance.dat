5|$|In 1557 Pleydell {{was charged}} in the chamber by former {{associate}} John Berwick, who accused him of protecting two felons from punishment. The men (one convicted of murder and the other of abetting a theft) were Pleydell's servants {{in his capacity as}} chief ranger and keeper of Savernake Forest. Berwick, assumed by the historian Stanley Thomas Bindoff to be acting out of jealousy, was the previous holder of the titles and involved in a dispute with Pleydell over the rights to property near the forest. Pleydell enlisted the aid of serving and former members of parliament, including William Button, Henry Clifford, Griffith Curteys and John Hooper, in July. Their duty was to examine witnesses and evidence {{on both sides of the}} argument, and they presented a list of 240 articles concerning the servants' activities. Pleydell's efforts were seen by the court as an attempt to undermine the integrity of the Queen's justices and, perhaps, to incite rebellion among his supporters. This, in addition to breaching a commitment to meet regularly with the Privy Council under <b>recognizance</b> after his imprisonment, led to his indictment by Attorney-General Edward Griffin during the Michaelmas term. Pleydell was incarcerated in the Tower of London, forfeiting his two £500 bonds. He was released for good behaviour on 19 December, and left for the home of cloth merchant Thomas Garrard (a kinsman of the William Garrard with whom Pleydell served as Member for Wootton Bassett) after posting a £1,000 bond.|$|E

5000|$|Letter-Books A and B are chiefly {{concerned}} with <b>recognizances</b> of debts. These <b>recognizances</b> have their value as illustrating the commercial intercourse {{of the citizens}} of London with Gascony and Spain in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, more especially in connection with wine and leather; the names of those sworn as [...] "correctors" [...] (coretaru), or licensed brokers, of those commodities, appear on the first page of Letter-Book A. Another prominent feature of both these books is the record of the Assize of Bread, as set from time to time by the municipal authorities; although also irregularly kept, with little respect paid to chronological order. The <b>recognizances</b> in Letter-Book A terminate in 1294, and are immediately followed by a series of deeds extending from 1281 to 1293. The remainder of the volume is occupied by miscellaneous matters and additions of a later date, inserted wherever space permitted.|$|R
25|$|Tensions {{remained}} high {{between the}} Municipal and Metropolitan police, {{especially during the}} next several months, and their feud continued throughout the summer. It was a common occurrence for Municipal officers to interfere in arrests by Metropolitan patrolmen. Criminals were often either released by Municipal officers or, when brought to a precinct, let go upon their own <b>recognizance.</b> This rivalry encouraged the criminal underworld {{to go on a}} crime spree and was partially responsible for the Dead Rabbits Riot in July 1857. By the fall of 1857, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Supreme Court's decision and Mayor Wood quietly agreed to disband the Municipal police force.|$|E
25|$|On March 16, 2007, {{three of}} the five police {{officers}} involved in the shooting were indicted by a grand jury. Officer Gescard Isnora, who fired the first shot, and Officer Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 shots, were charged with first- and second-degree manslaughter, second-degree reckless endangerment and first- and second-degree assault. Detective Marc Cooper was charged with two counts of reckless endangerment. All three detectives pleaded not guilty at the arraignment hearing on March 19, 2007. Detectives Isnora and Oliver were released on bail, and Detective Cooper was released on his own <b>recognizance.</b> Oliver and Isnora initially faced up to 25 years in prison for the charges.|$|E
25|$|Upon arrest, the {{individual}} is brought to a police station for processing and detained until a trial date is set. At the initial court hearing, which can be months or years after the arrest, the accused may retain an attorney at personal expense or be assigned a court-appointed attorney, although lawyers are not ensured access to their clients before trial. The individual is then tried in court, where a judge renders a verdict. Although the prison code provides for prompt access to family members, human rights organizations and families reported inconsistent application of the code, with some families waiting {{as long as a}} year to see relatives. Civil and criminal defendants had the right to bail hearings and possible release from detention on their own <b>recognizance.</b>|$|E
5|$|The justices were {{assisted}} by {{a staff of}} over 50 officials, most of whom sat in Westminster Hall but also kept offices at the various Inns of Court. The Chief Clerk was the Custos Brevium, appointed by the crown, but in practice clerking matters were handled by his deputy, as the office was a royal favour rather than a serious judicial appointment. The crown also appointed the court chirographer, the officer responsible for noting final concords and filing records of fines. Another high-ranking clerk was the Clerk of the Outlawries, an under-clerk of the Attorney General for England and Wales, who was tasked with recording <b>recognizances</b> to protect {{the interests of the}} King in common law matters. In 1541 his position was replaced with the office of Clerk of the King's Process. Other offices created during the reign of Henry VIII include the Clerk of the <b>Recognizances</b> in 1432, who recorded debts secured by <b>recognizances</b> and the office of Receiver of Debts, who was tasked with receiving and recording money coming into the court via debts and fines, and was first appointed in 1536.|$|R

[...] He {{edited the}} Flying Post for some years, and also {{wrote for the}} Medley in 1712. In September William Hurt and Ridpath were arrested for {{libellous}} and seditious articles, but were released on bail. On October 23 they appeared before the Court of Queen's Bench, and were continued on their <b>recognizances.</b> In February 1713 Ridpath was tried and, in spite of an able defence by leading Whig lawyers, was convicted. Sentence was postponed, and when Ridpath failed to appear, as ordered, in April, his <b>recognizances</b> were escheated, and a reward offered for his discovery; but he had fled to Scotland, and from thence to Holland.|$|R

25|$|Cokayne's {{involvement}} with Cromwell then drew {{him into the}} affairs of Lincolnshire. Walter Tailboys, a neighbour and client of Cromwell, together {{with some of his}} relatives and friends, had initiated an assize of novel disseisin. Eight plaintiffs and four defendants were named, although others were involved, and a number of tenements were at stake on or close to the Lincolnshire coast, at Theddlethorpe, Mablethorpe, Saltfleetby, Strubby, Carlton, Gayton and Withern, suggesting a contest between groups of property speculators. The plaintiffs had triumphed at the initial hearing and the defendants had decided to come to terms. They promised to accept the judgement and make a quitclaim, but wanted to limit their losses. Both sides seem to have recruited guarantors among serving MPs: the 1431 parliament, which was Cokayne's tenth, was assembling as the legal process continued. The defendants obtained recognizances to guarantee their quitclaim from John Culpepper, just elected MP for Rutland, and from Thomas Strange, a Midlands landowner. Cokayne agreed to enter into a <b>recognizance</b> of £1000 in Derbyshire to guarantee that Tailboys would press the issue no further after the judgement had been affirmed. This was matched by Sir Richard Stanhope, then serving as MP for Nottinghamshire, whose wife Maud was Lord Cromwell's daughter. It was later alleged that about this time Cromwell had illegally tried to recruit Cokayne, Vernon and others into his affinity by offering them his livery.|$|E
500|$|Farmer pled {{not guilty}} to all five federal charges on April 25, 2013. He was {{released}} on his own <b>recognizance,</b> and his trial date was set for July 2. U.S. Magistrate Robert Wier denied Farmer's request {{to leave the country}} in May to celebrate his girlfriend's 40th birthday in Cancún, Mexico. Wier also ordered the recently unemployed Farmer to seek employment, surrender his passport, and remain within the state until the trial. In response to Farmer's lawyer's request to delay the trial until February 2014 [...] a request the prosecution called [...] "excessive" [...] Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove rescheduled the trial for October 22.|$|E
500|$|Savage led the {{battalion}} into Yosemite Valley in 1851, {{in pursuit of}} around 200Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya. On March 27, 1851, the company of 50 to 60men reached {{what is now called}} Old Inspiration Point, from where Yosemite Valley's main features are visible. Chief Tenaya and his band were eventually captured and their village burned, fulfilling the prophecy an old and dying medicine man had given Tenaya many years before. The Ahwahnechee were escorted by their captor, Captain John Bowling, [...] to the Fresno River Reservation, and {{the battalion}} was disbanded on July 1, 1851. Life on the reservation was unpleasant and the Ahwahneechee longed for their valley. Reservation officials consented and allowed Tenaya and some of his band to return on their own <b>recognizance.</b>|$|E
500|$|In one period, {{particularly}} under Edward III, the Lord Chancellor also possessed {{some common}} law jurisdiction, {{able to hear}} cases for petitions of right and the repeal of letters patent, {{as well as other}} cases in which the King was a party. He heard cases on <b>recognizances,</b> the execution of Acts of Parliament and any case in which an officer of the Court of Chancery was involved. Records show that he enrolled <b>recognizances</b> and contracts, and also issued writs commanding a sheriff to enforce them. Carne considers that this common law jurisdiction was likely down to a failure to separate the common law jurisdiction and the equity jurisdiction possessed by the Lord Chancellor, a failure that continued into the 16th century; Sir Edward Coke wrote that in the Chancery there was both an ordinary court and an [...] "extraordinary" [...] one.|$|R
5000|$|The council {{were not}} sure what to do, but summoned the Bishops to appear before them on Friday 8 June, which became known as Black Friday. The bishops could have given their own <b>recognizances</b> for coming up for trial, and thereby avoided being imprisoned before their trial. Sancroft had urged this; even Compton agreed to it; but Sancroft changed his mind. The bishops seem to have been angling for a delay in the trial {{proceedings}} - by refusing to give <b>recognizances,</b> they would have the right to delay the trial until the beginning of Michaelmas term on 23 October. The king, however, wanted a speedy trial, {{and the only way to}} get it, apart from convincing the Bishops to give their own <b>recognizances,</b> was to imprison them in the Tower of London before their trial; within the Tower, however, they had complete freedom. Their imprisonment lasted only a week and had the effect, desired by the king, of speeding up the proceedings so that a trial could be held in June. But, in Hilaire Belloc's deliberately ironic words, [...] "Compton had had the satisfaction of seeing a vast popular gathering acclaiming these fathers in God on the way to the horrid dungeon of a Tyrant."Lord Jeffreys, the Lord Chancellor, advised the King to drop the prosecution; on being overruled he asked caustically if the King was prepared to take advice from his Ministers or whether [...] "the Virgin Mary is to do all".|$|R
5000|$|According to {{contemporary}} reports, those arrested were marched four abreast down Woodborough Road (formerly Mapperley Hills Road) {{and from there}} along Redcliffe Road (formerly Red Lane) to the Mansfield Road. At this point a mob attacked the police and military with a volley of stones. At the top of York Street just before arrival at the Nottingham House of Correction, there was another mêlée. The Dragoon Guards cleared the streets by galloping about and brandishing their swords. [...] By 4 pm all the prisoners were within the town gaol. Later in the afternoon about {{two hundred and fifty}} were released, on entering into their own <b>recognizances</b> of £5 each, to keep the peace for twelve months. About fifty of the rest were committed for trial and arraigned before Colonel Rolleston at the Quarter Sessions. All were found guilty and some were sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour for six, four or two months and the rest discharged upon entering into <b>recognizances</b> to keep the peace.|$|R
500|$|On May 8 at 4a.m., white {{business}} leaders agreed {{to most of}} the protesters' demands. Political leaders held fast, however. [...] The rift between the businessmen and the politicians became clear when {{business leaders}} admitted they could not guarantee the protesters' release from jail. On May 10, Fred Shuttlesworth and Martin Luther King Jr. told reporters that they had an agreement from the City of Birmingham to desegregate lunch counters, restrooms, drinking fountains and fitting rooms within 90days, and to hire blacks in stores as salesmen and clerks. Those in jail would be released on bond or their own <b>recognizance.</b> Urged by Kennedy, the United Auto Workers, National Maritime Union, United Steelworkers Union, and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) raised $237,000 in bail money ($ in [...] ) to free the demonstrators.

500|$|While officially {{the matter}} was {{considered}} closed, many individual MPs had doubts, although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage. Wigg later said that he left the House that morning [...] "with black rage in my heart because I knew what the facts were. I knew the truth." [...] Most newspapers were editorially non-committal; only The Guardian, under the headline [...] "Mr Profumo clears the air", stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value. Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re-emergence of Keeler, in Madrid. She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused, adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent {{and that she had}} many friends in important positions. She claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date. She was required to forfeit her <b>recognizance</b> of £40, but no other action was taken against her.|$|E
500|$|Bundy {{was arrested}} on August 16, 1975 in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb, by a Utah Highway Patrol officer who {{observed}} him cruising a residential area in the pre-dawn hours, then fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car. The officer noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car. He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick, and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, {{he had found the}} handcuffs in a dumpster, and the rest were common household items. However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and Bundy's name from Kloepfer's December 1974 phone call. In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn, and a brochure advertising the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful (where Debra Kent had disappeared), but nothing sufficiently incriminating to hold him. He was released on his own <b>recognizance.</b> (Bundy later said that searchers missed a collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released.) ...|$|E
