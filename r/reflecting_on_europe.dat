In 1884 the trustees of the British Museum acquired, by purchase, a volume containing numerous coloured drawings by Downman, among which were several portraits, now separately mounted. He also left several volumes of exquisite drawings, executed in red and black chalk, of which Ralph Neville Grenville published a catalogue (Taunton, 1865). He also painted some miniature portraits. Engravings were also made by Bartolozzi and others. Many of his portraits have attached to them remarks of considerable importance respecting the persons represented.|$|R

40|$|An ambitious {{program of}} High-Speed Railway (HSR) is under {{construction}} in China and already soon the network will overtake its counterparts in <b>Europe.</b> <b>Reflecting</b> <b>on</b> experiences in <b>Europe,</b> the authors explore the conditions for place making qualities of six new HSR station areas in China. The superb inter-city connectivity of the new infrastructure nodes raises a lot of expectations about {{the economic and social}} potential of the station areas, but the experiences in Europe thus far are very differentiated. With regards to the attraction of economic activities usually the existing differences between different economic regions are reproduced rather than shaping completely new conditions. Also the expectations of developing completely new integrated urban centers around stations in the urban periphery are rather ambitious. The paper questions the planning responses to HSR development in Chinese cities and investigates the institutional conditions that frame these responses. The authors explore how the plans for Chinese HSR station development account for their objectives and <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> the potential of the station area planning by investigating the institutional parameters of urban development...|$|R

Mackay then scored his second goal of the season, in a 2-0 win over Inverness CT on 15 October 2011. Despite the {{departure}} of McInnes and was replaced by newly Manager Lomas, MacKay first team place remained unaffected and scored two goals in two games against Hibernian and Hearts, which both games was a victory for St Johnstone. Then, in the fifth round of Scottish Cup against Hearts, with both side drew 1-1, MacKay was sent-off {{for the first time in}} his professional career, which left him surprised, though he was proud of the record. Mackay would miss the replay match in the Scottish Cup, which St Johnstone were out. At the end of the season, with St Johnstone qualify for Europe despite finishing sixth place, Mackay made forty appearance and scoring four times in all competitions. <b>Reflecting</b> <b>on</b> qualifying for <b>Europe,</b> Mackay reacted with mixed emotions, due to his sympathy for his former team-mate James McPake, who played for Hibernian in the Scottish Cup, and his fears of not playing in Europe if FIFA barred Scottish clubs, citing ongoing situation at Rangers. At the end of the 2011-12 season, Mackay scored four times in 40 appearance in all competitions.|$|R

40|$|This article {{proposed}} a psychological mechanism for improving future work motivation by <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences. Previous studies {{have claimed that}} future motivation is maintained by present self-affirmation and a future ideal, and have overlooked the effect of <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences. Rather, it has been claimed that <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences leads to overconfidence or anxiety, and impairs future motivation. In contrast, this article points out that people can maintain motivation through (1) imagining clearly their future ideal selves (setting goals), (2) <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences related to the ideal, and (3) acquiring lessons from the past. In a review of previous studies, we examined the process of <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences to improve future motivation. We showed that people with a clear ideal (goal) <b>reflected</b> <b>on</b> past experiences related to that ideal, and acquired lessons and mental rewards from the past, thus improving their motivation. A new mechanism for maintaining work motivation by <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences was presented, taking into consideration acquired lessons and mental rewards...|$|R

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen Australian {{international}} business education focus increasingly on the Asia-Pacific region. Basic reasons for this include the rapid growth and economic development of courtries {{in the region as}} well as a realisation that Australia is part of the Asia-Pacific rim and not a European outpost. Indeed, a greatly increased proportion of Australian trade is with countries in the Asia-Pacific area. The Gamaut report on Australia and North-East Asia is a further recent statement of the apparent importance of the area for Australia. The economic and political face of Europe, however, is changing rapidly. Western Europe is moving to economic integration through 1992. Countries in eastern Europe are adopting more market-based economic structures to match new political forms. Hence, the 19902 ̆ 7 s may prove to be the 2 ̆ 2 European decade 2 ̆ 2. In this paper, we examine some impacts of these changes in <b>Europe</b> <b>on</b> prospects for Australian business and particularly <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> Ihe potetial for a refocusing of Australian international business education <b>on</b> <b>Europe...</b>|$|R
5000|$|It was in Hartford, in {{the spring}} of 1830, that Woodbridge met William A. Alcott. Alcott would later {{remember}} the meeting, writing that he had entered a tavern, just as Woodbridge was leaving. He asked the publican who that was and was told that it was William Channing Woodbridge, who was a great friend of education. Alcott followed Woodbridge down the street and introduced himself. He was astonished when Woodbridge responded to the introduction with a question; [...] "what is the great practical error in all of our school education?" [...] Without hesitation, Alcott replied that it was,”the strange effort to crowd the intellect at the expense of health, morals, and everything else.” These words, Alcott wrote, “bound as friends for life.” [...] By 1831, Woodbridge had shifted his base of operations from Hartford to Boston. The first joint effort of Woodbridge and Alcott was the publication of an improved educational journal. In 1831, Woodbridge purchased the American Journal of Education, which was renamed the Annals of Education. Over the next five years Alcott and Woodbridge contributed many articles and textbook reviews to the Annals. Woodbridge and Alcott filled the Annals {{with a wide range of}} articles <b>on</b> educational topics, <b>reflected</b> <b>on</b> developments in <b>Europe,</b> and pressed for educational reform. They were particularly concerned with women’s education and with incorporating the ideas of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and the French reformer Joseph Jocotot into American schools, both of whom had stressed the importance of observation and of geography. By the time hard times swept away their control of the Annals in 1836, its reputation as the leading American educational publication was firmly established.|$|R

40|$|Die Jahre 2014 und 2015 geben mehrfachen Anlass zum Nachdenken über Europa: Vor 100 Jahren begann der 1. Weltkrieg, vor 75 Jahren der 2. Weltkrieg, 2015 sind es 70 Jahre seit Ende des 2. Weltkriegs, das 20. Jahrhundert war ein Jahrhundert der Katastrophen mit verheerenden Konsequenzen für Europa. 1989 / 90, vor 25 Jahren, eröffnete sich mit dem Fall des „Eisernen Vorhangs“ völlig unerwartet ein Kairos für eine Neugestaltung ganz Europas in Freiheit. Ein Kairos kann aber auch versäumt oder verpatzt werden. Es sind hintergründige Kräfte und Orientierungen auszumachen, die wesentlich die Entwicklung Europas und der Welt in den letzten Jahrhunderten bestimmten und auch für die Zukunftsfähigkeit Europas entscheidend sein dürften. Die spezielle Ausrichtung der europäischen Neuzeit, ihr „prometheisches“ Erforschen von Natur, Mensch und Gesellschaft, führte in der „Industriellen Revolution“ zu einer gigantischen Steigerung der wissenschaftlich-technisch-ökonomischen Effizienz. Es ist ethisch unbestreitbar, dass jedes menschliche Tun auf den Sinn und die Wirkungen dieses Tuns achten und dafür Verantwortung übernehmen muss. Wenn die wissenschaftlich-technisch-ökonomischen Effizienzsteigerungen nicht entsprechend auf die Menschenwürde der Betroffenen, auf Gerechtigkeit und Gemeinwohl achten, dann führt dies individuell und gesellschaftlich zu destruktiven Konsequenzen, zu Konflikten und Kriegen. Aus den Katastrophen hat man in Europa gelernt und mit dem neuen Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmodell „Öko-soziale Marktwirtschaft in einem demokratischen Rechtsstaat“ den Wiederaufbau und relativ hohe Lebensqualität geschafft. In der „Globalisierung“ vollzieht sich derzeit eine globale „ 2. Industrielle Revolution“. Analog zur „ 1. Industriellen Revolution“ ergeben sich daraus große Herausforderungen und dramatische Risiken. Europa hat die längsten Erfahrungen mit hocheffizienter Wissenschaft, Technik und Wirtschaft, hier wurden mehr als anderswo {{positive}} und negative Erfahrungen gemacht. Wenn es – in Freiheit geeint – eine zukunftsfähige Kultur wissenschaftlich-technisch-ökonomischer Effizienz unter Beachtung der personalen Werte und des Gemeinwohls entwickelt, dann werden sich die Menschen damit identifizieren und dafür engagieren. Dann und nur dann kann Europa auch in der globalisierten Welt eine entsprechende Position einnehmen. Mitteleuropa hat dabei spezielle Chancen und Aufgaben. 2014 and 2015 {{gave us a}} lot {{of reasons}} to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>Europe.</b> 100 years ago the First World War began and 75 years ago the Second World War. 2015 marks 70 years {{since the end of the}} Second World War. The 20 th century was a century of catastrophes with devastating consequences for Europe. In 1989 / 90, 25 years ago, the fall of the “Iron Curtain” had completely unexpectedly opened up a kairos for reshaping the whole of Europe in freedom. But a kairos can be wasted or bungled. There are profound forces and currents which have fundamentally determined the development of Europe and the World in recent centuries and which are likely to be crucial for the future development of the continent. The special focus of European society during the modern era, its "promethean" exploration of nature, man and society, had led during the period of the "Industrial Revolution" to a giant increase of efficiency in the fields of science, technology and economy. It is ethically indisputable, that all human activities must take into account the significance and impact of these activities and also take on responsibility. If the increase of efficiency in the fields of science, technology and economy does not properly look after the human dignity of those affected, after justice and common good, then this will individually and socially lead to the destructive consequences, to conflicts and wars. People in Europe have learned from the catastrophes, and with the introduction of the new social and economical model, the "Eco-social market economy in a constitutional democracy", they managed to rebuild and achieve a relatively high standard of living. In the time of "globalization" we are currently experiencing a global "second industrial revolution". Analogue to the "first industrial revolution", this one also brings forth big challenges and dramatic risks. Europe has the longest experience of high efficiency in the fields of science, technology and economy. Here more than anywhere else has Europe gained positive and negative experiences. If Europe – united in freedom – develops a sustainable culture of efficiency in the fields of science, technology and economy which keeps in mind personal values and the common good, then people will identify with it and will get involved. Then and only then can Europe hold a relevant position in the globalized world. Central Europe has special opportunities and tasks in this process...|$|R
