Whale shark (<b>Rhincodon</b> <b>typus)</b> is enlisted as one of the protected species in India and its fishing prohibited under Schedule Ι of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, according to the Order No. 1 - 2 / 2001 WL 1 Dated 28. 05. 2001, Govt. of India, so as to conserve the species in Indian waters. still illegal fishing prevails in Indian waters and the catch is processed in the vessel itself and sold in markets as meat chunks. To curb the illegal trade and marketing of fishery products from whale shark, for devising good management practices and for the strict law enforcement, accurate and reliable species identification methods using molecular tools are of paramount importance. In an effort to establish a comprehensive identification data set, we have generated a species-specific partial sequence data of the mitochondrial genome of properly identified stranded whale shark samples, covering the 16 S rRNA (546 bp),Cyt b (541 bp), COI (600 bp) genes as the reference genetic profile helping in accurate identification of any body parts of the species. In the year 2008, flesh suspected as that of the Wildlife protected whale shark (<b>Rhincodon</b> <b>typus)</b> was seized from fishermen by the Forest Range Officer (Govt. of Kerala), Kannur, Kerala, India and was brought before the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala, India. The detailed sample analysis and confirmation of species was carried out at NBFGR Cochin Unit (R. P. 330 / 08, dt 29. 09. 2008). Based on DNA sequencing of 16 S rRNA(525 bp) and COI (600 bp) Cyt b(541 bp) genes and comparing with the sequences earlier generated by NBFGR (FJ 375724, FJ 375725, FJ 375726, FJ 456921, FJ 456922, and FJ 456923), the suspected sample was identified as that of endangered Whale Shark (<b>Rhincodon</b> <b>typus)</b> and the result was communicated to the court.
