5|$|Perhaps the {{significance}} of the protests was the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch, more commonly known as Manchester United Supporters' Trust today, by journalist Michael Crick. Working alongside IMUSA (Independent Manchester United Supporters Association), their joint aim was to seek a reference of the merger by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Both groups therefore submitted papers to the Office of Fair Trading, stressing the importance of why the merger shouldn’t be carried out. IMUSA in particular argued that BSkyB’s main intention was not that of United’s but their already dominant position. Sky Television’s <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> was premium subscription channels and by buying an established Premier League team when they already had rights to the division was purely for financial gain. Moreover, Manchester United’s market was on the pitch and an acquisition by a media organisation– particularly one run by Murdoch– may create detrimental damage to the sport in the long term.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> is {{fundamental}} to antitrust analysis, particularly to those relating to mergers. However, defining <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> is sometimes difficult ot operationalize. This has triggered a substantial literature in which price tests {{have been used to}} define both economic and antitrust markets. This paper reviews some price tests and applies them in order to define <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>markets</b> in wholesale gasoline in Canada. We find that <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>markets</b> can be larger than cities but smaller than East and West Canada.

[...] That footnote, which appeared in analysis of the <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> issue in du Pont, rejected the Government's reliance on several cases, noting that [...] "the scope of the market was not in issue" [...] in Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 51 S.Ct. 248, 75 L.Ed. 544 (1931).

2500|$|The Lessig opinion claimed {{support from}} the {{language}} of § 2, which prohibits attempts to monopolize [...] "any part" [...] of commerce, and therefore forbids attempts to monopolize any appreciable segment of interstate sales of the relevant product.

An interesting guiding principle provided by Bishop and Darcey (1995) states that a <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> is something worth monopolising, {{in the sense}} that the <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> includes all the substitute products and therefore control of that market would allow the monopoliser to profitably increase the prices of the products to the monopoly level.
