50|$|The Zorki 2 (1954) {{was similar}} to the Zorki but {{featured}} an updated <b>rewind</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a self timer and strap lugs. There was a later flash version called the Zorki 2S.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} machines recorded only {{in black}} and white and had no <b>rewind</b> <b>mechanism,</b> like the Cartrivision format of a few years earlier; an external rewinder was used after recording or playing a tape. External rewinders were later used with the VHS and Beta formats, although the machines could rewind tapes; external rewinders were considerably faster than the rewind function.|$|E
50|$|Bruceâ€™s {{inventiveness}} {{and problem}} solving skills soon became apparent. He developed and patented an automatic <b>rewinding</b> <b>mechanism</b> for gasoline pumps (CA 454365) and a pipe-wrapping machine for coating pipelines with tar paper in the field. Many problems related to construction work were solved by adapting other available equipment. Gradually the company continued to grow and diversify its activities including concrete bridges, trucking fleet, industrial camps and a machine shop known as Industrial Fabricators.|$|R
50|$|A tape {{would be}} {{inserted}} into the rewinder and pushed down so the <b>rewinding</b> <b>mechanism</b> would start. There {{would also be a}} button on the front or side of the rewinder so a tape could be popped out in case a wheel inside a tape got caught and started sticking which could cause the tape to be ripped out from the inside of the cassette or severely damaged. Radio Shack {{is one of the few}} companies to still make a VHS videotape rewinder, as of June 2013.|$|R
40|$|Institute for Computing Systems ArchitectureEmerging {{technologies}} {{enable a}} set of distributed resources across a network to be linked together and used in a coordinated fashion to solve a particular parallel application at the same time. Such applications are often abstracted as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), in which vertices represent application tasks and edges represent data dependencies between tasks. Effective scheduling mechanisms for DAG applications are essential to exploit the tremendous potential of computational resources. The core issues are that the availability and performance of resources, which are already by their nature heterogeneous, {{can be expected to}} vary dynamically, even during the course of an execution. In this thesis, we first consider the problem of scheduling DAG task graphs onto heterogeneous resources with changeable capabilities. We propose a list-scheduling heuristic approach, the Global Task Positioning (GTP) scheduling method, which addresses the problem by allowing rescheduling and migration of tasks in response to significant variations in resource characteristics. We observed from experiments with GTP that in an execution with relatively frequent migration, it may be that, over time, the results of some task have been copied to several other sites, and so a subsequent migrated task may have several possible sources for each of its inputs. Some of these copies may now be more quickly accessible than the original, due to dynamic variations in communication capabilities. To exploit this observation, we extended our model with a Copying Management(CM) function, resulting in a new version, the Global Task Positioning with copying facilities (GTP/c) system. The idea is to reuse such copies, in subsequent migration of placed tasks, {{in order to reduce the}} impact of migration cost on makespan. Finally, we believe that fault tolerance is an important issue in heterogeneous and dynamic computational environments as the availability of resources cannot be guaranteed. To address the problem of processor failure, we propose a <b>rewinding</b> <b>mechanism</b> which <b>rewinds</b> the progress of the application to a previous state, thereby preserving the execution in spite of the failed processor(s). We evaluate our mechanisms through simulation, since this allow us to generate repeatable patterns of resource performance variation. We use a standard benchmark set of DAGs, comparing performance against that of competing algorithms from the scheduling literature...|$|R
5000|$|Motivated by {{the huge}} success of the low-priced Canon AE-1 and other consumer-level cameras, Minolta {{followed}} suit in the new camera's design by offering {{a wide array of}} optional equipment for the X-700 such as flashes, film winders, motor drives, data backs etc. This had the effect of lowering the budget for the camera's internal mechanism. In a step backwards, the new X-700 was not equipped with the fast vertical metal shutter of previous XE and XD cameras, and was instead fitted with a less expensive horizontal traverse silk shutter, enabling maximum sync speed of 1/60 second, and operated by an electromagnetic shutter release. [...] No mechanical shutter speed was provided, even in bulb mode. The resultant battery drain and inability to meter at light levels below EV-1 made the camera a poor choice for long exposures, as often needed for astrophotography. Minolta further lowered the price of the camera by fabricating certain parts in the film advance and <b>rewind</b> <b>mechanism</b> of less expensive materials, and by the use of less expensive electronic components. Even the rewind lever of the camera is made of plastic.|$|E
