40|$|Abstract—Efficient {{and compact}} {{wireless}} power transfer (WPT) systems are proposed and designed for recharging small implantable medical devices. They use the magnetic resonance coupling scheme to transfer power over a relatively large distance. The <b>receiver</b> resonator <b>coil</b> and the load loop are designed in correspondence to size restriction of implantable devices. The dimensions of the coils are optimized and effective values of the lumped capacitors are investigated and fine-tuned for efficiency enhancement. Three design configurations of the WPT system, each consisting of two coils at the transmitter and two <b>coils</b> at the <b>receiver,</b> are designed and fabricated. The transfer efficiency is measured over different transmission distances and with different orientation angles of the <b>receiver</b> <b>coils.</b> The measurement results show good agreements with the simulations and illustrate that the proposed WPT systems exhibit nearly omnidirectional radiation performance.

50|$|A Near-Field Magnetic Induction {{communication}} {{system is a}} short range wireless physical layer that communicates by coupling a tight, low-power, non-propagating magnetic field between devices. The concept is for a transmitter coil in one device to modulate a magnetic field which is measured {{by means of a}} <b>receiver</b> <b>coil</b> in another device.|$|E
50|$|Because the Q {{can be very}} high, {{even when}} low power is fed into the {{transmitter}} coil, a relatively intense field builds up over multiple cycles, which increases the power that can be received—at resonance far more power is in the oscillating field than is being fed into the coil, and the <b>receiver</b> <b>coil</b> receives a percentage of that.|$|E
30|$|It {{is shown}} in Fig.  9 that tilts of the two <b>receiver</b> <b>coils</b> can affect the {{judgment}} of low-resistivity formation and high-resistivity formation. In the condition of tilted <b>receiver</b> <b>coils,</b> when the dip angle of the formation increases, the resolution of instrument measurement results in the low-resistivity formation and high-resistivity formation gradually increasing. According to the polarization angles in amplitude ratios and phase difference curves, we can indicate the interface between the two formations clearly. However, as shown in Fig.  9, {{with the increase of}} dip angle of the formation, the variations of amplitude ratios and phase differences received by two <b>receiver</b> <b>coils</b> all present an upward trend. But in amplitude ratios and phase difference curves, we can find that with the increase of dip angle of the formation, the polarization angles corresponding to the interface from low-resistivity formation to high-resistivity formation gradually disappear. Conversely, the polarization angles corresponding to the interface from high-resistivity formation to low-resistivity formation become more and more obvious. Based on that, the drilling direction can be determined in time according to the polarization angles whether appear on the amplitude ratios and the phase difference curves corresponding to the interface between two formations, then the geosteering drilling information can be accurately provided by resistivity LWD tool.|$|R

40|$|New {{theoretical}} and practical concepts are presented for considerably enhancing the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by means of arrays of multiple <b>receiver</b> <b>coils.</b> Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) {{is based on the}} fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple <b>receiver</b> <b>coils</b> in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging.

50|$|However, {{it may be}} {{seen that}} if some energy is placed in a 'sender' coil when it is in {{resonance}} then the coil will ring {{for a number of}} cycles before losing the energy to its resistance. Provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is high enough to overcome the coupling coefficient, then most of the power can eventually be absorbed by the receiving coil over several cycles and can be tapped off. The remaining power will be lost in the resistance of the sender, and some in the <b>receiver</b> <b>coil</b> also.|$|E
50|$|The {{detection}} {{limits of}} Micro-MRI or MRM can be pushed further by {{taking advantage of}} microsystem fabrication techniques. In general, the RF <b>receiver</b> <b>coil</b> should closely conform to the sample to ensure good detection sensitivity.

30|$|When an {{electromagnetic}} wave propagates in the porous media near the borehole formation, the signal amplitude attenuation is different {{because there are}} different resistivities among different propagation mediums.

50|$|When {{the radio}} {{frequency}} pulse is turned off, the transverse vector component produces an oscillating magnetic field which induces a small current in the <b>receiver</b> <b>coil.</b> This signal {{is called the}} free induction decay (FID). In an idealized nuclear magnetic resonance experiment, the FID decays approximately exponentially with a time constant T2. However in practical MRI there are small differences in the static magnetic field at different spatial locations ("inhomogeneities") that cause the Larmor frequency to vary across the body. This creates destructive interference, which shortens the FID. The time constant for the observed decay of the FID is called the T relaxation time, and is always shorter than T2. At the same time, the longitudinal magnetization starts to recover exponentially with a time constant T1 which is much larger than T2 (see below).|$|E
40|$|Objectives The paper {{presents}} a novel and more generalized concept for spatial encoding by non-unidirectional, nonbijective spatial encoding magnetic fields (SEMs).

In MRI scanners, sections of the body are exposed to a very strong magnetic field causing primarily the hydrogen nuclei ("spins") of water in tissues to be polarized {{in the direction of}} the magnetic field. An intense radiofrequency pulse is applied that tips the magnetization generated by the hydrogen nuclei {{in the direction of the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>coil</b> where the spin polarization can be detected.

In clinical practice with parallel imaging, a maximum acceleration factor of two can be achieved, and it is not possible to further increase it without decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio. To further improve the acquisition speed, undersampling techniques, operating in the temporal domain, have been developed, such as k-t BLAST, which can easily handle a fourfold acceleration factor. This new approach is based on the fact that image frames are only slightly different if acquired at different time points; by identifying the redundant information among the image frames, only the novel portions of the images need to be acquired, thus reducing the total amount of sampled information [21].|$|R
