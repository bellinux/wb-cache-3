40|$|ABSTRACT: A continuum-based finite-element {{methodology}} {{is established}} for quantifying {{the stability of}} earthen embankments built on saturated soil deposits. Within the methodology the soil is treated as a fluid-solid porous medium, in which the soil skeleton’s constitutive behavior is modeled using a smooth elastoplastic cap model that features continuous coupling between deviatoric and volumetric plasticity. In the stability analysis procedure, self-weight of the embankment soils is monotonically increased at rates characteristic of the embankment construction time, until instability mechanisms develop. The transient effects of excess pore pressures {{and their impact on}} soil strength are explicitly modeled, allowing for computation of embankment safety factors against instability as a function of construction <b>rate.</b> <b>Details</b> on the proposed method are presented and discussed, including (1) how the construction rate of an embankment can be modeled; (2) how load-based safety factors can differ from resistance-based safety factors; and (3) solved example problems corresponding to a case history of an embankment failure...|$|E

A novel technique which facilitates striation counting and striation spacing measurements, is developed and used for extracting and analyzing the relevant statistical data for characterizing the stochastic fatigue crack propagation in polycrystalline metals.

40|$|Despite {{the long}} held {{agreement}} that {{a knowledge of}} enclosure integrity is an essential element {{in the design of}} fire protection systems, relatively little information is available concerning the development of enclosure pressure during the discharge of gaseous agents. Room pressure development during clean agent discharges is dependent upon several system-and enclosure-related factors. A major factor influencing the development of room pressure {{is the nature of the}} clean agent. The discharge of inert gas agents is characterized by a rapid buildup of pressure to a maximum, followed by a relatively slow decay in pressure with time. The discharge of halocarbon-based agents on the other hand, is characterized by an initial, relatively rapid negative pressure pulse, due to initial cooling of the enclosure and its contents, followed by a relatively rapid positive pressure pulse. Additional factors influencing the development of room pressure during a clean agent discharge include the enclosure construction, the enclosure integrity (leakage area, hold time), the fire size per enclosure volume ratio, and the agent flow <b>rate.</b> <b>Details</b> of the effects of the above factors on room pressure development for both inert gas and halocarbon-based systems will be reviewed, along with data relating enclosure pressurization to enclosure integrity.

40|$|Studies of the deep-level {{defects in}} the VPE and LPE GaAs layers under various growth {{conditions}} {{have been made}} in this work, using DLTS and C-V techniques. In the VPE grown GaAs, characterization of grown-in defects vs. Ga/As ratio (i. e., 2 / 1, 3 / 1, 4 / 1, and 6 / 1) were made on GaAs layers grown on,, and substrates. The two common electron traps observed in these samples were due to the EB- 4 (i. e., Ec - 0. 71 eV) level and the EL- 2 (i. e., E - 0. 83 eV) level. The density of these two electron traps was found to depend on the stoichiometry as well as substrate orientation. For examples, in the orientation samples, the density of EL 2 was found to decrease with increasing Ga/As ratio (e. g., NT = 1. 2 x 1014 cm- 3 for Ga/As = 2 / 1, and reducing to 5. 4 x 1011 cm- 3 for Ga/As = 6 / 1). A similar result was also observed in the EB- 4 electron trap. Low temperature (230 °C) thermal annealing and recombination enhanced annealing studies on these samples showed significant reduction in the density of EB- 4 trap and slight reduction in EL- 2 trap density. For the LPE grown GaAs layers, two growth temperatures (700 and 800 °C) and two temperature dropping rates (l°C/min. and 0. 4 °C/min.) were used.

40|$|Investigated {{here is the}} {{performance}} of composite explosives - {{measured in terms of}} the blast wave they drive into the surrounding environment. The composite charge configuration studied here was a spherical booster (1 / 3 charge mass), surrounded by aluminum (Al) powder (2 / 3 charge mass) at an initial density of {rho}{sub 0 } = 0. 604 g/cc. The Al powder acts as a fuel but does not detonate - thereby providing an extreme example of a 'non-ideal' explosive (where 2 / 3 of the charge does not detonate). Detonation of the booster charge creates a blast wave that disperses the Al powder and ignites the ensuing Al-air mixture - thereby forming a two-phase combustion cloud embedded in the explosion. Afterburning of the booster detonation products with air also enhances and promotes the Al-air combustion process. Pressure waves from such reactive blast waves have been measured in bomb calorimeter experiments. Here we describe numerical simulations of those experiments. A Heterogeneous Continuum Model was used to model the dispersion and combustion of the Al particle cloud. It combines the gasdynamic conservation laws for the gas phase with a dilute continuum model for the dispersed phase, as formulated by Nigmatulin. Inter-phase mass, momentum and energy exchange are prescribed by phenomenological models of Khasainov. It incorporates a combustion model based on mass conservation laws for fuel, air and products; source/sink terms are treated in the fast-chemistry limit appropriate for such gasdynamic fields, along with a model for mass transfer from the particle phase to the gas. The model takes into account both the afterburning of the detonation products of the booster with air, and the combustion of the Al particles with air. The model equations were integrated by high-order Godunov schemes for both the gas and particle phases. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) was used to capture the energy-bearing scales of the turbulent flow on the computational grid, and to track/resolve reaction zones. Numerical simulations of the explosion fields from 1. 5 -g and 10 -kg composite charges were performed. Computed pressure histories (red curve) are compared with measured waveforms (black curves) in Fig. 1. Comparison of these results with a waveform for a non-combustion case in nitrogen (blue curve) demonstrates that a reactive blast wave was formed. Cross-sectional views of the temperature field at various times are presented in Fig. 2, which shows that the flow is turbulent. Initially, combustion occurs at the fuel-air interface, and the energy release rate is controlled by the rate of turbulent mixing. Eventually, oxidizer becomes distributed throughout the cloud via ballistic mixing of the particles with air; energy release then occurs in a distributed combustion mode, and Al particle kinetics controls the energy release <b>rate.</b> <b>Details</b> of the Heterogeneous Continuum Model and results of the numerical simulations of composite charge explosions will be described in the paper...|$|E
