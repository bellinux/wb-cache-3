40|$|Abstract [...] -In this paper, we {{thoroughly}} {{investigate the}} performance of quasi-optical NbN phonon-cooled superconducting hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers, cryogenically cooled by a close-cycled 4 -K refrigerator at 500 GI- 1 z and 850 GHz. The uncorrected lowest receiver noise temperatures measured are 800 K at 500 CHz without anti-reflection coating, and 1000 K @ 850 GHz with a 50 11 M thick Mylar anti-reflection coating. The dependence of receiver noise temperature on the critical current and bath temperature of HEB mixer is also investigated here. Lifetime of quasi-optical superconducting NbN HEB mixers of different volumes, room <b>temperature</b> <b>resistances,</b> and critical <b>temperatures</b> are thoroughly studied. Increased room <b>temperature</b> <b>resistance</b> with time over the initial resistance changes between 1 and 1. 2, and the reduced critical current with time over the initial value fluctuates slightly around 0. 7 for most HEB mixers even of different volumes, room <b>temperature</b> <b>resistances,</b> and critical <b>temperatures.</b> The critical current degrades sharply vvhile room <b>temperature</b> <b>resistance</b> varies over 1. 25.
