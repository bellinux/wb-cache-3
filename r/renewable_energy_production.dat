China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity. Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E

In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations.

40|$|Abstract—Now a {{days the}} {{requirement}} for <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> power <b>production</b> is increasing due to scarcity of conventional energy resources. So, {{one of the best}} <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> resource for <b>production</b> of electrical <b>energy</b> is wind. As most of the loads are lagging loads, losses will be more due to low power factor. In our study even though capacitor bank is connected to compensate reactive power, and to maintain voltage stability, it is observed that there is no constant required power factor at all loads. Due to connection of capacitor in steps using capacitor bank, there is over compensation. In this paper “Thyristor switched Capacitor”is proposed to improve power factor in windmill power plant.
