40|$|Abstract. Dependently typed {{programming}} languages allow sophisticated {{properties of}} data to be expressed within the type system. Of particular use in dependently typed pro-gramming are indexed types that refine data by computationally useful information. For example, the N-indexed type of vectors refines lists by their lengths. Other data types may be refined in similar ways, but programmers must produce purpose-specific <b>refinements</b> on an ad hoc basis, developers must anticipate which <b>refinements</b> to include in libraries, and implementations must often store redundant information about data and their <b>refinements.</b> In this paper we show how to generically derive inductive characterisations of <b>refinements</b> of inductive types, and argue that these characterisations can alleviate some of the afore-mentioned difficulties associated with ad hoc <b>refinements.</b> Our characterisations also ensure that standard techniques for programming with and reasoning about inductive types are applicable to <b>refinements,</b> and that <b>refinements</b> can themselves be further refined. 1...|$|R

40|$|Resolution is {{the most}} widely studied {{approach}} to propositional theorem proving. In developing efficient resolutionbased algorithms, dozens of variants and <b>refinements</b> of resolution have been studied from both the empirical and analytic sides. The most prominent of these <b>refinements</b> are: DP (ordered), DLL (tree), semantic, negative, linear and regular resolution. In this paper, we characterize and study these six <b>refinements</b> of resolution. We give a nearly complete characterization of the relative complexities of all six <b>refinements.</b> While many of the important separations and simulations were already known, many new ones are presented in this paper; in particular, we give the first separation of semantic resolution from general resolution. As a special case, we obtain the first exponential separation of negative resolution from general resolution. We also attempt to present a unifying framework for studying all of these <b>refinements...</b>|$|R

5|$|Since yttrium is {{chemically}} {{so similar}} to the lanthanides, it occurs in the same ores (rare-earth minerals) and is extracted by the same <b>refinement</b> processes. A slight distinction is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), but the distinction is not perfect. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group because of its ion size, though it has a lower atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constantâ€”a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atomâ€”and the magnitude of the kilogramâ€”could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future <b>refinement</b> as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83â…“ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future <b>refinement.</b>|$|E
40|$|Place and {{transition}} <b>refinements</b> provide a convenient method of structuring complex net models by replacing single elements (places {{and transition}}s) at a `higher [...] level' of abstraction with `lower [...] level', more detailed, subnets. The concepts of static and dynamic place/transition <b>refinements</b> are introduced. Dynamic <b>refinements</b> do not {{increase the size}} of the (refined) model because no `expansion' of the model is performed; instead, only a `logical' association of higher [...] level elements with lower-level subnets is maintained and used in model analysis. Multiple applications of place/transition <b>refinements</b> results in hierarchical net models. The paper formalizes the concept of hierarchies of <b>refinements</b> in Petri nets and shows simple applications of the hierarchical approach to modeling of manufacturing cells. 1.
