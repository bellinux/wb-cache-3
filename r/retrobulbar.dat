25|$|As {{early as}} 400 BC, Hippocrates {{is thought to}} have {{recorded}} a relationship between blunt facial trauma and blindness. Injuries involving the eye or eyelid, such as <b>retrobulbar</b> hemorrhage, can threaten eyesight; however, blindness following facial trauma is not common.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or <b>retrobulbar</b> pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Adrian and Matthew noticed {{potential}} {{changes of}} the occipital EEG can be observed under stimulation of light. Ciganek developed the first nomenclature for occipital EEG components in 1961. During that same year, Hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual evoked potential (VEP) on the occipital lobe (externally and internally), and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest. In 1965, Spehlmann used a checkerboard stimulation to describe human VEPs. An attempt to localize structures in the primary visual pathway was completed by Szikla and colleagues. Halliday and colleagues completed the first clinical investigations using VEP by recording delayed VEPs in a patient with <b>retrobulbar</b> neuritis in 1972. A wide variety of extensive research to improve procedures and theories has been conducted from the 1970s to today and the method has also been described in animals.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} was first practiced by Herman Knapp in 1884. Here, 2% xylocaine is {{introduced into the}} muscle cone behind the eyeball. The injection is usually given through the inferior fornix of {{the skin of the}} outer part of the lower lid when the eye is in primary gaze. The ciliary nerves, ciliary ganglion, oculomotor nerve and abducens nerve are anesthetized in <b>retrobulbar</b> block. As a result, global akinesia, anaesthesia and analgesia are produced. The superior oblique muscle, which is outside the muscle cone, is not usually paralyzed. The complications of <b>retrobulbar</b> block are globe perforation, optic nerve injury, <b>retrobulbar</b> haemorrhage and extraocular muscle palsy. <b>Retrobulbar</b> anaesthesia is contraindicated in posterior staphyloma, high axial myopia and enopthalmos.|$|E

50|$|A <b>retrobulbar</b> {{block is}} a {{regional}} anesthetic nerve {{block in the}} <b>retrobulbar</b> space, the area located behind the globe of the eye. Injection of local anesthetic into this space constitutes the <b>retrobulbar</b> block. This injection provides akinesia of the extraocular muscles by blocking cranial nerves II, III, and VI, thereby preventing movement of the globe. Cranial nerve IV lies outside the muscle cone, but is blocked by diffusion of the local anesthetic. It also provides sensory anesthesia of the conjunctiva, cornea and uvea by blocking the ciliary nerves. This block is most commonly employed for cataract surgery, but also provides anesthesia for other intraocular surgeries.|$|E

50|$|Resuscitative equipment, {{monitoring}} and personnel must be immediately available prior to performance of this block. The <b>retrobulbar</b> block is {{performed with the}} patient either seated or supine and looking straight ahead. The head should be maintained in a neutral position. A needle (22-27 Gauge, 3 cm long) is inserted at the inferolateral border of the bony orbit and directed straight back until it has passed the equator of the globe. It is then directed medially and cephalad toward {{the apex of the}} orbit. Occasionally a 'pop' is felt as the needle tip passes through the muscle cone delineating the <b>retrobulbar</b> space. Following a negative aspiration for blood, 2-4mls of local anesthetic solution is injected and the needle is withdrawn. 2% Lidocaine (Xylocaine) and 0.5% to 0.75% bupivicaine (Marcaine) are two commonly used agents. Epinephrine, commonly mixed in with local anesthetics for vasconstriction, is not used in seeing eyes as this can cause a central retinal artery occlusion. An enzyme, hyaluronidase, is frequently a component of the anaesthetic solution, as it accelerates and improves dispersal of the agent. Akinesia and anesthesia quickly ensue within minutes with a successful <b>retrobulbar</b> injection.Retrobulbar block can be used successfully for corneal transplantation but may require a supplemental facial nerve block. <b>Retrobulbar</b> block can block levator palpebrae muscle but not orbucularis oculi. Several techniques for facial nerve block can be used in conjunction with <b>retrobulbar</b> block.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Retrobulbar</b> hemorrhage: {{trauma to}} the orbit can lead to {{bleeding}} behind the eye. The hemorrhage has nowhere to escape and the increased pressure pushes the eye out of the socket, leading to proptosis and can also cause blindness if not treated promptly.|$|E
50|$|Ophthalmologists {{should try}} to avoid <b>retrobulbar</b> blocks in {{patients}} with thesyndrome. Whenever possible, patients with HPS may benefit from generalendotracheal anesthesia. Phacoemulsification may help prevent intraoperativeand postoperative bleeding in patients with the syndrome. Prolonged bleedinghas been reported following strabismus surgery in patients with the syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Anisocoria is absent. A Marcus Gunn pupil is seen, {{among other}} conditions, in optic {{neuritis}}. It is also common in <b>retrobulbar</b> optic neuritis due to multiple sclerosis {{but only for}} 3-4 weeks, until the visual acuity begins to improve in 1-2 weeks and may return to normal.|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that Cajal-Retzius cells have {{different}} origins, both in the neocortex and in the hippocampus. In the neocortex they originate in the local pallium ventricular zone, the pallial-subpallial border of the ventral pallium, a region at the septum, the cortical hem [...] and the <b>retrobulbar</b> ventricular zone.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all ocular {{surgeries}} viz keratoplasty, cataract extraction, glaucoma surgery, iridectomy, strabismus, retinal detachment surgery etc. can be {{done under}} regional anaesthesia. Conjunctiva, globe and orbicularis can be paralysed {{using a combination of}} surface anaesthesia, facial anaesthesia and <b>retrobulbar</b> block. The advantage is that it produces less post-operative restlessness. It has less post-operative lung complications and less bleeding.|$|E
50|$|The AON {{is found}} behind the {{olfactory}} bulb {{and in front}} of the piriform cortex (laterally) and olfactory tubercle (medially) in a region {{often referred to as the}} olfactory peduncle or <b>retrobulbar</b> area. The peduncle contains the AON as well as two other much smaller regions, the taenia tecta (or dorsal hippocampal rudiment) and the dorsal peduncular cortex.|$|E
50|$|Optic {{neuritis}} is a demyelinating {{inflammation of}} the optic nerve. It {{is also known as}} optic papillitis (when the head of the optic nerve is involved) and <b>retrobulbar</b> neuritis (when the posterior of the nerve is involved). It is most often associated with multiple sclerosis, and it may lead to complete or partial loss of vision in one or both eyes.|$|E
50|$|Asymptomatic {{infection}} of the virus can occur in patas monkeys, vervet monkeys, and baboons, although it is observed primarily in patas monkeys. Infection has a rapid onset with animals developing a high fever, facial edema, cyanosis, anorexia, melena, and may begin to hemorrhage at the cutaneous, subcutaneous, and <b>retrobulbar</b> levels. Thrombocytopenia will develop soon after. Death usually occurs within 10-15 days after symptoms appear.|$|E
5000|$|Bupivacaine is {{indicated}} for local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, sympathetic nerve block, and epidural and caudal blocks. It is sometimes used {{in combination with}} epinephrine to prevent systemic absorption and extend the duration of action. The 0.75% (most concentrated) formulation is used in <b>retrobulbar</b> block. [...] It is {{the most commonly used}} local anesthetic in epidural anesthesia during labor, as well as in postoperative pain management.|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} of sinus barotrauma, {{localized}} pain to the frontal {{area is the}} predominant symptom. This is due to pain originating from the frontal sinus, it being above the brow bones. Less common is pain referred to the temporal, occipital, or <b>retrobulbar</b> region. Epistaxis or serosanguineous secretion from the nose may occur. Neurological symptoms may affect the adjacent fifth cranial nerve and especially the infraorbital nerve.|$|E
50|$|Uncontrollable fits of {{sneezing}} {{are common}} in patients under propofol sedation who undergo periocular or <b>retrobulbar</b> injection. A sneeze by a sedated patient often occurs upon insertion of a needle into or around their eye. The violent and uncontrollable movement of the head during a reflexive sneeze has potential to cause damage within the patient's eye if the needle is not removed before the sneeze occurs.|$|E
50|$|Susruta Samhita has evidences {{of use of}} {{anaesthesia}} for ocular surgeries. Inhalational anaesthesia {{was used}} for this purpose. Egyptian surgeons used carotid compression to produce transient ischemia during eye surgery to reduce the perception of pain. In 1884, Karl Koller used cocaine for ocular surgery. The same year, Herman Knapp used cocaine for <b>retrobulbar</b> block. In 1914, van Lint achieved orbicularis akinesia by local injection.|$|E
50|$|Infiltrative ophthalmopathy {{is found}} in Graves disease and resembles exophthalmos, except that the blurry or double vision is {{acquired}} because of weakness in the ocular muscles of the eye. In addition, there is no known correlation with the patient's thyroid levels. Exophthalmos associated with Grave's disease disappears when the thyrotoxicosis is corrected. Infiltrative ophthalmopathy at times may not be cured. The current hypothesis is that infiltrative ophthalmopathy may be autoimmune in nature targeting <b>retrobulbar</b> tissue.|$|E
50|$|In ischemic optic neuropathies, {{there is}} {{insufficient}} blood flow (ischemia) to the optic nerve. The anterior optic nerve is {{supplied by the}} short posterior ciliary artery and choroidal circulation, while the <b>retrobulbar</b> optic nerve is supplied intraorbitally by a pial plexus, which arises from the ophthalmic artery, internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral artery, and anterior communicating arteries. Ischemic optic neuropathies are classified based on {{the location of the}} damage and the cause of reduced blood flow, if known.|$|E
50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or <b>retrobulbar</b> pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.|$|E
5000|$|Even when facial {{injuries}} are not life-threatening, {{they have the}} potential to cause disfigurement and disability, with long-term physical and emotional results. [...] Facial injuries can cause problems with eye, nose, or jaw function and can threaten eyesight. As early as 400 BC, Hippocrates is thought to have recorded a relationship between blunt facial trauma and blindness. Injuries involving the eye or eyelid, such as <b>retrobulbar</b> hemorrhage, can threaten eyesight; however, blindness following facial trauma is not common.|$|E
50|$|On medical {{examination}} {{the head of}} the optic nerve can easily be visualized by a slit lamp with high plus or by using direct ophthalmoscopy; however, frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis (in cases of <b>retrobulbar</b> optic neuritis), though it may be swollen in some patients (anterior papillitis or more extensive optic neuritis). In many cases, only one eye is affected and patients may not be aware of the loss of color vision until they are asked to close or cover the healthy eye.|$|E
50|$|Local {{anaesthetic}} may be instilled {{into the}} space between Tenon's capsule and the sclera to provide anaesthesia for eye surgery, principally cataract surgery. After applying local anaesthetic drops to anaesthetise the conjunctiva, a small fold of conjunctiva is lifted off the eyeball and an incision made. A blunt, curved cannula is passed through the incision into the periscleral lymph space and a volume of local anaesthetic solution is instilled. The advantages are a reduced risk of bleeding and of penetration of the globe, compared to peribulbar and <b>retrobulbar</b> approaches. Akinesia (paralysis of the external eye muscles) may be less complete, however.|$|E
50|$|Posterior ischemic optic {{neuropathy}} (PION) {{is a medical}} condition characterized by damage to the <b>retrobulbar</b> portion of the optic nerve due to ischemia, a restriction of the blood supply to the optic nerve. Despite the term posterior, this form of ischemic {{optic neuropathy}} also includes cases where the ischemic damage is anterior, as the condition describes a particular mechanism of visual loss {{as much as the}} location of damage in the optic nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is distinguished from PION by the fact that AION occurs spontaneously and unilaterally in patients with predisposing anatomic or cardiovascular risk factors.|$|E
