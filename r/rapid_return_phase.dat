40|$|Ascent, {{rendezvous}} {{and earth}} return are three operational mission sequences {{in the sample}} <b>return</b> <b>phase</b> of the Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR) mission. In {{the conduct of the}} current study, several vehicles have been identified to enable the sample <b>return</b> <b>phase</b> of the mission. These elements are the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), the Earth Return Vehicle (ERV), the rendezvous and docking module (RDM), and the sample return capsule (SRC). The sample return elements, when combined with other elements performing the launch and delivery functions, form the basis of the MRSR system. This paper summarizes the significant mission aspects of the sample <b>return</b> <b>phase,</b> describes the Mars ascent and earth return scenario, illustrates the conceptual designs developed for the MAV, ERV, RDM, and SRC, and discusses the results of significant trade studies conducted...|$|R

50|$|A waggle dance {{consists}} {{of one to}} 100 or more circuits, each of which {{consists of}} two phases: the waggle <b>phase</b> and the <b>return</b> <b>phase.</b> A worker bee's waggle dance involves running through a small figure-eight pattern: a waggle run (aka waggle phase) followed by a turn {{to the right to}} circle back to the starting point (aka <b>return</b> <b>phase),</b> another waggle run, followed by a turn and circle to the left, and so on in a regular alternation between right and left turns after waggle runs. Waggle-dancing bees produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane, and two alkenes, (Z)-9-tricosene and (Z)-9-pentacosene, onto their abdomens and into the air.|$|R

40|$|Waggle-dancing honeybees produce {{vibratory}} {{movements that}} may facilitate communication by indicating {{the location of}} the waggle dancer. However, an important component of these vibrations has never been previously detected in the comb. We developed a method of fine-scale behavioural analysis that allowed us to analyze separately comb vibrations near a honeybee waggle dancer during the waggle and <b>return</b> <b>phases</b> of her dance. We simultaneously recorded honeybee waggle dances using digital video and laser-Doppler vibrometry, and performed a behaviour-locked Fast Fourier Transform analysis on the substratum vibrations. This analysis revealed significantly higher-amplitude 200 – 300 Hz vibrations during the waggle phase than during the <b>return</b> <b>phase</b> (P= 0. 012). We found no significant differences in the flanking frequency region...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} paced {{repetitive}} movements {{with respect to}} an external beat have either emphasised (a) the form of movement trajectories or (b) timing errors made {{with respect to the}} external beat. The question of what kinds of movement trajectories assist timing accuracy has not previously been addressed. In an experiment involving synchronisation or syncopation with an external auditory metronome we show that the nervous system produces trajectories that are asymmetric with respect to time and velocity in the out and <b>return</b> <b>phases</b> of the repeating movement cycle. This asymmetry is task specific and is independent of motor implementation details (finger flexion vs. extension). Additionally, we found that timed trajectories are less smooth (higher mean squared jerk) than unpaced ones. The degree of asymmetry in the flexion and extension movement times is positively correlated with timing accuracy. Negative correlations were observed between synchronisation timing error and the movement time of the ensuing <b>return</b> <b>phase,</b> suggesting that late arrival of the finger is compensated by a shorter <b>return</b> <b>phase</b> and conversely for early arrival. We suggest that movement asymmetry in repetitive timing tasks helps satisfy requirements of precision and accuracy relative to a target event. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R

40|$|Background Proximal {{displacement}} of the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) is present in hiatus hernia but also occurs transiently during transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) and swallows. Using a novel magnetic-based technique we have performed detailed examination of the GEJ movement during TLESRs and swallows in healthy subjects. Methods In 12 subjects, a magnet was endoscopically clipped to the GEJ and combined assembly of Hall-Effect locator probe and 36 channel high-resolution manometer passed nasally. After a test meal the subjects were studied for 90 min. Key Results The median amplitude of proximal movement of GEJ during TLESRs was 4. 3 cm (1. 68. 8 cm) and this was substantially greater than during swallowing at 1. 2 cm (0. 42. 7 cm), P = 0. 002. With both TLESRs and swallows proximal GEJ movement coincided with lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation and return to its original position occurred 4 s after return of LES tone. Kinetic modeling of {{the movement of the}} GEJ during TLESRs indicated two <b>return</b> <b>phases</b> with the initial <b>return</b> <b>phase</b> having the greater velocity (0. 9 cm s- 1) and being strongly correlated with amplitude of proximal movement (r = 0. 8, P < 0. 001). Conclusions & Inferences The marked proximal GEJ migration during TLESRs represents very severe herniation of the GEJ. The <b>rapid</b> initial <b>return</b> of the GEJ following TLESRs when the crural diaphragm is relaxed and its correlation with amplitude suggest it is due to elastic recoil of the phreno-esophageal ligament. The marked stretching of the phreno-esophageal ligament during TLESRs may contribute to its weakening and development of established hiatus hernia...|$|R
