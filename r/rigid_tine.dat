40|$|Elymus repens (coach grass) is {{traditionally}} controlled by repeated and prolonged stubble cultivation. However, the efficacy is strongly depending on weather and secondly on {{the exposure of}} rhizomes. The shorter the required period of cultivation stays the more compliance with the objective in organic farming where farmers aim at minimizing leaching of nutrients by keeping the soil plant-covered during autumn and winter. Effective technique and strategies for uprooting, exposing and destroying Elymus repens are needed. In a Danish organic research project {{the focus is on}} technological solutions for uprooting, exposing and destroying of the rhizomes within a short time span. Machines of standard type, modified machines and machines constructed for other purposes have been studied. The results show {{that it is difficult to}} achieve a high percentage of uprooting when using machines giving a high area capacity, e. g. spring loaded tine cultivator and <b>rigid</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator with modified spike discs at the rear. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} spring elasticity and spring orientation on the draft force during tillage operation. The experiments were conducted in a soil bin with the following dimensions: 1. 2 m in length, 0. 3 m in width and 0. 4 m in depth. The soil used in this experiment was clay loam soil; {{the depth of the}} hardpan in the soil bin was 12 to 15 cm with a penetration resistance of 2. 75 MPa. The depth of the tillage operation was 14 to 17 cm, and the thickness of the hardpan to be tilled was 7 to 10 cm. The tillage tool was connected to a fixed structure using a semi-elliptical spring. The tillage speeds used were 0. 158, 0. 212 and 0. 265 m/s. Two spring orientations were tested: Rear Spring Treatment (RST) and Front Spring Treatment (FST) orientations. In the RST orientation, the draft force raised the elevation of the tillage tool tip, and the draft force caused the tillage tool tip elevation decrease in the FST orientation. Compared to <b>rigid</b> <b>tine,</b> the average draft force in the FST orientation increased up to 73 %, whereas a draft force reduction was found in the RST orientation...|$|E
40|$|A {{three years}} {{experiment}} (2000 - 2002) {{was carried out}} on the possibility to perform the physical weed control of carrot in the typical cultural and environmental condition of the Fucino Valley (that {{is the most important}} area of carrot production in Italy), in order to obtain a “biological” product. Firstly, the strategy of physical weed control of carrot in the Fucino Valley was defined and included the realization of the false seed-bed technique, a flame treatment before crop emergence and one or more mechanical (precision hoeing) and manual interventions in post-emergence. False seed-bed technique was performed by means of a specific spring tine harrow two meters wide, while flaming was performed by means of an operative machine equipped with four “open flame” rod burners 50 cm wide. A specific precision hoe with eleven units (inter-row of about 18 cm) was built, tested, improved and set up to perform weed control both between (by means of a <b>rigid</b> <b>tine</b> supporting a 9 cm wide horizontal blade) and in rows (by means of vibrating teeth or torsion weeder). During the testing period the evolution of weed flora (both presence and biomass) was monitored and carrot root yield was recorded. Moreover work chains characteristics, manpower use and physical weed control cost were determined. The results were quite good and put in evidence that physical weed control in organic carrot cultivated in the Fucino Valley can be performed, obtaining relevant and high quality yields, without the need of too many hours of manual labour and with fully acceptable costs, taking also into account that in Italy the market price of “biological” carrot is quite high...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} from 1993 to 1994 {{to determine the}} effects of intercropping (with Glycine max L Merr., Lupinus sp., Trifolium pratense L. -Lolium multiflorum Lam., or Secale cereale L.) and mechanical weeding (with a <b>rigid</b> <b>tines</b> cultivator, Danish tines cultivator or ridge cultivator) on the population dynamics of insect pests (Diabrotica longicornis Say, Lygus lineolaris Palisot de Beauvois, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner, and Pseudaletia unipuncta Haworth) on corn (Zea mays L.) in L'Assomption and Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. D. longicornis or P. unipuncta populations did not increase. In 1994, intercropping with T. pratense-L. multiflorum (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue) or weeding with the Danish tines cultivator (L'Assomption) increased L. lineolaris populations. In 1994, intercropping with S. cereale (L'Assomption) ot T. pratense-L. multiflorum (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue) increased O. nubilalis populations...|$|R
5000|$|VeloBind {{is a type}} of book binding often {{offered at}} copy and print shops. Velobinding {{involves}} punching several small holes along the edge of an unbound book. A strip of plastic with <b>rigid</b> <b>tines</b> is inserted into the holes {{from the top of the}} book, and a strip with corresponding holes is placed on the back with the tines protruding through. The book is then placed in a machine that holds the book tightly while the excess length of the tines is cut and the tips melted to seal the bind. The term [...] "VeloBind" [...] is a trademark of the General Binding Corporation, but is regularly used generically to refer to this process, though strip binding is also sometimes used.|$|R
40|$|In 2002, 2003 and 2004, {{field trials}} {{were carried out}} in Slovenia {{in the form of}} random blocks with five replications. Three potato cultivators/ridgers were used on medium {{textured}} soil. The aim was to establish which potato cultivator/ridger was the most suitable for inter-row space cultivation, ridge shaping and achievement of the highest possible potato yield, work-rate and productivity. A drawn cultivator/ridger with spring tines on a parallelogram framework and wing ridge heads attached (STC), was com¬pared with a drawn cultivator/ridger with <b>rigid</b> <b>tines</b> on a parallelogram framework and cogwheel ridge discs attached (RTC) and with a rotary, PTO-driven cultivator/ridger (RC). The latter created the largest cross-sectional area of the ridge and proved to be the most efficient at crushing soil aggregates in the inter-row space and at ridge shap¬ing. It also allowed the lowest cone resistance at the ridge centre and in {{the central part of the}} ridge side. A higher number of tubers per plant resulted from ridges made by the PTO-driven cultivator/ridger giving a higher total yield of tubers than with the other two cultivators/ridgers. In comparison with the drawn cultivators/ridgers, the PTO-driven cultivator/ridger shaped ridges with better physical properties on medium textured soil; however both drawn cultivators/ridgers had greater work-rates, and also needed less energy to cultivate a unit of area. peer-reviewedThe authors would like to thank the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food and the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of Slovenian Government for financing the project...|$|R
40|$|Harrowing {{is often}} used to reduce weed competition, {{generally}} using a constant intensity across a whole field. The efficacy of weed harrowing in wheat and barley can be optimized, if site-specific conditions of soil, weed infestation and crop growth stage are taken into account. This study aimed to develop and test an algorithm to automatically adjust the harrowing intensity by varying the tine angle and number of passes. The field variability of crop leaf cover, weed density and soil density was acquired with geo-referenced sensors to investigate the harrowing selectivity and crop recovery. Crop leaf cover and weed density were assessed using bispectral cameras through differential images analysis. The draught force of the soil opposite to the direction of travel was measured with electronic load cell sensor connected to a <b>rigid</b> <b>tine</b> mounted in front of the harrow. Optimal harrowing intensity levels were derived in previously implemented experiments, based on the weed control efficacy and yield gain. The assessments of crop leaf cover, weed density and soil density were combined via rules with the aforementioned optimal intensities, in a linguistic fuzzy inference system (LFIS). The system was evaluated in two field experiments that compared constant intensities with variable intensities inferred by the system. A higher weed density reduction could be achieved when the harrowing intensity was not kept constant along the cultivated plot. Varying the intensity tended to reduce the crop leaf cover, though slightly improving crop yield. A real-time intensity adjustment with this system is achievable, if the cameras are attached in the front and at the rear or sides of the harrow...|$|E
40|$|Water {{protection}} {{is controlled by}} specific regulations in the German Federal States, e. g. the SchALVO in Baden-Württemberg. An amendment of the SchALVO demands, amongst others, a changed timing and intensity of soil tillage directly after growing crops with high-nitrogen residues. As Organic Farming highly relies on soil tillage for weed control, there is concern about decrease of yield and increase of weed infesta-tion in water protection areas if tillage is restricted. Field experiments were performed on practical farms with three treatments according to SchALVO (<b>rigid</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator or mouldboard plough for primary tillage, used in October, December or February) and two treatments according to best management practice (mouldboard plough in Octo-ber or November). The treatments were combined with growing either winter wheat or spring wheat, depending on the date of tillage. There {{were no significant differences}} between the SchALVO and the practice-related treatments for yield, yield parameters, protein content and weed infestation, whereas there were differences between the winter crop and spring crop. The total Nmin in soil was slightly lower in the SchALVO treatments. Here, Nmin reached 39 – 42 kg Nmin ha- 1 (mean of the experimental years), compared to the practice-related treatments with 42 or 43 kg Nmin ha- 1 in the sub-experiment exemplarily presented in this paper. These differences were not significant at P ≤ 0. 05. Mean Nmin was 38. 5 kg ha- 1 before starting the experiment. The lowest Nmin was found after using a cultivator in October. Since the one-time use of a cultiva-tor instead of the plough did not result in obvious disadvantages for the crop, the risk of yield reduction and increased weed infestation seems to be small. Nevertheless, if the initial number of perennial weeds, e. g. thistles, is high, a plough is supposed to be more effective for weed control than non-inversion tillage by cultivator...|$|E
40|$|Different {{implements}} {{for spring}} tillage and different cultivation intensities of autumn-ploughed fields were studied in eleven field experiments in potatoes in northern Sweden in 1965 - 69. The implements used were a spring tine harrow, a cultivator-harrow with fairly <b>rigid</b> spring <b>tines</b> and a disc harrow. These implements {{were used in}} two, four and six runs. In addition, there was one treatment with spring ploughing and spring tine harrowing (two runs) and one treatment with rotary cultivation (one run). The experiments were carried out on light soils, rich in fine sand and silt. In one of the experiments, however, the soil had a clay content as high as 23 per cent. Among the harrows, the disc harrow gave the best mean yield result. Four runs gave the highest yield. The differenees were, however small. Ploughing in the spring did not increase the crop yield. The rotary cultivation gave a yield result {{as high as the}} best of the harrowed treatments...|$|R
