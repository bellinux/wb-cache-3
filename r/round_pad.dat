40|$|Abstract. A typical {{mechanical}} {{character of}} rock {{is that the}} tensile strength is {{far less than the}} compressive strength. Meanwhile, the test data of tensile strength is very dispersive. Because the direct tensile tests always result in failure due to the difficulty in clamping the rock sample, the splitting test is used to determine the tensile strength of rock. There are four kinds of loading modes in the splitting test in actual laboratory test: angle pad splitting, <b>round</b> <b>pad</b> splitting, aclinic loading platen splitting, arc loading platen splitting. In this paper, the direct tensile test, the splitting test and the influence of different loading modes on rock tensile strength were studied. In order to study the stress distribution, the progressive splitting failure process was numerically modeled under the four kinds of loading cases by the Realistic Failure Process Analysis code (RFPA 2 D). Results show that the stress states under angle pad splitting, <b>round</b> <b>pad</b> splitting are similar to the stress states under diametrical compressive state. Regarding that the <b>round</b> <b>pad</b> splitting test is easy to implement, and its numerical results are also stable relatively, the <b>round</b> <b>pad</b> loading mode was suggested to be adopted...|$|E

50|$|Intended to {{function}} as a powerful kind of drum machine, the MPC60 drew on design ideas from earlier groovebox machines, combining a powerful MIDI sequencer with the ability to sample one's own sounds. A major influence to Roger Linn's design was his love of rubber pads and how they could be pushed, prodded, and banged; this can be seen clearly in his designs especially from the MPC-60 onwards. Linn also had a passion for squares: thus, no <b>round</b> <b>pads</b> on the MPC Series. Later models feature increasingly powerful sampling, storage, interfacing and sound manipulation facilities, which broaden the use of instrument beyond just drum and rhythm tracks.|$|R

5000|$|Clothes {{transformed}} from boxy styles, with square shoulders, to feminine and luxurious, with soft shoulder lines, corseted waists, <b>round</b> <b>padded</b> hips, and long skirts, {{leading to the}} knee-length [...] "sack" [...] dress. The knee-length skirts and dresses were the most oversized items of this 1950s. The introduction of new fabrics, including Terylene, Orlon, Banlon, Acrilan and Poplin, allowed for new fashion styles to be both created and introduced. Among these were the [...] "wash-and-wear" [...] sweater, the permanently pleated skirt, and the [...] "drip-dry" [...] skirt. Skirts of this era known as circle skirts were supported by layers of petticoats, creating a circular look that accentuated the waist line. Essentially, the petticoat reinforced the femininity of this period.|$|R
