40|$|A January 2014 {{industrial}} accident contaminated the {{public water supply}} of approximately 300, 000 homes in and near Charleston, West Virginia (USA) {{with low levels of}} a strongly-smelling substance consisting principally of 4 -methylcyclohexane methanol (MCHM). The ensuing state of emergency closed schools and businesses. Hundreds of people sought medical care for symptoms they related to the incident. We surveyed 498 households by telephone to assess the episode’s health and economic impact as well as public perception of risk communication by responsible officials. Thirty two percent of households (159 / 498) <b>reported</b> <b>someone</b> with illness believed {{to be related to the}} chemical spill, chiefly dermato-logical or gastrointestinal symptoms. Respondents experienced more frequent symptoms of psychological distress during and within 30 days of the emergency than 90 days later. Sixty-seven respondent households (13 %) had <b>someone</b> <b>miss</b> work because of the crisis, missing a median of 3 days of work. Of 443 households reporting extra expenses due to the crisis, 46 % spent less than $ 100, while 10 % spent over $ 500 (estimated average about $ 206).

40|$|Little {{is known}} about which {{patients}} miss appointments or why they do so. Using routinely collected data from four practices, we aimed to determine whether patients who missed appointments differed {{in terms of their}} age, sex, and deprivation scores from those who did not, and to examine differences between the practices with respect <b>to</b> <b>missed</b> appointments. The likelihood of <b>someone</b> <b>missing</b> at least one appointment was independently associated with being female, living in a deprived area, and being a young adult. Living in a deprived area was associated with a threefold increase in the likelihood of missing an appointment, and the extent of this association was the same across all four practices.

30|$|Much {{research}} has demonstrated that people fail to detect visual changes, and some of this work has demonstrated that these failures can occur in important applied settings. In any given setting, however, {{it is not clear what}} the implications of these failures are. For example, when <b>someone</b> <b>misses</b> a visual change (such as the substitution of one icon for another) when learning about a graphical computer interface, did this failure occur simply because they failed to look at the changing properties, or did the learner look at the changing properties but fail to create a representation sufficiently durable to see the change? Moreover, when <b>someone</b> <b>misses</b> a change, how broad was their failure? Does a failure to see changes imply a failure to remember the visual features of the interface or, even more broadly, a failure to pay much attention at all to the contents of the lesson? We therefore assessed change blindness in a specific real-world setting: screen-captured instructional videos. We tested the degree to which change blindness in this setting occurs because of failures to look at the changing properties and whether these visual-cognitive failures are associated with failures to remember visual properties and failures to learn instructional contents.|$|R

In order to make progress in the understanding of mental {{health promotion}}, the aim {{of this study was to}} describe the experiences of health-promoting dialogues from the perspective of community-dwelling seniors with multimorbidity – what these seniors believe is important for achieving a dialogue that may promote their mental health. Seven interviews with six women and one man, aged 83 – 96 years, were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The results were summarized into nine subcategories and three categories. The underlying meaning of the text was formulated into an overarching theme that embraced every category, “perceived and well-managed as a unique individual”. These seniors with multimorbidity <b>missed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> talk to about their mental health, and needed partners that were accessible for health dialogues that could promote mental health. The participants missed friends and relatives to talk to and they (crucially) lacked health care or social service providers for health-promoting dialogues that may promote mental health. An optimal level of care can be achieved through involvement, continuity, and by providing a health-promoting dialogue based on seniors’ needs and wishes, with the remembrance that general health promotion also may promote mental health. Implications for clinical practice and further research are discussed. Keywords: aged, care of older people, mental health-promotion, municipal car...|$|R
