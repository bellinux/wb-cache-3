40|$|In {{this rich}} and {{informative}} study, Alain Boureau breathes new intellectual life {{into an old}} task—to explain the major European witch hunts of {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries by reference to conditions in late medieval European society. Such founding fathers of the field of witchcraft studies as the American Henry Charles Lea and the German Joseph Hansen argued that the mentalities and legal procedures that supported early modern witch-hunting stemmed directly from the repressive qualities of the medieval church. More recently, a number of European and American scholars (including myself) have focused on the earliest witch hunts and major treatises on witchcraft from the fifteenth century. It is widely recognized that these [End Page 244] trials and particularly these treatises were premised on authorities’ overt hereticization of demonic magic and even more fundamentally on a growing concern over the scope and reality of demonic power in the world.

Cultural beliefs and practices can have an important impact on breastfeeding. This paper describes some common beliefs that may discourage breastfeeding in Lebanon. Methods Participants were healthy first-time mothers recruited from hospitals throughout Lebanon to participate in a study on usage patterns of a telephone hotline for postpartum support. The hotline was available to mothers for the first four months postpartum and patterns of usage, as well as questions asked were recorded. Thematic analysis of the content of questions which referred to cultural beliefs and practices related to breastfeeding was conducted. Results Twenty four percent of the 353 women enrolled in the study called the hotline, and 50 % of the calls included questions about breastfeeding. Mothers expressed concern about having adequate amounts of breast milk or the quality of their breast milk. Concerns that the mother could potentially harm her infant though breastfeeding were <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of cultural beliefs. Having an inherited inability to produce milk, having "bad milk", and transmission of abdominal cramps to infants through breast milk were among the beliefs that were expressed. Although the researchers live and work in Lebanon, they were not aware of many of the beliefs that are reported in this study. Conclusion There are a number of cultural beliefs that could potentially discourage breastfeeding among Lebanese women.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two centuries, Books I and III of Ophir de España: Memorias historiales y políticas del Perú (1644) by Fernando de Montesinos have been {{generally}} overlooked. The cause of this inattention {{is associated with the}} mysterious and unique pre-Columbian historical account from Book II, which affords the most extensive version of Andean genealogy. Due to the excitement of Book II, colonial scholars have predominantly concentrated on thoroughly exploring the theoretical depths of the colonial manuscript selection. While all preceding studies are estimable and invaluable, this dissertation seeks to reunify Ophir de España by placing Book II back into its original context alongside Books I and III and by demonstrating that the text should be understood as a complementary component that supports Montesinos’s theses. As the entirety of Ophir de España and some of Montesinos’s other correlative works are evaluated, the true authorial design of the chronicle is revealed. Although the primary goal of Ophir de España is obvious, in that it centers on defending the legal rights of Spain in the New World, the major objective of this dissertation is to explain why Montesinos felt it was necessary to come to Spain’s defense during the seventeenth century when it had already ruled America for nearly one hundred years. During the course of this study, Nathan J. Gordon establishes that Montesinos wrote Ophir de España because he was concerned with the financial demise of Spain, which was <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of social, political, and economic problems: the disarray of the American mining industry, the decline of proper precious metal exports and imports, enduring the various expensive international and domestic conflicts, the corruption of bankers and creditors, along with the civil unrest of Peruvian landowners, merchants, clergymen, and nobles. As a passionate metallurgist and mineralogist, Montesinos was actively searching for ways to resolve Spain’s economic dilemma while simultaneous profiting from his efforts. Almost all of his research and writings focused on this undertaking, from mining instructional manuals, mining codification, and amalgamation practices, to protecting the legal rights of the Spanish Empire in the New World, with Ophir de España serving as a culmination to his work...|$|E
40|$|Recentno oblikovana, prostorna instalacija „K 19 “ likovnog umjetnika Zlatka Kopljara postavljena u urbanoj jezgri Zagreba, smislom je i sadržajem upućena na spomen žrtvama holokausta. Instalacija se sastoji od pet skulptura izrađenih od cigala, prvotno korištenih za gradnju zidova logora u Jasenovcu, a potom za gradnju stambenih objekata nakon rata. Iste su cigle danas, korištene kao materijal za oblikovanje skulptura, postavljenih na standardiziranim postamentima građevinskih Euro-paleta. Slagane u horizontalnim nizovima, tvore vertikalne blokove neujednačenih gornjih bridova, organizirajući pri tom fragmente fiktivne cjeline u polukružni prostorni prsten spomeničkog karaktera. Polazeći od zapažanja da opisani rad određenu povijesnu situaciju dokumentira neprikazivim narativom, nastoji se pokazati kako time nije iznevjerena narav medija u kojem se djelo pokazuje. Teorijska se argumentacija izvodi iz različitih interpretativnih strategija koje se bave sidrenjem kulturnih reprezentacija u djelu, kao da su upis etičkog koncepta u prostor. Ukazuje se na postupke kognitivnog mapiranja u zadanim okvirima moralnih geografija, na spregu kontingencije i konceptualizacije baštinjenja, te na mnemopoetički perspektivizam i intersubjektivni karakter srodnih reprezentacija. Podražavanjem susreta „viđenog i pročitanog“, kao „vidljivog i iskazanog“, nastoji se ukazati na efekte fikcionalizacije i teatralizacije u djelu, koji ne urušavaju aspekte svjedočenja (minule) stvarnosti, već joj pomažu pri-kazati se u komunikaciji sa svijetom. Premda se nedovršene ili urušene zidove skulptura instalacije „K 19 “ može interpretirati u kontekstu čitavog niza „promjenjivih atmosfera svjetova umjetnosti“, u zaključku se ukazuje da je sam autor, pripisujući svojstva formi, uspješno strukturirao sadržaj svoga djela, učinivši neprikazivo vidljivim. The recently-created spatial {{installation}} K 19 by visual artist Zlatko Kopljar, set up {{in downtown}} Zagreb, is directed through its meaning and content towards the remembrance of Holocaust victims. The installation consists of five sculptures, which are made from the bricks originally used to build {{the walls of the}} concentration camp at Jasenovac and then re-used for the construction of post-war houses. These same bricks have now been used to create the K 19 sculptures, which have been placed on bases created from standardized Euro-pallets used in construction. Laid into horizontal courses, the bricks form vertical blocks with irregular upper surfaces, and, at the same time, place fragments of a fictitious whole in a semi-circular spatial ring of a monument-like character. The nature of the material and its description, therefore, act as signifiers for the installation K 19, while its interpretation acquired a defined field of signification, a language of context, or, simply put, a discourse. The non-material became a constituent part of the installation by being added through the symbolization inherent in its description and resulted in a “reality remade”, which sprang from the fragile foundations of an “indeterminate denotation and representation-as” with regard to the origin of its material (bricks from Jasenovac and Euro-pallets). The vulnerability of that which is represented draws its strength (growing or healing itself) from a reversible movement being performed by the meaning and content of this artwork which simultaneously travels from present time towards history and from history towards the present. The depiction of a memory of a concentration camp, in the symbolic context of the artwork under discussion, is a process related to a kind of documentation, but it also acts as a testimony achieved through narrative without the possibility of showing the expressed narrative itself. Starting with the observation that the installation K 19 documents a specific historical situation possessing an unrepresentable narrative, the aim of the article is to demonstrate that this does not betray the nature of the medium chosen for this artwork. The article’s theory-based argument is <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of different interpretative strategies which study the anchoring of cultural representations in artworks by considering them as ethical concepts which are inscribed in a space. Such an inscription in space, having found a newly-created habitat, generates geographical categories from the past which are laden with moral narratives as their points of origin. Through this, the connection between cognitive mapping and contemporary art functions as a link between artistic practices and moral geography {{based on the fact that}} certain people, things and practices belong in certain spaces, places and landscapes, and not in others. Moral geography, therefore, obliges us to understand and theorize interrelationships between geographical, social and cultural classes. In this sense, installation K 19 does indeed render a “re-use” of the past actual, and re-contextualizes heritage through the choice of its material (bricks from Jasenovac) and in doing so finds reason and meaning for archaeology in the cultural space of a post-war “prosaic age” when people (at least in this case) used things out of existential necessity and not out of the desire to render the near past symbolical. In that respect the installation K 19 uses the heritage of a collective memory of the event, to which it refers in order to create a new conceptual synonym, and through its mourning character acquires not only the past but the spirit of the new age too. In order to recognize the artist’s individual experience of objectifying mnemopoetic perspectivism (in other words, Kopljar’s mnemopoetic approach to the creation of installation K 19) through the reversible signifying process, in the collective experience of the conceptualization of heritage, one requires intersubjective representations. This is because art and its own mnemopoetic perspectivism is rooted in collective thought while memory restores the integrity to the “commonplace ability to think and remember”. Through this, thought and memory represent our rootedness in time which, unlike moral geographies, is confirmed through a communion with “mobile people” who do not need to cohabit with us in the same space nor be provided with the same ideological patterns that became entrenched as customs inside the narrow territorial and mental boundaries of sedentary cultures. In this sense, it is possible to answer the question about the encounter between subjective and collective memory in an artwork only in a remade reality of an interpretation, that is, in a “secondary discourse of commentary” which opens up a new context for the understanding of the old world. By encouraging the meeting between “the seen and the read” as the meeting between “the visible and the expressible”, the article points to the effects of fictionalization and theatricalization which are present in this installation. Without corrupting testimonial aspects of a (bygone) reality, they help it become manifest in communication with the world. The article’s conclusion congratulates the artist’s mnemopoetic strategies and highlights the encounter of the installation with the world, together with its fictitious elements (the reversible narrative of its content) and theatricalization, as an inscription of an ethical concept in space, and, by this, encourages the encounter between “the seen and the read”, and between “the visible and the expressible”, as if it were possible still...|$|E

The {{first is the}} flow of genetic information from the DNA of an individual organism up to {{the characteristics of a}} population of such organisms (with an eventual passage of information back to the genetic pool, as encoded within DNA). The second is the flow of experimental information from observed biological phenomena to models that explain them, and then to new experiments in order to test these models. The discipline of bioinformatics has its <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of activities, including the organization of DNA sequence and protein three-dimensional structural data collections in the 1960 's and 1970 's. It has become a booming academic and industrial enterprise with the introduction of biological experiments that rapidly produce massive amounts of data (such as the multiple genome sequencing projects, the large scale analysis of gene expression, and the large scale analysis of protein-protein interactions). Basic biological science has always had an impact on clinical medicine (and clinical medical information systems), and is creating a new generation of epidemiologic, diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment modalities. Bioinformatics efforts that appear to be wholly geared towards basic science are likely to become relevant to clinical informatics in the coming decade. For example, DNA sequence information and sequence annotations will appear in the medical chart with increasing frequency. The algorithms developed for research in bioinformatics will soon become part of clinical information systems...|$|R
40|$|The paper observes {{some words}} for waterfowls (aquatic birds) {{occurring}} exclusively in South Slavic languages: пат, патка, пате, патица 'duck, goose' {{and some of}} their derivatives. The <b>root</b> <b>in</b> these words is generally attributed to common Slavic pъt'bird', but the origin of the vowel timbre (a instead of ъ) is unclear. Furthermore, this root could also be found in Eastern and rarely Western Slavic names for another bird 'куропатка' ('Perdix').  Here all of the attempts for explaining the root vowel are summarized; also I propose a new convergence with the turkish root pat-/pač-, which could have had strong influence on the <b>root</b> vowel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of derivatives <b>in</b> Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian and Croatian...|$|R
