60|$|The {{resonant}} hammering of a coffin-lid is no pleasant {{thing to}} hear, {{but those who}} have experience maintain that much more terrible is the soft swish of the bed-linen, the <b>reeving</b> and unreeving of the bed-tapes, when he who has fallen by the roadside is apparelled for burial, sinking gradually as the tapes are tied over, till the swaddled shape touches the floor {{and there is no}} protest against the indignity of hasty disposal.|$|E
60|$|The English {{officers}} stood talking, not {{far from}} his tent, in tones of indignation and disgust at the brutal sentence, and then walked towards their divisional camp. As they went, they saw a number of men standing round a tree.

60|$|Wilder cast a last glance {{of appeal}} at the Rover but he met no look, in return, from {{a face that}} was {{intentionally}} averted. Then, with a burning brain he felt himself rudely transferred from the quarter deck into the centre and less privileged portion of the ship. The violence of the passage, the hurried <b>reeving</b> of cords, and all the fearful preparations of a nautical execution, appeared but the business of a moment, to him who stood so near the verge of time.|$|E
60|$|No {{experienced}} mariner {{could set}} {{about the work}} with more discretion, or with a better knowledge of what was necessary to be done, than Mr, Blunt now showed. Saunders was directed to clear the launch, which had a roof on it, and still contained a respectable provision of poultry, sheep and pigs. The roof he was told not to disturb, since it might answer {{as a substitute for}} a deck; but everything was passed rapidly from the inside of the boat, which the steward commenced scrubbing and cleaning with an assiduity that he seldom manifested in his cabins. Fortunately, the tackles with which Mr. Leach had raised the sheers and stepped the jury-mast the previous morning were still lying on the deck, and Paul was spared the labour of <b>reeving</b> new ones. He went to work, therefore, to get up two on the substitute for a main-stay; a job that he had completed, through the aid of the two gentlemen on deck, by the time Saunders pronounced the boat to be in a fit condition to receive its cargo. The gripes were now loosened, and the fall of one of the tackles was led to the capstan.|$|E
6000|$|The whale-line is {{only two}} thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By {{experiment}} its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms. Towards {{the stern of the}} boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded [...] "sheaves," [...] or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the [...] "heart," [...] or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then <b>reeving</b> it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{the ships}} were headed round they passed through the Dutch as before, and this {{manoeuvre}} was several times repeated. Up to one o'clock in the day no great advantage had been gained on either side. Spars had been carried away; there were yawning gaps in the bulwarks; portholes had been knocked into one, guns dismounted, and many killed; but as yet no vessel on either side had been damaged to an extent that obliged her to strike her flag, or {{to fall out of}} the fighting line. There had been a pause after each encounter, in which both fleets had occupied themselves in repairing damages, as far as possible, <b>reeving</b> fresh ropes in place of those that had been shot away, clearing the wreckage of fallen spars and yards, and carrying the wounded below. Four of the Volunteers had been struck down--two of them mortally wounded, but after the first passage through the enemy's fleet, Prince Rupert had ordered them to arm themselves with muskets from the racks, and to keep up a fire at the Dutch ships as they passed, aiming specially at the man at the wheel. The order had been a very welcome one, for, like Cyril, they had all felt inactivity in such a scene to be a sore trial. They were now ranged along {{on both sides of the}} poop.|$|E
6000|$|It was rare, indeed, {{to see two}} letters-of-marque set-to as coolly, and as scientifically as {{were the}} facts with the Crisis and la Dame de Nantes; for so, as we {{afterwards}} ascertained, was our antagonist called. Neither party aimed at any great advantage by manoeuvring; but we came up alongside of [...] "The Lady," [...] as our men subsequently nick-named the Frenchman, the two vessels delivering their broadsides nearly at the same instant. I was stationed on the forecastle, {{in charge of the}} head-sheets, with orders to attend generally to the braces and the rigging, using a musket in moments that were not otherwise employed. Away went both my jib-sheet blocks at the beginning, giving me a very pretty job from the outset. This was but the commencement of trouble; for, during the two hours and a half that we lay battering la Dame de Nantes, and she lay battering us, I had really so much to attend to in the way of <b>reeving,</b> knotting, splicing, and turning in afresh, that I had scarcely a minute to look about me, in order to ascertain how the day was going. I fired my musket but twice. The glimpses I did manage to take were far from satisfactory, however; several of our people being killed or wounded, one gun fairly crippled by a shot, and our rigging in a sad plight. The only thing encourag'ng was Neb's shout, the fellow making it a point to roar almost as loud as his gun, at each discharge.|$|E
60|$|The last {{injunction}} was useless, Mildred having {{flown to}} execute her commission. Her quick mind readily comprehended {{what was expected}} of her, and her nimble fingers soon performed their task. Tying a knot in the ends of the line, she did as desired, and the small rope was soon dangling within reach of Wychecombe's arm. It is not easy to make a landsman understand the confidence which a sailor feels in a rope. Place but a frail and rotten piece of twisted hemp in his hand, and he will risk his person in situations from which he would otherwise recoil in dread. Accustomed to hang suspended in the air, with ropes only for his foothold, or with ropes to grasp with his hand, his eye gets an intuitive knowledge of what will sustain him, and he unhesitatingly trusts his person to a few seemingly slight strands, that, to one unpractised, appear wholly unworthy of his confidence. Signal-halyards are ropes smaller than the little finger of a man of any size; but they are usually made with care, and every rope-yarn tells. Wychecombe, too, was aware that these particular halyards were new, for he had assisted in <b>reeving</b> them himself, only the week before. It was owing to this circumstance that they were long enough to reach him; a large allowance for wear and tear having been made in cutting them from the coil. As it was, the ends dropped some twenty feet below the ledge on which he stood.|$|E

6000|$|We parted {{company with}} the Blucher, in a heavy gale; our ship bearing up for Rio. After getting {{rid of some of}} our ballast, however, and {{changing}} the cargo of pig-lead, our vessel was easier, and did not go in. Nothing further occurred, worth mentioning, until we got off Van Diemen's Land. Two days after seeing the land, a boy fell from the fore-top-gallant yard, while <b>reeving</b> the studding-sail halyards. I had just turned in, after eating my dinner, having the watch below, when I heard the cry of [...] "a man overboard!" [...] Running on deck, as I was, I jumped into a quarter-boat, followed by four men, and we were immediately lowered down. The ship was rounded-to, and I heard the poor fellow calling out to me by name, to save him. I saw him, astern, very plainly, while on the ship's quarter; but lost sight of him, as soon as the boat was in the water. The sky-light-hood had been thrown overboard, and was floating in the ship's wake. We steered for that; but could neither see nor hear anything more of the poor fellow. We got his hat, and we picked up the hood of the sky-light, but could not find the boy. He had, unquestionably, gone down before we reached the spot where he had been floating, as his hat must have pointed out the place. We got the hat first; and then, seeing nothing of the lad, we pulled back to take in the hood; which was quite large. While employed in taking it in, a squall passed over the boat; which nearly blew it away from us. Being very busy in securing the hood, no one had leisure to look about; but the duty was no sooner done, than one of the men called out, that he could not see the ship! Sure enough, the William and Jane had disappeared! and there we were, left {{in the middle of the}} ocean, in a six-oared pinnace, without a morsel of food, and I myself, without hat, shoes, jacket or trowsers. In a word, I had nothing on me but my drawers and a flannel shirt. Fortunately, the captain kept a breaker of fresh water in each boat, and we had a small supply of this great requisite;--enough, perhaps, to last five men two or three days.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reeving</b> to {{disadvantage}} adds {{an extra}} sheave {{to change the}} direction of the pulling line, which increases friction losses without improving the velocity ratio.

50|$|The {{decision}} of which to use depends on pragmatic considerations {{for the total}} ergonomics of working with a particular situation. <b>Reeving</b> to advantage is the most efficient use of equipment and resources.
