40|$|Depressions in {{patients}} with schizophrenia in remission are quite common; however, their genesis and clinical features have been insufficiently studied. Objective: to assess the clinical features of depressions occurring {{in patients}} with paroxysmal schizophrenia in remission. Patients and methods. 88 patients with nonpsychotic depression who were diagnosed with paroxysmal schizophrenia in drug remission were examined. A total of 200 depressive episodes were analyzed. The patients' status was assessed according to the diagnostic criteria in the ICD- 10 Classification of Depressive Disorders. For quantitative evaluation, the investigators used psychometric scales, such as the Calgary Depression Schizophrenia Scale and the PANSS Negative Subscale. Results. There were two types of post-schizophrenic depressions: endogenous and <b>reactive.</b> Endogenous <b>depressions</b> are divided into postpsychotic depressions developing in remission and delayed depressive episodes; <b>reactive</b> <b>depressions</b> are divided into nosogenic and psychogenic. Endogenous depressions represent a stage of the schizophrenic process; reactive ones are a schizophrenic patient's depressive reaction to a stressful situation. The latter occur {{in patients with}} a less severe schizophrenic defect, a higher critical attitude toward illness, and a better social and labor adaptation. Endogenous depressions have averagely a longer duration and a greater severity and besides anxiety symptoms, they include asthenic and apathetic symptoms; <b>reactive</b> <b>depressions</b> comprise only anxious and dreary manifestations. Conclusion. Knowledge about the characteristics of depressions in schizophrenia will ensure their more accurate diagnosis and prescribe adequate therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{longitudinal}} psychiatric and endocrine {{observations are}} reported on 6 women receiving psychotherapy for <b>reactive</b> <b>depressions.</b> The authors hypothe-sized that confrontation of the precipitating loss during psychotherapy would be transiently more painful {{to the patient}} than the previous organized depressive equilibrium state. It was therefore predicted that corticosteroid excretion, as an index of emotional distress, would be highest {{during the period of}} confrontation of loss. (Psychiatric judgments were made independent of endocrine data.) The hypothesis was supported to the p < 0. 005 level for the group of 6 pa-tients. Corticosteroid elevations during periods of confrontation of loss averaged 36 % above levels for depressive equilibrium periods. The significance of the findings is discussed in terms of psychoanalytic theories of depressive illness, particularly the concept "primary " or "essential " depressive experience as distinguished from the secondary depressive symptom syndrome.

40|$|The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant {{accident}}, in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), on April 26, 1986, was {{the first}} major nuclear power plant accident that resulted in a large-scale fire and subsequent explosions, immediate and delayed deaths of plant operators and emergency service workers, and the radioactive contamination of a significant land area. The release of radioactive material, over a 10 -day period, resulted in millions of Soviets, and other Europeans, being exposed to measurable levels of radioactive fallout. Because of the effects of wind and rain, the radioactive nuclide fallout distribution patterns are not well defined, though they appear to be focused in three contiguous Soviet Republics: the Ukrainian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR, and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Further, because of the many radioactive nuclides (krypton, xenon, cesium, iodine, strontium, plutonium) released by the prolonged fires at Chernobyl, the long-term medical, psychological, social, and economic effects will require careful and prolonged study. Specifically, studies on the medical (leukemia, cancers, thyroid disease) and psychological (<b>reactive</b> <b>depressions,</b> post-traumatic stress disorders, family disorganization) consequences of continued low dose radiation exposure in the affected villages and towns need to be conducted so that a coherent, comprehensive, community-oriented plan may evolve that will not cause those already affected any additional harm and confusion...|$|R

An Arab sample of 53 cases was subjected to the original validation procedures which involved a preliminary exercise and a translation from English to Arabic.

Statistical analyses of the internal consistency and stability of the Arabic-BDI indicated {{a high degree of}} reliability.

The results of the cross-cultural validation study agree favorably with those of the original American validation. Although the Arabic inventory makes possible an assessment of the level and intensity of a <b>reactive</b> type <b>depression</b> suffered by Saudi Arab psychiatric outpatients living in the Eastern Province, it must be adapted dialectically for other Arab-speaking regions. AN ARABIC VALIDATION OF A DEPRESSION INVENTORY There is an emerging need today for psychological assessment tools which can be used within and across cultures and countries. In the Middle eastern countries, this need is accentuated. As physical health scrvices expand rapidly, requests for mental health services by both native and expatriate populations are increasing. It appeared, therefore, that the clinicial interview would be benefitted by a fast and efficient appraisal and measurement of the mental state of persons suffering from a <b>reactive</b> type <b>depression.</b> The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which is a simple, quantitative self-rating depression scale, satisfied these requirements. It was hoped that measurement using etic variables with emic operations (Triandis, 1980) could generate scores having similar meaning in the Saudi Arab and American population, and thereby contribute to a more effective therapy by the bi-lingual clinicians.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the outcome of adoptions and to study the gene-environment influences on psychiatric illness as well as sick-leave patterns. The material consists of 2 966 adopted persons born between 1917 and 1949, their 5 932 adoptive parents and 5 438 identified biological parents. Adopted persons had a higher incidence of personality disorders and substance abuse than non-adopted controls. Adopted men also had an increased incidence of neuroses. Adopted women had an increased sick-leave because of somatic complaints, especially upper respiratory tract infections and abdominal complaints of short duration. Somatization i. e. more than 2 sick-leaves/year because of somatic complaint together with nervous complaints was more frequent among adopted women. Women with somatization could be separated into 2 types according to the pattern of sick-leave. Type 1 ("high frequency") had frequent sick-leaves for psychiatric, abdominal and back complaints. They also had a high frequency of alcohol abuse. Type 2 ("diversiform") had more diverse complaints and had fewer sick-leaves because of nervous complaints. High frequency somatizers had biological fathers with teenage onset of criminality and frequent registrations for alcohol abuse. Diversiform somatizers had the same genetic background as adopted men with petty criminality or male limited alcoholism. No specific genetic influences on treated depression or substance abuse were found in this study. However, a non-specific vulnerability of the biological mother influenced on the risk of depression and substance abuse among adopted women. There were some indications that placement in the adoptive home between 6 and 12 months of age was associated with <b>reactive</b> neurotic <b>depression</b> in adult life. Otherwise early negative experiences in term of unstable placements before adoption did not significantly influence on psychiatric illness in adulthood. Affective disorders in the adoptive father were associated with treatment for depressions or substance abuse in the adoptee.

40|$|Background. Many {{people who}} develop {{schizophrenia}} have impairments in intellectual and social functioning that are detectable from early childhood. However, some patients do not exhibit such deficits, and {{this suggests that}} they may have suffered less neurodevelopmental damage. We hypothesized that the aetiology and form of schizophrenia may differ in such patients. We therefore studied a group of schizophrenic patients who were functioning well enough to enter university prior to illness onset. Methods. The casenotes of 46 university-educated patients and 48 non-university-educated patients were rated on several schedules including the OPCRIT checklist, and the two groups were compared using univariate statistical techniques. Principal components analysis was then performed using data from all patients, and the factor scores for each principal component were compared between groups. Results. Univariate analyses showed the university-educated patients had an excess of depressive symptoms, and a paucity of core schizophrenic symptoms. Four principal components emerged in the principal components analysis: mania, biological depression, schizophrenic symptoms, and a <b>reactive</b> <b>depression.</b> University-educated patients scored significantly higher on the <b>reactive</b> <b>depression</b> principal component, and lower on the schizophrenic symptoms principal component, than the non-university-educated patients.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} white matter (WM) brain alterations in asymptomatic patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods: We compared diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived WM fractional anisotropy (FA) between HIV-patients with and without mild macroscopic brain lesions determined using standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We furthermore investigated whether WM alterations co-occurred with neurocognitive deficits and depression. We performed structural MRI and DTI for 19 patients and 19 age-matched healthy controls. Regionally-specific WM integrity was investigated using voxel-based statistics of whole-brain FA maps and region-of-interest analysis. Each patient underwent laboratory and neuropsychological tests. Results: Structural MRI revealed no lesions in twelve (HIV-MRN) and unspecific mild macrostructural lesions in seven patients (HIV-MRL). Both analyses revealed widespread FA-alterations in all patients. Patients with HIV-MRL had FA-alterations primarily adjacent to the observed lesions and, whilst reduced in extent, patients with HIV-MRN also exhibited FA-alterations in similar regions. Patients with evidence of depression showed FA-increase in the ventral tegmental area, pallidum and nucleus accumbens in both hemispheres, and patients with evidence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder showed widespread FA-reduction. Conclusion: These results show that patients with HIV-MRN have evidence of FA-alterations in similar regions that are lesioned in HIV-MRL patients, suggesting common neuropathological processes. Furthermore, they suggest a biological rather than a <b>reactive</b> origin of <b>depression</b> in HIV-patients...|$|R
40|$|Depression is {{a medical}} {{condition}} with a complex biological pattern of aetiology, involving genetic and epigenetic factors, along with different environmental stressors. Recent evidence suggests that oxidative stress processes might play a relevant role in the pathogenic mechanism(s) underlying many major psychiatric disorders, including <b>depression.</b> <b>Reactive</b> oxygen and nitrogen species {{have been shown to}} modulate levels and activity of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, dopamine and glutamate, the principal neurotransmitters involved in the neurobiology of depression. Major depression has been associated with lowered concentrations of several endogenous antioxidant compounds, such as vitamin E, zinc and coenzyme Q 10, or enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, and with an impairment of the total antioxidant status. These observations introduce new potential targets for the development of therapeutic interventions based on antioxidant compounds. The present review focuses on the possible role of oxidative stress processes in the pathogenesis of depression. The therapeutic potential of antioxidant compounds as a co-adjuvant treatment to conventional antidepressants is discussed. For instance, N-acetyl-cysteine has been shown to have a significant benefit on depressive symptoms in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Additionally, curcumin, the yellow pigment of curry, has been shown to strongly interfere with neuronal redox homeostasis in the CNS and to possess antidepressant activity in various animal models of depression, also thanks to its ability to inhibit monoamine oxidases. There is an urgent need to develop better tolerated and more effective treatments for depressive disorders and several antioxidant treatments appear promising and deserve further study...|$|R

Although preoperative depression has been implicated as the strongest predictor of depression after surgery, the characteristics thought to influence reactive or persistent depression have been poorly investigated in cardiac surgery patients. Therefore, the main aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether preexisting depression rather than perioperative variables may predict postoperative reactive or persistent depression. Methods: Ninety-six patients completed a psychological evaluation, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES-D) scale and the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Y 1 /Y 2) for depression and anxiety, respectively, before surgery and at three-month follow-up. Results: Twenty-seven (28 %) and 24 (25 %) patients had depression preoperatively and at three-month follow-up, respectively. Postoperative depression was predicted by preoperative scores in CES-D (beta= 0. 29, P. 75). Specifically, patients with <b>reactive</b> <b>depression</b> showed greater EuroSCORE than those without depression (P <. 05), whereas patients with persistent depression had greater preoperative CES-D scores than those whose depression improved after surgery (P <. 01).
