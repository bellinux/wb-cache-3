A full-scale engine rig has been constructed, and stationary NOx redn. tests performed. In the NOx storage and redn. approach, NOx is stored on a BaO surface as Ba(NO 3) 2 under long lean conditions and desorbed and reduced under short rich conditions. The rich conditions are created by injection of diesel fuel into the exhaust stream. The stationary NOx redn. tests have been performed at nine load points on an engine rig.

50|$|In general terms, the shelterwood {{system is}} a series of partial cuts that removes the trees of an {{existing}} stand over several years and eventually culminates in a final cut that creates a new even-aged stand. It is an even-aged regeneration method that removes trees in a series of three harvests: 1) Preparatory cut; 2) Establishment cut; and 3) Removal cut. The success of practising a shelterwood system is closely related to: 1. the length of the <b>regeneration</b> <b>period,</b> i.e. the time from the shelterwood cutting to the date when a new generation of trees has been established; 2.the quality of the new tree stand with respect to stand density and growth; and 3.the value increment of the shelter trees.

The method's objective is to establish new forest reproduction under the shelter of the retained trees. Unlike the seed-tree method, residual trees alter understory environmental conditions (i.e. sunlight, temperature, and moisture) that influence tree seedling growth. This method can also find a middle ground with the light ambiance by having less light accessible to competitors while still being able to provide enough light for tree regeneration. Hence, shelterwood methods are most often chosen for site types characterized by extreme conditions, in order to create a new tree generation within a reasonable time period. These conditions are valid foremost on level ground sites which are either dry and poor or moist and fertile.|$|E

Following logging there is a four-fold increase in runoff volumes resulting from a decrease in saturated permeability from 1 x 10 - m/s in undisturbed rain forest to 1 x 10 - 8 m/s in recently logged parts of the catchment. Following logging sediment yield increases by over two orders of magnitude. These results help to elucidate both the average changes in catchment response due to rain forest logging, and the likely spatial variability that results from different degrees of landuse change {{in different parts of the}} catchment. Catchments in the Humid Tropics frequently consist of spatial units at different stages of regeneration.

The proposed dehumidifier system controls the humidity ratio of the confined space when a large amount of moisture is released, and uses ambient space air for regeneration when the spaces produce no moisture. The generated moisture air during the <b>regeneration</b> <b>period</b> can be discharged through continuous exhaust ventilation. ^ In the dissertation, the physical system design is described and dehumidifier performance models and CFD models are integrated and developed. Numerical simulations were conducted to compare the results of a conventional ventilation system and a dehumidifier system. ^ The results of the simulations show that the dehumidifier system reduced moisture condensation by 24. 0 % over a conventional exhaust ventilation system. It was also found that the configurations of the confined space and dehumidifier, e. g., the locations of the inlet air, exhaust air and moisture source, significantly impacted the space air humidity ratio and temperature distributions. ^ The theoretical analysis in the feasibility investigation suggests that an optimal dehumidifier system reduces moisture condensation and saves energy. Thus, the system optimizations are achieved by three approaches: optimal dehumidifier design parameters, improved dehumidifier location, and optimal <b>regeneration</b> <b>period.</b> ^ The results of the optimizations show that an improved dehumidifier location can reduce moisture condensation by 33. 1 % over the original dehumidifier location in the feasibility investigation. In addition, use of an optimal reheat desiccant temperature can reduce the <b>regeneration</b> <b>period</b> by 16. 0 % and the total performance period by 12. 5 %. ^ Yearly energy consumption and cost were compared between a base ventilation system and an optimal dehumidifier system for a bathroom in a hotel at two locations of Miami and Omaha.

The total yearly electricity energy consumption in an optimal dehumidifier system can be saved by 63. 7 % in Omaha and 65. 2 % in Miami.

Restocking of naturally k-dominated areas (Porites reefs) with species further on the r-side of the scale, like Acropora should be avoided since this could preclude the re- establishment of a mimick of the original community within the desired time-frame due to competitive processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} stand structure, tree species composition, {{proportion}} of habitat types {{and land use}} history on breeding bird assemblages in temperate mixed forests in Western Hungary were studied. The species richness, the abundance and {{the composition of the}} whole breeding bird assemblage and of some groups formed on the basis of nesting site and rarity were examined. Stand structural variables had the highest impact on the breeding bird assemblage, while tree species composition, the varying proportion of vegetation types and land use history had no significant effect. In the case of the species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole assemblage, the most important variables were the mean diameter of trees, the vegetation cover of the forest floor and the dead wood volume. The explained variance in the linear models of different groups varied between 20 % and 60 %, and the relative importance of these three variables also differed considerably. These results indicate that forest management may considerably influence the diversity and the composition of birds, as all the structural elements affecting birds deeply depend on it. Within the shelterwood management system, the elongation of the rotation and <b>regeneration</b> <b>periods,</b> and the relatively high proportion of retention tree groups after harvest could contribute to the conservation of forest birds. Our results also showed that for the forest bird communities, both the prevalence of big trees and the presence of a dense understory layer are important. Management regimes which apply continuous forest cover might be more appropriate for providing these structural elements simultaneously on small spatial scales, and for the maintenance of a more diverse bird community, thus healthier forest ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{approximately}} half of the drinking water for the city of Basel (Switzerland) is obtained by an artificial groundwater recharge system in a former floodplain area called “Lange Erlen”. Generally, the use of groundwater for drinking water production may lower groundwater tables. Artificial groundwater recharge is a practice of directing and simultaneously purifying water into aquifers, thereby raising the groundwater table and guaranteeing sufficient drinking water sources. Water purification through artificial groundwater recharge is widespread. However, it more commonly involves areas without vegetation, i. e. slow sand filters, dunes or channels and is combined with long flooding periods. In contrast, at the “Lange Erlen”, forested areas are periodically flooded (max. 10 days) with water from the river Rhine. This routine is interrupted by longer <b>regeneration</b> <b>periods.</b> To date, water infiltration and purification processes have remained constant and satisfactory since the system has been established almost 100 years ago. However, detailed knowledge on the belowground processes that have been sustaining the water purification capacity of “Lange Erlen” is scarce. Intensive flooding may detrimentally affect earthworm populations and result in clogging of the topsoil, which is a common problem in groundwater recharge systems. Earthworms are known to influence water infiltration and aeration of soils, but most of the existing knowledge relates to grasslands and {{little is known about the}} role of earthworms for water infiltration in forests. To better understand the “Lange Erlen” system in the shallow soil layer, earthworm populations, microbial parameters (substrate induced respiration, SIR) and water infiltration rates were studied at the recharge areas. The findings suggest that earthworms are an important factor of the long-term sustainability of this system (for the past 100 years). The total earthworm numbers and biomass in watered sites exceeded those of non-watered sites (+ 51...|$|R
