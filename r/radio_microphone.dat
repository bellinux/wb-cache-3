5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a <b>radio</b> <b>microphone</b> to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E
500|$|Ashdown {{explained}} that filming [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] {{to look like}} a typical episode of EastEnders was difficult, giving the example of a scene involving a ringing mobile phone. In a usual EastEnders episode, the viewer would see a shot of the phone and know who was calling. In the live episode, the caller would have to be visually or audibly obvious, {{as a result of the}} camera set-up and inability to edit scenes. He described the episode's biggest limitation as the weather, explaining that [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] begins with a direct pickup from the previous episode of EastEnders, with the same characters in the same outside location, leaving the crew hoping for a dry night. Sound was also a problem, as sound quality is better using boom rods than radio microphones, but booms often dip into shot during the filming of EastEnders. Ashdown commented that the production crew would be using booms where possible, but that all cast members with dialogue would be given a <b>radio</b> <b>microphone</b> as backup.|$|E
500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. I wanted to make a film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So I was living in Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They convinced me to come to church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldn’t clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. Someone said, ‘What happened to Jesus? I saw you dancing last night and you were totally fine.’ They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a <b>radio</b> <b>microphone),</b> composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E

5000|$|Digital <b>radio</b> <b>microphones</b> are {{inherently}} {{more difficult for}} the casual 'scanner' listener to intercept because conventional [...] "scanning receivers" [...] are generally only capable of de-modulating conventional analogue modulation schemes such as FM and AM. However, some digital wireless microphone systems additionally offer encryption technology in an attempt to prevent more serious 'eavesdropping' which may be of concern for corporate users and those using <b>radio</b> <b>microphones</b> in security sensitive situations.|$|R
2500|$|James {{developed}} his television {{career as a}} guest commentator on various shows, including as an occasional co-presenter with Tony Wilson on the first series of So It Goes, the Granada Television pop music show. On the show when the Sex Pistols made their TV debut, James commented: [...] "During the recording, the task of keeping the little bastards under control was given to me. With {{the aid of a}} <b>radio</b> <b>microphone,</b> I was able to shout them down, but it was a near thing...they attacked everything around them and had difficulty in being polite even to each other".|$|E
2500|$|The John F.

Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Made on a common Dictaphone dictation machine that recorded sounds in grooves pressed into a thin vinyl-plastic belt, the recording gained prominence among Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists from 1978, in which the HSCA used it to conclude that there was a [...] "high probability" [...] that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone and that the Kennedy assassination {{was the result of a}} conspiracy. Later scientific examination discredited this interpretation of the evidence.|$|E
