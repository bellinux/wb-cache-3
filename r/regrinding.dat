2500|$|Graphite is mined by both {{open pit}} and {{underground}} methods. Graphite usually needs beneficiation. This may {{be carried out}} by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite. Beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and [...] "marks" [...] (coats) the particles of gangue. This makes the [...] "marked" [...] gangue particles float off with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated <b>regrinding</b> and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid (for a silicate gangue) or hydrochloric acid (for a carbonate gangue).|$|E
60|$|And {{now that}} the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a {{momentary}} gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and <b>regrinding</b> in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.|$|E

50|$|Corn is {{prepared}} for breading by boiling in water with alkali, resulting in a de-skinned material called nixtamalized masa. Masa {{can be used for}} industrial purposes (tortillas, tamales, chips), but it must be used quickly because its glutens change rapidly and binding decreases rapidly. Masa does not store well and chemicals are added to enhance preservation at the expense of quality. At its peak attempting to use masa as dough generally results in a crumbly flat bread, correctable by <b>regrinding</b> masa to a fine flour and adding gums (such as xanthan gum). In contrast the glutens in wheat have more adhesive properties that change when prepared in different ways. The glutenins, for example, stretch, but can also fix their shape at high temperatures, causing bread to maintainits characteristic rise.|$|E
50|$|The {{feed into}} the {{concentrate}} processing section {{is made up}} of fines concentrate (<0.5 mm) and DMS concentrate (-9 +0.5 mm), containing mainly wolframite, cassiterite, iron oxides, and some silicates and arsenic minerals. The DMS concentrate is fed into a <b>regrind</b> ball mill which operates in closed circuit with a 450 micron Derrick sizing screen. The fines concentrate reports onto this Derrick screen directly to avoid over-grinding of the finer portion of this stream. The undersize of the <b>regrind</b> mill sizing screen is pumped via a dewatering cyclone into a conditioning tank. In this tank, several chemicals are added to enable sulphide flotation in three Outotec Denver flotation cells, targeting removal of arsenopyrite.

40|$|Issue: Contamination {{limits the}} {{ultimate}} marketability {{of the full}} range of PET plastic containers collected by local recycling programs. Contamination reduces the value of recyclable PET; it hinders processing and causes unproductive downtime and clean-up expenses for PET processors, reclaimers and end-users; and, it results in unnecessary manufacturing waste from the PET recycling process. Background: Intermediate plastic processors take in baled (and in some cases loose) plastic containers that have been separated from other recycable materials at MRFs, buyback or drop-off centers. Intermediate processors then granulate the containers for sale as “dirty <b>regrind</b> ” to reclaimers and end-users. In most cases, plastic intermediate processors take in loose plastic bottles and produce baled plastics for sale to plastic recycling facilities (PRFs), reclaimers or end-users. Most PRFs are designed to separate plastics into their individual resin categories (if they accept bales of mixed plastic bottles), and then further separate each plastic resin type by color or other market specification parameters.

50|$|Blue frit, {{also known}} as Egyptian blue, was made from quartz, lime, a copper compound, and an alkali flux, all heated to a {{temperature}} between 850 and 1000°C. Quartz sand {{may have been used}} to contribute silica to the frit. The copper content must be greater than the lime content {{in order to create a}} blue frit. Ultimately the frit consists of cuprorivaite (CaCuSi4O10) crystals and “partially reacted quartz particles bonded together” by interstitial glass. Despite an argument to the contrary, scientists have found that, regardless of alkali content, the cuprorivaite crystals develop by “nucleation or growth within a liquid or glass phase.” However, alkali content—and the coarseness of the cuprorivaite crystals—contribute to the shade of blue in the frit. High alkali content will yield “a large proportion of glass,” thereby diluting the cuprorivaite crystals and producing lighter shades of blue. <b>Regrinding</b> and resintering the frit will create finer cuprorivaite crystals, also producing lighter shades.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 120 - 123). It {{was identified}} that potential improvements in recoveries {{were to be}} found in the better use of the <b>regrind</b> stages at a number of Anglo-Platinum concentrators. Historically, these concentrators used to operate in an open circuit configuration, over a relatively short period, the circuits were changed to closed circuit configurations because of the reported benefits of operating in this configuration. The effect of closing the circuit had, however not been quantified in these concentrators. This dissertation looks at quantifying the effects of each configuration with the purpose of drawing meaningful comparisons between them. The circuit configurations studied are open circuit, I-stage and 2 -stage closed circuit configurations. The primary difference between these configurations is the network of hydrocyclones. This study pays special attention to the effect of cyclone performance on the <b>regrind</b> circuit performance. Comparisons were made between the open and the 2 -stage closed circuits in three concentrators, and surprisingly the closed circuit did not show any improvement over the open circuit configuration from a combination efficiency perspective. The cyclones performance was analysed, and it was observed that the cyclones were operating inefficiently, most likely because the cyclones employed were not appropriate for <b>regrind</b> circuits. A further comparison was made between the I-stage and 2 -stage circuit configurations and the I-stage closed circuit configuration proved to be more efficient than the 2 -stage closed circuit configuration. Simulations were conducted to predict the performance of the circuit configurations by using more appropriate cyclones which are smaller in size. These cyclones are currently being used in a similar application in another concentrator. The simulations indicated that significant improvements in comminution performance could be realised with the utilisation of more appropriate cyclones, to achieve the closed circuit configuration...|$|R

The complex consists of the Kemess South open pit mine and a 52, 000 tonnes per day mill. Hypogene, supergene and leach cap ores are processed using conventional crushing, grinding, and flotation techniques to produce gold-copper concentrates with minor by-product silver value. The rougher flotation concentrate is re-ground in closed circuit before being cleaned to final concentrate grade. Historically, gold losses in the cleaner tailings were primarily associated with pyrite, with only minor amounts of free gold. More recently, with the processing of high pyrite ores, the major losses were found to be free gold less than 10 microns in size. The fine grind required for the high pyrite ores resulted in over-grinding of the free gold particles in the <b>regrind</b> circuit, contributing to poor flotation characteristics.

The presence of the iron hydroxide coating inhibits flotation of these particles. One study showed that changing from forged steel grinding balls to high chromium steel balls was found to reduce the iron in the surface atomic composition of galena from 16.6% to 10.2%, but grinding with a ceramic medium reduced the surface iron to less than 0.1%.

Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder for use as a slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser).

5000|$|To sharpen or {{finish the}} blade using a {{suspended}} strop, the razor is pushed toward the suspension ring while both {{the back and}} the cutting edge lie flat on the strop and {{with the back of}} the blade. No pressure should be applied on the cutting edge. A strop may be two sided with leather on one side and cloth on the other side. The cloth is used for blade alignment and sharpening. The leather is for finishing.The stropping process involves sliding the razor blade flat on the strop; upon reaching the end of the cloth or leather near the suspension ring, the blade is turned about its back (clockwise for a right-handed barber; counter-clockwise for a left-handed one) until the cutting edge touches the strop. It is then pulled toward the rectangular handle of the strop with back and cutting edge flat on the strop as before. The blade is moved in a slightly diagonal direction so to give every point of the edge a chance to touch the strop, without applying too much pressure. This process aligns the cutting edge properly with the back of the blade, avoiding [...] "bumps" [...] on the cutting edge. Rotating the blade on the strop about the cutting edge can damage it because such use will impact the micro-alignment of the edge. Depending on use and condition, the blade can be sharpened occasionally by using a razor hone.

The primary goal was to find methods how the undesired output, plastic waste or scrap, could be eliminated. The Group’s target is to decrease the scrap percentage to 7. 5 % (in the year 2015 it was 10. 06 %). The secondary target was to study how scrap could be recycled inside the factory to valuable input, <b>regrind.</b> The current state of the core company was studied through participant and non-participant observation, through interviews and the analysis of the ERP- and BI-programs and also by working short periods in the production. Observation continued during {{the research}} and meant taking part in morning meetings and observing other daily operations. Numerical data showed the efficiency of the current extrusion process. Working in the production made it possible to see the production process from inside. The interviews and the analysis helped to discover the main development issues in the current state. Literature was used for surveying the requirements for the closed-loop system, for the concept of process-orientated thinking, elements of extrusion and for the study of plastics recycling. The literature about Lean-Philosophy was also important for this research. The most important results of the research concern development issues and recommendations of the raw material purchase, inventory and material management, the production process, recycling, information flows and daily management. Main problems were related to the lack of systematic and studied methods. Also the use of <b>regrind</b> requires scientifically studied and tested ratios, because its mechanical and processing properties (for instance MFI and bulk density) change during recycling.
