500|$|The serious {{nature of}} the {{environmental}} problems the lake has been experienced has been widely publicised and has {{been brought to the}} attention of the Supreme Court of India. Public Interest Litigations (PILs) have been filed in court demonstrating the environmental dangers posed to the lake by sewage, wastes and effluents. The PILs have sought injunctions of the court for setting up of an integrated ring sewage system encircling the Lake; release of funds by the Government of India to undertake measures to check pollution and to inaugurate a High Powered Committee to monitor proper utilisation of the allotted funds. The committee is under obligation to post feedback of progression developments from time to time, directly to the Supreme Court. The PIL, filed in 2001, has resulted in a number of directives from the court to the funding and implementing agencies and the case is continuing. Consequently, under the National Lake Conservation Plan of the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India, funds to the extent Rs 2987.6million were sanctioned in September 2005 for the conservation of the lake. The restoration and rehabilitation measures envisaged under the [...] "Conservation and Management of Dal" [...] are under various stages of implementation with the funds allocated by the Government of India for the purpose. Some of the measures undertaken for rehabilitating the lake to bring it to its original eutrophication free status involved measures such as construction of siltation tanks, mechanical deweeding, regrouping of houseboats, deepening of outflow channel and removal of bunds and barricades, including some floating gardens. In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on new construction works close to the lakefront, including the building of new house boats. Resettlement plans for migrating the population from the lakefront have also evolved. The long-term development plans also deal with the <b>reafforestation</b> of catchment area to reduce erosion movement and movement of silt and to regulate grazing by livestock. Recent reports indicate that, as of 2010, 40% of the measures have been implemented.|$|E

2500|$|Forests {{moderate}} the local climate {{and the global}} water cycle through their light reflectance (albedo) and evapotranspiration. They also conserve biodiversity, protect water quality, preserve soil and soil quality, provide fuel and pharmaceuticals, and purify the air. These free ecosystem services are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal {{when compared with the}} economic benefits of logging and clearance which, through soil degradation and organic decomposition returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions). Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in <b>reafforestation</b> schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable carbon-neutral fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services. However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon so the potential of forests to act as carbon [...] "sinks" [...] is [...] "at risk of being lost entirely".|$|E

40|$|Regeneration {{processes}} in riparian forests in islands Vardim and Malak Vardim were studied. Stands in natural oak {{forests in the}} investigated region are insignificantly impacted by anthropogenic activities in the last 40 - 50 years. They are dominated by Quercus robur L. Among the native tree species Populus alba L., Ulmus laevis Pall. and Pyrus communis L. are mostly spread. The introduced Amorpha fruticosa L. and Fraxinus americana L. spread in large scales. The regeneration potential of U. laevis is good and to less extent- of Q. robur. Main reason for the unsatisfactory regeneration of Q. robur is grazing of wild animals. Carrying out of regen-erating cuttings in Vardim oak forests is difficult due to the introduced limiting status of pro-tected area. For the successful natural regeneration of Quercus robur, it is recommended to make fences around solitaire and groups of fruiting trees, as well as strict protection and soil scarifi-cation. To stop the further invasion of introduced species and to increase the participation of other native tree species, it is recommended the following: (i) <b>reafforestations</b> with hybrid Euroamerican poplars and other exotic tree species are no longer performed; (ii) clear cuttings in forests composed by native tree and shrub species are stopped; (iii) regeneration groups of Quercus robur, Ulmus laevis, Populus alba, Populus nigra L. and Salix alba L. are established. This could be done through supporting the natural regeneration (soil scarification, cutting of the understorey and sowing of seeds) or through afforestation with Vardim reproductive materials.

The lands of the 3 villages were confiscated and declared a closed area, and only declared 'public land' to be developed for a recreational park two years later in 1969. According to Meron Benvenisti the function of such re-afforestation projects like that at Canada Park was to confiscate Arab land in the Palestinian territories Israeli occupied after 1967. The JNF's <b>reafforestation</b> programme privileges pine over indigenous species, and, according to Ilan Pappé, {{the choice of a}} fast-growing species was dictated by considerations of rapidly hindering a return of refugees to their land, while, as evergreens, quickly concealing the demolished village sites with year round leafage.|$|E

Methods and Results: A polyphasic approach including phenotypic and genotypic techniques {{was used to}} study the diversity and their relationships with other biovars and species of rhizobia. The geographical origins of the strains have limited effect on their phylogenetic and phenotypic classification. Nodulation tests indicated promiscuity of the strains studied, because they were capable of nodulating six woody legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia senegal, A. seyal, Acacia tortilis ssp. raddiana, Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis juliflora). Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of nodA, nodC and nifH genes pointed out that in contrast to nodA gene, the phylogenies of nodC and nifH genes were not consistent with that of 16 S rRNA, indicating that these genes of the A. seyal-nodulating rhizobia might have different origins.

40|$|Agricultural land {{abandonment}} and {{the consequent}} natural forest regrowth in areas once cultivated has significantly transformed Alpine ecosystems and landscapes. In this paper, we estimated the loss of agricultural areas due to <b>reafforestation</b> in the Belluno Province (Eastern Italian Alps) and integrated socioeconomic indicators with topographical features to evaluate the drivers of this change. Land use mapping, obtained from photo-interpretation of aerial photographs and technical maps, was used to quantify changes in forest and agricultural areas (crops, meadows and pastures) {{during the period of}} 1980 – 2000. On average, the forest surface expanded by 21 %, while the agricultural areas decreased by 40 %. This loss increased in areas with steeper slope, which confirms that the areas that would be first abandoned are those that are less productive and more difficult to manage. The <b>reafforestation</b> rate was particularly strong in the north of the province, where the livestock sector experienced a dramatic decline. In light of this situation and using multiple regression models with a large set of socioeconomic and agricultural indicators, we found that the loss of agricultural areas in 69 municipalities was primarily counterbalanced by the maintenance of livestock farming. The loss of steeper agricultural areas was counteracted by traditional extensive systems; however, it was not counteracted by modern intensive systems, which has important implications because steeper areas have higher landscape and biodiversity values. In addition, tourism development had a positive, although smaller, effect on the maintenance of agricultural areas, while industry development had a negative effect. The {{results of this study suggest}} that efforts are needed to maintain a territorial network of traditional extensive farms to avoid further landscape deterioration in Alpine areas.

An optimal development of the root system allows a better anchorage at the adult age. In sandy soil, tillage could {{be a part of}} the key in the shallow root development because it can add artificial microtopography. To assess the incidence of <b>reafforestation</b> techniques on root system development and to find out which tree structure features are associated to toppling, we selected three neighboring 13 -years old planted stands with different tillage (full ploughing, strip ploughing and rotary ploughing). An inventory of stem leaning and direction of leaning, height and DBH was made. Three trees per toppling level (undamaged, leaning and toppled trees) were sampled in each plot. The root system architecture was measured by 3 D digitizing and microtopography was measured in a radius of 3 m around the trees. The percent of straight trees was significantly more important (37 %) in the full ploughing compare to the other stands (23 %) and the toppled trees were the tallest. After thirteen years, the strip ploughing plot had still a strong microtopography. The circular distribution of the root volume was studied as a proportion in three wind-oriented sectors. Undamaged trees showed a large reinforcement of root volume, length and number in the leeward quarter only, except in the strip plough plot. Larger trees which uproot with a root soil plate show generally a windward and a leeward reinforcement. In these smaller trees, which toppled, leeward roots could not move due to low plasticity of sand, whereas leeward roots were lifted easily in these low cohesion soil.
