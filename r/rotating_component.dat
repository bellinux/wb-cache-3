40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This paper investigates {{rotation}} routines {{that will}} produce uncorrelated <b>rotated</b> principal <b>components</b> for a dataset of stock returns, {{in an attempt}} to identify the macroeconomic factors that best explain the variability among risk-adjusted stock returns on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. An alternative to the more traditional rotation approaches is used, which creates subsets of principal components with similar variances that are rotated in turn. It is found that only one of the three normalisation constraints examined can retain uncorrelated principal components after rotation. The results also show that when subspaces of <b>components</b> are <b>rotated</b> that have close eigenvalues, the different rotation criteria used to <b>rotate</b> principal <b>components</b> will produce similar results. After rotating the suitable subsets using varimax rotation, it is found that the first <b>rotated</b> <b>component</b> {{can be explained by the}} African Industrials sector, the second <b>rotated</b> <b>component</b> is related to the African Consumer Services sector while the third <b>rotated</b> <b>component</b> shows a significant relationship to the African Finance factor...|$|R
5000|$|The {{source of}} {{coefficients}} {{is coming out}} {{from the fact that}} <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> will in fact change the fluid properties, because of vibrations (compressibility of the flow change). So if one wants to correct the fuel flow then a theta correction exponent should be found through iterations, but for corrections for flow at engine entry (W2) then this aspect on <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> vibration is not accounted because much smaller than one inside an engine. As a consequence the inlet flow is corrected just by square root of Theta and divided by delta.|$|R

50|$|Run-out is {{dynamic and}} cannot be compensated. If a <b>{{rotating}}</b> <b>component,</b> {{such as a}} drill chuck, does not hold the drill centrally, then as it rotates the rotating drill will turn about a secondary axis.|$|E

50|$|Typically run-out is {{measured}} using {{a dial indicator}} pressed against the <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> while it is turned. Total indicated run-out (TIR) is a technician's term for the measured run-out of any rotating system, including all forms of run-out, at the measured point.|$|E
5000|$|Dynamic {{displacement}} {{air compressors}} include centrifugal compressors and axial compressors. In these types, a <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> imparts its kinetic {{energy to the}} air which is eventually converted into pressure energy.

40|$|Abstract-Vibration {{measurements}} {{have been}} used to reliably diagnose performance problems in machinery and related mechanical products. A vibration data collector can be used effectively to measure and analyze the machinery vibration content in gearboxes, engines, turbines, fans, compressors, pumps and bearings. Ideally, a machine will have little or no vibration, indicating that the <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> are appropriately balanced, aligned, and well maintained. Quick analysis and assessment of the vibration content can lead to fault diagnosis and prognosis of a machine’s ability to continue running. The aim of this research used vibration measurements to pinpoint mechanical defects such as (unbalance, misalignment, resonance, and part loosening), consequently diagnosis all necessary process for engineers and technicians who desire to understand the vibration that exists in structures and machines.

50|$|Axial run-out is {{the result}} of a <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> not being {{parallel}} with the axis, such as a drill chuck not holding the drill exactly in line with the axis. In general, cutting tools are less tolerant of axial run-out since the tool tip tends to dig in and further increase run-out. However a shaft may be more tolerant of axial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced less.|$|E
50|$|Oscillating devices do {{not have}} a <b>rotating</b> <b>component,</b> instead making use of {{aerofoil}} sections which are pushed sideways by the flow. Oscillating stream power extraction was proven with the omni- or bi-directional Wing'd Pump windmill. During 2003 a 150 kW oscillating hydroplane device, the Stingray, was tested off the Scottish coast. The Stingray uses hydrofoils to create oscillation, which allows it to create hydraulic power. This hydraulic power is then used to power a hydraulic motor, which then turns a generator.|$|E
50|$|Radial run-out is {{the result}} of a <b>{{rotating}}</b> <b>component</b> running off centre, such as a ball bearing with an offset centre. This means that the rotating tool or shaft, instead of being centrally aligned, will rotate about a secondary axis. In general, cutting tools are more tolerant of radial run-out since the edges are parallel to the line of cutting tending to keep the tool tip aligned. However, a rotating shaft may be less tolerant of radial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced by the amount of run-out.|$|E
50|$|A {{dog clutch}} {{is a type}} of clutch that couples two {{rotating}} shafts or other <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> not by friction but by interference.

50|$|An {{impeller}} is a <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> of a centrifugal pump, {{usually made}} of iron, steel, bronze, brass, aluminium, rubber or plastic, which transfers {{energy from the}} motor that drives the pump to the fluid being pumped by accelerating the fluid outwards {{from the center of}} rotation. The velocity achieved by the impeller transfers into pressure when the outward movement of the fluid is confined by the pump casing. Impellers are usually short cylinders with an open inlet (called an eye) to accept incoming fluid, vanes to push the fluid radially, and a splined, keyed, or threaded bore to accept a drive-shaft.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{feet per}} minute (SFPM or SFM) is the {{combination}} of a physical quantity (surface speed) and an imperial and American customary unit (feet per minute). It is defined as the number of linear feet that a location on a <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> travels in one minute. Its most common use is in the measurement of cutting speed (surface speed) in machining. It is a unit of velocity that describes how fast the cutting edge of the cutting tool travels. It correlates directly to the machinability of the workpiece material and the hardness of the cutting tool material. It relates to spindle speed via variables such as cutter diameter (for rotating cutters) or workpiece diameter (for lathe work).|$|E
5000|$|Not all {{structure}} {{must demonstrate}} detectable crack propagation {{to ensure safety}} of operation. Some structures operate under the safe-life design principle, where an extremely low level of risk is accepted {{through a combination of}} testing and analysis that the part will ever form a detectable crack due to fatigue during the service life of the part. This is achieved through a significant reduction of stresses below the typical fatigue capability of the part. Safe-life structures are employed when the cost or infeasibility of inspections outweighs the weight penalty and development costs associated with safe-life structures. [...] An example of a safe-life component is the helicopter rotor blade. Due to the extremely large numbers of cycles endured by the <b>rotating</b> <b>component,</b> an undetectable crack may grow to a critical length in a single flight and before the aircraft lands, result in a catastrophic failure that regular maintenance could not have prevented.|$|E

KIC 8111622 and KIC 10518735 undergo total eclipses while KIC 8196180 reveals partial eclipses. The target components are G and K stars, excluding the primary of KIC 8196180 which is early F star. KIC 8196180 reveals well-visible tidally-induced feature at periastron, i. e. {{it is an}} eclipsing heartbeat star. The characteristics of the observed periastron feature (shape, width and amplitude) confirm the theoretical predictions.
