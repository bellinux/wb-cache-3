5|$|A strong striker with {{excellent}} finishing abilities, Hughes represented the England semi-professional team once in 1996. After being released {{as a youth}} footballer, Hughes worked as a <b>roofer</b> alongside his father. He started {{his career in the}} Football Conference with Kidderminster Harriers, before winning a £380,000 move to boyhood club West Bromwich Albion in August 1997. He finished as the club's top-scorer for four seasons running, earning a place on the PFA Team of the Year in 1998–99 after finishing as the highest scorer in the top four divisions of English football. He was sold to Coventry City for £5 million in August 2001, before returning to West Brom for half of that figure twelve months later.

25|$|Watteau {{was born}} in October 1684 {{in the town of}} Valenciennes which had {{recently}} passed from the Spanish Netherlands to France. His father, Jean-Philippe Watteau, was a <b>roofer</b> given to brawling. Showing an early interest in painting, Jean-Antoine may have been apprenticed to Jacques-Albert Gérin, a local painter. Jean-Antoine's first artistic subjects were charlatans selling quack remedies on the streets of Valenciennes. Watteau left for Paris in 1702. There he found employment in a workshop at Pont Notre-Dame, making copies of popular genre paintings in the Flemish and Dutch tradition; it was in that period that he developed his characteristic sketchlike technique.|$|E

40|$|Thesis Chair, Dr. Sang D. Choi. This file {{was last}} viewed in Adobe Reader 7. 0 Construction {{is one of}} most {{dangerous}} industries in the United States. One of the most hazardous areas within the construction industry is roofing. Concern for safety in roofing construction has continued to spread, {{as a result of}} falls that make up the greatest rate of fatalities in the construction industry. Previous research has found that falls {{have been one of the}} leading categories under type of occupational death and that fall protection systems are not consistently used to prevent fall accidents in the roofing industry. Research is needed in order to analyze falls and other potential hazards in roofing. The main goal for this study is to analyze commercial and residential roofers’ behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs on the fall protection systems. A survey was distributed to commercial and residential <b>roofers</b> in the Midwest. Information collected from <b>roofers</b> was compared and analyzed to find differences between residential and commercial <b>roofers.</b> A total of 129 roofing contractors participated in this study. The results of the survey showed that while most of commercial <b>roofers</b> did use fall protection devices, a significant number of residential <b>roofers</b> did not comply with fall protection regulations and guidelines. Two main reasons of noncompliance with fall protection regulations and guidelines in roofing construction were found: (1) fall protection devices decrease productivity; (2) fall protection equipment makes <b>roofers</b> uncomfortable. Results from this study revealed that personal fall arrest system (PFAS) was the most prevalent fall protection device used among residential and commercial <b>roofers.</b> PFAS was also the most preferred fall protection equipment among the two groups of <b>roofers.</b> For both residential and commercial roofing, there is a significant (p = 0. 05 and p = 0. 01) negative relationship between enforcing <b>roofers</b> to wear or install fall protection devices and having falls from roofs. In both residential and commercial roofing, there is a very significant (p= 0. 001 and p = 0. 001) positive relationship between the enforcement and the actual usage of fall protection equipment. This thesis presents the results of the investigation of fall protection systems in roofing construction and recommendations that ultimately would reduce fall accidents...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the respirable dust and respirable silica exposures of roofing workers using an electric-powered circular saw with an aftermarket local exhaust ventilation attachment to cut concrete roofing tiles. The study was conducted to determine whether the local exhaust ventilation attachment was able to control respirable dust and respirable silica exposure below occupational exposure limits (OELs). Time-integrated filter samples and direct reading respirable dust concentrations were evaluated. The local exhaust ventilation consisted of a shroud attached to the cutting plane of the saw; the shroud was then connected to a small electric axial fan, which is intended to collect dust at the point of generation. All sampling was conducted with the control in use. <b>Roofers</b> are defined as those individuals who only lay tiles. Cutters/roofers are defined as those workers who operate the powered saw to cut tiles and also lay tiles. Respirable dust from this evaluation ranged from 0. 13 to 6. 59 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m(3)) with a geometric mean of 0. 38 mg/m(3) for <b>roofers</b> and from 0. 45 to 3. 82 mg/m(3) with a geometric mean of 1. 84 mg/m(3) for cutters/roofers. Cutters/roofers usually handle areas close to crevices, edges, or tips of the roof whereas <b>roofers</b> handle areas where complete tiles can be placed. The respirable dust exposures for all cutters/roofers indicated concentrations exceeding the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) for respirable dust containing silica; it was also exceeded for some of the <b>roofers.</b> The respirable silica concentrations ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 15 mg/m(3) with a geometric mean of 0. 09 mg/m(3) for <b>roofers,</b> and from 0. 13 to 1. 21 mg/m(3) with a geometric mean of 0. 48 mg/m(3) for cutters/roofers. As with respirable dust, the respirable silica exposures for cutters/roofers were higher than the exposures for <b>roofers.</b> DAL 2 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 08 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25148513 PMC 455217...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{represents a}} collaborative effort of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA), the Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers' Association (ARMA), the Asphalt Institute (AI), and the United Union of <b>Roofers,</b> Waterproofers, and Allied Workers (UURWAW) to reduce worker exposures to asphalt fumes during the application of hot asphalt to roofs. This guide is for <b>roofers</b> and contractors who work with hot asphalt on roofs. The guide lists steps for reducing exposure to asphalt fumes. <b>Roofers</b> exposed to asphalt fumes may experience the following health effects: headache; eye, nose, throat, and skin irritation; nausea; fatigue; and, drowsiness. These effects appear to be mild and transient. According to some studies, <b>roofers</b> also have {{an increased risk of}} lung cancer. But researchers are not sure whether this risk is caused by exposure to asphalt fumes or to other hazards such as smoking, coal tar, or asbestos. In light of this possible health risk and the irritation effects associated with hot asphalt work, it makes sense to take steps to control exposures while government, industry, labor, and independent researchers continue to study these health concerns. NIOSH is working together with industry and labor representatives to find methods that will significantly reduce asphalt fume exposures for <b>roofers</b> and contractors. Efforts are under way to identify new engineering controls and to test their effectiveness in reducing fume exposures at the kettle. To date, {{studies have shown that the}} use of fume-suppressing roofing asphalts can reduce fume exposure at the kettle. As these studies are completed, appropriate recommendations will be developed and disseminated. " [...] NIOSHTIC- 2 "September 2003. ...|$|R
