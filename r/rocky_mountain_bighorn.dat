25|$|<b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>bighorn</b> rams employ {{at least}} three {{different}} courting strategies. The most common and successful is the tending strategy, in which a ram follows and defends an estrous ewe. Tending takes considerable strength and dominance, so ewes are more receptive to tending males, feeling {{they are the most}} fit. Another tactic is coursing, which is when rams fight for an already tended ewe. Ewes typically avoid coursing males, so the strategy is not effective. Rams also employ a blocking strategy. They prevent a ewe from accessing tending areas before she even goes into estrus.|$|E

Several sightings of wolverines, rare within the United States, have been recorded since the 1990s. Smaller mammals include the pika, marten, badger, mink, beaver, river otter, and marmot. Bird species include the peregrine falcon, bald eagle, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, goshawk, gray-crowned rosy finch, chukar partridge, pileated woodpecker, American dipper, and great gray owl. Rivers and creeks support steelhead and trout.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to feral horses, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge {{is also a}} good place to see other wildlife and plant species. [...] Among the species found there are <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>bighorn</b> sheep, black bears, blue grouse, cougars, elk, gray wolves, mule deer, ring-necked pheasant, and sage grouse. The Pryor Mountains are also home to the most diverse bat populations in Montana, with 10 species identified (and potentially other species also present). [...] The range is also home to several animals which BLM or the state of Montana considers sensitive to ecological change, such as Baird's sparrow, long-eared myotis (a species of vesper bat), pallid bat, peregrine falcon, spotted bat, Townsend's big-eared bat, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. There are also 15 species of plants on the range which have been granted special status by the state of Montana or the federal government.|$|E

Significant populations of beaver, bighorn sheep, cougars, coyotes, mule deer, prairie dogs, porcupines, pronghorn, Rocky Mountain elk, and white-tailed deer exist within the refuge. Threatened species, endangered species, and species of concern in the refuge include the black-footed ferret, black-tailed prairie dog, burrowing owl, gray wolf, grizzly bear, least tern, mountain plover, northern leopard frog, pallid sturgeon, piping plover, greater sage-grouse, sicklefin chub, and sturgeon chub. The site also contains a large {{population of}} sharp-tailed grouse as well as approximately 235 other bird species. The refuge is home to 4,000 prairie elk, the largest remaining prairie elk herd in the United States.

5|$|The Canadian Rockies {{ecoregion}} supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> elk, <b>bighorn</b> sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|R
50|$|Bighorn National Forest {{is located}} in {{northern}} Wyoming, United States and consists of over 1.1 million acres (4,500 km²). Created as a US Forest Reserve in 1897, {{it is one of}} the oldest government-protected forest lands in the U.S. The forest is well east of the continental divide and extends from the Montana border for a distance of 80 miles (130 km) along the spine of the Big Horn Mountains, an outlying mountain range separated from the rest of the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountains</b> by <b>Bighorn</b> Basin. Elevations range from 5,000 feet (1,500 m) along the sagebrush and grass-covered lowlands at the foot of the mountains, to 13,189 feet (4,020 m) on top of Cloud Peak, the highest point in the Big Horn Mountains. Around 99% of the land is above 1500 m. The forest is named after the Bighorn River, which is partially fed by streams found in the forest. Streams in the range are fed primarily by snowmelt and snowmelt mixed with driving rainfall.|$|R

30|$|Die-offs {{from various}} respiratory-related {{diseases}} have chronically affected bighorn sheep {{populations in the}} western USA since the mid- 1800 s (Schommer and Woolever 2008). While bighorn sheep die-offs have occurred in every western state (Toweill and Geist 1999), recent conflicts in Intermountain states over the origins of disease effects on bighorn populations have erupted within the contexts of litigation over public lands grazing, Endangered Species Act dynamics, and the restoration discourse all noted above. In the past 5 [*]years, under these intensifying management and policy conditions, federal and state land management agencies have now developed strategic policies and management protocols that will require species separation {{as a means to}} ensure minimum viable populations for given areas. Although not currently constrained as a listed species within the Endangered Species Act, the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> subspecies of <b>bighorn</b> sheep holds its status as an iconic and symbolic wildlife species caught within the conflict over land use and management. The implications run deep.|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} note describes {{a method that}} incorporates a landscape approach {{with the use of}} Geographic Information Systems (GIs) to measure habitat and impacts for <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> and desert <b>bighorn</b> sheep and to rank potential transplant sites. A landscape approach, in which habitat is viewed from a large-scale perspective as an assemblage of patches, is used because: (1) bighorn habitat is naturally patchy due to the affinity of bighorn for terrain that is both open and mountainous; (2) fragmentation (i. e., increased patchiness) often is the most severe consequence of human disturbance; and (3) the proximity and distribution of neighboring bighorn ranges may be critical factors in determining genetic and demographic support for small bighorn populations. Potential suitability (the inherent capability to support bighorn sheep) and current suitability (the effect of impacts) is determined for each study area. Habitat components measured in alpine habitat include total habitat, escape terrain, and escape terrain contiguity in both summer and winter ranges. Habitat components measured in low-elevation habitat include total habitat, escape terrain, escape terrain contiguity, and water availability...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{mitochondrial}} cytochrome b gene sequence analysis, {{the history}} of true sheep (Ovis) began approximately 3. 12 million years ago (MYA). The evolution of Ovis resulted in three generally accepted genetic groups: Argaliforms, Moufloni-forms, and Pachyceriforms. The Pachyceriforms of the subgenus Pachyceros comprise the thin-horn sheep Ovis nivicola (snow sheep), Ovis dalli (Dall and Stone sheep), and Ovis canadensis (<b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> and desert <b>bighorn).</b> North America wild sheep (O. canadensis and O. dalli) evolved separately from Eurasian wild sheep and diverged from each other about 1. 41 MYA. Ancestral stock {{that gave rise to}} snow sheep, Moufloniforms, and Argaliforms occurred 2. 3 MYA, which then gave rise to two different extant lines of snow sheep that diverged from each other about 1. 96 MYA. The more recent nivicola line is genetically closer to the North American wild sheep and may represent a close association during the refugium when Alaska and Siberia were connected by the Bering land bridge. The earlier period of evolution of the Pachyceriforms suggests they may have first evolved in Eurasia, the oldest ancestor then giving rise to North American wild sheep, and that a canadensis-like ancestor most likely gave rise to nivicola. Cytogenetic analysis further validates that the standard diploid number for modern nivicola is 52. Wild sheep of the genusOvis are Holarctic, with a distribution of extant species and subspecies that span two continents...|$|R
