Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 28 patients had received a combination <b>of</b> <b>conventional</b> and zygomatic implants (group I) and 14 were rehabilitated with only conventional implants (group II). Results: The results showed that Stella and Warner’s technique, thought to minimize the presence of the implant into the maxillary sinus, improving the emergence of the implant, proved to be effective, allowing a high survival <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conventional</b> and zygomatic implants (100 %). The follow-up period ranged from a minimum of 15 months to a maximum of 53 months after prosthetic rehabilitation (average of 34 months).
