40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza viruses have evolved after pandemic onset {{giving rise to}} severe epidemics in subsequent waves. However, it still remains unclear which viral determinants might have contributed to disease severity after pandemic initiation. Here, we show that distinct mutations in the 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 virus genome have occurred with increased frequency after pandemic declaration. Among those, a mutation in the viral hemagglutinin was identified that increases 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 virus binding to human-like α 2, 6 -linked sialic acids. Moreover, these mutations conferred increased viral replication in the respiratory tract and elevated <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> transmission between ferrets. Thus, our data show that 2009 H 1 N 1 influenza viruses have evolved after pandemic onset giving rise to novel virus variants that enhance viral replicative fitness and <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> transmission in a mammalian animal model.

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} subtypes such as H 5, H 7 and H 9 are yet {{to adapt}} to the human host so as to establish airborne transmission between humans. However, lab-generated reassorted viruses possessing hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from an avian H 9 isolate and other genes from a human-adapted (H 3 or H 1) subtype acquired two amino acid changes in HA and a single amino acid change in NA that confer <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> transmission in ferrets. We previously demonstrated for human-adapted H 1, H 2 and H 3 subtypes that quantitative binding affinity of their HA to α 2 → 6 sialylated glycan receptors correlates with <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> transmissibility of the virus in ferrets. Such a relationship remains to be established for H 9 HA. In this study, we performed a quantitative biochemical characterization of glycan receptor binding properties of wild-type and mutant forms of representative H 9 HAs that were previously used in context of reassorted viruses in ferret transmission studies. We demonstrate here that distinct molecular interactions in the glycan receptor-binding site of different H 9 HAs affect the glycan-binding specificity and affinity. Further we show that α 2 → 6 glycan receptor-binding affinity of a mutant H 9 HA carrying Thr- 189 →Ala amino acid change correlates with the <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> transmission in ferrets conferred by this change.

40|$|During {{the early}} {{phase of the}} 2009 {{influenza}} pandemic, {{attempts were made to}} contain the spread of the virus. Success of reactive control measures may be compromised if the proportion of transmission that occurs before overt clinical symptoms develop is high. In this study we investigated the timing of transmission of an early prototypic strain of pandemic H 1 N 1 2009 influenza virus in the ferret model. Ferrets are the only animal model in which this can be assessed because they display typical influenza-like clinical signs including fever and sneezing after infection. We assessed transmission from infected animals to sentinels that were placed either in direct contact or in adjacent cages, the latter reflecting the <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> (RD) transmission route. We found that pre-symptomatic influenza transmission occurred via both contact and <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> exposure before the earliest clinical sign, fever, developed. Three of 3 animals exposed in direct contact between day 1 and 2 after infection of the donor animals became infected, and 2 / 3 of the animals exposed at this time period by the RD route acquired the infection, with the third animal becoming seropositive indicating either a low level infection or significant exposure. Moreover, this efficient transmission did not temporally correlate with respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and sneezes, but rather with the peak viral titre in the nose. Indeed <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> transmission did not occur late in infection, even though this was when sneezing and coughing were most apparent. None of the 3 animals exposed at this time by the RD route became infected and these animals remained seronegative {{at the end of the}} experiment.

The third route, airborne transmission, is difficult to prevent since respiratory viruses are ubiquitous in the environment and virus particles constantly circulate in the air [1].

40|$|Most avian {{influenza}} viruses do not replicate or transmit efficiently in mammals. The events {{that lead to}} interspecies transmission and host adaptation are unknown. Part one of this project set out to establish quail as an intermediate host of influenza. Our results indicate that adapting a mallard H 2 N 2 virus in quail leads to expanded host range in chickens. The molecular changes, which occur during the adaptation in quail, are crucial for viral replication and transmission in chickens. Further adaptation of this quail-adapted virus in chickens leads to a 27 amino acid-deletion in the stalk region of the NA, changing the tissue tropism and temperature phenotype of the virus. H 9 N 2 influenza viruses have created in poultry an endemic situation in much of Asia, Europe and the Middle East. This subtype, albeit low pathogenic, carries with it human receptor specificity {{and the ability to}} infect humans without prior adaptation. The generation of an influenza pandemic requires interspecies transmission of a novel strain, which can adapt to its new host through either reassortment or point mutations. Given that two previous pandemics were the result of reassortment between low pathogenic avian viruses and human subtypes of that period, and given the endemic situation of avian H 9 N 2 viruses in Eurasia, for part two of this project, we wanted to determine if adaptation of an avian-human H 9 N 2 reassortant in ferrets could support mammalian <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> transmission.

An NA-R 292 K mutation that confers broad-spectrum resistance to NA inhibitors has been documented in H 7 N 9 patients after treatment. METHODS: We evaluated the transmission potential of a human influenza A H 7 N 9 isolate with a NA-R 292 K mutation in the ferret model followed by genotyping assay to monitor its competitive fitness in vivo. RESULTS: Plaque-purified A/Shanghai/ 1 / 2013 wild-type and NA-R 292 K viruses transmitted at comparable efficiency to direct or <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> contact ferrets. In ferrets inoculated with the plaque-purified A/Shanghai/ 1 / 2013 NA-R 292 K virus with dominant K 292 (94 %), the resistant K 292 genotype was outgrown by the wild-type R 292 genotype {{during the course of}} infection. Transmission of the resistant K 292 genotype was detected in 3 / 4 direct contact and 3 / 4 <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> contact ferrets at early time points but was gradually replaced by the wild-type genotype.

40|$|The {{seasonality}} {{of influenza}} virus infections in temperate climates {{and the role}} of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood. Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplet</b> transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H 3 N 2 virus and an H 3 N 2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals.

40|$|Transmission of {{respiratory}} infectious diseases in humans, for instance influenza, occurs by several modes. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>droplets</b> provide a vector of transmission of an infectious pathogen that {{may contribute to}} different transmission modes. An epidemiological model incorporating the dynamics of inhalable <b>respiratory</b> <b>droplets</b> is developed to assess their relevance in the infectious process.

Droplet dynamics is determined by their physical properties (size), whereas population dynamics by, among other parameters, the pathogen infectivity and the host contact rates. Three model influenza epidemic scenarios, mediated by different airborne or settled droplet classes, are analyzed. The scenarios are distinguished by the characteristic times associated with breathing at contact and with hand-to-face contact. The scenarios suggest that airborne transmission, mediated by respirable droplets, provides the dominant transmission mode in middle and long-term epidemics, whereas inspirable droplets, be they airborne or settled, characterise short-term epidemics with high attack rates.

The receptor binding properties of these H 2 N 2 viruses was analyzed using dose-dependent direct glycan array-binding assays. Alb/ 58 virus, which contains the 226 L/ 228 S amino acid combination in the HA and displayed dual binding to both alpha 2, 6 and alpha 2, 3 glycan receptors, transmitted efficiently to na 3 ferrets by respiratory droplets. Inefficient transmission was observed with ElSalv/ 57 virus, which contains the 226 Q/ 228 G amino acid combination and preferentially binds alpha 2, 3 over alpha 2, 6 glycan receptors.
