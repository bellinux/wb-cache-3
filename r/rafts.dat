40|$|Abstract—In this paper, two {{centrifugal}} model tests (case 1 : <b>raft</b> foundation, case 2 : 2 x 2 piled <b>raft</b> foundation) {{were conducted}} in order to evaluate the effect of ground subsidence on load sharing among piles and <b>raft</b> and settlement of <b>raft</b> and piled <b>raft</b> foundations. For each case, two conditions consisting of undrained (without groundwater pumping) and drained (with groundwater pumping) conditions were considered. Vertical loads were applied to the models after the foundations were completely consolidated by selfweight at 50 g. The results show that load sharing by the piles in piled <b>raft</b> foundation (piled load share) for drained condition decreases faster than that for undrained condition. Settlement of both <b>raft</b> and piled <b>raft</b> foundations for drained condition increases more quickly than that for undrained condition. In addition, the settlement of <b>raft</b> foundation increases more largely than the settlement of piled <b>raft</b> foundation for drained condition.

40|$|The use of piled <b>raft</b> {{foundations}} {{has become}} more popular in recent years, as the combined action of the <b>raft</b> and the piles can increase the bearing capacity, reduce settlement, and the piles can be arranged so as to reduce differential deflection in the <b>raft.</b> Piled <b>raft</b> foundation is a new concept in which the total load coming from the superstructure is partly shared by the <b>raft</b> through contact with soil and the remaining load is shared by piles through skin friction. A piled <b>raft</b> foundation is economical compared to the pile foundation. Because piles {{do not have to}} penetrate the full depth of clay layer but it can be terminated at higher elevations. Such piled <b>raft</b> foundation undergoes more settlement than the pile foundation and less settlement than the <b>raft</b> foundation.

40|$|Anemia {{remains the}} {{principal}} management challenge {{for patients with}} lower risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). Despite appropriate cytokine production and cellular receptor display, erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) signaling is impaired. We reported that EpoR signaling is dependent upon receptor localization within lipid <b>raft</b> microdomains, and that disruption of <b>raft</b> integrity abolishes signaling capacity. Here, we show that MDS erythroid progenitors display markedly diminished <b>raft</b> assembly and smaller <b>raft</b> aggregates compared to normal controls (p =  0. 005, <b>raft</b> number; p =  0. 023, <b>raft</b> size). Because lenalidomide triggers <b>raft</b> coalescence in T-lymphocytes promoting immune synapse formation, we assessed effects of lenalidomide on <b>raft</b> assembly in MDS erythroid precursors and UT 7 cells. Lenalidomide treatment rapidly induced lipid <b>raft</b> formation accompanied by EpoR recruitment into <b>raft</b> fractions together with STAT 5, JAK 2, and Lyn kinase. The JAK 2 phosphatase, CD 45, a key negative regulator of EpoR signaling, was displaced from <b>raft</b> fractions. Lenalidomide treatment prior to Epo stimulation enhanced both JAK 2 and STAT 5 phosphorylation in UT 7 and primary MDS erythroid progenitors, accompanied by increased STAT 5 DNA binding in UT 7 cells, and increased erythroid colony forming capacity in both UT 7 and primary cells. <b>Raft</b> induction was associated with F-actin polymerization, which was blocked by Rho kinase inhibition. These data indicate that deficient <b>raft</b> integrity impairs EpoR signaling, and provides a novel strategy to enhance EpoR signal fidelity in non-del(5 q) MDS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Skirted {{foundation}} {{is one in}} which vertical or inclined wall surrounds one or more sides of the soil mass beneath the footing. Skirted {{foundation is}} an alternative approach required for improving the bearing capacity of <b>raft</b> foundation by using “structural skirts ” fixed to the edges of the <b>raft</b> foundation. Construction of vertical skirts {{at the base of the}} <b>raft</b> foundation confines the underlying soil and generates a soil resistance on skirt side that helps the footing to resist sliding. The present work focused on the analysis of two sided and one sided skirted <b>raft</b> with and without vertical skirt using a finite element software PLAXIS 2 D. The studied parameters include the <b>raft</b> sizes,skirt depth and then compared with those of <b>raft</b> without vertical skirt. The results indicated that using structual skirts for <b>raft</b> foundation has a significant effect in improving the bearing capacity. This improvement increases with the skirt depth with varying <b>raft</b> sizes for two sided <b>raft</b> foundation vertical skirt with decrease in settlement. Whereas in one sided <b>raft</b> foundation with vertical skirt there is increase in both bearing capacity and settlement. Thus finite element analysis presented in this study helped in better understanding and identifying the failure pattern of skirted <b>raft</b> with and without skirt for <b>raft</b> foundation with vertical skirt...|$|R

The larvae that hatch are planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before {{settling}} to the sea floor, entering a gastropod shell and returning to dry land.
