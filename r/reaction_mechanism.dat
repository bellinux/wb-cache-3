5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following <b>reaction</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their suggestion was that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} nucleophilic acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} described, the Nazarov cyclization {{involves the}} activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key {{step of the}} <b>reaction</b> <b>mechanism</b> involves a cationic 4π-electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway.|$|E
5|$|The most {{sensitive}} enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions. These measurements either use {{changes in the}} fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme's <b>reaction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during catalysis. These studies are providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.|$|E

5|$|The <b>{{reaction}}</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction {{consists of}} nucleophilic {{addition of the}} ylide to the carbonyl or imine group. A negative charge is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring. In the related Wittig reaction, {{the formation of the}} much stronger phosphorus-oxygen double bond prevents oxirane formation and instead, olefination takes place through a 4-membered cyclic intermediate.|$|E
5|$|As {{only one}} of the {{electrons}} can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the <b>reaction</b> <b>mechanism</b> of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.−, which is the ubisemiquinone free radical. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.|$|E

25|$|Solvents with a {{dielectric}} constant (more accurately, relative static permittivity) greater than 15 (i.e. polar or polarizable) {{can be further}} divided into protic and aprotic. Protic solvents solvate anions (negatively charged solutes) strongly via hydrogen bonding. Water is a protic solvent. Aprotic solvents such as acetone or dichloromethane tend to have large dipole moments (separation of partial positive and partial negative charges within the same molecule) and solvate positively charged species via their negative dipole. In chemical reactions the use of polar protic solvents favors the SN1 <b>reaction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> while polar aprotic solvents favor the SN2 <b>reaction</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
