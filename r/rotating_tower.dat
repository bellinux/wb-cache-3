40|$|The main {{objective}} of this graduation project was designing a feasible load bearing structure for the <b>Rotating</b> <b>Tower,</b> within the set boundary conditions given by the architectural design. The concept “Rotating Tower” is developed by the Italian architect David Fisher. The main idea behind this concept is: {{the building of the}} future. Mr. Fisher translated this idea into the design of the Rotating Tower: a tower with separate rotating floors. The tower consists of multiple (non-circular) floors that can rotate independent around a common axis. Since all floors rotate independent, the building can (theoretically) transform into every shape imaginable. The original design of the <b>Rotating</b> <b>Tower</b> (designed for target city Dubai) has a height of approximately 435 meter. To get a more detailed view of previous designed load bearing structures 3 reference project with comparable height were analysed. Different load cases were analysed and used in the calculation for the structure: dead load, live load, wind load and earthquake load. In this analysis local conditions for Dubai are taken into account. The current design of the stabilizing core for the <b>Rotating</b> <b>Tower</b> does not meet any of the requirements given in the codes. Therefore different solutions for stiffening and strengthening the structure were investigated. Most striking solutions are: higher concrete grade, thicker core, activating steel structure of the storeys and active systems. With the results of the optimization analysis 5 different feasible designs were made for the stability structure of the <b>Rotating</b> <b>Tower.</b> All these designs have one or more adaptations from the architects design. 3 of the 5 alternative designs are considered to be the most relevant for the project and are presented as “final designs”. These 3 final designs are worked out to a more detailed level. The main conclusion of this thesis report covers the structural feasibility of the project. For several designs it is shown that the project is feasible from a structural point of view but not without adapting the architectural design. All alternatives contain one or more adaptations to the architectural design, but keep the main concept of the project unchanged.

40|$|Eurobot is {{an annual}} {{robotics}} competition. Teams from different countries composed of mostly students but also independent teams participate. This year s title was Robomovies, {{and the competition}} were held in Yverdon-Les-Bains in Switzerland. It is the first year UiO participated in the competition, and {{all parts of the}} robot needed to be developed. The game table was also build according to the measures and specifications listed in the rules. This has been designed so that it easily can be modified to fit future year s tasks. The main goal of this thesis is to research technologies and establish the foundation for coming participants in the Eurobot competition from University of Oslo (UiO). This thesis focus on the navigation and position system of the robot and the sensor system. A low cost beacon based positioning system using infrared codes and a <b>rotating</b> <b>tower</b> has been developed and tested. A Kalman filter was used to combine the odometry and the beacon system for a better position estimate. However, the beacon system did not work sufficiently when the robot was moving and rotating. All the code for the navigation and sensor part have been written in C++. A silicone wheel was designed in order to improve the grip ensuring that no wheelspin would occur making the position based on the odometry quite reliable. In order to avoid collision, proximity sensors were mounted both on the front and the back of the robot. A personal Computer (PC) was used to control the robot. For the communication between all the different systems the message library Zero Message Queue (ZMQ) has been used. ZMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library. It is one of the easiest message library to use, as well as being one of the fastest. And worked well in this project...|$|E

40|$|Town, Interrupted breaks {{tyranny of}} place with an {{architecture}} of measured instability. It introduces a dynamic {{building with a}} new aesthetic and housing type in the stable and homogenous townscape of Marfa, Texas. Marfa In this remote desert town, a central border patrol facility operates alongside a vibrant art community. Marfa is simultaneously sophisticated and rough, constructed and raw. Reified into and art institution, it is becoming victim of its own success, editing out a rich diversity of lifestyles that is specific to the West Texas enclave. Marfa has an eclectic community, but the legacy of Donald Judd perpetuates an aesthetic orthodoxy of beige, symmetrical and bare boxes. With single family homes as the only housing type, the growth pattern of Marfa's urban fabric is also boxy and consistent. Interruption In Girl Interrupted at her Music (1660), Johannes Vermeer used interruption in {{the subject of his}} painting as a device to capture movement in a static form of representation. Town, Interrupted embeds movement in -inherently static- architecture, to produce formal and social associations that constantly fluctuate between the individual and the collective. A "disciplined play" on seriality destabilizes part-to-whole relationships. Six slightly <b>rotated</b> <b>towers</b> puncture a horizontal mass. From different perspectives, they merge and separate. The rotation opens up the form and creates dynamic circulation. Four distinct unit types are aggregated to shape courtyards and create interconnected sub-hierarchies. Enhanced by Marfa's dramatic light changes on reflective and translucent materials, the repeated misregistration of identical parts produces a flickering effect...|$|R
50|$|The {{allosteric}} site of AMP binding on muscle isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase {{are close to}} the subunit interface just like Ser14. Binding of AMP at this site, corresponding in a change from the T state of the enzyme to the R state, results in small changes in tertiary structure at the subunit interface leading to large changes in quaternary structure. AMP binding <b>rotates</b> the <b>tower</b> helices (residues 262-278) of the two subunits 50˚ relative to one another through greater organization and intersubunit interactions. This rotation of the tower helices leads to a rotation of the two subunits by 10˚ relative to one another, and more importantly disorders residues 282-286 (the 280s loop) that block access to the catalytic site in the T state but do not in the R state.|$|R

50|$|To play, {{each player}} takes turns <b>rotating</b> the <b>Tower</b> {{to face them}} and then moving about the board. The quarter of the board {{in front of a}} {{particular}} player is their territory. Gameplay proceeds by moving a player's token one space and then pressing a button on the Tower that corresponds to the type of space (e.g., Sanctuary, Tomb, Bazaar, Frontier). The Tower then resolves what happens to the player by showing the player the appropriate cel and reporting whatever occurs. For instance, if the Tower decides that the player has encountered Brigands, it will turn to the Brigands cel, simultaneously displaying the number of brigands encountered. If the player chooses to fight, the Tower resolves the battle by alternately counting off the remaining numbers of friendly troops and Brigands. Once all events have resolved, the <b>Tower</b> is <b>rotated</b> to the next player and their turn begins.|$|R

2500|$|While {{the heights}} of the various SkyScreamer {{installations}} vary from park to park, the basic operation of the ride is consistent. Riders sit in one of 16 two-seat chairs connected to a gondola mounted on a central tower, which brings the gondola up and down. A seat belt is placed over the rider's waist to keep them firmly in their seat, and a lap bar is fastened into place. When the ride cycle begins, the gondola rises {{to the top of}} the tower, beginning to spin slowly around the central tower and picking up speed as it ascends further. By the time it reaches the top, it is <b>rotating</b> around the <b>tower</b> at its full speed of approximately , with riders <b>rotating</b> around the <b>tower</b> in a circle [...] in diameter. The gondola remains at the top of the tower for a period of time, then it descends and slows down slightly before returning to the top. At the end of the cycle, the gondola lowers to the ground and slows its rotation such that, by the time it reaches the bottom of the tower, all rotation has ceased and the riders are able to depart. Optionally, SkyScreamer can be set to rotate in the opposite direction during its cycle, such that riders are traveling backwards. Thus far, the installations at St. Louis, Discovery Kingdom, Fiesta Texas, New England and La Ronde have operated in this manner, with each running them in this mode during special events or as a limited-time promotion.|$|R
