50|$|A {{callable}} bond (also called <b>redeemable</b> <b>bond)</b> {{is a type}} of bond (debt security) that allows the issuer of the bond to retain the privilege of redeeming the bond at some point before the bond reaches its date of maturity. In other words, on the call date(s), the issuer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy back the bonds from the bond holders at a defined call price. Technically speaking, the bonds are not really bought and held by the issuer but are instead cancelled immediately.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Redeemable</b> <b>bonds</b> (called losrenten) {{that paid}} an annual {{interest}} to the holder, whose name appeared in a public-debt ledger (not as convenient as bearer bonds, but the bonds were still readily negotiable) until the loan was paid off; ...|$|R
5000|$|In practice, however, by {{the middle}} of the 17th century the Dutch Republic enjoyed such good credit, that it was able to {{dispense}} with lijfrenten and finance its borrowing requirements with long-term <b>redeemable</b> <b>bonds</b> at rates that were equal to, or lower than, the lowest interest returns available in the private sector. In fact, redemption could often be postponed indefinitely, making such loans [...] "interest-only." [...] This enabled the Republic in practice to spend according to its needs without practical limit, greatly exceeding its short-term ability to tax. This greatly enhanced its politico-military power, as it was able to field mercenary armies equal in size to the armies of countries with much larger populations, like France and England.|$|R

Its accounts must be audited and it must also have explicit permission to operate from the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).|$|R
50|$|Article 182, {{which states}} that a {{municipal}} government may, for an area included in its master plan, according to Brazil's federal law, expropriate land. The municipal government may pay for the land in public debt <b>bonds,</b> <b>redeemable</b> within up to ten years, in equal and successive annual installments, ensuring {{the real value of}} the compensation and the legal interest.|$|R
50|$|Consols (originally {{short for}} {{consolidated}} annuities, but subsequently taken to mean consolidated stock) was a name given to certain government debt {{issues in the}} form of perpetual <b>bonds,</b> <b>redeemable</b> at the option of the government. They were issued by the U.S. Government and the Bank of England. The first Bristish Consols were issued in 1751. They have now been fully redeemed. The first U.S. Government Consols were issued in the 1870's.|$|R

5|$|After {{the close}} of the session, Sherman {{returned}} to Ohio to campaign for the Republican nominee for governor there, former governor Rutherford B. Hayes. The issue of specie payments was debated in the campaign, with Hayes endorsing Sherman's position and his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor William Allen, in favor of increased circulation of greenbacks <b>redeemable</b> in <b>bonds.</b> Hayes won a narrow victory and was soon mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 1876. The controversy over resumption carried into the presidential election. The Democratic platform that year demanded repeal of the Resumption Act, while the Republicans nominated Hayes, whose position in favor of a gold standard was well known. The election of 1876 was very close, and the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Louisiana was one of the states in which both parties claimed victory, and Grant asked Sherman and a few other men to go to New Orleans and ensure the party's interests were represented.|$|R
500|$|The Greenback Party was a {{newcomer}} to the political scene in 1880, having arisen, mostly in the nation's West and South, {{as a response to}} the economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized [...] "greenbacks", a form of money <b>redeemable</b> in government <b>bonds,</b> rather than in gold as was traditional. After the war, many Democrats and Republicans in the East sought to return to the gold standard, and the government began to withdraw greenbacks from circulation. The reduction of the money supply, combined with the economic depression, made life harder for debtors, farmers, and industrial laborers; the Greenback Party hoped to draw support from these groups.|$|R
5000|$|His feuds {{with the}} {{leadership}} of the New York Democratic Party foreclosed any further advancement in the party, but Dillaye found a new political home in the Greenback Party. The party was a newcomer to the political scene, having arisen {{as a response to the}} economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized [...] "greenbacks," [...] a form of money <b>redeemable</b> in government <b>bonds,</b> rather than in gold, as was traditional. After the war, many Democrats and Republicans in the East sought to return to the gold standard, withdrawing greenbacks from circulation.

500|$|With the {{financial}} crisis abated, many in Congress wanted the greenbacks to be withdrawn from circulation. The public had never seen greenbacks as equivalent to specie, and by 1866 they circulated at a considerable discount, although their value had risen {{since the end of}} the war. Hugh McCulloch, the Treasury Secretary under Lincoln and Johnson, believed the notes were an emergency measure only and thought they should be gradually withdrawn. McCulloch proposed a bill, the Contraction Act, to convert some of the greenbacks from notes <b>redeemable</b> in <b>bonds</b> to interest-bearing notes redeemable in coin. Most Senate Finance Committee members had no objection, and Sherman found himself alone in opposition to it, believing that withdrawing greenbacks from circulation would contract the money supply and harm the economy. Sherman instead favored leaving the existing notes in circulation and letting the growth in population catch up to the growth in money supply. He suggested an amendment that would instead just allow the Treasury to redeem the notes for lower-interest bonds, now that the government's borrowing costs had decreased. Sherman's amendment was voted down, and the Contraction Act passed; greenbacks would be gradually withdrawn, but those still circulating would be redeemable for the high-interest bonds as before. In his memoirs, Sherman called this law [...] "the most injurious and expensive financial measure ever enacted by Congress," [...] as the continued high-interest payments it required [...] "added fully $300,000,000 of interest" [...] to the national debt.|$|R

Beyond their support for a larger money supply, they also favored an eight-hour work day, safety regulations in factories, and an end to child labor.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, several states in India have {{introduced}} financial incentive programs to discourage son preference among parents and encourage investment in daughters'education and health. This study evaluates one such {{program in the}} state of Haryana, Apni Beti Apna Dhan (Our Daughter, Our Wealth). Since 1994, eligible parents in Haryana have been offered a financial incentive if they give birth to a daughter. The incentive consists of an immediate cash grant and a long-term savings <b>bond</b> <b>redeemable</b> on the daughter's 18 th birthday provided she is unmarried, with additional bonuses for education. Although no specific program participation data are available, we estimate early intent-to-treat program effects on mothers (sex ratio among live children, fertility preferences) and children (mother's use of antenatal care, survival, nutritional status, immunization, schooling) using statewide household survey data on fertility and child health, and constructing proxies for household and individual program eligibility. The results based on this limited data imply that Apni Beti Apna Dhan had a positive effect on the sex ratio of living children, but inconclusive effects on mothers'preferences for having female children as well as total desired fertility. The findings also show that parents increased their investment in daughters'human capital {{as a result of the}} program. Families made greater post-natal health investments in eligible girls, with some mixed evidence of improving health status in the short and medium term. Further evidence also suggests that the early cohort of eligible school-age girls was not significantly more likely to attend school; however, conditional on first attending any school, they may be more likely to continue their education.

50|$|Thus, for 15 years, {{in order}} to defray {{the cost of their}} no longer {{performing}} the corvée and the other feudal duties, peasants were required to pay into an indemnity fund that issued <b>bonds</b> <b>redeemable</b> in instalments an annual fee of 51-133 lei, depending on their category and region; this was a heavy burden for the majority and ruined the poorest. They also had to pay for the land they now owned, albeit at a price below market value. The quantity of expropriated land was not to exceed ⅔ of the domains' area (the boyars kept the best third, taking advantage of a provision calling for the consolidation, wherever possible, of pastures, hayfields and arable plots scattered by successive inheritances {{in order to}} get rid of their poorest quality land) and selling or mortgaging the lots was forbidden for 30 years, after which the village commune could exercise its right of pre-emption. This reform gave 1,654,965 ha (6,389.86 mi²) of land to 406,429 peasants; another 60,651 received lots only for a house and garden. Later, 48,432 additional families of newlyweds (who did not come under the law's provisions but were permitted to settle on state-owned lands near their village) received 228,329 hectares. Implementation of the law was by and large complete by 1865 but was slowed by a lack of comprehensive regulations concerning both general procedures and special cases; moreover, friction between landlords and peasants ensued because the latter had no confidence in the private surveyors hired by landlords to delimit their new holdings {{from the rest of the}} estate. In the year following 1864, agricultural production stagnated or even fell in some regions, partly because many owners had done nothing to compensate for the loss of the corvée, and also because many peasants did not know what land would be theirs and were reluctant to raise crops that might not be theirs, but by the spring of 1866 production once again rose. After the reform, land owned by peasants (that is, former corvée members, free peasants and small proprietors) covered around 30% of the national territory, with 70% still in state or landlord hands. The reform had important social consequences, giving the peasants a civic motivation and assuring them a means of subsistence; it was also enshrined in the 1866 Constitution.|$|R
