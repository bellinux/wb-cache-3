40|$|Patients with {{tetraplegia}} {{may have}} {{various degrees of}} spasticity in the hand ranging from a completely clenched fist to reduced control of grip at triggered spasticity. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the functional effect of the distal ulnar intrinsic <b>release</b> <b>procedure</b> to reduce intrinsic tightness. Seventeen patients with tetraplegia (37 fingers) and with prominent intrinsic tightness were operated on for distal intrinsic release with a modification of the procedure to include only the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx. All the patients had more pronounced tightness on the ulnar than on the radial side of the affected finger. Long fingers were consistently the most affected digits. The intrinsic tightness was released completely in all patients and the range of motion (ROM) was improved by 25 %, and up to 45 % in mild and severe cases, respectively. The good immediate effects of treatment as shown by increased ROM remained intact by 6 months postoperatively. These data suggest that the distal ulnar intrinsic <b>release</b> <b>procedure</b> is a simple and valuable way of reducing intrinsic tightness and improving hand function and grip for patients with intrinsic tightness.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThis article {{describes}} patient demographic data, {{as well as}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} symptomatic lower extremity claudication that has no apparent vascular or orthopedic cause. MethodsA retrospective review was performed of records for 843 patients who received surgical treatment between 1975 and 2003. All patients had a detailed history, and underwent physical examination and selected noninvasive vascular testing. Noninvasive popliteal entrapment screening tests and compartment pressure measurements for isolated superficial muscle pain were routine. Duplex scanning or arteriography were used only when arteriovenous disease or popliteal entrapment syndrome was suspected. ResultsThe study population included 549 female patients (65 %) and 294 male patients (35 %). Their mean age was 29 years (range, 12 - 71 years). The most common symptoms were isolated lower extremity muscle cramping (100 %), foot paresthesia (20 %), and medial tibial bone pain (1 %). Causes of symptoms included chronic compartment syndrome (796 patients, 94 %), functional popliteal entrapment syndrome (33 patients, 4 %), and medial tibial syndrome (14 patients, 2 %). Pathologic findings included overuse injury (756 patients, 89 %), blunt limb trauma (60 patients, 7 %), or gait anomaly (34 patients, 4 %). Surgery for compartment release included fasciotomy (100 patients, 12 %) or fasciectomy (696 patients, 88 %). Surgery for functional popliteal entrapment included excision of the plantaris muscle and soleal band (33 patients). Medial tibial release included soleal and transverse fasciectomy, with periosteal cautery of the tibial insertions. Complete symptomatic relief was achieved in 92 % of compartment <b>release</b> <b>procedures,</b> 100 % of popliteal entrapment <b>release</b> <b>procedures,</b> and 80 % of medial tibial <b>release</b> <b>procedures.</b> ConclusionAtypical claudication represents a collection of syndromes that can be permanently and effectively treated with surgical intervention...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and investigates a novel technique for the footprint and thickness-independent selective release of Au–Si eutectically bonded microstructures through the localized removal of their eutectic bond interface.

The gold removal results in a porous silicon layer, acting similar to standard etch holes in a subsequent sacrificial release etching. The paper presents the principle and the design requirements of the technique. First test devices were fabricated and the method successfully demonstrated.
