40|$|The {{effect of}} the feeding system (ad libitum or rationed) on the feed {{conversion}} rate and weight gains of Merino ram lambs Summary The investigations were conducted on 583 ram lambs of the Polish Merino breed in nine consecutive years (1991 - 1999) in the period from the 4 * to the 6 * month of their lives. Ram lambs- fed and kept separately on slatted floor- {{were divided into two}} groups: R in the system of <b>rationed</b> <b>feeding</b> at the level recommended by the Polish Standard, and L fed at libitum with a ration of the same composition. In the consecutive months of the test ram lambs from group L consumed more NE- on average by 30. 0 % (6. 59 and 8. 57 MJ) and obtained higher daily weight gains- in the experimental period on average by 23. 3 % (223. 1 and 275. 1 g) than ram lambs from group R. The NE consumption per 1 kg of body weight gain was higher in group L in the 4 lh month. In the 5 lh month it was comparable, whereas in the 6 " 1 month it was lower and on aver-age similar in both groups (30. 64 and 30. 97 MJ, respectively). Significant interdependencies were found between NE consumption and the daily body weight gains. The dependencies were higher in group R (r= 0. 92) than in group L (r= 0. 46). The results suggest that it is advisable to use limited feeding and selection in terms of body weight gains in breeding practice aiming at the improvement of feed conversion rate...|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies on}} the impact of {{biofuels}} on greenhouse gas emissions do not consider indirect land-use change and land use avoided because of co-products utilization. This paper provides estimates of the land-use credit for corn ethanol when its by-productâ€”distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) â€”is used in swine <b>feed</b> <b>rations</b> to substitute for corn and soymeal. The range of estimates used here covers the land-use credit used in the literature. Moreover, this study departs from earlier studies because <b>feed</b> <b>rations</b> from a least-cost optimization are used rather than <b>rations</b> from <b>feeding</b> trials, and DDGS nutrient profile variability is fully accounted for. As a result, displacement rates and the land-use credit can be better characterized using a distribution rather than a single point estimate. The land-use credit for corn ethanol for DDGS used in swine <b>feed</b> <b>rations</b> ranges from - 0. 367 to - 0. 596 hectares, whereby substitution for corn in the <b>feed</b> <b>ration</b> accounts for 56. 09 % and soymeal substitution contributes 48. 46 %. Variability of the land-use credit is contributed more by the variability of land use from the substitution of soymeal than that of corn. Finally, when feed compounders discount the DDGS nutrient profile to ensure they are at or above any realized nutrient profile 90 % of the time, the land-use credit for corn ethanol declines by 8. 47 % for DDGS in a swine <b>feed</b> <b>ration.</b> biofuel, DDGS quality, displacement rate, greenhouse gas accounting, land-use credit, optimal, stochastic LP, swine grower-finisher optimal <b>feed</b> <b>ration.</b> ...|$|R

The agglutinated diet was well accepted by the octopuses at this early stage.
