50|$|It was an all-metal, twin-engine, twin-boom design {{developed}} during World War II. The first test flight {{was made on}} May 26, 1942, with the first production aircraft <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> assembly line in October 1943. The last aircraft was retired from government service in 1954.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to approximate a triangle wave with additive synthesis by adding odd harmonics of the fundamental, multiplying every (4n−1)th harmonic by −1 (or changing its phase by π), and <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> harmonics by the inverse square of their relative frequency to the fundamental.|$|R
5000|$|The Giraffe {{can safely}} collide with enemies on <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> {{knocking}} them <b>off</b> in <b>the</b> process (referred to as [...] "bulling"). This attracts higher scores, especially if a large chain of enemies are bulled <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> at one time. It can {{also increase the}} global bonus multiplier.|$|R
5|$|Front flat tire. Braking a {{wheel with}} a flat tire can cause the tire to come <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, {{in the case of}} a front wheel, result in a loss of balance.|$|R
50|$|These initial six {{vehicles}} were produced at Smith UK’s facility in Washington, Tyne & Wear {{and shipped to}} Missouri in kit form, for final assembly.

5000|$|The {{first test}} {{run of the}} TFE731 {{occurred}} in 1970 at Garrett's plant in Torrance, California. [...] The first production model, <b>the</b> TFE731-2, began <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> assembly line in August, 1972, and was used on the Learjet 35/36 and Dassault Falcon 10, both of which entered production in 1973.|$|R
50|$|How {{the roller}} and rocker {{interface}} can vary. Rollers may have grooves {{to fit a}} guide on the board to keep the roller aligned with the rocker and prevent the rocker from sliding along the roller. Rockers may have guard rails at the ends to prevent <b>the</b> rocker from <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> roller.|$|R

50|$|The pilot {{informed}} Ngoyi Kasanji, {{governor of}} Kasai-Oriental province, that a brake {{problem on the}} aircraft {{was the cause of}} the accident.

The A310 came to a stop on soft ground among houses about 1,640 ft past the runway end.|$|R

The chassis development for the Maestro and Montego's rear suspension {{was used as a}} basis for later Rover cars, and was well regarded.|$|R
50|$|Winters are {{described}} as somewhat mild and very wet. Cold snaps can occur and last for several days, and snowfall occurs a few times throughout the winter season; {{the city has been}} known to see major snow and ice storms.

[...] Based {{directly on the}} Ford Expedition, introduced the year before, the Navigator gave the Lincoln-Mercury its first full-size SUV (slotted above the Mercury Mountaineer, based upon the Ford Explorer).|$|R
50|$|In Game 4, Kobe Bryant {{came back}} from his injury from Game 2 and after his teammate, Shaquille O'Neal fouled {{out of the game}} in OT, he took over the game.

Production commenced in June 1989 at Tsutsumi, {{with the first}} 1990 ES 250 <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> production line on 30 August 1989. Production ended on 5 July 1991. Because of its relatively brief production run, the ES 250 is a rare model on US roads today.|$|R
5000|$|In 1964, Opel {{introduced}} its KAD (Kapitän, Admiral, Diplomat) [...] "A" [...] series models. The Admiral [...] "A" [...] {{was the middle}} model in this three-car range. The cars were first presented in February 1964, but volume production of the Admiral began only in May 1964: Chevrolet powered V8 Diplomats started <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> production line three months later, in August 1964.|$|R

50|$|Because of its {{location}} {{at the foot}} of Mount Cameroon, the climate in Buea tends to be humid, with the neighbourhoods at higher elevations enjoying cooler temperatures while the lower neighbourhoods experience a hotter climate. Extended periods of rainfall, characterized by incessant drizzle, which can last for weeks, are common during the rainy season as are damp fogs, <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mountain into the town below.|$|R
50|$|The Torrent was {{discontinued}} {{after the}} 2009 model year {{as part of}} the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand, with <b>the</b> last one <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> assembly line on September 2, 2009. A Buick Theta crossover SUV was to be made, effectively taking place of the Pontiac Torrent. Instead, GM replaced the Torrent with the GMC Terrain, which shares the Theta platform with the second generation Equinox.|$|R
50|$|In the event, however, he was proven wrong, as the Oka's overall {{acceptable}} {{operating characteristics}} and low price resulted in some 700,000 examples <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> assembly line {{over a period}} of nearly two decades. During test drives on roads and in the Caucasus Mountains the car proved to have good handling, roadholding and, surprisingly for a vehicle of its size, excellent off-road capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Limited {{production}} of the Model 3 began in July 2017, with the first production vehicle <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> assembly line on July 7, 2017 and the official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars on July 28. Tesla CEO Elon Musk expects production to reach 20,000 vehicles per month by December 2017 or approximately 50 percent of the design capacity of the manufacturing line.|$|R
