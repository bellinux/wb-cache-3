5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary <b>renal</b> cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary <b>renal</b> cancer (papillary <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and <b>renal</b> cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe <b>renal</b> carcinoma and <b>renal</b> oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe <b>renal</b> carcinoma, clear cell <b>renal</b> carcinoma, <b>renal</b> oncocytoma, and papillary <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and men are more likely to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E
5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute <b>renal</b> insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the <b>renal</b> tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of <b>renal</b> insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output <b>renal</b> failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of <b>renal</b> dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{is usually}} due to insufficient dietary intake, {{but can be}} associated with malabsorption, acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic <b>renal</b> disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses. Groups at risk for zinc deficiency include the elderly, children in developing countries, and those with <b>renal</b> dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|The substance, or parenchyma, of {{the kidney}} {{is divided into}} two major {{structures}}: the outer <b>renal</b> cortex and the inner <b>renal</b> medulla. Grossly, these structures take the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped <b>renal</b> lobes, each containing <b>renal</b> cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a <b>renal</b> pyramid. Between the <b>renal</b> pyramids are projections of cortex called <b>renal</b> columns. Nephrons, the urine-producing functional structures of the kidney, span the cortex and medulla. The initial filtering portion of a nephron is the <b>renal</b> corpuscle which is located in the cortex. This is followed by a <b>renal</b> tubule that passes from the cortex deep into the medullary pyramids. Part of the <b>renal</b> cortex, a medullary ray is a collection of <b>renal</b> tubules that drain into a single collecting duct.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{studies are}} {{important}} {{in the evaluation of}} structural <b>renal</b> disease caused by urinary tract obstruction, <b>renal</b> stones, <b>renal</b> cyst, mass lesions, <b>renal</b> vascular disease, and vesicoureteral reflux.|$|E
25|$|Renal: <b>renal</b> hypertrophy, nephropathy, acute <b>renal</b> failure (secondary to rhabdomyolysis), focal {{segmental}} glomerulosclerosis, <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The tip, or papilla, of each pyramid empties urine into a minor calyx; minor calyces empty into major calyces, {{and major}} calyces empty into the <b>renal</b> pelvis. This becomes the ureter. At the hilum, the ureter and <b>renal</b> vein exit the kidney and the <b>renal</b> artery enters. Hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes {{surrounds}} these structures. The hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled cavity called the <b>renal</b> sinus. The <b>renal</b> sinus collectively contains the <b>renal</b> pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the <b>renal</b> medullary tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renal</b> {{insufficiency}} {{can lead}} to <b>renal</b> osteodystrophy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renal</b> {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology {{that deals}} with the diagnosis and characterization of disease of the kidneys. In a medical setting, <b>renal</b> pathologists work closely with nephrologists and transplant surgeons, who typically obtain diagnostic specimens via percutaneous <b>renal</b> biopsy. The <b>renal</b> pathologist must synthesize findings from traditional microscope histology, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Medical <b>renal</b> diseases may affect the glomerulus, the tubules and interstitium, the vessels, {{or a combination of}} these compartments.|$|E
25|$|Foot and Humphreys, and Foote et al. {{introduced}} the term <b>Renal</b> Celled Carcinoma to emphasize a <b>renal</b> tubular origin for these tumours. Their designation was slightly altered by Fetter to the now widely accepted term <b>Renal</b> Cell Carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{appearance of}} <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma (RCC) {{is a solid}} <b>renal</b> lesion which disturbs the <b>renal</b> contour. It will frequently have an irregular or lobulated margin and {{may be seen as}} a lump on the lower pelvic or abdomen region. Traditionally, 85 to 90% of solid <b>renal</b> masses {{will turn out to be}} RCC but cystic <b>renal</b> masses may also be due to RCC. However, the advances of diagnostic modalities are able to incidentally diagnose a great proportion of patients with <b>renal</b> lesions that may appear to be small in size and of benign state. Ten percent of RCC will contain calcifications, and some contain macroscopic fat (likely due to invasion and encasement of the perirenal fat.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>renal</b> artery {{branches}} into segmental arteries, dividing {{further into}} interlobar arteries, which penetrate the <b>renal</b> capsule and extend through the <b>renal</b> columns between the <b>renal</b> pyramids. The interlobar arteries then supply {{blood to the}} arcuate arteries that run through the boundary of the cortex and the medulla. Each arcuate artery supplies several interlobular arteries that feed into the afferent arterioles that supply the glomeruli.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} <b>renal</b> biopsy is to {{diagnose}} <b>renal</b> disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means (clinical history, past medical history, medication history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies). In general, a <b>renal</b> pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate the morphologic findings with the clinical history and laboratory data, ultimately arriving at a pathological diagnosis. A <b>renal</b> pathologist is a physician who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially training {{in the interpretation of}} <b>renal</b> biopsy specimens.|$|E
25|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs are inhibitors of the cyclooxygenases. In the kidney, this {{inhibition}} results in decreased PGE2 concentration causing {{a reduction in}} blood flow. Because {{blood flow to the}} kidney first reaches the <b>renal</b> cortex (outside) and then the <b>renal</b> medulla (inside), the deeper structures of the kidney are most sensitive to decreased blood flow. Thus the innermost structures of the kidney, known as the <b>renal</b> papillae, are especially dependent on prostaglandin synthesis to maintain adequate blood flow. Inhibition of cyclooxygenases therefore rather selectively damages the <b>renal</b> papillae, increasing the risk of <b>renal</b> papillary necrosis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} the <b>renal</b> cell cancer {{detected}} before they have symptoms (incidentally) because of the CT scan (Computed Tomography Imaging) or ultrasound. Incidentally diagnosed <b>renal</b> cell cancer (no symptoms) differs in outlook from those diagnosed after presenting symptoms of <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma or metastasis. The 5 year survival rate was higher for incidental than for symptomatic tumours: 85.3% versus 62.5%. Incidental lesions were significantly lower stage than those that cause symptoms, since 62.1% patients with incidental <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma were observed with Stage I lesions, against 23% were found with symptomatic <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Hypertension is a {{risk factor}} for <b>renal</b> injury and end-stage <b>renal</b> disease (ESRD). <b>Renal</b> risk appears to be more closely related to {{systolic}} than to diastolic blood pressure, and black men are at greater risk than white men for developing ESRD at every level of blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Management of {{the disease}} should be focused on {{preventing}} end-stage <b>renal</b> disease (ESRD) and/or vision loss. The treatment of hypertension may also preserve <b>renal</b> function. <b>Renal</b> replacement therapy is recommended, and vision experts may provide assistance to adapt to continued vision loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>renal</b> epithelial tumours was debated for decades. The {{debate was}} initiated by Paul Grawitz when in 1883, he published his {{observations on the}} morphology of small, yellow <b>renal</b> tumours. Grawitz concluded that only alveolar tumours were of adrenal origin, whereas papillary tumours were derived from <b>renal</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|There {{is large}} interfamilial and intrafamilial {{variability}} in ADPKD. Most individuals with PKD1 mutations have <b>renal</b> failure by age 70 years, whereas more than 50% {{of individuals with}} PKD2 mutations have adequate <b>renal</b> function at that age (mean age of onset of end-stage <b>renal</b> disease: 54·3 years with PKD1; 74·0 years with PKD2).|$|E
25|$|At diagnosis, 30% of <b>renal</b> cell carcinomas {{have spread}} to the {{ipsilateral}} <b>renal</b> vein, and 5–10% have continued into the inferior vena cava.|$|E
25|$|Metolazone quickly gained {{popularity}} due to {{its lower}} <b>renal</b> toxicity compared to other diuretics (especially thiazides) in patients with <b>renal</b> insufficiency.|$|E
25|$|Moderate <b>renal</b> {{impairment}} {{does not}} necessitate dosage adjustment, while {{in patients with}} severe <b>renal</b> impairment or hepatic impairment, Nimesulide is contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|Pregabalin is {{eliminated}} from the systemic circulation primarily by <b>renal</b> excretion as unchanged drug. <b>Renal</b> clearance of pregabalin is 73 mL/minute.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renal</b> impairment: <b>Renal</b> {{disease has}} no {{influence}} on plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and dosing {{need not be}} adjusted in these patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renal</b> vein {{thrombosis}} is the obstruction of the <b>renal</b> vein by a thrombus. This tends {{to lead to}} reduced drainage from the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Familial <b>renal</b> {{disease is}} an {{uncommon}} cause of <b>renal</b> failure (kidney failure) in young dogs. Most causes are breed-related (familial) {{and some are}} inherited.|$|E
25|$|Oligohydramnios is {{the cause}} of Potter {{sequence}} but {{there are many things that}} can lead to oligohydramnios. It can be caused by <b>renal</b> diseases such as bilateral <b>renal</b> agenesis (BRA), atresia of the ureter or urethra causing obstruction of the urinary tract, polycystic or multicystic kidney diseases, <b>renal</b> hypoplasia, amniotic rupture, toxemia, or uteroplacental insufficiency from maternal hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{though the}} <b>renal</b> {{survival}} is 80–90% after 10 years, at least 25% and maybe up to 45% of adult patients will eventually develop end stage <b>renal</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renal</b> function: Increased BUN and serum {{creatinine}} {{have been}} noted. Crystalluria (formation of crystals and excretion in the urine) and acute <b>renal</b> failure {{have also been}} seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{kidney and}} nervous system {{communicate}} via the <b>renal</b> plexus, whose fibers course along the <b>renal</b> arteries to reach each kidney. Input from the {{sympathetic nervous system}} triggers vasoconstriction in the kidney, thereby reducing <b>renal</b> blood flow. The kidney also receives input from the parasympathetic nervous system, {{by way of the}} <b>renal</b> branches of the vagus nerve; the function of this is yet unclear. Sensory input from the kidney travels to the T10-11 levels of the spinal cord and is sensed in the corresponding dermatome. Thus, pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney.|$|E
25|$|Chronic pain in {{patients}} with ADPKD is often refractory to conservative, non-invasive treatments, but non-opioid analgesics and conservative interventions can be first used before opioid analgesics are considered; if pain continues, then surgical interventions can target <b>renal</b> or hepatic cysts in order to directly address the cause of pain, with surgical options including <b>renal</b> cyst decortication, <b>renal</b> denervation, and nephrectomy.|$|E
25|$|In general, death {{results from}} {{hypotension}} secondary to blood loss, <b>renal</b> failure, and intracranial hemorrhage. Common complications include necrosis and <b>renal</b> failure secondary to shock and the toxic {{effects of the}} venom.|$|E
25|$|Hysterectomy {{may cause}} an {{increased}} risk of the relatively rare <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma. The increased risk is particularly pronounced for young women; the risk was lower after vaginally performed hysterectomies. Hormonal effects or injury of the ureter were considered as possible explanations. In some cases the <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma may be a manifestation of an undiagnosed hereditary leiomyomatosis and <b>renal</b> cell cancer syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{grade is}} {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} most imperative prognostic factors in patients with <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma. However, a study by Delahunt et al. (2007) has shown that the Fuhrman grading is ideal for clear cell carcinoma but may not be appropriate for chromophobe <b>renal</b> cell carcinomas and that the staging of cancer (accomplished by CT scan) is a more favourable predictor of the prognosis of this disease. In relation to <b>renal</b> cancer staging, the Heidelberg classification system of <b>renal</b> tumours was introduced in 1976 as a means of more completely correlating the histopathological features with the identified genetic defects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renal</b> failure (kidney failure) * {{is common}} in dogs and {{may be found in}} acute or chronic forms. It is defined by a loss of {{function}} of about 75 percent of the filtration system of the kidney and characterized by azotemia and low specific gravity of the urine. Acute <b>renal</b> failure can be caused by loss of blood supply, hypercalcemia, or toxins such as ethylene glycol (antifreeze) or aminoglycoside antibiotics (see: ethylene glycol poisoning). Chronic <b>renal</b> failure can be congenital and/or inherited or caused by cancer, infection, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis, progressive interstitial fibrosis, or any of the causes of acute <b>renal</b> failure.|$|E
