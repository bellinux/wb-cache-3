500|$|In mathematics, {{a binary}} {{operation}} is commutative if changing {{the order of}} the operands does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many mathematical proofs depend on it. Most familiar as the name of the property that says [...] or , the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as [...] division and subtraction, that do not have it (for example, [...] ); such operations are not commutative, and so are referred to as noncommutative operations. The idea that simple operations such as the multiplication and addition of numbers are commutative, was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized. A corresponding property exists for binary relations; a binary relation is said to be symmetric if the relation applies <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of its operands; for example, equality is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.|$|E

We study <b>the</b> growth rate <b>of</b> <b>ordered</b> Ramsey numbers of ordered graphs {{with respect to}} <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> vertices. We find ordered match- ings whose ordered Ramsey numbers grow superpolynomially. We show that ordered Ramsey numbers of ordered graphs with bounded degeneracy and interval chromatic number are at most polynomial. We prove that ordered Ramsey numbers are at most polynomial for ordered graphs with bounded bandwidth. We find 3 -regular graphs that have superlinear <b>ordered</b> Ramsey numbers, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordering.</b> <b>The</b> last two results solve problems of Conlon, Fox, Lee, and Sudakov.
