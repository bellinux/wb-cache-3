40|$|Purpose – Marketers often combine {{products}} in bundles to increase demand. Research {{has shown that}} itemizing the prices of the individual {{products in}} the bundle raises evaluations in some situations. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate how bundle size influences the effect itemizing prices have on bundle evaluation. Design/methodology/approach – We conduct two experiments. In the first, we test the effects of price presentation formats (itemized vs consolidated) and bundle size on consumers’ evaluations of product bundles. In the second experiment, we test the proposed mechanism that itemizing the price leads to a more <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> expectation which in turn enhances evaluation. We also test whether this effect is stronger for larger bundles. Findings – In Study 1,we find that large, but not small, bundles are evaluated more positive when presented with itemized prices. In Study 2 mediated moderation analysis supports the prediction that price expectation mediates the effect of the price presentation x bundle size interaction on bundle evaluations. The findings show that itemizing prices results in more <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> expectations and that this effect is stronger for larger bundles. In turn, more <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> expectations leads to higher evaluation. Research limitations/implications – The implication of this research is that by directing attention to individual items in the bundle, consumers are better able to assess bundle benefits. More research is needed to investigate other potential explanations for the findings in Study 1. Further research should also investigate whether the findings reported here holds in other settings, with other products, and with other types and size of bundles. Practical implications – Managers are recommended to itemize the prices of product bundles, particularly when bundles are large. Originality/value – This article extend our knowledge about the effect itemizing the prices of individual items in a bundle has on consumer evaluation by (1) demonstrating the moderating effect of bundle size, and (2) showing that more <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> expectation explains these effects...|$|R

Although competition can be effective, the unusual incentives flowing from interservice rivalry and the parochial interests of individual legislators often allow contractors to underbid or “buy in” on early development and production contracts and to “get well” on later contracts. Expanding the role of competition within the present institutional framework holds the potential for some improvement in the procurement process.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel {{approach}} to electricity price modeling, based on the powerful technique of stochastic time change. This technique allows us to incorporate the characteristic features of electricity prices (such as seasonal volatility, time varying mean reversion and seasonally occurring price spikes) into the model in an elegant and economically justifiable way. The stochastic time change introduces stochastic as well as deterministic (e. g., seasonal) features in the price process’ volatility and in the jump component. We specify the base process as a mean reverting jump diffusion and the time change as an absolutely continuous stochastic process with seasonal component. The activity rate of the stochastic time change {{can be related to}} the factors that influence supply and demand. Here we use the temperature as a proxy for the demand and hence, as the driving factor of the stochastic time change, and show that this choice leads to <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> paths. We derive properties of the resulting price process and develop the model calibration procedure. We calibrate the model to the historical EEX power prices and apply it to generating <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> paths by Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|Decarbonising {{electricity}} {{systems is}} essential for mitigating climate change. Future systems will likely incorporate higher penetrations of intermittent renewable and inflexible nuclear power. This will significantly impact on system operations, particularly the requirements for flexibility in terms of reserves {{and the cost of}} such services. This paper estimates the interrelated changes in wholesale electricity and reserve prices using two novel methods. Firstly, it simulates the short run marginal cost of generation using a unit commitment model with post-processing to achieve <b>realistic</b> <b>prices.</b> It also introduces a new reserve price model, which mimics actual operation by first calculating the day ahead schedules and then letting deviations from schedule drive reserve prices. The UK is used as a case study to compare these models with traditional methods from the literature. The model gives good agreement with and historic prices in 2015. In a 2035 scenario, increased renewables penetration reduces mean electricity prices, and leads to price spikes due to expensive plants being brought online briefly to cope with net load variations. Contrary to views previously held in literature, a renewable intensive scenario does not lead to a higher reserve price than a fossil fuel intensive scenario. Demand response technology is shown to offer sizeable economic benefits when maintaining system balance. More broadly, this framework can be used to evaluate the economics of providing reserve services by aggregating decentralised energy resources such as heat pumps, micro-CHP and electric vehicles...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{telecommunication}} operators have been deploying WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) technology to satisfy the exponential growth in global communication. While facilitating the advanced information society of today, this has also led to a higher dependency on the networks, and furthermore the high capacity utilisation of optical fibres means that a single link failure will influence many users and enterprises. For these reasons, protection of network connections {{has become a major}} competitive parameter for the operators. Currently, the most popular protection method is ring protection, due to its simplicity, requiring only basic management functionality and operating with local restoration control. While many optical rings have been deployed, little work has been published on exactly what the cost of ring networks are, compared to general mesh networks. In this article we perform a quantitative comparison between ring protection and mesh protection, using real world network data and <b>realistic</b> <b>prices</b> for network components. Extending classic LP flow models to take rings and node costs into account, and using a link-path based mesh network LP model, we are able to perform a total cost comparison of the two architectures, and of manual ring network design. The results suggest that the price of mesh network components must be reduced significantly to be competitive with ring based networks, and also that manual network design does not necessarily lead to the most cost-efficient designs. c ○ 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to harmonize guidelines for environmental footprints of food and beverages. For example, the food Sustainable Consumption and Production Roundtable, the Leap partnership, and the Environmental Footprint project, in particular within the Cattle Model Working Group. Despite all these activities, there are still many issues unresolved. This paper gives an overview of five important reasons why it is so difficult to reach consensus within the sector. In short, the issues are: 1) how to allocate deforestation to land use activities; 2) how to assess agricultural emissions profiles; 3) how to make regionalized water scarcity assessments; 4) how to choose the functional unit of food and beverages; and 5) how to deal with multi-functional processes in agro-industry. Recommendations as motivated in this paper are, in summary, to: 1) use the method to calculate the amount of land use change caused by increased pressure from growing areas per crop in each country; 2) always calculate agricultural emissions using at least an intermediate level of detail with the option to add more detail; 3) use good quality irrigation and crop evapotranspiration data, and at least country specific water scarcity factors; 4) report the environmental footprint results per unit of economic value besides per unit of mass or volume to enable fairer comparisons; 5) and apply economic allocation in all multi-functional agricultural and agri-industrial processes based on <b>realistic</b> <b>prices</b> calculated as multiple year averages...|$|E
