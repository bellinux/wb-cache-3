5|$|Players {{are able}} to move around the {{battlefield}} freely, but they {{have the option to}} create predefined paths for the character to follow. While moving along these paths, characters gain access to Hero actions, which make them immune to damage and speed up charge times. However, the use of these Hero actions requires the use of Bezels; these items are an essential element in battle and are <b>recharged</b> <b>through</b> a variety of methods, such as destroying portions of an enemy's weapons and armor, or killing an enemy. Characters using Hero actions can attack while jumping in the air, and are also able to unleash special attacks which manifest as stylish firearm maneuvers. Enemies are only able to move while the player's current character is moving and will usually attack only that character.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{parallel hybrid}} is the 'through the road' type. In this system a conventional drivetrain powers one axle, {{with an electric}} motor or motors driving another. This arrangement was used by the earliest 'off track' trolleybuses. It in effect provides a complete backup power train. In modern motors batteries can be <b>recharged</b> <b>through</b> regenerative braking or by loading the electrically driven wheels during cruise. This allows a simpler approach to power-management. This layout also has the advantage of providing four-wheel-drive in some conditions. (An example of this principle is a bicycle fitted with a front hub motor, which assists the cyclist's pedal power at the rear wheel.) Vehicles of this type include the Audi 100 Duo II, Subaru VIZIV and Peugeot 307 Hybrid HDi concept cars, the PSA Group vehicles Peugeot 3008, Peugeot 508, 508 RXH, Citroen DS5 all using the HYbrid4 system, the Volvo V60 plug-in hybrid, the BMW 2-series Active Tourer, BMW i8, and the second generation Honda NSX.|$|E

5000|$|A laptop computer, {{also called}} a notebook, {{is a small}} {{personal}} computer designed for portability. Usually, all of the hardware and interfaces needed to operate a laptop, such as the graphics card, audio devices or USB ports (previously parallel and serial ports), are built into a single unit. Laptops usually have [...] "clamshell" [...] design, in which the keyboard and computer components are on one panel and a flat display screen on a second panel, which is hinged to the first panel. The laptop is opened for use and closed for transport. Closing the laptop also protects the screen and keyboard during transportation. Laptops have both a power cable that can be plugged in and high-capacity batteries that can power the device, enhancing its portability.

A Greens function approach derives an integral equation that is solved numerically for the case in which two interfaces exist - one between salt and freshwater and one between freshwater and air.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{representativeness}} of groundwater <b>recharge</b> estimates <b>through</b> the chloride mass balance (CMB) method in a tropical environment. The representativeness of recharge estimates using this methodology is tested using evaporation estimates from isotope data, the general {{spatial distribution of}} the potential field, and the topographical variations in the area. This study suggests that annual groundwater recharge rates in the area ranges between 0. 9 % and 21 % of annual precipitation. These estimates are consistent with evaporation rates computed from stable isotope data of groundwater and surface water in the Voltaian Basin. Moreover, estimates of groundwater <b>recharge</b> <b>through</b> numerical model calibration {{in other parts of}} the terrain appear to be consistent with the current data in this study. A spatial distribution of groundwater recharge in the area based on the estimated data takes a pattern akin to the spatial pattern of distribution of the hydraulic head, the local topography, and geology of the terrain. This suggests that the estimates at least qualitatively predicts the local recharge and discharge locations in the terrain...|$|R
30|$|Recharge {{is assumed}} to be {{predominantly}} from rainfall infiltration.

A small component of recharge is thought to occur via stream and river bed leakage especially in the lower reaches of the river systems. As there is no long term water level monitoring data recharge has been assumed to be a percentage of the total annual rainfall [39]. Rainfall infiltration rates in the order of 5 – 20 % have been estimated during the model calibration. Recharge zoning was made based on the geology and rainfall isohyet map.|$|R

The aquifer occurs in permeable sediments ranging in age from Miocene to Recent. Over most of Delaware, the top of the unconfined or water-table portion of the Columbia aquifer occurs at depths less than 10 feet below land surface. Because of the permeable character of the aquifer and its near-surface location, the unconfined aquifer is highly susceptible to contamination...|$|E
30|$|The {{quality of}} {{groundwater}} {{resources in the}} central Thakurgaon Sadar of Thakurgaon District was evaluated to reconnaissance the suitability for irrigation uses.

Trace metals concentration in groundwater samples were below the detection limit. The chemical analyses of groundwater samples indicate that the water is chemically characterized by Ca–HCO 3, Ca–Mg–HCO 3 and CaCO 3 with low TDS. The groundwaters from these groups are <b>recharged</b> <b>through</b> direct infiltration of rain.

The radiocarbon dating also shows that flow paths in the basalt aquifer are complex since ages do not always increase downflow; any hydraulic conductivity calculations must take this into account.
