60|$|Do you see yonder brown house, {{with its}} broad roof sloping {{almost to the}} ground on one side, and a great, unsupported, sun bonnet of a piazza {{shooting}} out over the front door? You must often have noticed it; you have seen its tall well sweep, relieved against the clear evening sky, or observed the feather beds and bolsters lounging out of its chamber windows on a still summer morning; you recollect its gate, that swung with a chain and a great stone; its pantry window, latticed with little brown slabs, and looking out upon a forest of bean poles. You remember the zephyrs that used to play among its pea brush, and shake the long tassels of its corn patch, and how vainly any zephyr might essay to perform similar flirtations with the considerate cabbages that were solemnly vegetating near by. Then there was the whole neighborhood of purple-leaved beets and feathery parsnips; there were the billows of gooseberry bushes rolled up by the fence, interspersed with rows of quince trees; and far off in one corner was one little patch, penuriously devoted to ornament, which flamed with marigolds, poppies, snappers, and four-o'clocks. Then {{there was a little}} box by itself with one <b>rose</b> <b>geranium</b> in it, which seemed to look around the garden as much like a stranger as a French dancing master in a Yankee meeting house.|$|E
6000|$|Afterward, in London, {{it was a}} {{pleasure}} to me to see this fantastic vagabond come marching into the lobby of the hotel in his grand-ducal way, for he always had some new imaginary grandeur to develop--there was nothing stale about him but his clothes. If he addressed me when strangers were about, he always raised his voice a little and called me [...] "Sir Richard," [...] or [...] "General," [...] or [...] "Your Lordship"--and when people began to stare and look deferential, he would fall to inquiring in a casual way why I disappointed the Duke of Argyll the night before; and then remind me of our engagement at the Duke of Westminster's for the following day. I think that for the time being these things were realities to him. He once came and invited me to go with him and spend the evening with the Earl of Warwick at his town house. I said I had received no formal invitation. He said that that was of no consequence, the Earl had no formalities for him or his friends. I asked if I could go just as I was. He said no, that would hardly do; evening dress was requisite at night in any gentleman's house. He said he would wait while I dressed, and then we would go to his apartments and I could take a bottle of champagne and a cigar while he dressed. I was very willing to see how this enterprise would turn out, so I dressed, and we started to his lodgings. He said if I didn't mind we would walk. So we tramped some four miles through the mud and fog, and finally found his [...] "apartments"; they consisted of a single room over a barber's shop in a back street. Two chairs, a small table, an ancient valise, a wash-basin and pitcher (both on the floor in a corner), an unmade bed, a fragment of a looking-glass, and a flower-pot, with a perishing little <b>rose</b> <b>geranium</b> in it, which he called a century plant, and said it had not bloomed now for upward of two centuries--given to him by the late Lord Palmerston--(been offered a prodigious sum for it)--these were the contents of the room. Also a brass candlestick and a part of a candle. Rogers lit the candle, and told me to sit down and make myself at home. He said he hoped I was thirsty, because he would surprise my palate with an article of champagne that seldom got into a commoner's system; or would I prefer sherry, or port? Said he had port in bottles that were swathed in stratified cobwebs, every stratum representing a generation. And as for his cigars--well, I should judge of them myself.

From {{far away}} came a rich, long-continued chuckle of laughter, {{followed}} by the clatter of a falling plate, and then, still more uncontrollable laughter. There was a faint smell of toast on the air. Lawford ventured out on to the landing and into a little room that had once, in years gone by, been Alice's nursery. He stood far back from the strip of open window that showed beneath the green blind, craning forward to see into the garden--the trees, their knotted trunks, and then, as he stole nearer, a flower-bed, late <b>roses,</b> <b>geraniums,</b> calceolarias, the lawn and--yes, three wicker chairs, a footstool, a work-basket, a little table on the smooth grass in the honey-coloured sunshine; and Sheila {{sitting there in the}} autumnal sunlight, her hands resting on the arms of her chair, her head bent, evidently deeply engrossed in her thoughts. He crept an inch or two forward, and stooped. There was a hat on the grass--Alice's big garden hat--and beside it lay Flitters, nose on paws, long ears sagging. He had forgotten Flitters. Had Flitters forgotten him? Would he bark at the strange, distasteful scent of a--Dr Ferguson? The coast was clear, then. He turned even softlier yet, to confront, rapt, still, and hovering betwixt astonishment and dread, the blue calm eyes of his daughter, looking in at the door.

5000|$|Whole fruit {{preserves}} can {{be found}} in most Greek and Cypriot homes. They are made by slowly and gently boiling fruit in water and sugar over several hours or days, until the syrup sets.

Some lemon juice is often added to preserve the fruit's original color, as the citric acid prevents oxidation. A small quantity of blanched almonds, slivered or whole, may also be added for crunch, often to baby eggplants, apples or grapes. Ingredients variously added during the boiling, and then discarded, include a quill of cinnamon bark, a mint bouquet, or the green, fragrant leaves of the shrub Pelargonium odoratissimum (apple geranium) or Pelargonium graveolens (<b>rose</b> <b>geranium)</b> which add some astringency and a slight aroma of frankincense and is especially popular in the Ionian islands.|$|E
40|$|Author for {{correspondence}} Based on {{empirical evidence}} from small scale growers and a processor, this study evaluated contract farming of <b>rose</b> <b>geranium</b> (Pelagonium graveoleus) production {{in a rural}} setting of Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. With the aid of interview schedules and observation, cross sectional {{data were collected from}} the growers and processor of geranium oil on their 2007 production activities. The analytical tools employed descriptive statistics and farm budget model. The contract <b>rose</b> <b>geranium</b> growers in the area supplied the land for planting while the processor supplied the other inputs from land preparation to the harvesting of the plant. The contractual agreement was, however, unwritten with no signed contract between the parties. Further analysis revealed some ambiguities in the contractual arrangement. With an average of US $ 4 785. 61 as production and processing costs on a hectare of <b>rose</b> <b>geranium,</b> the processor receives US $ 3 862. 39 as net profit, while the contract growers received US $ 833. 33. This arrangement appears unsustainable. Although contract farming is essentially private in the area, the arrangement can become an integral policy, where the government, together with the growers and agro-industry, join to create a conducive production environment. Sustainable contract farming of essential oil plants in South Africa, calls for a policy option that enforces well documented and clearly explained agreements between the farmers and the processors.

40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} compositions {{of seven}} essential oils from Taiwan {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The eluates were identified by matching the mass fragment patents to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 08 database. The quantitative analysis showed that the major components of lemon verbena are geranial (26. 9 %) and neral (23. 1 %); those of sweet marjoram are γ-terpinene (18. 5 %), thymol methyl ether (15. 5 %), and terpinen- 4 -ol (12. 0 %); those of clove basil are eugenol (73. 6 %), and β-(Z) -ocimene (15. 4 %); those of patchouli are carvacrol (47. 5 %) and p-cymene (15. 2 %); those of rosemary are α-pinene (54. 8 %) and 1, 8 -cineole (22. 2 %); those of tea tree are terpinen- 4 -ol (33. 0 %) and 1, 8 -cineole (27. 7 %); and those of <b>rose</b> <b>geranium</b> are citronellol (28. 9 %) and 6, 9 -guaiadiene (20. 1 %). These components are somewhat different from the same essential oils that were obtained from other origins. Lemon verbena has the same major components everywhere. Tea tree, <b>rose</b> <b>geranium,</b> and clove basil {{have at least one}} major component throughout different origins. The major components and their amounts in sweet marjoram, patchouli, and rosemary vary widely from one place to another. These results demonstrate that essential oils have a large diversity in their composition in line with their different origins. The antibacterial activity of essential oils against Escherichia coli was evaluated using the optical density method (turbidimetry). Patchouli is a very effective inhibitor, in that it completely inhibits the growth of E. coli at 0. 05 %. Clove basil and sweet marjoram are good inhibitors, and the upper limit of their minimum inhibitory concentration is 0. 1 %...|$|E
