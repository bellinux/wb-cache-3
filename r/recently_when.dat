5|$|The last new county {{formation}} in Maryland occurred when Garrett County {{was formed in}} 1872 from portions of Allegany County. However, {{there have been numerous}} changes to county borders since that time, most <b>recently</b> <b>when</b> portions of the city of Takoma Park that had previously been part of Prince George's County were absorbed into Montgomery County in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (Lepilemur) and mouse lemurs (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus), golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until <b>recently,</b> <b>when</b> genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the early}} exit in the Houston Regional {{due to the}} upset by the Aggies, Humber {{looked forward to the}} Major League Baseball Draft. Niemann, and Townsend were all {{selected}} along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft— the first time three teammates had ever gone so early in the same draft. Only twice had three teammates been taken in the first round, most <b>recently</b> <b>when</b> Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected {{in the first round of}} the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Skagen's Skipper School {{was opened}} to train navigators for both fishing boats and {{merchant}} ships. It {{is now the}} only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most <b>recently</b> <b>when</b> a new wing was added in 2003. The private school Brovandeskolen, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach. A primary goal is active cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} also {{time and again}} shown to have {{a soft spot for}} clubs in {{financial}} disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers. Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its license for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli. More <b>recently</b> <b>when</b> Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E

50|$|The first {{excavation}} of the stone's vicinity {{was conducted in}} 1860. Further excavation took place in 1864 and, most <b>recently,</b> 1977 <b>when</b> it was unsuccessfully proposed that the stone {{be removed from the}} grounds of Edinburgh airport.|$|R
25|$|The {{allocation}} has mainly been Leyland Olympians and AEC Routemasters until <b>recently</b> <b>when</b> Alexander ALX400 bodied DAF DB250s were allocated in its completely double-deck allocation {{which included}} the Northern Counties Palatine bodied Volvo Olympians which came with {{the operation of the}} former Londonlinks routes 176/route 188.|$|E

25|$|The oldest ultras {{groups in}} all of Italian football, Fossa dei Leoni, {{originated}} in Milan. Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is Brigate Rossonere. Politically, Milan ultras have never had any particular preference, but the media traditionally associated them with the left-wing, until <b>recently,</b> <b>when</b> Berlusconi's presidency somewhat altered that view.|$|E

In 1989, {{with the help of}} Sun Remarketing, Apple disposed of approximately 2,700 unsold Lisas in a guarded landfill in Logan, Utah, in order to receive a tax write-off on the unsold inventory.|$|E
25|$|Inter{{national}} Cricket was nonexistent until <b>recently</b> <b>when</b> the United States national cricket team {{started playing}} in the World Cricket League. Cricket in the United States {{is run by the}} United States of America Cricket Association, whose effectiveness is lessened by limited funds due to cricket's lack of popularity compared to other sports. The United States cricket team is currently unranked in Test Cricket and One Day International cricket.|$|E
25|$|More <b>recently,</b> <b>when</b> the International Cricket Council {{decided to}} award Test and One Day International status to the matches {{played for the}} tsunami benefit and the ICC Super Series between Australia and a Rest of the World team, Frindall, in common with many statisticians and historians, disputed the ruling. As a result, Playfair and other {{publications}} to which he supplied statistics did not classify those matches as official Tests or ODIs.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, the Browns {{have had}} on-again / off-again periods of wearing white for their home games, {{particularly}} in the 1970s and 80s, {{as well as in}} the early 2000s after the team returned to the league. Until <b>recently,</b> <b>when</b> more NFL teams have started to wear white at home at least once a season, the Browns were the only non-subtropical team north of the Mason-Dixon line to wear white at home on a regular basis.|$|E
25|$|There {{does not}} seem to be a {{researched}} history of sprung floors. There would not have been much perceived need until <b>recently,</b> <b>when</b> concrete slabs started being generally used for sub-floors. Before then floors were mainly either earthen or used wood on joists, both of which provide some cushioning from shocks. Early sprung floors often used leaf or coil springs, whence the name; these floors tended to bounce, but modern floors have suppressed this 'trampoline' effect and so are often called semi-sprung.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture and {{livestock}} form {{at least part}} of the economic base for over 90% of the population. Almost all farming occurs during the rainy season from June to October. Important crops include tomatoes, corn, beans, squash and cucumbers. However, the growing of tomatoes has decreased due to plant infestations, costs of herbicides and insecticides and falling market prices. Most of the municipal land was held communally in ejidos until <b>recently,</b> <b>when</b> constitutional changes have allowed more land to pass into private hands.|$|E

25|$|As Debbie Darnell, {{she often}} dated long-time hero Captain Comet. She also portrayed a French {{real estate agent}} named Camille on Earth. Her {{whereabouts}} were unknown until <b>recently</b> <b>when</b> {{it was revealed that}} she was mind-wiped and put in a coma. She was most likely mind-wiped at the request of Green Lantern, Hal Jordan to protect Carol Ferris. She was in a coma following the mind-wipe, and was revived by her teammates in the Secret Society. Together, they again battled the Justice League of America.|$|E
25|$|At {{various times}} {{there have been}} {{concerns}} about concentration of newspaper ownership, notably in 1970 and 1980 with two commissions, the Davey Committee on combines and the Kent Royal Commission on Newspapers respectively, and most <b>recently</b> <b>when</b> Conrad Black's Hollinger acquired the Southam newspapers in the late 1990s. When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased {{by a variety of}} new ownership groups such as Osprey Media, increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership {{for the first time in}} many years.|$|E
25|$|Another ideology-focused {{approach}} defines {{both parties}} not as competing trends within Carlism, but as entirely separate political groupings which between 1870 and 1888 remained in a temporary, shaky alliance. According to this analysis, the religion-focused group {{has always been}} clearly distinct from Carlism. In partisan version, launched in the 1970s {{for the sake of}} political struggle, Traditionalists infiltrated into Carlism. Later this theory was elaborated further on and currently features 3 groupings: Integrists focusing on religious aims, Traditionalists focusing on dynastical aims and (genuine) Carlists focusing on social aims. <b>Recently</b> <b>when</b> discussing the 1888 rupture historians tend to combine all factors mentioned, without giving priority to any of them.|$|E
