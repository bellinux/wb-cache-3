40|$|A Research Report Submitted to the Faculty of Humanities, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in Partial Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts February 2014 The report {{explores the}} South African craft policy {{framework}} using, as a case-study, the iSimangaliso Craft Programme in KwaZulu-Natal, and {{its attempts to}} assist rural women craft producers through a partnership with a major South African home décor chain store. The purpose {{was to examine the}} feasibility of South African craft policy in the rural context, the extent to which rural women benefit from craft production and sales in the market economy; and the constraints on the actors in the craft sector (including the crafters) with regards to the creation or transformation of <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> producers into small, micro and medium enterprises (SMMEs). The study used the Sustainable Livelihoods (SL) framework to shift the research focus away from craft for economic benefit to the broader perspective of ‘tangible and intangible costs and benefits’. The livelihood outcomes the women crafters pursued, the strategies they adopted to achieve them, {{and the extent to which}} the Craft Programme fitted into their lives were examined. An actor-oriented approach helped determine the ‘social interface’ or dynamics between the actors in the sector when they try to implement craft policy. The research was qualitative, and mixed methods such as semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used to gather data. Thematic content analysis was used to mine data for information relating to the main research questions. The study found that the women crafters draw on multiple strategies to cope and that craft is desirable for its ability to ‘fit’ with other livelihood strategies. The study also found that SMME development policy created a strain on both craft producers and government agencies. It is suggested that a ‘context-sensitive’ and people-centred framework for craft development is needed. The South African government needs to consider the contexts of craft producers and develop appropriate interventions aligned to the social and economic outcomes that people pursue. One possible option is the social enterprise ‘market intermediary’ model which provides services to its target population to help them access markets. This model could leverage resources from both sectors to create truly economic and social value for <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> producers...|$|E

However, little information is available on the methods of by-product disposal used by craft breweries. An investigation was carried out in which 200 + British craft brewers were contacted, of which 90 craft brewers provided basic information about their brewery operations and by-product disposal. Representatives of eleven breweries were interviewed to provide an in-depth case study of their by-product disposal methods. The research found that urban craft brewers use a wider range of disposal methods compared to <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> brewers; urban brewers dispose of more waste through sewage and landfill, as well as using external companies, such as bio-recycling and anaerobic digester plants, whereas rural brewers have relationships with farmers who dispose of the by-products in various ways.

The ROTC {{objective is to}} design pilot rural development strategies for expanding income in selected poor; the SSM objective {{is to build a}} "righteous society " based on equality, common ownership of the means of production, freedom from exploitation, and people's power. Other project attributes discussed include program size (68 RCTC's in 1978; 2, 000 SSM villages in 1977), funding sources (RCTC funds are raised locally;,local contributions and foreign philanthropic organizations support the SSM), and curriculum (both projects respond to local needs). A comparison of the projects shows that while both were founded to help the rural poor, RCTC's were begun'-by foreigners and are both capitalistic and decentralized. The SSM, however, is much larger in size and budget. It is voluntary, socialistic, moralistic, spiritualistic, and was founded by people indigenous to Sri Lanka. Five tables provide data on educational opportunity in Kenya, government-approved RCTC's, subjects taught in RCTC's and the SSM, and the SSM budget (1977 - 78).

It explores the multidisciplinary and inter-sectoral initiatives undertaken to support the development of indigenous crafts enterprises and interrogates internalised understanding of the cultural complexities, social conditions and relationship between the producer (artisan enterprise) and the marketplace (consumer) as a pre-requisite for the development of learning systems, appropriate design strategies and skills necessary for transformation from survivalist enterprise to sustainable business. The research in progress was presented to and informed by NGOs, SMEs and Craft retail sector (Roundtable seminar, Delhi, 2009) and builds on previous projects and research undertaken within the DIUS funded England-Africa Partnership (EAP) project ‘Design, Health and Community’ (2007 - 08).

40|$|The {{concept of}} cottage {{industry}} (kotiteollisuus) referred especially to <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> practices. For {{the promotion of}} cottage industries, a state administrative organ and a network of cottage industry associations and schools were established. A sphere developed and monitored by specialists, cottage industry policies were planned as official committee work. However, the matter was usually addressed as ‘the idea of cottage industry’ (kotiteollisuusaate). In this study, the historical idea of cottage industry and its cultural and political backgrounds are analysed. The starting point of the investigation is in the post-WWII Cottage Industry Production Committee, but from its years of activity, 1944 – 1949, the study moves on to the emergence and establishment {{of the idea of}} cottage industry and the respective policy line in the late 19 th and the early 20 th centuries. The study scrutinises, who promoted cottage industries and what their cultural, social, and ideological backgrounds were, and how they influenced the construction of cottage industry policy. Research work builds on the microhistorical research angle making use of textual details in the 1949 committee report. Following the clue method, historical sources are analysed, including earlier committee reports, newspaper articles, meeting and exhibition documents, small publications, and personal archives. Through the notion of historical experience, special attention is paid to the continuity and recollection of the idea of cottage industry as it was expressed by the 1944 – 1949 committee members in the magazine Kotiteollisuus. The study found that cottage industry created a 19 th-century administrative and political concept that was applied in the first instance to manage critical situations caused by crop failures and other societal hardships. Especially {{in the aftermath of the}} WWII, cottage industry was essentially conceived of as a cultural political measure to balance the society facing large settlement and land acquisition projects by creating a sense of cultural continuity through the means of domestic craft practices. The historical idea of cottage industry and the respective sphere of administration summoned a remarkable cultural political factor that has strongly affected Finnish craft culture...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{people have}} long shown their varied artistic talents as painters, potters, sculptors, carvers and weavers. Whether for family use, for barter or for sale, the {{production}} of artifacts has generally been regarded as a 'spare time' activity. Could such craft activities be developed more widely to provide employment during periods of low agricultural activity in order to supplement rural incomes? Almost every country pro ducesa wide variety of craft products for sale, from mohair rugs in Lesotho and tapestries in Senegal to coconut palm woven products and seashell ornaments in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Beadwork, batiks, wood and stone carvings, and clay and metal sculptures are produced in almost every ACP country. Originally, many of these products were crafted by rural artisans employing traditional techniques passed down and refined over generations. But, having pioneered the market, rural craftsmen are being superseded by urban based production. Can the rural producers compete? As with most forms of production there are economies in larger scale output, and groups of artisans working together in an organized way benefit from centralized buying of raw materials, centralized design, artistic interaction and training within the group. Also, there are benefits {{in being able to}} offer market outlets a wide range and high volume of products. Many urban-based craft production groups have been assisted, and even initially managed, by international aid organizations. The emphasis has been on assisting disadvantaged people with poor employment prospects; as a result, many such projects have trained either the handicapped or unemployed women heads of households. Many such craft projects also sell a substantial proportion of their production to NGOs such as Oxfam Trading, Traidcraft Exchange, Caritas and Tearfund for marketing in Europe and the United States. Matching urban competition If rural craftsmen, artists and artisans are to compete successfully with urban producers they too have to form groups, work together and gain the benefits of volume purchase and sale. Those preferring to work as individuals have to develop niche markets for their products, which must be seen as offering originality in design and quality of work that is superior to the mass-produced articles and can therefore command higher prices. Craft products may be utilitarian or purely aesthetic, but in both cases it is the general attractiveness, originality of design, quality of work and final cost that determine what people will buy. Local talents and preferences should be given free expression to optimize all the talent available in the community. Young people, and those who have travelled outside the community, may be better able to develop designs in sympathy with current tastes. New designs and products should be tested for market acceptance before they are produced in volume. If craft work is to provide a meaningful source of employment in rural areas artists and artisans must work through agents or traders to reach sales outlets. Exceptionally, <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> workshops may be on tourist itineraries so that the ultimate purchaser comes direct to the producer. To capitalize on this advantage craftsmen must develop personal skills that help to sell their wares: attractive displays, personable and friendly attitudes and reasonable prices are essential. For tourists, seeing the artist at work is a further attraction. Roadside sale of woven baskets and furniture is a common sight in some rural areas and rural craftsmen can also keep costs down by selling direct to tourists in the environs of hotels. Organization Some <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> groups have exported their own products. An example is the Mbooni Women's Handicraft Project in Kenya, which was set up in 1985 with help from the UK-based Traidcraft Exchange, the Danish Volunteer Services and Kenya's Ministry of Social Services. The main product is sisal baskets (kiondos), which are made by the women at home or are woven 'on the move' as the women go about their daily work. The kiondos are sold in Nairobi and Mombasa with 50 % of production being exported through Scandinavian trading organizations and the relief agency Caritas. In Lesotho, the potential was realized for adding value locally to the country's major product, mohair. Women were organized to spin the wool and weave it into attractive and hard-wearing rugs, which found a ready market locally and are now exported to the UK and the US. Future possibilities Crafts which flourish in Asia, and which could be developed in some ACP countries, include silk weaving based on local sericulture and lace making. In Sri Lanka local initiative alone has resulted in thriving lace-making and batik groups, largely comprising fisherfolk women. Rural women's groups in Bangladesh have been assisted by the Bangladesh Government and UN World Food Programme both to plant mulberry trees for feeding silkworms and to harvest, spin and weave the silk produced. If governments wish to promote such rural enterprises for the benefits that they can bring in off-season employment, additional income and arresting urban migration, investment will be required in assessing market demands, providing training and facilitating access to credit. The realization by rural people that opportunities for craft production exist leads to recognition and development by them {{of a wide range of}} latent skills. Rural people have long shown their varied artistic talents as painters, potters, sculptors, carvers and weavers. Whether for family use, for barter or for sale, {{the production of}} artifacts has generally been regarded as a 'spare time' activity [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|As {{the number}} of craft breweries rise in Ontario, there becomes a need to explore how the breweries can harness the growing {{interest}} in craft beer and transform the attention into tourism dollars {{for themselves and their}} community. A number of researchers have noted the lack of research regarding the potential of beer tourism (Kraftchick, Byrd, Canziani, 2 ̆ 6 Harlow, 2014; Rogerson, 2014; Plummer, Telfer, Hashimoto, 2 ̆ 6 Summers, 2005; Murray and Kline, 2015). The proposed research will explore craft breweries acting as the catalyst for rural tourism development. Mitchell and Vanderwerf’s (2010) case study revealed that Creemore Spring’s Brewery was a catalyst for tourism development in the village of Creemore. Themes of partnerships, strategic alliances and neo-localism will be addressed. The purpose of this case study will be to explore the relationship between craft breweries and tourism in rural Ontario. For the sake of this study craft brewery tourism will be generally defined as “visitation to breweries, beer festivals and beer shows for which tasting and experiencing the attributes of beer region are the prime motivating factors for visitors. ” (Plummer, Telfer, Hashimoto, 2 ̆ 6 Summers, 2005, p. 449) The research objectives include identifying the extent to which craft breweries consider tourism benefits in their operating decisions, determining if efforts have been taken to promote tourism, assess the impacts of craft breweries on tourism destinations and provide recommendations to communities and craft breweries. The research will involve a survey distributed to {{all the members of the}} Ontario Craft Brewers, semi-structured interviews with brewery owners and semi-structured interviews with various tourism stakeholders from the community. Using the findings, <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> breweries would be able to compare their current tourism practices, if any, to the tourism practices of other breweries. Hospitality and tourism businesses in the regions can begin to reassess their relationships, if any, with the breweries. Kraftchick, J. F., Byrd, E. T., Canziani, B. and Harlow, N. J.
