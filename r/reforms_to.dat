By 1937, Speaker had opened a wholesale liquor business {{and worked as}} a state sales representative for a steel company. He chaired Cleveland's boxing commission between 1936 and 1943. Newspaper coverage credited Speaker with several key <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> boxing in Cleveland, including the recruitment of new officials and protections against fight fixing. Under Speaker, fight payouts went directly to boxers rather than managers.

Yarosz defeated Jimmy Reeves in ten rounds and the fight attracted over 8,300 spectators.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn's {{primary focus}} was on <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> the state's penal system.

Conditions in the penitentiary were poor and resulted in many illnesses. One fifth of the state's prisoners suffered from pneumonia in 1875. When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the mortality rate of the almost one thousand inmates in the state penitentiary was over 7 percent. Scurvy caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared conditions at the penitentiary to the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments.

5|$|Gomułka, in {{his public}} speeches, criticized {{the hardships of}} Stalinism and promised <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> democratize the country; this was {{received}} with much enthusiasm by Polish society. By mid-November, Gomułka had secured substantive gains in his negotiations with the Soviets: the cancellation of Poland's existing debts, new preferential trade terms, abandonment of the unpopular Soviet-imposed collectivization of Polish agriculture, and permission to liberalize policy towards the Roman Catholic Church. In December, the status of Soviet forces in Poland, the Northern Group of Forces, was finally regulated.|$|E

During Greenup's administration, the state chartered the Bank of Kentucky and the Ohio Canal Company; Greenup became {{a director of the}} former in 1807.

5|$|He {{was elected}} the 33rd {{governor}} of Oregon in 1986, serving a single term. He faced significant challenges, particularly a rising anti-tax movement (leading to Measure 5 in 1990) and {{a doubling of}} the state's prison population. He worked across party lines to reduce regulation and to repair the state's infrastructure. During his term, Oregon emerged from nearly eight years of recession. His <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> the State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF), a state-chartered worker's compensation insurance company were heralded at the time, but drew strong criticism in later years.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Nasser {{sought to}} firmly {{establish}} Egypt {{as the leader}} of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking. To achieve this, he initiated several <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam, and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party's {{election}} campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, {{there were significant}} <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats. From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, McCreery {{suggested}} <b>reforms</b> <b>to</b> the Order of Canada {{that would}} avert the awkwardness around appointing those in Canada's royal family as full {{members of the}} order: He theorized that the Queen, as the order's Sovereign, could simply appoint, on ministerial advice, anyone as an extra member, or the monarch could issue an ordinance allowing for her relations to be made regular members when approved. Similarly, McCreery proposed that a new division of the order could be established specifically for governors general, their spouses, {{and members of the}} Royal Family, a version of which was adopted in 2013.|$|E
