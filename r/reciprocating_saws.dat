50|$|A <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a type}} of saw {{in which}} the cutting action is {{achieved}} through a push-and-pull ("reciprocating") motion of the blade.|$|R
5000|$|All sawmills use rip saws {{of various}} types {{including}} the circular saw and band saw. Historically sawmills used one or more <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> more specifically known as an [...] "up-and-down" [...] or [...] "upright saw" [...] which are of two basic types, the frame saw or a muley (mulay) saw {{which is similar to}} the hand powered pit saw. Some sawmills also use crosscut saws to cut boards and planks to length.|$|E
50|$|While the show's crew {{get busy}} on {{rebuilding}} the contestants' shed frames, the contestants themselves {{are given a}} simple test, administered by Jill, {{to see if they}} can identify 11 different handyman tools. Among the tools were bevels, coping saws, files, pliers, <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws,</b> and screwdrivers. Although very little of the test was shown, Jeff was the worst out of the five contestants, having been able to identify three of the eleven tools.|$|E
50|$|A power hacksaw (or {{electric}} hacksaw) {{is a type}} of hacksaw that {{is powered}} either by its own electric motor or connected to a stationary engine. Most power hacksaws are stationary machines but some portable models do exist; the latter (with frames) have been displaced to some extent by <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> such as the Sawzall, which accept blades with hacksaw teeth. Stationary models usually have a mechanism to lift up the saw blade on the return stroke and some have a coolant pump to prevent the saw blade from overheating.|$|E
40|$|The Los Alamos LSDDP {{demonstrated}} a Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear to remove legs from plutonium glove boxes. The baseline technology used at LANL for removal of glove box legs is a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw.</b> Legs on glove boxes are typically either 3 -inch diameter pipe or unistrut. During the demonstration, the Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear cut eight pipe legs in 15 minutes, while the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> took 45 - 60 minutes {{to cut through}} eight legs, including a rest break to alleviate worker fatigue. Despite its lower production rate, the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> may be favored in confined spaces, {{because it does not}} require as much access room as the hydraulic shears. Based on the faster production rate of the hydraulic shear, LANL and Rocky Flats are expected to begin using the hydraulic shear as their new baseline technology to remove legs from over 1, 500 plutonium glove boxes at the two sites...|$|R

50|$|By 1887 Elgin had general stores, a livery, a hotel, and a church, {{as well as}} {{a nearby}} sawmill, which {{continues}} as a more modern Boise Cascade mill. Between 1887 and 1908, the area around Elgin had 35 sawmills, most transportable water-driven whipsaws (vertical <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws).</b> Local landowners would sell the trees for 50 centers per thousand board feet, which is about how much the sawmills could handle in a day. Log transportation cost about two dollars per thousand board feet, and a mill could sell the processed lumber for $6-10 per thousand board feet.|$|E
50|$|Wire saws {{are similar}} in {{principle}} to band saws or <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws,</b> but they use abrasion to cut rather than saw teeth. Depending on the application, diamond material {{may or may not}} be used as an abrasive. The wire can have one strand or many strands braided together (cable). A single-strand saw can be roughened to be abrasive, abrasive compounds can be bonded to the cable, or diamond-impregnated beads (and spacers) can be threaded on the cable. Wire saws are often cooled and lubricated by water or oil.|$|E
5000|$|All dentofacial osteotomies are {{performed}} under general anesthesia, causing total unconsciousness. General anesthesia allows surgeons to perform dentofacial osteotomies effectively without involuntary muscle movement or complaints about minor pain. Prior to any Osteotomy, third molars (wisdom teeth) are extracted {{to reduce the}} chance of infection.Dentofacial osteotomy is usually performed using oscillating and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws,</b> burs, and manual chisels. <b>Reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> are straight and are used for making straight bone cuts. Oscillating saws are angled, to different degrees, {{in order to make}} deep curved cuts for certain osteotomies like mandible angle reduction. The recent advent of piezoelectric saws has simplified bone cutting, but such equipment has not yet become the norm outside of the most developed countries.The surgery might involve one jaw or both jaws cuncurrently. The modification is done by making cuts in the bones of the mandible and/or maxilla, and repositioning the cut pieces in the desired alignment. This surgery is usually performed with the use of general anaesthetic and a nasal tube for intubation. The nasal tube enables the teeth to be wired together during surgery. The surgery usually does not involve cutting the skin. Instead, the surgeon is often able to go through the interior of the mouth.Cutting one bone is known as an osteotomy, while performing the surgery on both jaws simultaneously is known as a bi-maxillary osteotomy (cutting the bone of both jaws) or a maxillomandibular advancement.|$|E

50|$|After the {{competition}} the interfering tube was cut {{out with a}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> and a diagonal tube was welded in so that the chain did not interfere. This setup lasted many drive days until eventually causing a crack {{in one of the}} original chassis tubes.|$|R

Involves straight <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> blade and slight rotation of ingot between cutting strokes. Many parallel blades combined to cut many wafers simultaneously from ingot...|$|R
50|$|Designs range {{widely in}} power, speed, and features, from less {{powerful}} portable, handheld models {{that are usually}} shaped like a cordless drill, to high-power, high-speed, corded models designed for heavy construction and demolition work. Modern <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> almost all have variable speed, either through trigger sensitivity or through a dial. Another feature that has become important to the way these saws are used is the inclusion of an orbital action. This action consists of oscillating the traversed reciprocation in up and down fashion (perpendicular to the motion of cut) causing {{the tip of the}} blade to move in an oval pattern, up and down as well as back and forth. This feature is primarily for wood, allowing quick cuts.|$|E
5000|$|Blades for {{bandsaws}} and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> {{are often}} made with bimetal construction. The teeth, made of high speed steel, are bonded (by various methods, for example, electron beam welding or laser beam welding) to the high-strength carbon steel base. Such construction makes for blades {{with a better}} combination of cutting speed and durability than shown by non-bimetal blades, because {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each of the metals are applied in the best locations: the teeth are harder (and thus cut better), but therefore also brittler; meanwhile, the body area of the band is softer (which would make for poorer teeth), but also less brittle, and thus more resistant to cracking and breaking (which is desirable in the body area).|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} a few ways to lower the {{severity}} and risk of damage from HAVS without complete engineering redesign on the operation of the tools. A few examples could be increasing the dampening through thicker gloves and increasing the trigger size of the tool to decrease the stress concentration of the vibrations on the contact area, but the best course of action would be to buy safer tools that vibrate less. These Exposure Action Values and Exposure Limit Values seem rather low, when compared to lab tested data, shown by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Power Tools Database. Just an example out of the database, the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> look to have extremely violent vibrations with one of the saws vibrations reaching 50 m/s2 in one hand and over 35 m/s2 in the other.|$|E
50|$|A dragsaw is {{an early}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> using a 1.8 m (6-foot) steel {{crosscut}} saw to buck logs to length. Prior to the popularization of the chainsaw during World War II, the dragsaw was a popular means of taking the hard work out of cutting wood.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} confirm the IOF, orbitozygomatic {{osteotomy}} is essential. After the periorbit is elevated from the outer or lower wall of the orbit, {{the tip of the}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> is positioned in the outermost part of the IOF from {{the lower part of the}} orbit. Osteotomy should be performed along the malar eminence. A beveled or V-shaped bone cut is performed using a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> to increase the exposure and return the bone to its original position after the operation. If the tumor mass does not involve the temporal bone or the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), this level of osteotomy is sufficient for exposure to the infratemporal skull base. However, if removal of the petrous portion of the ICA is required, the glenoid fossa should be removed together with osteotomized bony segments, and temporal craniotomy may be performed to expose the glenoid fossa. TMJ capsule can be freed from the fossa and lowered for full exposure, but the capsule and meniscus should be preserved if possible. If additional exposure is required, the condyle can be removed from the sigmoid notch. A V-shaped bone cut can be performed using a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> to remove the outer two thirds of the glenoid fossa. By thus removing the glenoid fossa, the ICA inside the glenoid fossa can be protected.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> or [...] "sabre saw" [...] (UK and Australia): a {{saw with}} an [...] "in-and-out" [...] or [...] "up-and-down" [...] action {{similar to a}} jigsaw, but larger and more powerful, and using a longer stroke with the blade {{parallel}} to the barrel. Hand-held versions, sometimes powered by compressed air, are for demolition work or for cutting pipe.|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} examined {{the features that}} may differentiate cuts made in bone by mechanical and hand-powered saws, specifically investigating the characteristics of commercially available <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws.</b> The partial limbs of adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were used {{as a proxy for}} human remains, and were cut using five commercially available reciprocating saw blades and a hand-powered hacksaw. The reciprocating blades tested ranged from five teeth-per-inch to 14 / 18 teeth-per-inch and included raker, alternating, and wavy tooth sets. The hacksaw blade had 32 teeth-per-inch, with wavy set teeth. All the blades examined were intended to cut wood, metal, or both materials. The resulting false start kerfs and complete kerfs on the remains were then examined macroscopically and microscopically. The present study utilized both qualitative and quantitative analysis to examine kerf features that characterize <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws.</b> The presentation of specific features within the kerf varied based upon blade properties, how the implement was powered, and how it was wielded in reference to the material. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrated that significant differences do exist between reciprocating saw blades. Kerf characteristics in which significant differences were noted include: kerf false start (cross section) shape, frequency of cut surface drift, presence of harmonics, striation regularity, and exit chipping size. Inter-blade differences generally reflect class characteristics previously established for hand-powered blades, though reciprocating blades do not strictly follow these categorizations (Symes 1992; Symes et al. 1998, 2010). Identification of inter-blade differences allows the limited identification of sub-classes within <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> based on the above characteristics, though blades cannot be uniquely identified. Additionally, interior exit chipping was noted, which has not been mentioned in previous sharp force trauma research. Ultimately, this research has applications for sharp force trauma analysis and further aids in the identification of reciprocating saw use in a forensic context, including dismemberments...|$|E
40|$|In the {{handling}} of bulk metals, it is common practice to use a sawing machine, such as a bandsaw or power hacksaw to reduce the workpiece to a manageable size for downstream processing. Recently, stationary power hacksaws have been replaced with more versatile portable electric <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws.</b> These machines differ from bandsaws and power hacksaws {{in that they are}} portable, light-weight, and saw by rapidly reciprocating a blade over a short stroke length. In industrial applications, the speed of metal sawing is an important economic factor. The mechanics of metal sawing with traditional machines have been described in the literature, but virtually no research has been published on the mechanics of reciprocating sawing. Research was undertaken to describe metal sawing with <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> by the application of metal cutting mechanics. Cutting rates of metals with a reciprocating saw are dependent upon several process parameters, such as the applied pressure on the saw, the reciprocating speed of the saw blade, and the geometry of the cutting edges. An analytical model was developed to predict the cutting rate of metals with a reciprocating saw. Particular attention was placed on the sawing rates of steel due to their broad commercial usage. The analytical model for reciprocating sawing rates was compared to empirical studies of important process parameters. A wear model for the cutting edges of saw blade teeth was also derived. Using a Design of Experiments technique, a test matrix was developed to determine the significance of applied thrust force and reciprocating speed on cutting rates of steel. Results of analytical predictions from the newly developed sawing model and empirical data compared reasonably well...|$|E
40|$|Power-tool {{vibrations}} {{can cause}} a variety of health disorders, ranging from inconsequential to disastrous. These vibrations may not be harmful when received in small doses but can cause vasospastic disorders, such as vibration-induced white finger disease (VWF), with frequent use or accumulated over time. Existing occupational guidance does not adequately describe the health risks associated with power-tool vibrations. In the current study, vibration levels for major brands of <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> and impact drivers were measured under typical use conditions, along with user comfort levels after different usage times. Results are provided in terms of acceleration and comfort levels {{as a function of}} usage time, varied grip-force conditions, and with or without use of gloves. Based on the VWF-incidence data from prior occupational studies, guidance on restrictions on usage of power tools is provided. It is found that existing ISO guidance for Europe overestimates allowable times, compared to those determined here...|$|E
50|$|A rotary <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a type}} of {{saw that}} spins a cutting {{implement}} around a rotary axis, instead of thrusting it along a linear axis. The first use of such devices was in medicine, where cutting through bone warranted the need for a saw with minimal stroke length, and a cutting action that could be implemented through depth cut rather than a follow through cut.|$|R
