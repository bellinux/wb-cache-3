Lotus driver Mario Andretti said [...] "It is like a bloody great vacuum cleaner. It throws muck and rubbish at you at a hell of a rate". Murray says that this was untrue: [...] "The fan couldn't spit anything out the back because the fan e-flux [...] was only 55mph.

They qualified second and third behind championship leader Andretti. In the race, Watson spun off on the 19th lap. Once a back-marker dropped oil onto the track and with both major front-runners out the race, the remaining Brabham was in a class of its own, seemingly unaffected by the slippery surface. Lauda passed Andretti around the outside of one of the corners, who dropped out shortly afterwards due to a broken valve, and went on to win by over half a minute from Riccardo Patrese in an Arrows.|$|E

However, the head was rotated by 180° compared with the motorcycle engine. The twin-bearing crankshaft was also different in the Isetta power unit, being larger and featuring reinforced bearings. One of the reasons for this was the heavy Dynastart unit which combined the dynamo and self-starter. The fuel mixture was provided by a Bing sliding throttle side draft motorcycle carburetor.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} {{optimizing}} {{the design of}} <b>radial</b> <b>fan</b> impeller using finite element analysis. Most manufacturing concerns spend more than a 60 % of their money for materials. The design of turbo machinery has been practiced {{in the last half}} of the previous century with increasing degree of sophistication. This trend of development is not complete because design of any turbo machine is interdisciplinary process involving aerodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, stress analysis, vibration analysis, the selection of materials, and the requirements for manufacturing. So, products have not reached a level of full maturity. Today there is considerable room for further development of most turbo machinery products when looked at with the perspective of the broadest possible design world and when it comes to development at the design stage then various types of analysis of every component are performed on computer before the first prototype is built. Among these the major one end the most frequently used in the manufacturing of any mechanical part is stress analysis. As the mass of the fan is directly related to the thickness of the impeller parts hence our objective in this project is to minimize the thickness, keeping in consideration the operating restrictions and design parameters. This work concentrates on to generate the finite element model of backward curved aerofoil <b>radial</b> <b>fan</b> impeller which behaves mathematically like structure model & carry out stress analysis using ANSYS software. The analysis was carried out using the default thickness of the impeller of the <b>radial</b> <b>fan.</b> This results in massive weight of the fan, leading to large vibrations and one of the reasons to failure. Ways were found out to reduce all these things, so the analysis was carried using various reduced thicknesses of the impeller and the optimum thickness of the impeller parts found for the safe stress and strain limits. This value analysis/Engineering results in material reduction, cost reduction with reduced vibrations for the desired design and operating conditions.

40|$|Space {{constraints}} in many emerging {{electronic systems}} {{mean that there}} is a growing demand for heat sinks which are low in profile. As a result, small, low profile fans are necessary. In many instances <b>Radial</b> flow <b>fans</b> are best suited. An understanding of the design and performance of these fans is therefore necessary. For <b>radial</b> flow <b>fans</b> little work has been done to quantify the deviation of aerodynamic performance from that predicted by conventional fan laws. This paper aims to address this situation, by performing measurements of pressure rise, flow rate and power consumption for 3. 5 mm high <b>radial</b> flow <b>fan</b> rotors ranging in diameter from 20 to 35 mm over a range of speeds. Measurements presented show variations of pressure rise and flow rate with Reynolds number to be largely in accordance with trends predicted by high Reynolds number theory, with the exception of flow rates at the lower range of Reynolds numbers which fell below the predicted values. Variations in power consumption show a similar trend to those of flow rate, with power consumption obeying the fan laws for the higher Reynolds numbers investigated, but showing a large increase at the lower Reynolds numbers.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a miniaturized frictionless fan concept, {{which is similar}} to a piezo-electric driven fan principle and that can fits into a size of a matchbox. This type of fan has been employed for the enhancement of heat transfer by increasing the fluid circulation in regions which are otherwise stagnant. The introduced fan is based on a flexible blade whose vibration is driven by means of a magnetic field. As opposed to the piezo-electric fan, the blade material can be based on a polymer or steel blade. A static mechanical FE-analysis has shown good potential for a reliable, frictionless (i. e. highly reliable) fan compared to the piezo-electric one or to small axial or <b>radial</b> <b>fans.</b> A flow rate of similar to 11 l/min could be reached.

40|$|The {{significance}} {{of the number of}} vector maps recorded on time-averaged statistics is analysed using Particle Image Velocimetry for a practical application of a <b>radial</b> <b>fan</b> flow. This type of flow has been shown to produce large gradients in both velocity and turbulence intensity, therefore rendering a single-point statistical analysis of the error in time-averaged data unsuitable. First and second order statistics for the entire region of interest have been assessed by varying sample sizes and monitoring the influence on velocity magnitude, turbulence intensities and Reynolds shear stress. Theoretical standard error estimates and an empirical bootstrapping technique have been implemented for determining high confidence levels in the accuracy of the time-averaged quantities. The results illustrate the complex turbulent and fluctuating flows produced by rotating fans, highlighting the requirement to predict sufficient sample numbers during experimentation. In the example presented, and for many practical scenarios where fluctuating flow exists, a trade-off between sample size and accuracy may be necessary using this measurement technique. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|This study sedimentologically, stratigraphically, and diagenetically {{analyzed}} {{strata of}} the upper member of the Lower Cretaceous Yucca Formation in the Indio Mountains, West Texas {{in order to develop}} an outcrop-based analog model for similar facies that form major hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Pre-salt rift basins of the South Atlantic margin. The lower Cretaceous strata of the Indio Mountains were deposited in rift basins that formed along the eastern margin of the Chihuahua Trough under similar greenhouse climate conditions as the South Atlantic basins. ^ Eleven lithofacies are recognized from the upper member of the Yucca Formation {{to the base of the}} overlying Bluff Mesa Formation. The lithofacies are: 1) siliciclastic channelized sandstone and conglomeratic sandstone, 2) carbonate-clast channelized conglomerate, 3) polymict-clast channelized conglomerate, 4) burrowed fine-grained sandstone containing localized lenses of thrombolite, 5) fine-grained sandstone containing carbonate septarian concretions, 6) calcite <b>radial</b> <b>fans,</b> 7) stromatolitic bindstone, 8) dolomudstone, 9) sandy oyster-rich packstone, 10) lime mudstone and 11) fossiliferous packstone. These eleven lithofacies were further grouped into four depositional facies associations: 1) fluvial channel, 2) lacustrine littoral, 3) marginal marine and 4) normal marine open shelf. ^ The upper member of the Yucca Formation comprises eleven cycles of interstratified lacustrine and fluvial facies associations. Cycles consist of an upward shallowing and coarsening lithofacies progression from 1) lacustrine fine-grained sandstone containing localized thrombolite lenses; to 2) lacustrine massive fine-grained sandstone containing irregular carbonate septarian concretions and localized calcite radial fans; to 3) lacustrine stromatolitic bindstone; to 4) lacustrine dolomudstone, capped by 5) fluvial channel facies with a basal lag commonly containing clasts of the underlying lacustrine facies including stromatolite, carbonate concretions, lime mudstone and lithic clasts of sandstone or siltstone. Not all facies are present in every cycle and the spatial and temporal variations of lithofacies within cycles are attributed to the interplay between rift tectonics and climate. The cyclic repetition of lacustrine to fluvial depositional systems is attributed to climate shifts from semi-humid to semi-arid where increased surface runoff during more humid conditions formed lakes. With increased aridity the lakes dried up and rivers developed across the basin. Cycles display a long-term trend of increase in average thickness and increase in dominance of lacustrine facies within a cycle. This trend is related in this study to long-term climate change to more humid/higher rainfall climatic conditions. ^ In the Echo Canyon area of the Indio Mountains a series of normal fault-bounded uplifts and basins with minor syndepositional offset on faults of a few meters were identified. The subtle differences in bathymetry/topography generated by the faults significantly influenced lacustrine facies distribution. The stromatolitic bindstone and dolomudstone developed preferentially on syndepositional horst blocks, whereas the lacustrine fine-grained sandstone with calcite <b>radial</b> <b>fans</b> are only present within down-dropped grabens directly adjacent to faults. The faults acted as conduits for Ca-saturated waters that degassed upon reaching the surfaces along seeps resulting in calcite precipitation on the lake floor. No syndepositional faults were recognized in the Squaw Canyon area. ^ Diagenetic alterations and paragenetic sequence are similar in the same facies between the Echo and Squaw canyons. Mineral replacements including dolomitization and silicification were identified in all lithofacies except for thrombolite and calcite <b>radial</b> <b>fans.</b> Furthermore porosity in all lithofacies (1 – 2 %) was reduced by cementation and replacement and was slightly improved by dissolution channels that formed in a relatively deep burial diagenetic environment. The only evident spatial variation regarding diagenetic features in the area was the localized presence of hydrothermally-derived saddle dolomites that are spatially associated with a Tertiary igneous dike in Squaw Canyon and normal faults in Echo Canyon. ^ Stratigraphic cyclicity within the upper member of the Yucca Formation in the study area was dominantly controlled by climate fluctuation, whereas syndepositional faulting played an important role controlling local facies type within lacustrine facies association and lateral facies distribution. ...|$|R
