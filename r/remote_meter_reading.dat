This is especially important on remote locations with no other communication means available. Besides the traditional voice communication, the new digital PMR systems also support various modes of data communication including the IP protocol. This offers new possibilities for remote data applications.

This paper presents a real-time <b>remote</b> circular <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> system, which is equipped on our CfMR platform (Cruising and Inspecting Mobile Robot) for a transformer station environment. The tasks of malfunction detection and daily monitoring are carried out by a mobile robot, which cruises along a dynamically planned route and carries an onboard camera to capture Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) images and <b>read</b> <b>meters</b> in the transformer environment. With the wireless communication, the control center makes global planning for, and collects the feedback from, the inspecting robot. Due to a localizing error in navigation, the robot needs to detect the geometric shape, specifically circles or ellipses, of the designated meter in a large search space. This challenges on most existing circle/ellipse detection algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a constraint on continuity of the contour to divide the circle/ellipse detection into some smaller sub-problems which can efficiently deal with multiple circles/ellipses. Moreover, we use the historical scene information as heuristic information to guide the searching procedure.
