The project is scheduled to conclude in 2012. The development objective of the Catastrophe Development Policy Loan Deferred Draw Down Option Project for Guatemala is to enhance the Government's capacity to implement its disaster risk management program for natural disasters. This objective will be achieved by supporting policy and institutional reform in the following aspects of disaster risk management: i) improving <b>risk</b> <b>identification</b> and monitoring; ii) increasing disaster risk reduction investments; iii) strengthening institutions and planning capacity for risk management; and iv) developing risk financing strategies.|$|E
2500|$|Olanzapine {{has been}} {{considered}} {{as part of an}} early psychosis approach for schizophrenia. [...] The Prevention through <b>Risk</b> <b>Identification,</b> Management, and Education (PRIME) study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and Eli Lilly, tested the hypothesis that olanzapine might prevent the onset of psychosis in people at very high risk for schizophrenia. The study examined 60 patients with prodromal schizophrenia, who were at an estimated risk of 36–54% of developing schizophrenia within a year, and treated half with olanzapine and half with placebo. In this study, patients receiving olanzapine did not have a significantly lower risk of progressing to psychosis. Olanzapine was effective for treating the prodromal symptoms, but was associated with significant weight gain.|$|E

The authors have created classification of the trade services technological process risks and have carried out {{a survey of the}} most important risk factors in the stages of the trade services technological process. Also, the authors have created the trade services technological process risks matrix. The risks matrixis a quantitative assessment of risks. Risks have been arranged by their size of possible losses. The experts’ method for economic risks assessment has been used and a model of enterprises’ <b>risks</b> <b>identification,</b> classification and assessment for the trade services sector of Latvia has been made. The authors have used their own created model of enterprises’ <b>risks</b> <b>identification,</b> classification and assessment to research economic and financial risks by their effect on Latvian trade services sector enterprises’ development.
