30|$|From the {{perspective}} of cloud market mechanism we imagine that if a cloud broker represents a cloud provider, then the cloud broker may provide information which favors that cloud provider; however, if a broker is independent, and its business depends on the trust <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>users,</b> the broker is more motivated to find and provide information being truly helpful for cloud users. This situation may occur when a cloud broker serves as a gateway for {{a large number of}} cloud users in the cloud market. Consistent with the above view, we further imagine that if a cloud broker is highly trusted by some cloud users (especially, end cloud users), the broker may become those cloud users’ trust anchor, taking care of trust management for those cloud users.|$|E

It begins by classifying services and companies, revealing their diversity, followed by an analysis of survey data obtained from these companies regarding the employment they offer and their staff selection procedures. The results show a predominance of temporary employment, frequently related to a specific project, at the level of a technician with a generic profile but having aptitude within the category of documentalist. As for the type of professional sought, these enterprises value most highly attitudes, experience and competencies. Among this last category, the most highly considered are those related to information technologies, information organisation and storage, and <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>users</b> and customers.

It is {{acknowledged}} {{by both the}} Materials and Design community and the Human– Computer Interaction community, which recently are merging their interests into the engagement of users with physical matter, through the experiential qualities of materials. Taking into consideration the fundamental role of materiality {{in the definition of}} the product experience, the concept of Materials Experience emerged. Nevertheless, since it is restricted to a human–centered view, the framework of Materials Experience does not contemplate the relations between non–human subjects, i. e. the interaction between the materials and other artifacts, substances, organisms, and environments. The concept of material agency in non–human relations might offer a new perspective to Materials Experience. Recently, materials {{with a high degree of}} interactivity are emerging, showing unusual properties and establishing unique <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>users,</b> designers, artifacts, environments.

The article concentrates upon three inter-related areas as part of a more general critique: first, reliability of services; second, relations with stakeholders; and finally, the identity of employees. Despite differences across sectors and some largely collateral benefits it is proposed that fragmentation has promoted inconsistent and unreliable services, the development of superficial <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>users</b> and carers and the loss of belonging and fractured identities of social care employees. Fragmentation regularly spoils professional identities and generates uncertainty amidst attempts to provide effective or reliable services.

Framing this exploration with a concept of cultural justice, it considers the still uncertain place of popular music as a subject of heritage and preservation, assessing the parameters of what counts as an archive and issues of democratization. It offers {{a discussion of the}} archival and affective turns in the humanities as a means of framing the politics of practice focused on popular music culture. The paper offers empirical evidence of the relational qualities of the popular music archive considered in affective terms. Discussion draws first on evidence from the vernacular practices of communities in what Baker and Collins describe as ‘do-it-yourself’ archives and secondly from ‘authorized’ collections in established archival institutions (Baker and Collins, “Sustaining Popular Music’s Material Culture,” 3). The paper explores the motivations of popular music archivists and how they articulate the affective dimensions of their work, and how their work qualifies personal and collective commitments and expressions of value and indeed, <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>users.</b> In conclusion, affect is identified as pertinent to wider issues in the relations of archive, archivist and user and the possibilities of historical practice.

As a result, the individual develops negative attitudes, conduct and feelings that entail problems associated with physical and emotional exhaustion in the work environment (Maslach and Jackson, 1981). Mainly diagnosed in professions that demand direct contact with its users and constant interpersonal relations, such as education, health and security, burnout is a psychological syndrome in response to chronic stressors that intervene in interpersonal relations at work (Maslach, Schaufeli and Leiter, 2001). With its multidimensional nature, professional exhaustion involves three basic components: 1) emotional exhaustion, with feelings of extreme fatigue and perception of an inability to “give of oneself ” in terms of affection; 2) depersonalization, with the development of cynical attitudes and negative feelings; 3) dissatisfaction with one’s professional achievements, with the tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, especially in <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>users</b> or clients, with feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction with one’s achievements at work (Maslach and Jackson, 1981). In the context of sports, burnout must be defined according to the athletes ’ performance, which is the fundamental element for these professionals (Hill and Appleton, 2001; Raedeke, 1997).

Based on a survey of 216 business users of mobile technology, we found statistical evidence for a positive association of task difficulty with various functional and non-functional requirements, as well as for a positive association of fit and overall technology evaluation. In addition, our data suggests the relation between fit and overall evaluation to be asymmetric and non-linear, very similar to a typical convex consumption function. While user mobility did not play an immediate statistically significant role, we found indications of an indirect association: The non-functional characteristic of portability that described the availability of the technology in various mobile use situations turned out to be the most important factor to explain and predict technology requirements and overall evaluation in the current research study. ...|$|R

In order to give the capability to a virtual agent to reason on its social <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> a <b>user,</b> we propose a BDI formalization of social relations. Based on psychological theories, we characterize social relation over three dimensions, namely dominance, liking and familiarity. Liking (of the agent toward a user) is defined as a like-mindedness be-tween the agent and a user in terms preferences. The degree of liking can be computed from the number of shared preferences and their related importance for the agent. The agent’s dominance is defined as its power on the other’s intentions achievement. The level of dominance depends also on the other’s power. Finally, the agent’s familiarity is defined by the value of intimacy <b>with</b> a <b>user</b> and relies on the quantity of knowledge about a user’s beliefs and intentions. Based on the formal representa-tion of social relation, the virtual agent may reason about the different strategies to adopt to deal <b>with</b> its <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> another agent (virtual or real) ...|$|R

Traditional product design research methods entailing field work and user-centered design are supplemented with Human-Computer Interaction theories such as Activity Theory, and frameworks borrowed from the interdisciplinary study of extended cognition. A softening of the boundary of the individual is an umbrella idea connecting these various frameworks. Humans are seen as adaptive and plastic systems adopting tools and technologies as cognitive enhancements. The work surface design for seamstresses that is arrived at is evaluated in terms of its potential as a cognitive enhancement.
