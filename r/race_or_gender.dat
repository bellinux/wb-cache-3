5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender.</b> His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of a}} {{proposed}} Equality Bill, Harman announced a consultation on changing the existing discrimination laws, including options for reverse discrimination in employment. Under the proposals, employers would be legally allowed to discriminate in favour of a job candidate {{on the basis of}} their <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender</b> where the candidates were otherwise equally qualified. Employers would not be required to use these powers, but would be able to do so without the threat of legal action for discriminatory practices. The white paper also proposed measures to end age discrimination, promote transparency in organisations and introduce a new equality duty on the public sector.|$|E

25|$|Lilly Ledbetter sued Goodyear {{claiming}} she {{was paid}} less than men {{doing the same}} work. She won the suit and was awarded $360,000, the jury deciding that Goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. In Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. ___ (2007), Justice Alito held for the five-justice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender</b> pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer 180 days ago or more. The United States Congress overturned this decision by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 {{which was the first}} bill signed into law by President Obama.|$|E

Among current Georgia Tech students, only upperclassmen (junior and senior undergraduates) are eligible for regular membership. Honorary memberships for faculty members and distinguished alumni are also available. The society apparently selects members based on [...] "leadership ability, personal achievement, strong character, and love for Georgia Tech". Membership is unrestricted by <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender,</b> and academic achievement is not considered in the selection criteria. The society admitted its first female member, Carol A.

5000|$|Second-wave feminism, {{particularly}} at its outset, was similarly shaped by middle-class, educated white women, and again did not tend to consider issues relevant specifically to women of colour. For example, though Betty Friedan helped begin {{the second wave}} of feminism in the United States by writing about [...] "the problem that has no name", she primarily spoke of unity among women who gave up their careers to become housewives, and did not consider women of other <b>races</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender</b> divides.|$|R

500|$|Symbolic interaction; often {{associated}} with Interactionism, Phenomenological sociology, Dramaturgy, Interpretivism, is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through micro-analysis. This tradition emerged in the Chicago School of the 1920s and 1930s, which prior to World War II [...] "had been the center of sociological research and graduate study". The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society {{as the product of}} the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings. Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender</b> (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation. Some important sociologists associated with this approach include Max Weber, George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, George Homans and Peter Blau. It is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of Ethnomethodology emerges from the work of Harold Garfinkel.|$|E
2500|$|Supporters of Proposition 209 {{contended that}} {{existing}} {{affirmative action programs}} led public employers and universities to reject applicants based on their race, and that Proposition 209 would [...] "restore and reconfirm the historic intention of the 1964 Civil Rights Act." [...] The basic and simple premise of Proposition 209 is that every individual has a right, and that right {{is not to be}} discriminated against, or granted a preference, based on their <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender.</b> [...] Since the number of available positions are limited, discriminating against or giving unearned preference to a person based solely, or even partially on <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender</b> deprives qualified applicants of all races an equal opportunity to succeed. It also pits one group against another and perpetuates social tension.|$|E
2500|$|The Seventh Amendment (1791) {{extends the}} right to a jury trial to federal civil cases, and {{inhibits}} courts from overturning a jury's findings of fact. Although the Seventh Amendment itself says that it is limited to [...] "suits at common law", meaning cases that triggered {{the right to}} a jury under English law, the amendment has been found to apply in lawsuits that are similar to the old common law cases. For example, {{the right to a}} jury trial applies to cases brought under federal statutes that prohibit <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender</b> discrimination in housing or employment. Importantly, this amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial only in federal court, not in state court.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{proponents of}} the law intend it to address cases where gay, lesbian, bisexual, and {{transgender}} employees have been discriminated against by their employers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Currently, these employees are unable to find protection in the courts because sexual orientation is {{not considered to be}} a suspect class by the federal courts and by many U.S. states. Proponents argue that such a law is appropriate in light of the United States Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process to all. Advocates argue that homosexuality is not a [...] "choice" [...] but a personal identity, a claim supported by the American Psychology Association (APA), and that all working {{people have a right to}} be judged by the quality of their work performance and not by completely unrelated factors. According to a study published in 2001 by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation are roughly equal to those on <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender.</b> The APA also states that there is significant discrimination against homosexuals in the workforce.|$|E
2500|$|The Black feminist {{movement}} {{was formed in}} response to the needs of women who were racially underrepresented by the Women's Movement and sexually oppressed by the Black Liberation Movement. Black feminist scholars assert that African-American women are doubly disadvantaged in the social, economic, and political sphere, because they face {{discrimination on the basis of}} both race and gender. Black women felt that their needs were being ignored by both movements and they struggled to identify with either based on <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender.</b> African-American women who use the term Black feminism attach a variety of interpretations to it. One such interpretation is that Black feminism addresses the needs of African-American women that the Feminism Movement largely ignores. Feminism, as Black feminist theorist Pearl Cleage defines it, is [...] "the belief that women are full human beings capable of participation and leadership in the full range of human activities—intellectual, political, social, sexual, spiritual, and economic". With this definition, the feminist agenda can be said to encompass different issues ranging from political rights to educational opportunities within a global context. The Black feminist agenda seeks to streamline these issues and focuses on those that are the most applicable to African-American women.|$|E
2500|$|Hip hop {{culture has}} spread to both urban and {{suburban}} communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. [...] Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats and basslines from old records [...] to the art form means {{that much of the}} culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called [...] "flipping" [...] in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, and disco {{to become one of the}} most practiced genres worldwide. It is the language of urban environments and the youth around the world, many who do not know what Hip Hop (the consciousness which makes up the collective culture of Hip Hop) is or what it means to [...] "Be Hip Hop" [...] , have recently begun to attribute being Hip Hop with being black, however that is race , not culture and not consciousness. as KRS-One says [...] "Hip Hop is the only place where you see Martin Luther King Jr. s; 'I have a dream speech' in real life" [...] and [...] "To be Hip Hop you have to have the courage to be you and be Hip Hop all the time not just when it's popular or convenient, and have repped it when it wasn't and you were the only one repping it." [...] He also notes that Hip Hop is beyond something as simple minded as <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>gender</b> or nationality, it belongs to the world.|$|E
