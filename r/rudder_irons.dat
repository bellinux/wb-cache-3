60|$|At length our sloop returned; {{having found}} another island {{where there was}} a very good harbour, we ran in, and came to an anchor. We {{immediately}} unbent all our sails, sent them ashore upon the island, and set up seven or eight tents with them; then we unrigged our top-masts, and cut them down, hoisted all our guns out, our provisions and loading, and put them ashore in the tents. With the guns we made two small batteries, for fear of a surprise, and kept a look-out upon the hill. When we were all ready, we laid the ship aground upon a hard sand, {{the upper end of the}} harbour, and shored her up on each side. At low water she lay almost dry, so we mended her bottom, and stopped the leak, which was occasioned by straining some of the <b>rudder</b> <b>irons</b> with the shock which the ship had against the rock.|$|E
60|$|How many {{thoughts}} {{came into}} my brain as I ran along that river road! If that wretched boarder had not taken the <b>rudder</b> for an <b>ironing</b> table he might have steered in shore! Again and again I confounded--as far as mental ejaculations could do it--his suggestions.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, the 28 ft cutter Sylvia was wrecked in Port Lincoln harbour on {{returning}} from a picnic on Grantham Island. The steamer Iron Monarch was going astern from the jetty when the cutter passed behind it to inspect the vessel. Sylvia was sucked into Iron Monarchs propeller and sank immediately. Two men clung to the <b>rudder</b> of <b>Iron</b> Monarchs propeller while is turned, while the other four aboard climbed into a dinghy which had been towed behind the cutter. The six occupants of the cutter all survived.|$|R
2500|$|None of {{the boats}} used on the canal has survived completely, but a wrought <b>iron</b> <b>rudder</b> found in the tunnel in 1976 is on display at Morwellham Quay Museum and recent archaeological survey work has found more wrought iron plates within the canal tunnel. A report from 1888 {{describes}} the boats as being [...] in length, [...] in width, and made of rivetted iron, while an earlier description from 1826 gives the width as [...] wide by [...] deep.|$|R
25|$|Like the old Wäinämöinen, Jääkarhu had a heeling {{system with}} two pumps capable of {{transferring}} 650 tons of ballast water per hour between side tanks, heeling the vessel {{up to five}} degrees in ten minutes. In addition, she had six centrifugal pumps for moving 100 tons of water in five minutes between the fore and aft peak tanks to adjust her trim and release the icebreaker from compressive ice. For escort operations she had a towing winch and a stern notch that was considerably larger than in the older icebreakers. Her single piece cast <b>iron</b> <b>rudder</b> weighed 9 tons.|$|R
50|$|Great Eastern sailed from Liverpool on Tuesday 10 September 1861, {{commanded}} by Captain James Walker. On her second day out the wind increased to gale force, causing {{the ship to}} roll heavily. The port paddle wheel was completely lost, and the starboard paddle wheel smashed to pieces {{when one of the}} lifeboats broke loose. At the same time it was discovered that the cast <b>iron</b> <b>rudder</b> post, which was 11 in in diameter, had sheared off 2 ft above its collar and the rudder was swinging free and hitting the screw, which was slowly breaking it up.|$|R

5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's <b>iron</b> <b>rudder</b> will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|R
500|$|Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi {{arrived on}} the western shore of lake Petén Itzá with his {{soldiers}} on 26 February 1697, and once there built the heavily armed galeota attack boat, which was assembled at Ch'ich' over a space of 12 days in early March. The galeota had a keel of 30 cubits or it had 12 oars on each side and a <b>rudder</b> with an <b>iron</b> screw. The galeota carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces, including a pieza (light cannon) and four pedreros (mortars). The piragua longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was also transported to the lake {{to be used in}} the attack on the Itza capital; this boat had 6 oars and a rudder.|$|R
2500|$|HMS Erebus at [...] and HMS Terror at [...] were sturdily {{built and}} were {{outfitted}} with recent inventions. These included steam engines from the London and Greenwich Railway that enabled the ships to make [...] {{on their own}} power, a unique combined steam-based heating and distillation system for {{the comfort of the}} crew and to provide large quantities of fresh water for the engine's boilers, a mechanism that enabled the <b>iron</b> <b>rudder</b> and propeller to be drawn into iron wells to protect them from damage, ships' libraries of more than 1,000books, and threeyears' worth of conventionally preserved or tinned preserved food supplies. Unfortunately, the latter was supplied from a cut-rate provisioner who was awarded the contract only a few months before the ships were to sail.|$|R

Goldner worked frantically on the large and hasty order of 8,000tins. The speed required affected quality control of a proportion of the tins manufactured, which were later found to have lead soldering that was [...] "thick and sloppily done, and dripped like melted candle wax down the inside surface".|$|R

60|$|The great {{difference}} in appearance between these packets and ours, is, {{that there is}} so much of them out of the water: the main-deck being enclosed on all sides, and filled with casks and goods, like any second or third floor in a stack of warehouses; and the promenade or hurricane-deck being a-top of that again. A part of the machinery is always above this deck; where the connecting-rod, in a strong and lofty frame, is seen working away like an iron top- sawyer. There is seldom any mast or tackle: nothing aloft but two tall black chimneys. The man at the helm is shut up in a little house in the fore part of the boat (the wheel being connected with the <b>rudder</b> by <b>iron</b> chains, working the whole length of the deck); and the passengers, unless the weather be very fine indeed, usually congregate below. Directly you have left the wharf, all the life, and stir, and bustle of a packet cease. You wonder for a long time how she goes on, for there seems to be nobody in charge of her; and when another of these dull machines comes splashing by, you feel quite indignant with it, as a sullen cumbrous, ungraceful, unshiplike leviathan: quite forgetting that the vessel you are on board of, is its very counterpart.|$|R
