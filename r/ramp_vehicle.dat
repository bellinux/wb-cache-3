40|$|This paper {{presents}} a decentralized merging assistant for mixed traffic situations aiming to increase traffic flow stability around the merging area by minimizing {{the conflict and}} limiting the changes in speed. The algorithm encourages early and smooth deceleration of the mainline vehicles upstream of the merging area {{in order to create}} gap for <b>ramp</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Simulation results show that the effectiveness of the merging assistant can be different depending on traffic conditions and compositions. A negative side effect that reduces the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is found and some ideas to solve this problem are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{research}} study on a traffic model developed for analysing the performance of the wireless inductive systems for charging while driving (CWD) fully electric vehicles (FEVs) from both traffic and energy points of view. The design assumptions of the developed traffic model are aimed to simulate in particular a freight distribution service in a fully cooperative traffic environment. In this case, the CWD service could be used to guarantee the minimum state of charge (SOC) of the batteries at the arrival to the depot that allows the vehicles to shortly start with further activities. In this way, the fleet manager could avoid wasting time for the stationary recharge, thus increasing the level of service of the freight distribution. The CWD system is applied to a multilane ring road with several intermediate on-ramp entrances, where the slowest lane is reserved for the charging activities, when authorized vehicles are present. A specific traffic model has been developed and implemented adopting a mesoscopic approach, where vehicle energy needs and charging opportunities affect drivers' behavior. Overtaking maneuvers, as well as new entries in the CWD lane of vehicles which need to charge, have been modeled by taking into account a fully cooperative driving system among vehicles which manages an adequate gap between consecutive vehicles. Finally, a speed control strategy in which vehicles can be delayed to create an empty time-space slot in the CWD lane, is simulated at a defined node. This type of control, though is simulated to allow extraordinary maintenance operations, which may require a free charging zone for a given time slot, could also be applied to support merging maneuvers for on <b>ramp</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|E
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 26, 2014). Ramp metering {{has been successfully}} implemented in many states and studies have documented its positive mobility and safety benefits. However, {{there have been no}} studies on the use of ramp metering for work zones. This thesis reports the results from the first deployment of temporary ramp meters in work zones in the United States. Temporary ramp meters were deployed at seven work zones in Missouri. Due to lack of crash data, this study uses video data to extract alternative safety measures such as driver compliance, merging behavior, speed differentials, lane changing, and braking maneuvers. This evaluation suggests that temporary ramp meters should only be deployed at work zone locations where there is potential for congestion and turned on only during periods of high congestion. In comparison to over 90 % compliance rates of permanent ramp meters implemented in other states, field data showed compliance rates from 40. 5 % to 82. 9 % in temporary ramp meter. This suggested that non-compliance could be a major safety issue in the deployment of temporary ramp meters. The use of a three-section instead of a traditional two-section signal head used for ramp metering produced significantly higher compliance rates. This thesis then aggregated the data into groups to further analyze the effects of different factors such as platoons, commercial trucks, work zone type and work zone-ramp configuration. After analyzing general characteristics of mainline and <b>ramp</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed and speed differentials, this study then focused on findings for different comparison groups. The two comparison groups are “between two work zones” versus “before work zone” configuration and “left-lane closed” versus “right-lane closed” work zone type. Results indicated lower mean speeds of mainline and ramp vehicles and higher differentials when ramp metering was turned on. This is expected and again temporary ramp meters are recommended only where congestion occurs. Congestion will lead to lower mainline speeds thus lower speed differentials either with or without ramp metering. Finally, analysis of merging headways showed that temporary ramp meters were effective in separating platoons before vehicles merged into mainline. This produces more single-vehicle merging which requires shorter gaps and causes fewer impacts on the mainline traffic...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTransportation {{engineers}} {{rely on the}} Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) for estimating capacity at freeway segments. According to the HCM 2010, {{the capacity}} of the basic freeway segments {{is a function of the}} free-flow speed and it ranges from 2, 400 passenger cars per hour per lane (pc/h/ln) for FFS 70 or 75 mi/h, to 2, 250 pc/h/ln for FFS 55 mi/h. The freeway merge segments methodology in the HCM 2010 Update uses these same capacity values in the analysis procedure, although research has shown that capacities at these bottleneck locations are considerably lower. In addition to that, researchers have also observed that capacity varies significantly from day to day and from one site to the other. Researchers acknowledge that driver behavior and frequent interactions between mainline and <b>ramp</b> <b>vehicles</b> at these junctions are the causal factor of these variations in capacity and the low capacity values; however, this has not been reflected in the updated version of the HCM 2010. Furthermore, the HCM 2010 Update does not account for the conflicting movements and the contribution of the <b>ramp</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the overall merge junction capacity. This paper investigates the relationship between freeway and ramp demand and capacity at merge junctions. For the purposes of this research, historic data at merge bottleneck locations across North America with different geometric and operational characteristics were analyzed. The results of the analysis show that, there is a clear correlation between ramp demand, freeway demand and freeway capacity. More specifically, higher demand on the on-ramps produces lower overall capacity values. In addition, this paper proposes new capacity values for merge junctions as a function of the freeway and ramp demand and number of lanes...|$|R

50|$|A$110 million {{multi-phase}} {{expansion and}} renovation project, designed by Atkins Benham Inc. and Gensler and built by Oscar J. Boldt Construction Company, began in 2001. Phase-I involved erection of construction walkways from the five-story parking garage {{to the terminal}} building, demolition of the terminal's existing elevator core, construction of new elevator and escalator cores on the tunnel level and on level one, building temporary entrance and exit <b>ramps</b> for <b>vehicles</b> approaching and leaving the terminal, reconstruction of the roofs of the lower level and level one, finishing the elevator and escalator cores to level two, building new permanent entry and exit <b>ramps</b> for <b>vehicles</b> and {{construction of a new}} transportation plaza and driving lanes. Phase-II included a new concourse constructed {{to the west of the}} central terminal area, which was renovated to match the interior and exterior designs of the new concourse. The 1960s-built concourses were then demolished after the new concourse opened in 2005. The entire phase was completed in November 2006.

50|$|Also {{included}} at some demolition derbies in the US and UK are rollover competitions, {{where the}} object is to drive a car so that only the wheels on one side hit a <b>ramp,</b> causing the <b>vehicle</b> to roll over repeatedly.

Compact cars, especially hatchbacks, are used in rollover competitions. Their lighter weight enables them to roll more easily than larger vehicles. However, with modern high-horsepower unibody sedans and coupes now appearing on salvage lots, some of this conventional wisdom is being questioned and some major competitions have been won by drivers of small size, mid-size and full-size sedans.|$|R
