5|$|The {{corn earworm}} {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest, with a large host range encompassing corn and many other crop plants. H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the codling moth. The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to $250 million. The moth’s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E

5|$|Following the bird's extinction, {{remains of}} the great auk {{increased}} dramatically in value, and auctions of specimens created intense interest in Victorian Britain, where 15 specimens are now located, {{the largest number of}} any country. A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for £9000, which placed it in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold. The price of its eggs sometimes <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year. The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown. Several other eggs have been destroyed accidentally. Two mounted skins were destroyed in the twentieth century, one in the Mainz Museum during the Second World War, and one in the Museu Bocage, Lisbon that was destroyed by a fire in 1978.|$|E

5|$|Warnings and {{advisories}} {{declared in}} response to the storm were widely distributed, and approximately 25,000 people in the area evacuated their homes. Officials completed various precautionary measures. Wind gusts along the coast <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to , and high storm tides were recorded. The hurricane inflicted severe damage; destruction to property was worth an estimated $2 million, with an additional $5 million in damage to crops, notably rice and cotton. Overall, the cyclone killed four people. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a prelude to World War II. Heavy rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result. The inclement weather forced hundreds of military aircraft to move inland for shelter.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Maria, Environment Canada declared {{a tropical storm}} watch for the coast of Newfoundland on September15, which stretched from Arnolds Cove to Brigus South. Three hours later, it was upgraded to a hurricane watch, while a tropical storm watch was put into effect from Arnolds Cove to Jones Harbor. At 0600UTC the following day, the watches and warnings were replaced by a hurricane warning, and areas between Brigus South and Charlottestown, Newfoundland were placed under a tropical storm warning. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued at 2100UTC on September16. While becoming absorbed by a front on September16, Maria made landfall on {{the southern tip of}} the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, where winds of 64mph (103km/h) were recorded.

The capital city of St. John's experienced heavy rain, though not to the extent that had been forecast, as the storm moved through the peninsula faster than predicted.|$|E
5|$|Powerful surf {{affected}} the northern coastlines {{of the islands}} in the Greater Antilles. Strong swells also lashed the Bahamas. During most hurricanes, {{the location of the}} Bahamas prevents powerful swells of Atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast Florida. However, the combination of the location, forward speed, and strength of Isabel produced strong swells through the Providence Channel onto a narrow 10mile (16km) stretch of the southeastern Florida coastline; wave heights peaked at 14feet (4.3m) at Delray Beach. The swells capsized a watercraft and injured its twopassengers at Boynton Beach, and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near Juno Beach. Minor beach erosion was reported in Palm Beach County. In the northern portion of the state, waves <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to 15feet (4.5m) in height at Flagler Beach, causing the Flagler Beach Pier to be closed due to damaged boards from the waves. Rip currents from Isabel killed a surfer at an unguarded beach in Nassau County, with an additional six people requiring rescue from the currents. The beaches were later closed during the worst of the rough surf.|$|E

A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three feet in the Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E
