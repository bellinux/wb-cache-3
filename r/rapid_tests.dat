The {{aim of this study}} is to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the Ov 16 <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> into onchocerciasis surveillance activities in Senegal, based on the following attributes of acceptability, usability, and cost. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 13 villages in southeastern Senegal in May 2016. Individuals 5 years and older were invited to participate in a demographic questionnaire, an Ov 16 <b>rapid</b> <b>test,</b> a skin snip biopsy, and an acceptability interview. <b>Rapid</b> <b>test</b> technicians were interviewed and a costing analysis was conducted. Of 1, 173 participants, 1, 169 (99. 7 %) agreed to the <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> while 383 (32. 7 %) agreed to skin snip microscopy. The sero-positivity rate of the <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> among those tested was 2. 6 % with zero positives 10 years and younger. None of the 383 skin snips were positive for Ov microfilaria. Community members appreciated that the <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> was performed quickly, was not painful, and provided reliable results. The total costs for this surveillance activity was $ 22, 272. 83, with a cost per test conducted at $ 3. 14 for <b>rapid</b> <b>test,</b> $ 7. 58 for skin snip microscopy, and $ 13. 43 for shared costs.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the assay of routin method of CK-MB and cTnI in comparison with <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> method in suspected patients to AMI. Materials and Methods: The study population comprised 142 patients admitted to the emergency ward with acute chest pain for less than 12 hours before admission.

5000|$|Confirmed {{diagnosis}} of pandemic H1N1 flu requires testing of a nasopharyngeal, nasal or oropharyngeal tissue swab from the patient. Real-time RT-PCR is the recommended test as others {{are unable to}} differentiate between pandemic H1N1 and regular seasonal flu. However, most people with flu symptoms do not need a test for pandemic H1N1 flu specifically, because the test results usually do not affect the recommended course of treatment. The U.S. CDC recommend testing only {{for people who are}} hospitalized with suspected flu, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. For the mere {{diagnosis of}} influenza and not pandemic H1N1 flu specifically, more widely available tests include rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDT), which yield results in about 30 minutes, and direct and indirect immunofluorescence assays (DFA and IFA), which take 2-4 hours. Due to the high rate of RIDT false negatives, the CDC advises that patients with illnesses compatible with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection but with negative RIDT results should be treated empirically based on the level of clinical suspicion, underlying medical conditions, severity of illness and risk for complications, and if a more definitive determination of infection with influenza virus is required, testing with rRT-PCR or virus isolation should be performed. Rhonda Medows of the Georgia Department of Community Health states that the <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> are incorrect anywhere from 30% to 90% of the time and warns doctors in her state not to use them because they are wrong so often.
