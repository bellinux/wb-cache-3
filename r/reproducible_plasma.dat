40|$|Improving oral {{bioavailability}} of low poorly {{water soluble}} drugs using self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) possess significant potential. Oral bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs {{can be improved}} using SEDDS, and appears most promising.

The frequency of these waves is of the order of the electron-plasma frequency and it lies in that part (≃ 300 - 4 000 MHz) of the microwave spectrum where power generators with large enough output powers are readily available, at reasonable cost. Moreover, these waves can be excited very efficiently by using appropriate launching structures such as the surfatron. Such plasmas can, in certain instances, advantageously replace the positive column of DC discharges. This paper reviews the properties of the plasma columns sustained by the azimuthally symmetric surface wave.

Two sets of fast-scanning {{microwave}} heterodyne radiometer receiver systems employing Backward-wave Oscillators in 78 - 118 GHz and 118 - 178 GHz {{were developed}} for Electron Cyclotron Emission measurements (ECE) on HT- 7 superconducting tokamak.

40|$|<b>Reproducible</b> <b>plasma</b> instabilities {{have been}} {{observed}} and studied in low-pressure 13. 56 MHz inductively coupled discharges operating in oxygen, chlorine and argon-chlorine mixtures. The instabilities were observed {{in the form of}} periodic modulations in the light output, floating potential, negative ion fraction, electron and positive and negative ion densities. The magnitude and frequency of the modulations are sensitive to the plasma operating conditions. The plasmas were characterised both by time-averaged and time-resolved measurements. Instabilities were observed in a pure chlorine discharge when the discharge was de-tuned to increase reflected power. A variety of instabilities with different light emission characteristics were observed. These varied in nature from a modulated series of sharp bursts to a very periodic behaviour. Time-resolved measurements of the negative ion fraction shows a sudden increase in the afterglow period of the instability. The instability can be controlled, by variation of the matching conditions, to produce an apparent pulsed plasma environment. A global model has been modified for weakly electronegative discharge and this provides a qualitative description of the instabilities observed in oxygen and the argon-chlorine mixture. While the global model predicts a smaller power and pressure window for the instability, and different frequencies to experiment, it still provides a framework for the discussion of instabilities in weakly electronegative discharges.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{imaging system}} with shutter speeds {{as fast as}} 2 ns and double frame capability {{has been used to}} directly image the formation and evolution of the sustained spheromak physics experiment (SSPX) [E. B. Hooper et al., Nucl. Fusion 39, 863 (1999) ]. <b>Reproducible</b> <b>plasma</b> features have been identified with this diagnostic and divided into three groups, according to the stage in the discharge at which they occur: (i) breakdown and ejection, (ii) sustainment, and (iii) decay. During the first stage, plasma descends into the flux conserver shortly after breakdown and a transient plasma column is formed. The column then rapidly bends and simultaneously becomes too dim to photograph a few microseconds after formation. It is conjectured here that this rapid bending precedes the transfer of toroidal to poloidal flux. During sustainment, a stable plasma column different from the transient one is observed. It has been possible to measure the column diameter and compare it to CORSICA [A. Tarditi et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys. 36, 132 (1996) ], a magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium reconstruction code which showed good agreement with the measurements. Elongation and velocity measurements were made of cathode patterns also seen during this stage, possibly caused by pressure gradients or E×B drifts. The patterns elongate in a toroidal-only direction which depends on the magnetic-field polarity. During the decay stage the column diameter expands as the current ramps down, until it eventually dissolves into filaments. With the use of magnetic probes inserted in the gun region, an X point which moved axially depending on current level and toroidal mode number was observed in all the stages of the SSPX plasma discharge...|$|E

More than 4 mg of pyridoxine supplementation daily was required for most pregnancies to maintain maternal plasma PLP levels within the range observed during the first trimester and in the nonpregnant state.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the grafting of nitrogen and amino surface functional groups on polymers by means of plasmas containing nitrogen and hydrogen. For this purpose, many aspects of plasma surface modification were studied. In the frame of this work, a new, UHV-sealed plasma reactor system was put into operation. The system is special for its clean reaction environment and the possibility to perform quasi in situ XPS measurements. A comparison of the UHV system to a fine vacuum reactor showed that a clean reaction environment is mandatory for <b>reproducible</b> <b>plasma</b> processing and efficient nitrogen and amino functionalisation. A key motivation for the present work was the observation that the non-coating plasma processes reported in literature fail to graft primary amino groups on polymer surfaces with densities that significantly exceed 3 - 4 % NH 2 /C. In order to investigate this phenomenon in detail, this work followed two experimental tracks: On the one hand, a broad systematic study of plasma processing parameters was performed. On the other, the surface diagnostics methods used for the quantification of amino groups were critically reviewed. In the scope of this work, the UHV reactor system was equipped with optical emission spectroscopy (OES), two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF), and tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). A separate plasma source was setup to perform an absolute quantification of the vacuum-ultra-violet (VUV) emission intensity of hydrogen-containing MW-excited plasmas. The techniques were evaluated with respect to their contribution to an understanding of the plasma processing of polymers. The rich experimental data allowed to suggest new reaction mechanisms for the grafting of nitrogen- and amino functional groups. Surface passivation experiments in H, plasmas of nitrogen-functionalised surfaces initiated a re-evaluation and an extension of the mechanism of selective etching [1]. Together with two other new reaction mechanisms, a hypothetical reaction scheme was suggested. It was studied by the help of two numerical models for heterogenous reactions of radicals with the surface. In order to avoid the complexity of the fragmentation process of NH,, the models were restricted to discharges in N, and H 9. Despite the sparse information on the composition of the gas phase, the data of two experimental series showed a very particular phenomenology that allowed a first test of the model. The test supports the newly-suggested reaction mechanisms. Especially the role of NH 2 attachment to open reaction sites for the grafting of amino groups was emphasised. A more stringent test of the model is left to future experiments with extended gas phase diagnostic means.

Reference values for the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) using ARC are still undefined. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the threshold of ARR using ARC measurement to screen for primary aldosteronism. Methods: A total of 211 subjects were included in the study, comprising 78 healthy normotensive controls, 95 patients with essential hypertension, and 38 patients with confirmed primary aldosteronism (20 with surgery-confirmed aldosterone-producing adenoma and 18 with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia). Blood samples were drawn from ambulatory patients and volunteers in the mid-morning without specific dietary restriction for measuring plasma aldosterone concentration, ARC, and serum potassium. Results: Most normotensive controls and essential hypertension patients had ARR results below 100 pmol/ng, a value which corresponded to 3. 3 times the median of these two groups. Conclusion: Patients with ARR values above this level should be considered for further investigation (confirmatory tests) or for repeat testing should ARR values be borderline.

Gastrointestinal symptoms in association with migraine including, nausea, vomiting, and gastroparesis, affect a large proportion of migraine sufferers. These symptoms may result in delays or inconsistencies in the absorption of oral treatments. Hence, the necessity for an innovative, non-invasive, parenteral delivery formulation for quick and effective treatment of migraine attacks is evident. Iontophoresis utilizes minimal amounts of electrical potential to support the fast transfer of ionized medication transdermally and into the general circulation. Two pharmacokinetic clinical trials have shown that iontophoretic delivery of sumatriptan through the skin produces quick and <b>reproducible</b> therapeutic <b>plasma</b> concentrations. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III study demonstrated superior efficacy versus placebo and excellent tolerability, with no triptan-related adverse events. The proportion of patients that were pain-free at 2 h post-treatment was 18 % for the sumatriptan patch vs 9 % for placebo (P = 0. 0092; number needed to treat = 11. 1). Upon approval from the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities, the iontophoretic transdermal delivery of sumatriptan will be a good choice for patients experiencing poor absorption of oral medication often associated with migraine and/or for those with intolerable triptan-related adverse events.

The resulting density profiles in capillaries with gas jet and multiple in- and outlets are simulated with the fluid code OpenFOAM. Satisfactory simulation results then are followed by fabrication of the desired target shapes with structures down to the 10 µm level. The detection of Raman scattered photons using lenses with large collection solid angle allows to measure the corresponding longitudinal density profiles at different number densities and allows a detection sensitivity down to the low 1017 cm− 3 density range at high spatial resolution.

40|$|The high {{confinement}} mode (H-mode) is {{the operational}} scenario foreseen for ITER, DEMO and future fusion power plants. At high densities, which are favorable {{in order to}} maximize the fusion power, a back transition from the H-mode to the low confinement mode (L-mode) is observed. In present tokamaks, this H-mode density limit (HDL) occurs at densities on the order of, but below, the Greenwald density. In gas ramp discharges at the fully tungsten covered ASDEX Upgrade tokamak (AUG), four distinct operational phases are identified in the approach towards the HDL. These phases are a stable H-mode, a degrading H-mode, the breakdown of the H-mode and an L-mode. They are <b>reproducible,</b> quasi-stable <b>plasma</b> regimes and provide a framework in which the HDL can be further analyzed. During the evolution, energy losses are increased and a fueling limit is encountered. The latter is correlated to a plateau of electron density in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The well-known extension of the good confinement at high density with high triangularity is reflected in this scheme by extending the first phase to higher densities. In this work, two mechanisms are proposed, which can explain the experimental observations. The fueling limit is most likely correlated to an outward shift of the ionization profile. The additional energy loss channel is presumably linked to a regime of increased radial filament transport in the SOL. The SOL and divertor plasmas play a key role for both mechanisms, in line with the previous hypothesis that the HDL is edge-determined. The four phases are also observed in carbon covered AUG, although the HDL density exhibits a different dependency on the heating power and plasma current. This can be attributed to a changed energy loss channel in the presented scheme...|$|R

However, the global glycan profiles of the released N- and O-linked oligosaccharides from the glycoproteins retained by the lectins, and from those glycoproteins that did not bind, using both these complex samples, were found to be very similar. That is, although the lectins selectively and reproducibly retained some glycoproteins, other proteins with the same attached oligosaccharide structures did not bind. Some small N- and O-glycan differences were observed in the bound fractions but there was little absolute specificity toward individual oligosaccharide structures known to have high affinity to these lectins.

In dysbetalipoproteinemia, esterification rates were increased above normal levels, but cholesteryl ester transfer was reduced and the direction of sterol transport between the cells and plasma medium was reversed, as in the hyperbetalipoproteinemic group. In hypertriglyceridemia, those subjects with cardiovascular disease showed a metabolic pattern similar to the hyperbetalipoproteinemic group. The subjects in this group without symptoms of cardiovascular disease showed a normal direction of sterol transport, normal or raised rates of cholesteryl ester transfer between lipoproteins, and an increased rate of sterol esterification in plasma that decreased towards normal levels as plasma triglyceride levels decreased. Despite their quite distinct metabolic patterns there was no consistent difference between the two hypertriglyceridemic groups in triglyceride or cholesterol levels, very low density lipoprotein composition, or electrophoretic or isoelectric focussing patterns. All hypertriglyceridemic subjects with documented cardiovascular disease showed reversed cell-plasma sterol transport and all subjects without such disease showed a normal direction of cell-plasma sterol transport. The results of this study indicate major and <b>reproducible</b> abnormalities in <b>plasma</b> cholesterol metabolism in several groups of subjects with genetically distinct hyperlipidemias, who are at risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease. The possible predictive value of sterol metabolic measurements in the analysis of cardiovascular disease is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Improved assay {{methods for}} {{determination}} of dyphylline levels in plasma, saliva, and urine utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography have been developed. Detection of levels {{as low as}} 25 ng/ml from 0. 5 ml plasma and 50 ng/ml from 0. 5 ml saliva were possible. Both procedures utilized the same extraction process. A separate extraction process was used for dyphylline analysis in urine due {{to the presence of}} interfering substances occurring with previous methods. The method was applied to samples of one subject's plasma, saliva and urine after administration of dyphylline. Plasma, saliva, and urine dyphylline concentrations were measured after administration of a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg to six healthy male subjects. Improved analytical methods have allowed sampling over longer time periods than have previously been reported. The resultant plasma, saliva and urine data show that dyphylline pharmacokinetics cannot be described by traditional one or two compartment open models. Model independent pharmacokinetic parameters, including renal clearance, drug excreted, time to plasma peak, and peak plasma values have been determined. In contrast with a previous report, the analysis of dyphylline in urine has established that dyphylline is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine. The observed rapid and <b>reproducible</b> rise in <b>plasma</b> dyphylline levels is consistent with prediction of rapid onset of action following oral dosing with the tablet investigated. A high degree of correlation was found between saliva and plasma dyphylline concentrations of individuals using parabolic equations, the r² values ranging from 0. 935 to 0. 996. This relationship suggests nonlinear protein binding of dyphylline occurs within the range of plasma levels attained by the dose given in the study. These observations should prove to be useful for designing future pharmacokinetic studies and clinically when monitoring of plasma dyphylline levels via saliva sampling is anticipated...|$|R
40|$|Blood plasma, {{the largest}} human {{proteome}} is readily accessible {{and can be}} minimalinvasively sampled making it a valuable source of potential biomarkers. However, its analysis is complicated by its complexity and the huge dynamic concentration range of its constituents. Automated assays were established using magnetic microspheres and customized group-specific triple X proteomics (TXP) antibodies. These antibodies are directed against short N- or C-terminal epitope motifs for the immunoprecipitation of signature peptides derived from groups of trypsin-digested plasma proteins. The introduction of these antibodies led to a very efficient enrichment of the targeted analytes {{and a reduction in}} sample complexity similar to the SISCAPA (Stable Isotope Standards and Capture by Anti-Peptide Antibodies) approach introduced by Anderson et al. (2004). The quantitative evaluation as targeted approach, via nano liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring and stable isotopes peptide standards revealed limits of detection of 21 ng/ml and limits of quantification of 189 ng/ml in a tryptic plasma digest assay. Two peptides with the same TXP tag were simultaneously captured with one TXP antibody in a multiplex dynamic range of about 7, 000 (5 fmol peptide were still detectable in presence of 33. 3 pmol matrix peptide). The qualitative evaluation as discovery approach, of a tryptic plasma digest assay via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF) analysis revealed the presence of TXP tag-specific peptides captured by the used TXP antibodies. Their analysis, however, was compromised by peptide peaks from non-targeted high abundant proteins. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation showed a 99 % depletion of non-targeted peptides. Further investigations with a total of 14 TXP antibodies enabled the detection of targeted TXP peptides and a significant reduction in the intensity of non-specific peptides. TXP Proteomics by peptide group-specific immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry read-out allowed <b>reproducible</b> multiplexed <b>plasma</b> protein analysis without the requirement for demanding liquid chromatography separation techniques. Furthermore, the application of TXP antibodies requires significantly fewer antibodies for immuno-affinity mass spectrometry based plasma proteome analysis compared to the use of anti-peptide antibodies. Blutplasma ist das größte menschliche Proteom. Es kann schnell durch einen minimal invasiven Eingriff gewonnen werden und stellt dadurch eine wertvolle Quelle für potentielle Biomarker dar. Die Analyse jedoch ist kompliziert, bedingt durch die Komplexität des Plasmas und den enormen dynamischen Konzentrationsbereich der beinhalteten Proteine. In dieser Arbeit wurde eine automatisierte Probenbearbeitung mit magnetischen Partikeln und gruppenspezifischen "Triple X Proteomics" (TXP) -Antikörpern etabliert. Diese sind gegen kurze N- oder C-terminale Epitop-Motive von Peptiden gerichtet um diese gruppenweise aus tryptisch verdauten Plasma anzureichern. Die Anwendung dieser führte zu einer sehr effektiven Anreicherung der Zielanalyten und folglich zu einer Reduktion der Komplexität ähnlich dem Konzept SISCAPA (Stable Isotope Standards and Capture by Anti-Peptide Antibodies) von Anderson et al. (2004). Die quantitative Evaluierung mittels nano-Flüssigkeitschromatographie Multiple Reaction Monitoring und stabilen Isotopen-Standards zeigte Detektionsgrenzen von 21 ng/ml und Quantifizierungsgrenzen von 189 ng/ml in tryptischem Plasmaverdau. Der multiplexe dynamische Bereich eines TXP-Antikörper lag bei 7, 000 (5 fmol Peptid waren in Gegenwart von 33, 3 pmol Matrixpeptid noch detektierbar), wobei zwei Peptide mit derselben TXP-Sequenz simultan mit einem TXP-Antikörper gebunden werden konnten. Die qualitative Evaluierung eines Plasma-Experiments mittels Matrix-unterstützter Laser-Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI) mit Flugzeitanalyse (time of flight, TOF) zeigte die Präsenz von TXP-spezifischen Peptiden, die von den benutzten TXP-Antikörpern gebunden wurden. Die Analyse dieser wurde allerdings beeinträchtigt durch Peptidpeaks von unerwünschten, hoch abundanten Plasmaproteinen. Mittels Dichtegradientenzentrifugation wurden 99 % der unerwünschten Peptide abgereichert. Mit insgesamt 14 TXP-Antikörpern wurden gezielt Peptide mit TXP-Sequenz angereichert. Gleichzeitig konnte eine signifikante Reduktion von unspezifischen Peptiden ohne TXPSequenz erreicht werden. Die Proteomanalyse mit TXP-Antikörpern (gruppenspezifische Immunpräzipitation von Peptiden gekoppelt mit massenspektrometrischer Analyse) erlaubte die reproduzierbare, multiplexe Analyse von Plasmaproteinen ohne zusätzliche, anspruchsvolle LCTrennungsmethoden. Im Gegensatz zu der Applikation peptidspezifischer Antikörper werden mit TXP-Antikörpern erheblich weniger Antikörper für die Plasma-Proteom- Analyse bei der Immunaffinitätschromatographie benötigt...|$|R
40|$|Many plasma {{membrane}} proteins {{are linked to}} diseases and are often targets of therapeutic drugs. However, analysis of {{plasma membrane}} proteins from cancer tissues or cells is far from satisfaction due to their water-insoluble and low abundant natures. The enrichment of plasma membrane proteins is always contaminated by other intracellular organelles. To perform a sensitive and specific analysis of plasma membrane proteome, {{it is important to}} develop a better method to improve the extraction efficiency for plasma membrane proteins. We aim to develop an efficient purification strategy to increase the plasma membrane protein identification coverage by mass spectrometry. We expect that this strategy can help us to probe the under-represented membrane proteome. We used our two-step centrifugation method in combination with the conventional ultracentrifugation method to improve the purity of plasma membrane proteins. Using HeLa cells as experiment model, under the same protein identification threshold the purification efficiency between the two-step method and the combined method was compared. 1077 and 1002 proteins were identified in two-step method and combined method, of which 550 (51. 1 %) and 601 (60 %) proteins were annotated as membrane proteins, 353 (32. 8 %) and 359 (35. 8 %) were annotated as plasma membrane proteins by Gene Ontology database. The combined method showed better purity and higher identified number of plasma membrane proteins than two-step method. To application on mouse liver tissues, 1398 and 1214 proteins were identified in two-step method and combined method, of which 813 (58. 1 %) and 723 (59. 6 %) proteins were annotated as membrane proteins, 343 (24. 5 %) and 304 (25 %) were annotated as plasma membrane proteins. The purification efficiency of combined method apply on cell lines was better than tissue samples. For the reproducibility of combined method, there were 1157, 1269 and 1217 proteins identified in three replicates in mouse liver tissues. Among them, 274 (23. 7 %), 330 (26 %) and 310 (25. 5 %) proteins were annotated as plasma membrane proteins, which more than 70 % (227) plasma membrane proteins were appeared in all of three replicates. The low recovery (10 %) often limits the application of ultracentrifugation method on trace amount of starting materials. The combined method can improve the recovery and the purity of identified plasma membrane proteins, indicating that this combined method may have better efficiency for extraction of plasma membrane proteins. To further improve the yield of the plasma membrane proteins by centrifugation, we modified the volume of 20 % to 25 % sucrose gradients used in ultracentrifugation. Three different types of gradient preparation, including original, expanded, and condensed sucrose gradient, were tested. A total of 91 plasma membrane proteins were identified using condensed gradient, which is higher than using expanded gradient (53 plasma membrane proteins) and original gradient (61 plasma membrane proteins). The condensed gradient had smaller volume (2 ml) of 20 % ~ 25 % sucrose solutions for ultracentrifugation and thus improved the recovery of plasma membrane proteins. For other organelle proteins, mitochondria membrane protein-rich region were concentrated in 25 % ~ 40 % sucrose solutions The ER membrane protein-rich region is in 25 % ~ 30 % sucrose solutions. The nucleus protein-rich region is in 40 % solution. The 20 % sucrose solution has the highest purity (42. 1 %) of plasma membrane proteins and lowest contamination from other organelle membrane proteins. 許多細胞膜蛋白扮演著與疾病相互關聯的角色，常成為藥物治療的標的蛋白，然而分析癌症組織或細胞中細胞膜蛋白質仍極富挑戰，例如細胞膜蛋白質具高疏水特性，在細胞膜蛋白質純化的過程中也容易夾雜細胞胞器膜而造成干擾。為了針對細胞膜蛋白進行靈敏且高專一性的分析，我們需要發展一個更有效率的萃取策略，以提升質譜分析所鑑定到的細胞膜蛋白數量，我們也希望這個萃取策略可以鑑定出尚未被發現的細胞膜蛋白。 我們將目前常用的兩步驟離心法 (two-step centrifugation) 結合傳統的超高速離心法來提升所萃取的細胞膜蛋白純度，我們比較了兩步驟離心法和結合離心法 (combined method) 的純化效率。利用子宮頸癌細胞 (HeLa cells) 為測試模式，在參數條件相同的分析中，兩步驟離心法與結合離心法在結果中依序鑑定到平均各 1077 與 1002 個蛋白質，其中以Gene Ontology資料庫分類後呈現出所鑑定到的總體膜蛋白數量 550 (51. 1 %) 與 601 (60 %) 個，細胞膜蛋白數量為 353 (32. 8 %) 、 359 (35. 8 %) 個。結果中結合離心法所分離出的細胞膜蛋白純度與鑑定到的細胞膜蛋白數量皆較兩步驟離心法高。若應用於老鼠肝臟組織上，兩步驟離心法與結合離心法依序可鑑定到 1398 與 1214 個蛋白質，分類後總體膜蛋白數量為 813 (58. 1 %) 與 723 (59. 6 %) 個，細胞膜蛋白數量為 343 (24. 5 %) 與 304 (25 %) 個，相較於cell line，組織應用上使用結合離心法所提升的純化效率較有限。於結合離心法之重複性測試中，使用老鼠肝臟組織於三重複中可鑑定到 1157, 1269, 1217 個蛋白質， 274 (23. 7 %), 330 (26 %), 310 (25. 5 %) 個蛋白被分類為細胞膜蛋白質，其中大於七成 (227) 的細胞膜蛋白質於三重複中皆被鑑定到。 由於低回收率 (10 %) 是傳統超高速離心法不易進行微量樣品分析的限制，因此使用結合離心法可提升回收率以及鑑定到的細胞膜蛋白純度，顯現了結合離心法能更有效率的萃取細胞膜蛋白質以進行分析。為了將細胞膜蛋白進行有效濃縮，我們調整了超高速離心步驟中蔗糖梯度 20 %到 25 %溶液的體積，測試了三種不同的蔗糖梯度配置方式包含原始梯度、延展梯度和壓縮梯度。在壓縮梯度中一個梯度區段最高可鑑定到 91 個細胞膜蛋白，高於延展梯度所鑑定到的 53 個和原始梯度的 61 個細胞膜蛋白。使用壓縮梯度以僅兩毫升的 20 %至 25 %蔗糖溶液來進行超高速離心亦可提升細胞膜蛋白量的回收率。於其他胞器蛋白的分佈方面，粒線體膜蛋白傾向集中在 25 %至 40 %蔗糖溶液中，內質網膜蛋白則傾向位於 25 %至 30 %蔗糖溶液中，細胞核蛋白傾向位在 40 %蔗糖溶液中。超高速離心後 20 %蔗糖溶液內含有最高純度的細胞膜蛋白質 (42. 1 %) ，同時也避開了其他胞器膜蛋白的干擾。Acknowledgement [...] I Chinese Abstract [...] II Abstract [...] IV Table of Contents [...] VI List of Figures [...] IX List of Tables [...] .
