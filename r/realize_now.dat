500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2013, MLB {{suspended}} Braun for {{the remaining}} 65 games of the regular season, plus the entire postseason, for his involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. Braun, who lost $3.25 million as a result, did not appeal the suspension. In a statement, he said, [...] "I <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> that I have made some mistakes. I am {{willing to accept the}} consequences of those actions." [...] ESPN reported that Braun decided to [...] "strike a deal" [...] with MLB after being presented with the evidence against him. Called a [...] "liar", he was heavily criticized by the media and other players, particularly for tarnishing Laurenzi's reputation. In particular, it was later exposed that Braun engaged in a campaign for support from players around the league, accusing Laurenzi Jr. of being an anti-Semite.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Jr. {{would later}} say [...] "One {{of the most}} {{damaging}} things for me, I <b>realize</b> <b>now,</b> was playing a drunk in the play Long Day's Journey Into Night. In the play, the drunk's father is a failed artist {{and his mother was}} a drug addict. It was only after years of analysis I realized I was acting out events in my own life on stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Magnani had a {{love affair}} with the actor Massimo Serato, by whom she had her only child, a son named Luca, who was born on October 29, 1942 in Rome, after her {{separation}} from Alessandrini. Magnani's life was struck by tragedy when Luca came down with crippling polio at only 18 months of age. He never regained use of his legs. As a result, she spent most of her early earnings for specialists and hospitals. After once seeing a legless war veteran drag himself along the sidewalk, she said, [...] "I <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> that it's worse when they grow up", and resolved to earn enough to [...] "shield him forever from want".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think that}} the Towson, Maryland area that I am {{familiar}} with differs {{from other parts of}} Maryland because of the proximity to one of the largest slave plantations in the country. The Ridgely Plantation which owned all of the property from Baltimore County to Baltimore City and other surrounding areas. ...This was a very unique place of which I have never heard of any equal to it. Every African American school age child in Baltimore County had to attend school at some point at Carver in East Towson. ...I <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> that as a youngster the older African Americans avoided talking about slavery or the nearby Ridgely Plantation because they themselves were not too far removed from slavery itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1999, at a {{press conference}} in New York City to discuss The Phantom Menace, Lucas {{described}} the [...] "nine year commitment" [...] required to make a Star Wars trilogy. In 2002, he said: [...] "Basically what I said as a joke was, 'Maybe when Harrison and Carrie are in their 70s, we'll come back and do another version.' The thing I didn't realize then, and that I do <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> very clearly, is that not only would they be in their 70s, but I would be in my 70s too." [...] In 2007, Lucas described making the films at that age as [...] "an idea that seemed amusing at the time, but doesn't seem realistic now", and suggested that 'off-the-cuff' comments he had made in earlier years had been misconstrued as absolute statements.|$|E

2500|$|Elements of {{the history}} of Star Wars are {{commonly}} disputed, as George Lucas' statements about it have changed over time. One of the claims is that he intended to make the film a Space Western. Lucas has said that it was early as 1971—after he completed directing his first full-length feature, THX 1138—that he first had an idea for a space fantasy film, though he has also claimed to have had the idea long before then. In the 2010 coffee table book Star Wars: Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle produced by DK Publishing and Lucasfilm, George Lucas is said to have made his film as a direct contrast to THX 1138. He felt that the bleak tone of the film led to it being poorly received, and therefore chose to make Star Wars a more optimistic film. This is what led to the fun and adventurous tone of the space opera. Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into his own films, having been fascinated by them since he was young. In 1979, he said, [...] "I especially loved the Flash Gordon serials... Of course I <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> how crude and badly done they were... loving them that much when they were so awful, I began to wonder what would happen if they were done really well." ...|$|E

60|$|Nasmyth {{started a}} little. It {{was a thing}} that he would at one time {{certainly}} not have expected, but he <b>realized</b> <b>now</b> that he was driven by a fierce impatience {{to get back to}} the work he had undertaken.|$|R

60|$|I {{think that}} I {{was a little}} bewildered. I <b>realized</b> <b>now</b> what at first I had been {{inclined}} to doubt--that Mabane was wholly in earnest. Unconsciously my attitude towards him changed. It is hard to mock a man who believes in himself.|$|R
6000|$|He {{understood}} {{something of}} her emotion {{and responded to}} it. [...] "You dear, faithful little mother, I <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> what I have cost you, and I'm grateful; but that's the very reason why I can't let you do any more of it. I must begin to pay you back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hugh, dear, if it's {{hard for}} you, try to {{understand}} that it's terrible {{for me to think}} that he has any claim at all. I <b>realize</b> <b>now,</b> as I never did before, how wicked it was in me to marry him. I hate him, I can't bear the thought of going near him." ...|$|E

60|$|The rumour, he declared, was right. The false Demetrius {{was none}} other than his own nephew, Grishka Otrepiev, who had once been a monk, but, unfrocked, had embraced the Roman heresy, and had {{abandoned}} himself to licentious ways. You <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> why Smirnoy had been chosen by Basmanov for this particular mission.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{majority}} of the populace unquestionably would demand that we pay the penalty of our sacrilege.
