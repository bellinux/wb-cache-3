5|$|Cage and Vrataski {{infiltrate}} the MoD Main Building {{to obtain a}} prototype built by Carter that can locate the Omega. Cage finally compels General Brigham {{to give him the}} device. During the ensuing car chase, Cage discovers the Omega is under the Louvre Pyramid in Paris. However, Cage is captured and seriously injured. He wakes up in a hospital to find he has been given a transfusion and thus has lost the ability to <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> day.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
5|$|The game {{does not}} include Interplay's extra music, but it {{includes}} the extra level, {{as well as the}} added enemies and hazards from the console versions. This version is part of the Another World 15th Anniversary Edition CD-ROM released in 2007, which also includes a development diary, an exclusive postcard autographed by Chahi and a separate soundtrack CD. The CD-ROM version of 15th Anniversary Edition contains strict digital rights management technology– upon installation, the game verifies the user's serial number through the Internet, allowing only for five installations of the game using any given serial number. Uninstallation does not <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> count, so after five installations, the player must purchase a new copy. This problem does not exist on the digital copy sold by GOG.com.|$|E
50|$|End Of Interrupt (EOI) {{operations}} support specific EOI, non-specific EOI, and auto-EOI. A specific EOI specifies the IRQ level it is acknowledging in the ISR. A non-specific EOI <b>resets</b> <b>the</b> IRQ level in <b>the</b> ISR. Auto-EOI <b>resets</b> <b>the</b> IRQ {{level in the}} ISR immediately after the interrupt is acknowledged.|$|R

5|$|When a USB {{device is}} first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After <b>reset,</b> <b>the</b> USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device {{is supported by the}} host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E
5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E

50|$|Each {{number in}} the {{accumulator}} can be individually set with a knob situated right below it. This feature is optional for the operation counter register. The accumulator and the result counter are in between two buttons used to reset their content at once. <b>The</b> left button <b>resets</b> <b>the</b> accumulator, <b>the</b> right button <b>resets</b> <b>the</b> operation counter. These buttons are also used as handles when lifting and sliding the carriage.|$|R
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> stun meter.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into eight {{chapters}} and a prologue; {{at the end of}} each chapter, the player is graded on their performance, and all of their statistics and medals are <b>reset.</b> <b>The</b> only items which carry over between chapters are emblems, which are given to the player for achieving high scores in a chapter or defeating hidden monsters. High scores are achieved by defeating more enemies, and defeating enemies with high Panic meters. In addition to the main game is a challenge arena, accessible through the main menu, where Keldric can fight timed battles against powerful foes. Keldric can fight alongside AI-controlled pets in these challenges, found in eggs throughout the game. The challenge arena also contains a shop, which contains emblems, eggs, and bonuses like extra music or higher game difficulties, which can be bought with money dropped by enemies throughout the game.|$|E

This is the four-phase protocol, four-phase handshake, or Return-to-Zero encoding. Despite being apparently more complicated, the circuit-level implementations are usually faster and simpler.|$|R

5|$|The No. 9 Audi {{began to}} fall off the race pace after {{multiple}} visits to the garage for repairs to its hybrid system, but the No. 7 Audi kept fighting as Lotterer <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> fastest lap of the race with a three minutes and 17.476 seconds time. KCMG had an anxious moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course {{and came to the}} garage with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari to climb to second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan came to a halt at the Porsche Curves after smoke bellowed out of {{the front of the car}} as the gearbox failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{features}} various Bonus Challenges. When Cooper collects five Rare books (there are 100 Rare books in total) during his adventure in Ghoulhaven Hall, a Bonus Challenge is unlocked. The main {{objective of the}} Bonus challenges is to revisit {{one of the rooms}} and perform a different task within it, such as defeating a number of enemies in a certain amount or time or surviving a duel with the Grim Reaper. Upon completing a Bonus Challenge, the player is awarded with a bronze, silver, gold or platinum medal based on their performance. For every platinum medal earned, a piece of the game's concept art is unlocked. If the player collects all 100 Rare books and earns gold or better on all 20 challenges, the player is given the option to <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> game with Amber unlocked as the new playable character in a 21st bonus challenge. Here Amber has 10 health in every level and there are no power ups. When the game is beaten this way the old E3 trailer for the game as well as a deleted cutscene are unlocked to view.|$|E

40|$|Predictive State Representations (PSRs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to model dynamical systems. Although POMDPs and PSRs provide general frameworks for solving partially observable problems, in real world applications, when the PSR model of a system is learned from samples, it will almost certainly result in an inaccurate PSR model. Therefore the prediction vector calculated using this model may progressively drift farther and farther away from reality, which will result in lower prediction accuracy of the PSR model. This paper describes an algorithm for <b>resetting</b> <b>the</b> learned PSR models. First, for the inaccurate PSR model, the PSR state is identified using discriminant function analysis, then the calculated prediction vector can be <b>reset</b> for <b>the</b> purpose of improving the veracity of the PSR model. The algorithms with and without <b>resetting</b> <b>the</b> PSR model are compared, empirical results show that in case of the obtained PSR model's prediction quality, <b>the</b> algorithm with <b>resetting</b> <b>the</b> prediction vector has better prediction accuracy than <b>the</b> algorithm without <b>resetting</b> <b>the</b> prediction vector, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} its l'Cie {{soldiers}} and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys {{the forces of}} Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag. This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population. Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the trials of the Arbiter, the Vermillion Bird Crystals offers them the chance to become l'Cie. Class Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Severely weakened by the trials and demoralized at seeing Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post-war lives. They are found by Machina and Rem, who have returned to human form and, {{along with the rest}} of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and Rem unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with Rem at his side. A second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities Pulse and Lindzei, as part of an experiment to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm. Competing with each other to open the gateway using a different method, both failed and <b>reset</b> <b>the</b> world for another attempt.
