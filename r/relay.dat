40|$|Abstract – This paper {{provides}} a theoretical {{characterization of the}} multihop wireless communications channel. Four channel models are proposed and developed: the decoded <b>relaying</b> multihop channel, the amplified <b>relaying</b> multihop channel, the decoded <b>relaying</b> multihop diversity channel, and the amplified <b>relaying</b> multihop diversity channel. Two classifications are discussed: decoded <b>relaying</b> versus amplified <b>relaying</b> and multihop versus multihop diversity. When comparing decoded <b>relaying</b> with amplified <b>relaying</b> the primary considerations are noise propagation, error introduction, and delay. When comparing multihop with multihop diversity the primary considerations are performance and complexity.

40|$|Since {{the packet}} is {{transmitted}} {{to a set}} of <b>relaying</b> nodes in opportunistic routing strategy, so the transmission delay and the duplication transmission are serious. For reducing the transmission delay and the duplicate transmission, in this paper, we propose the delay based duplication transmission avoid (DDA) coordination scheme for opportunistic routing. In this coordination scheme, the candidate <b>relaying</b> nodes are divided into different fully connected <b>relaying</b> networks, so the duplicate transmission is avoided. Moreover, we propose the <b>relaying</b> network recognition algorithm which can be used to judge whether the sub-network is fully connected or not. The properties of the <b>relaying</b> networks are investigated in detail in this paper. When the fully connected <b>relaying</b> networks are got, they will be the basic units in the next hop <b>relaying</b> network selection. In this paper, we prove that the packet delivery ratio of the high priority <b>relaying</b> nodes in the <b>relaying</b> network has greater effection on the <b>relaying</b> delay than that of the low priority <b>relaying</b> nodes. According to this conclusion, in DDA, the <b>relaying</b> networks which the packet delivery ratios of the high priority <b>relaying</b> nodes are high have higher priority than that of the low one. During the next hop <b>relaying</b> network selection, the transmission delay, the network utility, and the packet delivery ratio are taken into account.
