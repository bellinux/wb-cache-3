5|$|A <b>research</b> <b>paper</b> {{published}} {{ten years}} after the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.|$|E
40|$|Classifying <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> into patent {{classification}} systems enables {{an exhaustive}} and effective invalidity search, prior art search, and technical trend analysis. However, {{it is very}} costly to classify <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> manually. Therefore, we have studied automatic classification of <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> into a patent classification system. To classify <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> into patent classification systems, the differences in terms used in <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> and patents {{should be taken into}} account. This is because or creative than those used in <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> in order to widen the scope of the claims. It is also necessary to do exhaustive searches and analyses that focus on classification of <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> written in various languages. To solve these problems, we propose some classification methods using two machine translation models. When translating English <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> into Japanese, the performance of a translation model for patents is inferior to that for <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> due to the differences in terms used in <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> and patents. However, the model for patents is thought to be useful for our task because translation results by patent translation models tend to contain more patent terms than those for <b>research</b> <b>papers.</b> To confirm the effectiveness of our methods, we conducted some experiments using the data of the Patent Mining Task in the NTCIR- 7 Workshop. From the experimental results, we found that our method using translation models for both <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> and patents was more effective than using a single translation model. ...|$|R

5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a protein with a function never before observed in nature.

The 2008 <b>research</b> <b>paper</b> from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important proof of concept for this protein design method. This type of protein design could have future applications in drug discovery, green chemistry, and bioremediation.|$|E
5|$|The {{curriculum}} emphasizes writing; {{students are}} required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and are required to complete a <b>research</b> <b>paper</b> during their third year. All students must pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually in their area of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis is required of all students. Usually an analytic or expository essay, it may also be a piece of original fiction, poetry, a performance or work of visual art. Students are encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public is invited to the presentations.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the thematic structures in students’ <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> and oral presentations. Specifically, it focuses on two aspects, i. e. types of Theme and realizations of topical Theme in students’ <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> and oral presentations. It is qualitative in nature, and involves three students’ <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> and transcribed students’ oral presentations as the main research data. Findings from the research show differences of thematic structures in students’ <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> and oral presentations {{in terms of the}} types of Theme used and realizations of topical Theme. Firstly, the types of Theme used in students’ <b>research</b> <b>papers</b> and oral presentations were interpersonal, textual, and topical.

5|$|Although {{meteorologist}} David Roth {{assessed the}} storm as making landfall on August19 at Isle Dernière {{to the west}} of New Orleans, a <b>research</b> <b>paper</b> from the American Meteorological Society estimated that the hurricane moved ashore about 40mi (60km) southeast of New Orleans. Modern research suggests the storm was the equivalent of a major hurricane (a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale), or with winds of at least , when it made landfall. It passed just southwest of the city, becoming the closest major hurricane to New Orleans. The wind diameter was average to slightly below-average, and the forward speed was normal. Due to its movement, the hurricane likely maintained much of its strength after making landfall and by the time it affected New Orleans. The hurricane gradually weakened over land, passing near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi on August20. Heavy rainfall was reported in eastern Ohio beginning on August21, potentially from the remnants of the storm merging with a cold front.|$|E
