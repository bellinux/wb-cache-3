5|$|Weston {{is close}} to {{junction}} 21 of the M5 motorway, {{to which it is}} linked by a dual-carriageway <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> built in the 1990s. This replaced Locking Road as the designated A370 route and avoided some of the traffic congestion along that narrower urban road.|$|E
5|$|The A354 road {{connects the}} town to the A35 trunk road in Dorchester, and terminates at Easton on the Isle of Portland. The A353 road runs east from Weymouth {{to the south of}} Warmwell, where it connects with the A352 to the Isle of Purbeck and Wareham. The B3157 road runs west from Weymouth to the south of Bridport where it terminates and connects to the A35. In the 1980s the town centre was {{bypassed}} by the A354 to Portland, but the government's road building policy changed before a proposed <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> could be completed. Before completion of the <b>relief</b> <b>road,</b> the A354 followed its original route through Upwey and Broadwey, where traffic problems were common at peak tourist times, particularly on event days such as the carnival.|$|E
5|$|The {{village is}} on the A340 road, and has nearby access to the A4 road and the M4 motorway. Newbury Buses route 104 serves the village, with {{services}} terminating in Newbury, Calcot and Reading. The 2005 Parish Plan identified {{a need for a}} <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> near the village. A report was presented in 2009 evaluating the problems caused by HGV traffic through the village, and described solutions which included support from Newbury MP Richard Benyon.|$|E
50|$|The {{course of}} the road has changed {{significantly}} since the 1960s {{with the construction of}} several bypasses and <b>relief</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R

5|$|Reading {{was a major}} {{staging point}} on the old Bath Road (A4) from London to Avonmouth, near Bristol. This road still carries local traffic, but has now been {{replaced}} for long distance traffic by the M4 motorway, which closely skirts the borough and serves it with three junctions, J10-J12. Other main roads serving Reading include the A33, A327, A329, A4074 and A4155. Within Reading there is the Inner Distribution Road (IDR), a ring road for local traffic. The IDR is linked with the M4 by the A33 <b>relief</b> <b>road.</b> National Express Coaches run out of Reading Coachway, at Junction 12 of the M4. The Thames is crossed by both Reading and Caversham road bridges, while several road bridges cross the Kennet, the oldest surviving {{one of which is}} High Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Two {{main roads}} service the area, the A4058 {{runs through the}} Rhondda Fawr and the A4233 {{services}} the Rhondda Fach. The A4058 starts at Pontypridd runs through Porth before ending at Treorchy, where it joins the A4061 to Hirwaun. The A4233 begins outside Rhondda at Tonyrefail, heading north through Porth and through the Rhondda Fach to Maerdy, where the road eventually links up with the A4059 at Aberdare. Two other A roads service the area; the A4119 is a <b>relief</b> <b>road,</b> known as the Tonypandy Bypass {{and the other is}} the A4061 which links Treorchy to the Ogmore Vale before reaching Bridgend.|$|E
5|$|The {{line from}} Northallerton railway station along Ripon Line {{was closed to}} {{passengers}} on 6 March 1967 and to goods on 5 September 1969 {{as part of the}} wider Beeching Axe, despite a vigorous campaign by local campaigners, including the (nearby city of Ripon) city's MP. Today much of the route of the line through the city (Ripon) is now a <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> and although the former station still stands, it is now surrounded by a new housing development. The issue remains a significant one in local politics and there are movements wanting to restore the line. Reports suggest the reopening of a line between Ripon and Harrogate railway station would be economically viable, costing £40million and could initially attract 1,200 passengers a day, rising to 2,700. Campaigners call on MPs to restore Ripon railway link.|$|E
50|$|To {{alleviate}} congestion which frequently sees loaded trains queuing, in November 2013 construction commenced on five <b>relief</b> <b>roads</b> at Hexham {{that will}} be located between the two running lines, with the westbound line relocated further south. This will allow coal trains to be pass one another and reach the ports in a more logical order. It is scheduled for completion in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Several major {{expansion}} projects {{around the}} town are planned over the next decade, including a major redevelopment of the town centre, new north and south <b>relief</b> <b>roads</b> and at the former military base at nearby Arborfield Garrison. As of 2015, the redevelopment of the railway station and surrounding area is complete, and large scale housing construction is underway to the north-east and south-east of the town.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{it was evident}} that Wetherby was going to grow. In 1965 it was {{estimated}} that by 1981, the town's population would double to 12,000 and this estimate proved quite accurate. There were ambitious plans to relieve growing congestion through the town centre and on the A58 and A661 by converting the disused railways into <b>relief</b> <b>roads.</b> These suggestions never came to fruition.|$|R
5|$|After the viaduct {{the road}} becomes Southend Road, passing north of Walthamstow, and {{immediately}} before the Crooked Billet junction, the former site of Walthamstow greyhound racing track. It continues eastward, cutting through a southern section of Epping Forest and meeting the Woodford New Road at Waterworks Corner, before an elevated junction with the M11 motorway and Southend Road heading to Gants Hill. The South Woodford to Barking <b>Relief</b> <b>Road</b> (the section between the M11 and A13) opened in 1987. Previously, the A406 extended along Southend Road and Woodford Avenue as far east as Gants Hill. The current {{route of the}} North Circular Road turns south, passing Eastern Avenue (A12) on a flyover at the Redbridge roundabout. It passes Romford Road (the historic Roman Road from London to Colchester) {{to the west of}} Ilford and London Road, Barking, and ends at a roundabout with the A13 Newham Way / Alfred's Way in Beckton. To reach the Woolwich Ferry, traffic must follow local roads to the ferry terminal. This leads across the River Thames, connecting with the eastern end of the South Circular Road {{on the other side of}} the river. The junction with the A13 has been built to enable the North Circular to be continued across the junction to the Thames Gateway Bridge if and when it is built.|$|E
25|$|The {{village is}} split into roughly two halves, intersected by the A624 <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> (locally {{referred}} to as the bypass although it goes through, rather than round, the village). One half contains the traditional village centre, including several shops, businesses, and St. Matthew's Parish Church, while the other half contains mostly dwellings along with a handful of businesses, the bus station and St. John's Methodist Church. The <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> was built to ease heavy traffic that once travelled through the narrow main streets of the village.|$|E
25|$|South of the River Thames, the ECR (A102) skirts Tunnel Avenue {{and flies}} over Blackwall Lane (A2203) and Woolwich Road (A206) before {{climbing}} the hill towards the Sun-in-the-Sands interchange where it passes under Shooters Hill Road (A2/A207) and becomes the Rochester Way <b>Relief</b> <b>Road</b> (A2). It squeezes through the tight space between Rochester Way (the old A2 route) and Woolacombe Road before it {{ends at the}} Kidbrooke interchange where it connects to Kidbrooke Park Road (A2213) or continues as the later section of the Rochester Way <b>Relief</b> <b>Road</b> built in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|A {{bottleneck}} in {{the federal}} trunk road network (B61) was eliminated at the existing railway overpass at Bassum with the partial removal of the embankment {{in the autumn of}} 2009. In Ströhen a hall has been built over the track. In the Sulingen area several level crossings were eliminated, in some cases during the construction of <b>relief</b> <b>roads.</b> The level crossing on the B61 in Neuenkirchen has also been removed. The other sections are now mostly overgrown with scrub.|$|R
50|$|The Hailsham & Hellingly Masterplan, {{submitted}} to Wealden District Council as supplementary planning guidance in 2009, planned a {{holistic approach to}} the town's infrastructure: roads; sewerage and drainage; transport; retail; employment land; housing; healthcare; education and training; leisure, recreation and the arts. Among the Masterplan’s proposals were long-term visualisations for the town's roads, including two major (new) <b>relief</b> <b>roads</b> which would make the High Street and town centre more pedestrian-friendly, a community-based diagnostic and treatment centre with GP surgeries, and a community park/complex.|$|R
5000|$|In Erdington and Sutton Coldfield, the {{original}} A5127 has been bypassed {{a second time}} by more minor urban <b>relief</b> <b>roads,</b> easing congestion in and allowing partial pedestrianisation of their respective town centre shopping areas. A further bypass between Sutton centre and the northern junction with the A453 Tamworth Road has long been under consideration to remove pressure from the narrow, mediaeval [...] "high street" [...] section (that features a pair of historic coaching inns and was, originally, part of the A38), but no actual plans have yet been confirmed even after many decades of discussion.|$|R
25|$|The town is {{situated}} {{close to the}} junction of the A325 Farnborough Road and A331 Blackwater Valley <b>Relief</b> <b>Road,</b> which provides {{a link to the}} M3 Motorway junction 4.|$|E
25|$|The M4 <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> {{skirting}} {{the southern edge}} of the urban area of Newport is proposed as a means of reducing the congestion on the existing M4 motorway (presently squeezed through the Brynglas Tunnels) and making Newport and the surrounding areas more accessible. There have also been calls for a barrage across the River Usk to be incorporated with the M4 bypass, so that the level of the river would stay permanently at high tide level, although possible plans for a Severn barrage across the River Severn would reduce the need for a River Usk barrage. The <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> scheme was cancelled in July 2009 but relaunched in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The UK's first privately {{operated}} motorway {{opened in}} 2003. The M6 Toll (originally the Birmingham Northern <b>Relief</b> <b>Road)</b> {{is designed to}} relieve the M6 through Birmingham, {{which is one of}} the most heavily used roads in the country.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{restoring}} the canal was first developed in 1975, {{as a result}} of legislation requiring planning authorities to produce county structure plans. The West Midlands structure plan included the concept of the restored canal as a linear park, and included a bypass to avoid the section destroyed by opencast mining. Further threats to the route from the proposed Birmingham Northern <b>Relief</b> <b>Road</b> {{led to the formation of}} the Ogley and Hatherton Restoration Society in 1989, after the Inland Waterways Association held a rally at Pelsall to highlight the plight of the canal. The Society later became the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust, while the <b>relief</b> <b>road</b> became the M6 Toll motorway.|$|E
25|$|The site of {{the station}} {{buildings}} has since been redeveloped with small industrial units. In 2006 the A23 Coulsdon <b>Relief</b> <b>Road</b> was constructed through its site.

50|$|The {{position}} of Blackwood is mid valley between Risca {{the southern end}} of the Sirhowy River where the river merges with the Ebbw River which leads into the Severn Estuary at Newport. Until recently the main road through the town was the only road used by heavy haulage and cars alike. The Chartist Bridge has been built linking a number of well engineered single carriageway <b>relief</b> <b>roads,</b> meaning none of the journey from Blackwood to Newport now has to go through residential streets, all is on high quality new roads.
