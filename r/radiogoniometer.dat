25|$|To {{complete}} the system, an electronic switch was added that was timed to the 50Hz signal of the National Grid. The signal {{was used to}} switch the input to the receivers from the range antenna, to output {{of the other two}} antennas mixed through the <b>radiogoniometer.</b> The same signal also adjusted the Y-axis bias of the CRT slightly, so that alternate traces appeared above or below the center of a new CRT dedicated for elevation measurements. The result was that the upper trace contained the original range signal as before, while the lower trace contained the <b>radiogoniometer</b> output; by looking along the lower trace under the range blip, the operator could turn the <b>radiogoniometer</b> until the signal reached a null, revealing the angle. The operator would periodically adjust the setting as the lower blip re-appeared while the target moved.|$|E
25|$|Overall the GL/EF {{equipped}} {{systems were}} similar to the Mk. I, but added another set of antennas positioned vertically along a ladder projecting {{from the top of}} the receiver cabin. The original range antenna was mounted at the bottom of the ladder, with two new antennas equally spaced out along it. The antennas were spaced by about half a wavelength, so the signals would interfere constructively on one pair and destructively on the other. A <b>radiogoniometer</b> was used to change the relative sensitivity of the upper pair of antennas, and the outputs of the <b>radiogoniometer</b> and range antenna were sent to separate pre-amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|Even slight mis-alignment {{of the two}} {{causes a}} bias in the output, a false null. Since this was fixed {{as part of the}} {{construction}} of the <b>radiogoniometer,</b> it was simple enough to correct for this simply by moving the pointer. Slip-rings or nuts were commonly used.|$|E
25|$|During the war, new {{techniques}} like huff-duff began to replace <b>radiogoniometers</b> {{in the intelligence}} gathering role, reducing {{the time needed to}} take an accurate fix from minutes to seconds. The ability to inexpensively process radio signals using microcontrollers allowed pseudo-doppler direction finders to take over most of the <b>radiogoniometer's</b> remaining roles from the 1980s. In spite of seeing little use today, the original antennae of BTDF systems can still be seen on many ships and boats.|$|R
25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem is to wind the sense coil in two pairs, each displaced from either side of the centerline by 22.5 degrees. This makes the error in one coil the opposite of the other, a condition that remains true around the entire circle. The correction is never perfect, the precise angles had to be experimented with on every <b>radiogoniometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} the GL/EF, for Gun Laying/Elevation Finder, {{although}} known almost universally as the Bedford Attachment. This modification added a set of vertical antennas and a new elevation-measuring CRT to read them, along with a <b>radiogoniometer</b> that allowed the vertical angle to be accurately measured. Mk. I*'s with GL/EF began to deploy in early 1941, just as The Blitz was reaching a crescendo.|$|E
25|$|A Bellini–Tosi {{direction}} finder (B–T or BTDF) {{is a type}} of radio {{direction finder}} (RDF), which determines the direction to, or bearing of, a radio transmitter. Earlier RDF systems used very large rotating loop antennae, which the B–T system replaced with two fixed antennae and a small rotating loop, known as a <b>radiogoniometer.</b> This made RDF much more practical, especially on large vehicles like ships or when using very long wavelengths that demand large antennae.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{a system}} {{originally}} {{developed in the}} French ITT laboratories was widely used. The ITT team had fled France {{in front of the}} German invasion and destroyed their equipment before leaving. They were able to quickly duplicate their efforts once reaching the US. This system used a motor to quickly spin a <b>radiogoniometer,</b> as well as providing an input to electronics that spun the X and Y inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). This caused the signal to trace out a pattern on the display {{that could be used to}} determine the direction of the transmission almost instantly.|$|E
25|$|As {{the system}} was being developed, a further {{improvement}} was introduced that allowed for continuous following as opposed to periodic re-setting. The switching system was modified such that the range {{was sent to the}} upper line for 2.5milliseconds (ms), and the range and <b>radiogoniometer</b> signals for 7.5ms. If the signal was properly nulled, the two upper signals would mix and produce a single bright blip on the upper trace, while the lower trace would be nulled, as before. If the signal was not nulled, a faint second blip would appear to smear out the upper trace, noticeable even before the blip on the lower trace became visible.|$|E
25|$|The {{directional}} {{qualities of}} the <b>radiogoniometer</b> work in both directions; {{it can be used}} to determine the direction of an incoming signal, or change the direction of a transmission. During early experiments, this capability was used to produce a radio signal that swept the sky like a lighthouse beam, allowing conventional radio receivers to determine their location by timing the passage of the signal. A typical solution was to broadcast a specific start signal, often Morse code, to start the sweep, and the slowly sweep a steady signal after that. The operator timed from the end of the start signal to the maximum in the continuous tone, and then divided by the rotation rate to determine the angle.|$|E
25|$|Even {{minor changes}} in the weather, {{physical}} layout or even bumping the chassis containing the tunable capacitors can cause the tuning to vary. For this reason a variety of systems were used to decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>radiogoniometer</b> to mis-tuning. Primary among these was the aperiodic aerial concept, which described the mechanical layout of the radiogoniometer's internal wiring. By winding the sense coil wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the field coils in a similar arrangement {{as close as possible to}} the sense coil, the entire circuit became capacitively coupled. A single tunable capacitor on the output from the sense coil could then be used to tune the entire system.|$|E
25|$|Shortwave signals {{presented}} {{a problem for}} RDF because the skywave signal can be simultaneously received from several hops, making it appear as if the transmitter is at several different bearings. The solution had already been studied, although not in order to solve this specific problem. In 1917 Frank Adcock was {{trying to solve the}} problem of making large antennae suitable for use with the <b>radiogoniometer</b> at even the longest wavelengths. He developed a system using four very tall masts, connected together electrically to form two virtual loops. This eliminated the need to connect the tops of the antennae, which were otherwise difficult to connect together for very large antennae. However, it was later found that the underground connections between the antennae shielded them from skywaves, allowing only the direct-line groundwave to reach the goniometer.|$|E

50|$|This {{reception}} pattern provided CH with {{a relatively}} accurate way to estimate the altitude of the target. To do this, the motorized switch in the receiver hut was used to disconnect the four receiver masts and instead select the two vertically displaced antennas on one mast. When connected to the <b>radiogoniometer,</b> the output on the display was now effected by the relative signal strength of the two lobes, rather than the relative strengths in X and Y in the horizontal plane. The operator swung the <b>radiogoniometer</b> looking for the peak or minimum reception, as before, and noted the angle.|$|E

50|$|The Air Staff {{was slow}} to respond to Dowding's request due to a {{shortage}} of cathode ray tubes (CRTs), {{and by the end}} of 1937 only five sectors were equipped. However, during tests in March 1938, the value of DF as part of the reporting system became very clear to all involved, and on 14 April 1938 the Air Ministry ordered a further 29 sets to equip all sectors. These were initially delivered without a CRT and required longer to reliably determine direction using a manual <b>radiogoniometer,</b> but they could be upgraded as CRTs arrived.|$|E

50|$|The number {{reported}} by the operator was the line-of-sight range to the target, or slant range, which included components of both the horizontal distance and altitude. To convert this to the real range on the ground, the plotter used basic trigonometry on a right angle triangle; the slant range was the hypotenuse and the open angle was the measurement from the <b>radiogoniometer.</b> The base and opposite sides could then be calculated, revealing the distance and altitude. An important correction was the curvature of the Earth, which became significant at the ranges CH worked at. Once calculated, this allowed the range to be properly plotted, revealing the grid square for the target, which was then reported up the chain.|$|E
50|$|A single 12.7 mm (0.5 in) in a turret in mid-fuselage, was {{manned by}} the co-pilot. A seat {{for the flight}} {{engineer}} was later fitted.

The aircraft was also equipped with an APR 3 camera which although not fixed, was normally operated through a small window. The wireless operator also had a 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine gun in the ventral position. All this equipment made him very busy; as a result, an extra man was often carried. The aircraft had very wide glazed surfaces in the nose, cockpit, and the central and aft fuselage; much more than in other Italian aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The {{receiver}} {{consisted of}} an Adcock array consisting of four 240 foot m tall wooden towers arranged {{at the corners}} of a square. Each tower had three sets (originally two) of receiver antennas, one at 45, 95 and 215 feet off the ground. The mean height of the transmitter stack was 215 feet, which is why the topmost antenna was positioned at the same altitude in order to produce a reception pattern that was identical to the transmission. A set of motor-driven mechanical switches allowed the operator to select which antenna was active. The output of the selected antenna on all four towers was sent to a single <b>radiogoniometer</b> system (not Watt's own huff-duff solution). By connecting the antennas together in X-Y pairs the horizontal bearing could be measured, while connecting together the upper and lower antennas allowed the same goniometer to be used to measure the vertical angle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiver}} system, {{built by}} A.C. Cossor to a TRE design, was a multiple-stage superheterodyne. The {{signal from the}} selected antennas on the receiver towers were fed through the <b>radiogoniometer</b> and then into a three-stage amplifier, with each stage housed in a metal screen box to avoid interference between the stages. Each stage used a Class B amplifier arrangement of EF8s, special low noise, [...] "aligned-grid" [...] pentodes. The output of the initial amplifier was then sent to the intermediate frequency mixer, which extracted a user-selectable amount of the signal, 500, 200 or 50 kHz as selected by a switch on the console. The first setting allowed most of the signal through, and was used under most circumstances. The other settings were available to block out interference, but did so by also blocking some of the signal which reduced the overall sensitivity of the system.|$|E
50|$|The HF Adcock {{stations}} {{consisted of}} four 10m vertical antennas surrounding {{a small wooden}} operators hut containing a receiver and a radio-goniometer which was adjusted to obtain the bearing. MF stations were also used which used four guyed 30m lattice tower antennas. In 1941 RSS began experimenting with Spaced Loop direction finders, developed by the Marconi company and the UK National Physical Laboratories. These consisted of two parallel loops 1 to 2m square {{on the ends of}} a rotatable 3 to 8m beam. The angle of the beam was combined with results from a <b>radiogoniometer</b> to provide a bearing. The bearing obtained was considerably sharper than that obtained with the U Adcock system, but there were ambiguities which prevented the installation of 7 proposed S.L DF systems. The operator of an SL system was in a metal underground tank below the antennas. Seven underground tanks were installed, but only two SL systems were installed at Wymondham, Norfolk and Weaverthorp in Yorkshire. Problems were encountered resulting in the remaining five underground tanks being fitted with Adcock systems. The rotating SL antenna was turned by hand which meant successive measurements were a lot slower than turning the dial of a goniometer.|$|E
