5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the <b>Rhine</b> Campaign of 1796, Austria had two armies in Germany, the Army of the Upper <b>Rhine</b> under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and the Army of the Lower <b>Rhine</b> under Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. The left wing of the 80,000-man Army of the Upper <b>Rhine</b> guarded the <b>Rhine</b> River from Mannheim to Switzerland under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé while its right wing was on the west bank around Kaiserslautern. The Army of the Lower <b>Rhine</b> had a 20,000-strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The archduke's remaining 70,000 troops lay on the west bank along the Nahe River with powerful garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress.|$|E

5|$|Moreau sent Desaix's wing to {{the west}} bank of the <b>Rhine</b> at Breisach and, with the main part of his army, offered battle at Schliengen. Saint-Cyr held the low ground on the left near the <b>Rhine</b> while Ferino defended the hills on the right. Charles hoped to turn the French right and trap Moreau's army against the <b>Rhine.</b> In the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October, the French {{suffered}} 1,200 casualties out of 32,000 engaged. The Austrians counted 800 casualties out of 36,000 men. The French held off the Austrian attacks but retreated the next day and recrossed {{to the west}} bank of the <b>Rhine</b> on 26 October. The In the south, the French held two east bank bridgeheads. Moreau ordered Desaix to defend Kehl while Ferino and Abbatucci were to hold Hüningen.|$|E

5|$|Rather {{than simply}} quell the mutiny however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers {{and led them}} on a short {{campaign}} across the <b>Rhine</b> into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus.

5|$|The French {{military}} strategy against Austria {{was for a}} three-pronged invasion to surround Vienna, ideally capturing the city and forcing the Holy Roman Emperor into a surrender and acceptance of French Revolutionary ideals. The French assembled the Army of Sambre and Meuse commanded by Jean Baptiste Jourdan against the Austrian Army of the Lower <b>Rhine</b> in the north; the Army of the <b>Rhine</b> and Moselle, led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau, opposed the Austrian Army of the Upper <b>Rhine</b> {{in the south and}} the Army of Italy commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte approached Vienna through northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Rhine</b> Campaign of 1796 saw Moreau's army {{facing the}} Austrian Army of the Upper <b>Rhine</b> under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour in the south. Meanwhile, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's French Army of Sambre-et-Meuse opposed the Army of the Lower <b>Rhine</b> under Archduke Charles in the north. Jourdan drubbed Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg at Altenkirchen on 4 June, {{compelling}} Archduke Charles {{to rush to}} the rescue with reinforcements. Charles defeated Jourdan at Wetzlar on the 15th, forcing him to pull back {{to the west bank}} of the <b>Rhine.</b> At this time there was a shake up in the high command and the archduke was put in control of both Austrian armies. In Charles' absence, Moreau successfully crossed the <b>Rhine</b> at Kehl on the night of 23–24 June and beat Latour at Rastatt on 5 July. Leaving Wilhelm von Wartensleben in charge in the north, Charles rushed south to confront Moreau along the Alb River near Ettlingen. After an all-day combat, the Austrians held the advantage on their right wing near Malsch, but the French had defeated their left wing in the Black Forest.|$|E

5|$|Varsity {{was part}} of Operation Plunder, the Anglo-American-Canadian assault under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery to cross the {{northern}} <b>Rhine</b> River and from there enter Northern Germany.

5|$|Although the French and the Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the <b>Rhine</b> River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the <b>Rhine,</b> when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E
5|$|An {{alliance}} between the Iazyges and the Dacians led the Romans {{to focus more on}} the Danube than the <b>Rhine.</b> This is reflected by the placement of the Roman legions; During the time of Augustus's rule, there were eight legions stationed along the <b>Rhine,</b> four stationed in Mainz and another four in Cologne. Within a hundred years of Augustus' rule, however, Roman military resources had become centred along the Danube instead of the <b>Rhine,</b> with nine legions stationed along the Danube and only one at the <b>Rhine.</b> However, by the time of Marcus Aurelius, twelve legions were stationed along the Danube. The Romans also built a series of forts along the entire right bank of the Danubefrom Germany {{all the way to the}} Black Seaand in the provinces of Rhaetia, Noricum, and Pannonia the legions constructed bridge-head forts. Later, this system was expanded to the lower Danube, with the key castra of Poetovio, Brigetio, and Carnuntum. The Classis Pannonica and Classis Flavia Moesica were deployed to the right and lower Danube, respectively; however, they had to overcome the mass of whirlpools and cataracts of the Iron Gates.|$|E
