5|$|Natural selection, {{introduced}} in 1859 {{as the central}} mechanism of evolution by Charles Darwin, is the differential survival and <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> individuals {{due to differences in}} phenotype.

5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E
5|$|Automotive {{manufacturers}} {{often use}} patterns to disguise upcoming products. This camouflage {{is designed to}} obfuscate the vehicle's visual lines, and is used along with padding, covers, and decals. The patterns' purpose is to prevent visual observation (and {{to a lesser degree}} photography), that would subsequently enable <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle's form factors.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Rovers {{are known}} for their {{distinctive}} blue and white quartered shirts, which they have worn for most of their history. The current home kit consists of a light blue and white quartered shirt and white shorts, while the away kit is black and gold with the same colours as the trim. During the 2008–09 season a special third strip, which is black with a gold sash, and is a <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> the original Black Arab shirt, was used for a single match to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the club.|$|E

5|$|For several decades, {{no natural}} <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> pallid {{sturgeon}} was observed, {{since all the}} fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed by Christmas presentations through the holiday season.|$|E

5|$|Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany was {{a serious}} subject. He taught Linnaeus to {{classify}} plants according to Tournefort's system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> plants, according to Sébastien Vaillant. In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in Lund University in Skåne. He was registered as , the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.|$|E
5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> the Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces {{a sequence of}} frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special brake circuit {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E
5|$|The disease runs most {{rampant in}} the {{subtropical}} conditions which encourage <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> its mosquito vectors among which Culex tarsalis is most significant. Mortality rates {{appear to be}} higher than those in other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area. Crows cannot transmit the virus to humans directly.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete — living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared {{sometime in the}} late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it {{is found in the}} eutherian Eomaia and the metatherian Sinodelphys, both dated to 125 million years ago. Epipubic bones, a feature that strongly influenced the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> most mammal clades, are first found in Tritylodontidae, suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and mammaliformes. They are omnipresent in non-placental mammaliformes, though Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium appear to have lacked them.|$|E
5|$|The oxazolidinones are protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors: they stop {{the growth and}} <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> bacteria by disrupting translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins in the ribosome. Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, linezolid appears {{to work on the}} first step of {{protein synthesis}}, initiation, unlike most other protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit elongation.|$|E
