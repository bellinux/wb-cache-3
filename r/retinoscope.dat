40|$|AIM:To {{explore the}} microfluctuation change of eye {{accommodation}} in adolescents with ametropic amblyopia under same amount comprehensive amblyopia treatment and the efficacy for dominant eye. METHODS:Teenagers who took routine physical examination were {{chosen as the}} research object. Copper card method was used to identify the dominant eye and the main eye in adolescents with ametropic amblyopia which was the observation group, 63 cases with 63 eyes each. Sixty subjects with emmetropia were as the normal group. The research objects underwent mydriasis optometry, computer optometry and streak <b>retinoscopes</b> to determine the diopter. The patients with ametropic amblyopia were treated with same amount comprehensive amblyopia treatment, and wearing glasses. There was not any treatment for normal group. The curative effect of same amount comprehensive amblyopia treatment were tested between the observation group and the control group when treating at 1, 3, 6 and 12 mo respectively. Microfluctuation changes when reading at the distance of 25, 33 and 50 cm(5 min for every distance) {{of the two groups}} were tested. Then the low frequencies(LFC) of microfluctuation change was calculated and analyzed. The whole eye aberration of the normal group and the observation group were tested with i-Trace Wave Scan Wavefront, and the corneal aberration was collected and calculated with Humphrey corneal topographer. Microfluctuation changes of the two groups were compared and the relation between the accommodation index and the wavefront aberration was analyzed. RESULTS:Through statistical analysis, the LFC value of the observation group at 25, 33 and 50 cm respectively was 0. 086 ± 0. 022, 0. 057 ± 0. 032 and 0. 041 ± 0. 028 D 2 /Hz, which was significantly higher than the LFC value of the normal group which was 0. 047 ± 0. 023, 0. 037 ± 0. 021, 0. 027 ± 0. 011 D 2 /Hz(P CONCLUSION:Under the same amount treatment, the short-term curative effect of dominant eyes in children with ametropic amblyopia is superior to the non-dominant ones. While the differences of medium and long-term efficacy have no statistical significance. There is no difference on corneal aberration between dominant and non-dominant eyes. At near distance, the LFC of microfluctuation change was higher in amblyopia patients than that in normals...|$|R

40|$|In medical ophthalmology, {{refractive}} {{studies have}} {{become an integral part}} of a complete ophthalmic examination and second only to a slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination in determining visual function and ability. This study shows that the same ideology applies to refractive studies on dogs. The refraction technique has evolved in process, with refinement of the technology and methods used; with the development of handheld autorefractors utilised in paediatric refraction. Fifty guide dogs completed this study however five of the dogs were subsequently excluded and replaced because of poor compliance. Forty six of the dogs were Labrador Retrievers; one was a Golden Retriever, one a Great Dane cross, one a Labrador cross and one a cross breed. The median sample age was 17 months with an interquartile range (IQR) of 13 to 34 months. We validated the agreement in refractive error measurement between the Welch Allyn ™ "SureSight" (WASS) autorefractor to the traditional Welch Allyn ™ handheld streak <b>retinoscope</b> (SR) by two experienced investigators, due to previous studies showing variability in measurement for both instruments. The refractive state for 60 °/o of the guide dogs sampled at South African Guide Dogs Association (SAGDA) were emmetropic (- 0. 5 to + 0. 5 D), 34 % were hypermetropic (>+ 0. 5 D) with 6 % myopic (- 0. 50 cylinder) was detected more readily on the WASS (37 dogs) than on the SR (9 dogs). Between investigators the MSE measurements differed significantly (P = 0. 02), with the average agreement on the SR slightly better than the WASS. Overall, the handheld manual streak <b>retinoscope</b> remains the more practical, cost effective and efficient instrument for objective refraction in dogs. We can also conclude, that current subjective criteriae utilised in the selection of guide dogs at SAGA can be further improved by including objective methods of refraction.

METHODS:Respectively using hand-held autorefractor and streak <b>retinoscope</b> to do optometry examination in 317 cadet candidates students(634 eyes) after mydriasis. Main index of refraction values(spherical, cylindrical mirror degree and axial) were analyzed by difference test and correlation analysis. And the elimination rate was comparatively analyzed. RESULTS:Diopters of sphere and cyclic refraction measured by hand-held autorefration {{were significantly higher than}} those by retinoscopy(P r = 0. 733, 0. 694), axial of refration measured by these two methods were non-significant(P > 0. 05). The disqualifying rate using autorefraction was much higher than that using retinoscopy. It was easy to be wrongly eliminated. CONCLUSION:Because of the high correlation between diopters of autorefraction measured by retinascopy and autorefractor, autorefraction has application value in refraction screening in cadet candidates with normal vision...|$|E

In the three turtles investigated, the refractions increased continuously from the ventral to the dorsal visual field over a range of 35, 40 and 56 D, respectively. While this finding confirms the presence of an adaptive change of the refractive state equivalent to lower field myopia, subsequent measure-ments with a rotated <b>retinoscope</b> showed that {{at least part of the}} variation in the ventral field was attributed to astigmatism.

40|$|The {{accommodation}} {{that the}} eye uses to focus {{at a certain}} distance does not correspond exactly with {{the value of the}} accommodative stimulus. Such accommodation matches the diopter value of what is called the accommodative response. The Nott method is used in the optometric examination to measure the accommodative response at 40 cm by dynamic retinoscopy. The test is performed with the eye compensated by its neutralizing lens (PNL), obtained from binocular subjective examination. In the literature one can find a measurement procedure in which an accommodative test is situated at a distance of 40 cm, starting from that distance, the optometrist without moving the test, shifts the <b>retinoscope</b> until he finds the point of neutralization. The value of the lead or lag of accommodation is usually obtained by subtracting at 2. 50 D the inverse of the distance to the point of neutralization (in meters). The value of 2. 50 D is considered accommodative stimulus at 40 cm.

Methods: A total of 54 healthy eyes {{were enrolled in the}} study. Following pupil dilation, aberrations were measured with the iTrace and OPD Scan. We compared the aberrations obtained from measurements obtained at pupillary diameters of 4 mm and 6 mm with the OPD Scan and iTrace. Aberrations of internal optics and total aberrations were compared for the two aberrometers. For each aberrometer and each eye, the averaged Zernike data were used to calculate various root-mean-square (RMS) data.

40|$|The dark {{focus is}} a resting state of accommodation, which occurs {{when there are}} not enough stimuli for the eye to focus on. This means that the eye becomes more myopic and some people notice a blur for example at night time, more known as night myopia. In this study the dark focus in Swedish myopes is {{measured}} and any difference between early and late onset myopes is investigated. Method: The dominant eye of 56 myopes was first measured with static retinoscopy, using a distant target, and then with near retinoscopy, with the <b>retinoscope</b> beam as the target. The full working distance of 2. 00 D was subtracted in both methods and the values were compared. The difference, if any, was the dark focus. Results: The mean value of dark focus was 0. 53 D ± 0. 26 for the entire group. The mean value for early onset myopes was 0. 56 D ± 0. 29 and for late onset myopes the mean value was 0. 47 D ± 0. 21. This showed no significant difference (p-value = 0. 18). No significant correlation between amount of refractive error and dark focus was found.

40|$|AbstractPurposeChildhood {{accommodation}} {{interferes with}} accurate {{diagnosis of the}} latent refractive errors. Dynamic retinoscopy offers accurate measurements of accommodative response, while an autorefractometer can predict the accommodative system activation in children. A correlation of the accommodative effort with the dynamic refraction has been investigated in emmetropic children, before and after cycloplegia. MethodsA prospective clinical study of accommodative effort in 149 emmetropic children, in the age group 3 – 16 years, has been conducted using TOPCON AR RM- 8000 B autorefractor. Dynamic refraction was performed by monocular estimation method before and after cycloplegia, using the <b>retinoscope</b> mirror light as target. Retinoscopic reflex produced ‘with the motion’ was corrected with positive spherical lenses, and that ‘against the motion’ was corrected with negative spherical lenses, to achieve neutralization. ResultsMean accommodative effort measured for 149 children {{included in the study}} was − 0. 63 ± 0. 69 D and dynamic refraction was − 0. 07 ± 0. 44 D before cycloplegia, while the mean was+ 0. 52 D after cycloplegia, irrespective of the method used. Autorefractor measured − 0. 17 D of accommodative effort per unit change in dynamic refraction before cycloplegia and + 0. 90 D after cycloplegia. ConclusionsThe performance of TOPCON AR RM- 8000 B autorefractor was comparable to dynamic retinoscopy. Presence of many children, and in turn, large number of accommodative response data in 11 – 13 and 14 – 15 years group is probably linked to prolonged reading/writing.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis were carried out {{because of a lack}} of previous research with respect to (a) the habits and attitudes towards retinoscopy and (b) the relative accuracy of dedicated retinoscopes compared to combined types in which changing the bulb allows use in spot or streak mode. An online British survey received responses from 298 optometrists. Decision tree analyses revealed that optometrists working in multiple practices tended to rely less on retinoscopy than those in the independent sector. Only half of the respondents used dynamic retinoscopy. The majority, however, agreed that retinoscopy was an important test. The University attended also influenced the type of <b>retinoscope</b> used and the use of autorefractors. Combined retinoscopes were used most by the more recently qualified optometrists and few agreed that combined retinoscopes were less accurate. A trial indicated that combined and dedicated retinoscopes were equally accurate. Here, 4 optometrists (2 using spot and 2 using streak retinoscopes) tested one eye of 6 patients using combined and dedicated retinoscopes. This trial also demonstrated the utility of the relatively unknown ’ 15 degrees of freedom’ rule that exploits replication in factorial ANOVA designs to achieve sufficient statistical power when recruitment is limited. An opportunistic international survey explored the use of retinoscopy by 468 practitioners (134 ophthalmologists, 334 optometrists) attending contact related courses. Decision tree analyses found (a) no differences in the habits of optometrists and ophthalmologists, (b) differences in the reliance on retinoscopy and use of dynamic techniques across the participating countries and (c) some evidence that younger practitioners were using static and dynamic retinoscopy least often. In conclusion, this study has revealed infrequent use of static and dynamic retinoscopy by some optometrists, which may be the only means of determining refractive error and evaluating accommodation in patients with communication difficulties...|$|E
40|$|Background : Current {{amblyopia}} {{screening methods}} are not cost effective. Aim : To evaluate the diagnostic capability of a modified Br&# 252;ckner test (MBT) for amblyopiogenic risk factors. Materials and Methods : We applied the MBT using the streak <b>retinoscope</b> to identify anisometropia and strabismus by noting an inter-ocular difference in movement and glow, from children who failed 6 / 9 Snellen on community vision screening, followed by comprehensive eye examination. Statisitics : Data {{were analyzed by}} 2 &# 935; 2 tables for diagnostic test parameters (95 &#x 0025; CI). Results : From 7998 children vision-screened, 392 failed 6 / 9 VA and were referred. Since 34 failed to reach the centers, and 15 were excluded due to poor/ no glow, data from 343 was analyzed. The prevalence of anisometropia of 0. 5 D was 17 &#x 0025;, of 1 D was 11 &#x 0025; and of strabismus 5 &#x 0025;. For the MBT the accuracy was &# 8805; 90 &#x 0025; (95 &#x 0025;CI 89 &#x 0025; to 97 &#x 0025;) over the three outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, NPV and &#x 002 B;LR for anisometropia of 0. 5 D were: 0. 57 (0. 48, 0. 64), 0. 97 (0. 95, 0. 98), 0. 92 (0. 90, 0. 93) and 18 (9. 7, 35); for 1 D: 0. 74 (0. 60, 0. 82), 0. 95 (0. 94, 0. 97), 0. 97 (0. 95, 0. 98) and 16 (9. 3, 28); and for strabismus: 0. 5 (0. 32, 0. 66), 0. 98 (0. 97, 0. 98), 0. 97 (0. 96, 0. 98) and 20 (9. 1, 42). Conclusion : Our data suggests that the MBT is highly accurate and useful for ruling in anisometropia and strabismus in children who fail 6 / 9 Snellen. The MBT needs further validation, both by different care givers and on differing populations. It offers an affordable, portable, and clinically useful tool to detect anisometropia and strabismus.

40|$|Background: The {{syndrome}} Multiple Congenital Ocular Anomalies (MCOA) is a congenital {{eye disease}} in horses. Previous {{studies have shown}} that both the MCOA syndrome and the silver coat color in horses are caused by the same missense mutation in PMEL 17. Horses homozygous for the Silver mutation (TT) are affected by multiple eye defects causing visual impairment or even blindness. Horses heterozygous for the Silver mutation (CT) usually have iridociliary cysts, occasionally extending into the peripheral retina. Clinical signs of visual impairment seem to be very rare in these horses. However, a recent study reported that Comtois horses carrying the Silver mutation had deeper anterior chambers of the eye compared to Wild-type horses. This could potentially cause refractive errors. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to study refraction of the eye in horses heterozygous for the Silver mutation to investigate if they have refractive errors. Ninety-four Icelandic horses were examined. All horses were genotyped for the missense mutation in PMEL 17. Each of the 47 CT horses was matched by a Wild-type (CC) horse of the same age ± 1 year. A brief ophthalmic examination was performed and questionnaires regarding signs of visual impairment were filled out by the owners. Skiascopy was performed using a streak <b>retinoscope</b> (Heine Beta 200) and Trousseau racks without dilation of the pupils. Association between refraction and age, eye, genotype and sex was tested by linear mixed-effect model analysis. Pairwise interactions between each fixed factor (age, eye, genotype and sex) were included in the model. Results: The mean refraction value ± SE was 0. 00 ± 0. 12 D for the right eye and 0. 03 ± 0. 10 D for the left eye in CT horses compared to 0. 22 ± 0. 05 D for both right and left eye in Wild-type horses. The interaction between age and genotype had a significant impact on the refractive state (P= 0. 001). A deviation towards myopia (nearsightedness) could be observed in CT horses older than 200 months (16. 7 years). In the questionnaire, forty-one CT horse owners (87. 2...|$|E

METHODS At the time of the administration of the physical examination to male students entering Stanford University one of the authors estimated the re-fractive state by means of a <b>retinoscope</b> and trial lenses; while an associate esti-mated the pupil diameter. l The refractive state in the two major meridians was determined and the average (equivalent sphere) used as a measure of ametropia. The pupil diameter was determined by the use of a rule having a series of half circles varying in size by one-half millimeter steps from 3 mm. to 8 mm. During this determination the subject faced a uniformly illuminated white sheet behind the examiner’s head. The measurements made on 266 students (532 eyes) comprise the basic data for the study. RESULTS The information desired is most simply expressed by the coefficient of correlation between the refractive state and the pupil diameter. This was found to be- 0. 243, the negative sign indicating association between hyperopia and small pupil or myopia and large pupil. The probability that a coefficient as large as this could have occurred by chance is less than I in 1000. The regression formula is Y = 4. 7908 - 0. 0883 X, where Y is the pupil diameter i...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} constant flickering light on refractive development, the role of serotonin (i. e. 5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) and 5 -HT 2 A receptor in myopia induced by flickering light in guinea pigs. Forty-five guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups: control, form deprivation myopia (FDM) and flickering light induced myopia (FLM) groups(n = 15 for each group). The right eyes of the FDM group were covered with semitransparent hemispherical plastic shells serving as eye diffusers. Guinea pigs in FLM group were raised with illumination of a duty cycle of 50 % at a flash frequency of 0. 5 Hz. The refractive status, axial length (AL), corneal radius of curvature(CRC) were measured by streak <b>retinoscope,</b> A-scan ultrasonography and keratometer, respectively. Ultramicroscopy images were taken by electron microscopy. The concentrations of 5 -HTin the retina, vitreous body and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, the retinal 5 -HT 2 A receptor expression was evaluated by immunohistofluorescence and western blot. The refraction of FDM and FLM eyes became myopic from some time point (the 4 th week and the 6 th week, respectively) {{in the course of}} the experiment, which was indicated by significantly decreased refraction and longer AL when compared with the controls (p< 0. 05). The concentrations of 5 -HT in the retina, vitreous body and RPE of FDM and FLM eyes were significantly increased in comparison with those of control eyes (both p< 0. 05). Similar to FDM eyes, the expression of retinal 5 -HT 2 A receptor in FLM eyes was significantly up-regulated compared to that of control eyes (both p< 0. 05). Western blot analysis showed that retinal 5 -HT 2 A receptor level elevated less in the FLM eyes than that in the FDM eyes. Moreover, the levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in FDM and FLM groups generally decreased when compared with control groups (all p< 0. 05). Constant flickering light could cause progressive myopia in guinea pigs. 5 -HT and 5 -HT 2 A receptor increased both in form deprivation myopia and flickering light induced myopia, indicating that 5 -HT possibly involved in myopic development via binding to 5 -HT 2 A receptor...|$|E
40|$|Background Prolonged use of {{computers}} can lead to complications such as eye strain, eye and head aches, double and blurred vision, tired eyes, irritation, burning and itching eyes, eye redness, light sensitivity, dry eyes, muscle strains, and other problems. Objectives The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate visual problems and major symptoms, and their associations among computer users, aged between 11 and 18 years old, residing in the Qazvin city of Iran, during year 2010. Patients and Methods This cross-sectional study was done on 642 secondary to pre university students who had referred to the eye clinic of Buali hospital of Qazvin during year 2013. A questionnaire consisting of demographic information and 26 questions on visual effects of the computer was used to gather information. Participants answered all questions and then underwent complete eye examinations and in some cases cycloplegic refraction. Visual acuity (VA) was measured with a logMAR in six meters. Refraction errors were determined using an auto refractometer (Potece and Heine <b>retinoscope).</b> The collected data was then analyzed using the SPSS statistical software. Results The results of this study indicated that 63. 86 % of the subjects had refractive errors. Refractive errors were significantly different in children of different genders (P < 0. 05). The most common complaints associated with the continuous use {{of computers}} were eyestrain, eye pain, eye redness, headache, and blurred vision. The most prevalent (81. 8 %) eye-related problem in computer users was eyestrain and the least prevalent was dry eyes (7. 84 %). In order to reduce computer related problems 54. 2 % of the participants suggested taking enough rest, 37. 9 % recommended {{use of computers}} only for necessary tasks, while 24. 4 % and 19. 1 % suggested the use of monitor shields and proper working distance, respectively. Conclusions Our findings revealed that using computers for prolonged periods of time can lead to eye-related problems such as eyestrain, headaches, weak and tired eyes, blurred and double vision, weak vision, burning itching and watery eyes, etc. To correct and reduce these problems the following precautions may be helpful, using computer shields (anti-reflex glasses), proper computer workplace illumination, enough rest after working with computers, appropriate viewing distances during computer work, placing computers far from bright objects and adjusting a line of vision with the top of the monitor...|$|E

Prevalence rates are approximately 20 %– 35 % among the older teenage population globally. It has a medical burden of pathologic complications such as maculopathy and glaucomatous optic neuropathy. High school students experience high-performance and study pressures in the preparation for the final national examination. As a result {{they are exposed to}} excessive near work and indoor activities. They are also ignored for regular screening. Objective: To determine the prevalence and associated factors of myopia among high school students in Gondar town, Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 498 high school students with systematic random sampling method from April 18 to April 29, 2016, in three full-cycle high schools (9 th– 12 th grades). A standardized structured questionnaire, Snellen acuity chart, pinhole, <b>retinoscope,</b> trial case lenses, pen torch, and direct ophthalmoscope were used to collect data. Results: A total of 495 study participants were included, and they had a mean age of 17. 48 ± 1. 59  years. The prevalence of myopia was 11. 9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 10. 2, 17. 9). Family history of myopia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]= 8. 08 [95 % CI: 4. 30, 15. 16]), school being private (AOR= 2. 88 [95 % CI: 1. 02, 8. 11]), longer time spent for near work (AOR= 2. 89 [95 % CI: 1. 12, 7. 43]), longer time spent partaking in indoor activities (AOR= 4. 32 [95 % CI: 1. 69, 10. 99]), shorter near working distance (AOR= 3. 06 [95 % CI: 1. 33, 7. 06]), lack of outdoor sport activities (AOR= 2. 27 [95 % CI: 1. 05, 4. 90]), use of visual display units (AOR= 2. 81 [95 % CI: 1. 30, 6. 10]), and abnormal ocular findings (AOR= 6. 69 [CI: 3. 43, 13. 03]) were found to be independently associated with myopia. Conclusion: The prevalence of myopia was 11. 9 %. Family history for myopia, school being private, longer time spent partaking in indoor activities, shorter working distance, lack of outdoor sport activities, use of visual display units, and presence of abnormal ocular findings were positively associated with myopia.

40|$|Background: The {{magnitude}} of astigmatism among adults {{is not only}} high but also has a wide variation worldwide. 12, 13, 33 The symptoms associated with morbidity of astigmatism pose many challenges in patient’s performance. If astigmatism remains uncorrected, it {{may be associated with}} poor quality of life, employment prospects, productivity and general health. Uncorrected refractive errors especially astigmatism causes frequent hospital visits with unnecessary expenditure for individuals and governments at large. In many developing countries including Tanzania, there is insufficient data on its magnitude among adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between June and December 2011 to determine the {{magnitude of}} astigmatism among adults attending the refraction unit at Muhimbili National Hospital eye clinic. A total of 1250 patients aged 18 years and above attending refraction unit were enrolled. Both presenting and best corrected visual acuities were taken using Snellen’s chart. After thorough evaluation by ophthalmologist, those patients suspected to have refractive error were refracted objectively and subjectively using self illuminated <b>retinoscope</b> and refinement respectively. Cylindrical powers were refined first by the use of Jackson’s cross cylinder at the appropriate axis followed by spherical refinement by fogging technique. Any error, stigmatic (spherical) or astigmatic (cylindrical) of ¼ diopter or more was considered an error and included in the analysis. This exercise was done by principal investigator in collaboration with a senior optometrist. Statistical computer software (SPSS v. 13. 0) package was used for data analysis and processing. Results: A total of 2495 eyes were studied. The prevalence of refractive error was 79. 7 %. The mean age of the study subjects was 52 years. Most patients were in age group 18 – 27 which accounted for 21. 56 % of study population. Male to female ratio was 0. 8 : 1. Emmetropia was found in 20. 3 % subjects. Astigmatism ranked the second among refractive errors. Hypermetropia was the commonest refractive error (43. 4 %) and myopia (17. 4 %) the least. Among those who were found to have astigmatism, 55 % were females and 45 % were males. Most patients had secondary education (46 %) and were found to be in age group 18 – 47 years (χ 2 = 138, df = 18, p = 0. 000). Mixed astigmatism was the commonest type (43. 1 %), followedby simple astigmatism (30. 4 %) and compound astigmatism (26. 4 %). Compound astigmatism occurred more significantly among males (36. 9 %) while mixed astigmatism was more common (53. 1 %) among females (χ 2 = 44. 5, df = 4, p = 0. 000). The proportion of patients with mixed astigmatism decreased with increasing age. This finding was statistically significant (χ 2 = 33. 5, df = 12, p = 0. 001). Majority of patients with compound astigmatism had impaired vision (χ 2 = 65. 0, df = 4, p = 0. 0001). Most patients (95. 8 %) improved with correction from impaired vision and blindness to normal vision. Patients with mixed astigmatism were the most symptomatic. The commonest symptoms were decreased vision, easy ocular fatigability and headache. Conclusion: There is high prevalence of refractive error including astigmatism at MNH...|$|E
