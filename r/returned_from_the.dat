She came out of dock on 4 June 1784, and was subsequently laid up in ordinary.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the case}} of its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). The specifications for these instruments were identical to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E

He {{appeared in}} one game for the Yankees, starting at first base and going 0–2 with two strikeouts in a 51 loss to the Kansas City Royals. On July 14, Ishikawa cleared waivers and elected free agency after being designated for assignment when Derek Jeter <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 60-day disabled list.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2010 at Miller Park, in a 6-1 {{win over}} the Milwaukee Brewers, Bumgarner earned his first career victory by going eight innings without {{yielding}} a run. Bumgarner pitched well enough that when Wellemeyer <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disabled list in August, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy chose to use him in the bullpen and leave Bumgarner in the rotation.|$|E
5|$|Once back in Britain {{he spent}} much of his time recruiting, and he was placed in charge of {{recruits}} on Jersey. He purchased his majority on 27 June 1795, and rejoined his regiment in 1796, when the rest of his men <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> West Indies.|$|E

5|$|The Romney Literary Society's library {{suffered}} significant losses {{during the}} war, {{and by the}} war's end in 1865, only about 400 volumes of its once large 3,000-volume library could be located. Many of the society's members never <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war, {{and those who did}} were at first too weary and discouraged to revive the society or the Romney Classical Institute.|$|E
5|$|The data <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Galileo flybys of Gaspra and Ida, and {{the later}} NEAR Shoemaker {{asteroid}} mission, permitted {{the first study}} of asteroid geology. Ida's relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features. The discovery of Ida's moon Dactyl, the first confirmed satellite of an asteroid, provided additional insights into Ida's composition.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{story is}} told {{in a series of}} flashbacks {{interspersed}} with discussions between Ann (Dockery), a patient in a sanatorium, and Dr Fisher (Stevens), a sceptical and atheistic psychiatrist.

5|$|The ten {{thousand}} men strong Lisowczycy mercenary division, a highly effective military force, had just <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Moscow campaign, and having {{become a major}} nuisance for the szlachta, was available for another assignment abroad; Sigismund sent them south to assist Emperor Ferdinand II. Sigismund court's intervention greatly influenced {{the first phase of}} the war, helping save the position of the Habsburg Monarchy at a critical moment.|$|E

5|$|Vesta is {{currently}} {{one of only}} six identified Solar System bodies of which we have physical samples, coming {{from a number of}} meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta.

Following her win at the 2006 Worlds, the town gave one of its main roads, Pennsylvania Avenue, the honorary title of Kimmie Way. She threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Phillies opening day game, and a week later for her hometown team, the Baltimore Orioles, on April 14, 2006.|$|E
5|$|After Maine and Missouri entered service, {{they were}} {{assigned}} to the North Atlantic Fleet, while Ohio, built on the West Coast of the United States, was instead sent to serve as the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet based in the Philippines. In April 1904, a turret fire killed 36 men aboard Missouri, but the quick action of three men prevented the fire from reaching the magazines and destroying the ship, for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1907, Ohio <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> western Pacific and joined her sisters in what was now the Atlantic Fleet. During this period, Maine served as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet until she was relieved in April 1907.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Australia, {{all members of}} the 9th Division were given three weeks leave. The men were then assembled in their home state capital and took part in a welcome-home march; these marches were conducted both to acknowledge the division's service in the Middle East and advertise a war loan drive. Following the marches the division re-assembled at training camps on the Atherton Tableland in far North Queensland, where it was to complete its training for jungle warfare. The 9th Division next saw action against Japanese forces during the Salamaua–Lae campaign in New Guinea during September 1943; had the division not <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, at least part of this task would have fallen to less-experienced militia units.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Moon are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E
5|$|As Han troops <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, the Han {{government}} debated annexing Dongyue. Dongyue, under King Zou Yushan, {{had agreed}} to assist the Han campaign against Nanyue, but the Dongyue army never reached Nanyue. Yushan blamed the delay on the weather. The proposal to annex Dongyue was suggested by General Yang Pu, but was dismissed by Emperor Wu. The naval force arrived home without having attacked Dongyue. Zou caught wind of Yang's request, and responded by revolting against the Han. Han forces were led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The army crushed the rebellion and captured Dongyue in {{the last months of}} 111 BC, placing the former Minyue territory under Han rule.|$|E
