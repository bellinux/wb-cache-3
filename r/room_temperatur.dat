A sub-monolayer of the Pt NPs was created by simple evaporation of the solvent in which Pt NPs were dispersed. The Pt NPs serve to dissociate hydrogen molecules into atomic hydrogen, which is absorbed at the metal-semiconductor interface. Hydrogen absorption leads {{to the formation of}} the dipole layer, which changes the Schottky barrier height and results in the increase of both forward and reverse current.

Interestingly, the produced particles appeared to be of a very high crystalline quality with a perfect epitaxy between the spinel-like iron oxide core and the rock-salt-like cobalt monoxide shell, leading to a substantial exchange bias at low temperatures.

40|$|International audienceOrganic {{semiconductors}} constitute promising candidates toward large-scale {{electronic circuits}} that are entirely spintronics-driven. Toward this goal, tunneling magnetoresistance values above 300 % at low temperature suggested {{the presence of}} highly spin-polarized device interfaces. However, such spinterfaces have not been observed directly, let alone at room temperature. Thanks to experiments and theory on the model spinterface between phthalocyanine molecules and a Co single crystal surface, we clearly evidence a highly efficient spinterface. Spin-polarised direct and inverse photoemission experiments reveal {{a high degree of}} spin polarisation at room temperature at this interface. We measured a magnetic moment on the molecule's nitrogen p orbitals, which substantiates an ab-initio theoretical description of highly spin-polarised charge conduction across the interface due to differing spinterface formation mechanisms in each spin channel.
