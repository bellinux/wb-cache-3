The variation of calculated values of macroscopic mechanical properties decreases with increasing the number of particles. When the number of particles is 10000 or more, stable results are obtained as a <b>rock</b> <b>test.</b> Moreover, macroscopic mechanical properties of rock model, such as uniaxial compressive strength, Young's modulus and uniaxial tensile strength are significantly affected by porosity of the rock model. Since small particles fill the space among large particles, the porosity of the rock model decreases with increasing the maximum/minimum radius ratio of the particles, and particles are densely packed in the rock model. When the particle is closely arranged, the displacement of each particle is restrained with the adjacent particles even if the bond between particles breaks.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{properties}} of rocks {{are important in}} a variety of rock mechanics and rock engineering problems. Due to the transient nature of the loading, dynamic <b>tests</b> of <b>rock</b> materials are very different from and much more challenging than their static counterparts. Dynamic tests are usually conducted using the split Hopkinson bar or Kolsky bar systems, which include both split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) and split Hopkinson tension bar (SHTB) systems. Significant progress has been made on the quantification of various rock dynamic properties, owing to the advances in the experimental techniques of SHPB system. This review aims to fully describe and critically assess the detailed procedures and principles of techniques for dynamic <b>rock</b> <b>tests</b> using split Hopkinson bars. The history and principles of SHPB are outlined, followed by the key loading techniques that are useful for dynamic <b>rock</b> <b>tests</b> with SHPB (i. e. pulse shaping, momentum-trap and multi-axial loading techniques). Various measurement techniques for <b>rock</b> <b>tests</b> in SHPB (i. e.

The relationship between pore proportioning, porosity and permeability was thus obtained {{to set up}} an equation expressing how the hydraulic pressure and porosity weaken the rigidity and peak strength of artificial specimens. A reference was therefore provided to describe quantitatively the relationship between rock's porosity, permeability and peak strength. Experimental results showed that the coarse particles in proportioning and macro pore affect obviously the porosity and initial permeability and water weakens the rigidity and strength of specimens more significantly with increasing porosity. 應用電液伺服巖石力學試驗系統,研究了不同孔隙配比的人工巖芯試件的應力應變滲流特性,比較系統地分析了孔隙分布配級、孔隙度、滲流作用對強度、剛度的影響. 試驗得到了孔隙配比、孔隙度與初始滲透性的關系,建立了水壓和孔隙度對試件強度弱化的關系方程,對于定量描述孔隙結構與滲流率、試樣強度的關系,具有一定的參考價值. 試驗結果表明,粗顆粒比例和大孔徑孔隙對孔隙度和滲透性影響較大,隨著孔隙度增加,水對試件的強度弱化程度更加顯著. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The notch elements were assumed linear elastic with very low elastic stiffness parameters Kn and Kt, so that they do not oppose any significant resistance to opening. The constitutive model used for the interface elements along the fracture path was the elastoplastic constitutive formulation with fracture energy-based evolution laws.

Those that met the criteria were then divided randomly into two groups (13 per group), which comprised the experimental and control groups, respectively. The control and experimental groups were tested on six visual skills, namely: accommodation, saccadic eye movements, speed of recognition, hand-eye co-ordination, visual memory and peripheral awareness. An optometric assessment was also conducted as a pre-test to ensure that the participant had “normal vision”, followed by a six week intervention (visual skills-training). The sessions were performed for thirty minutes three times per week for six weeks, followed by a post-test. Descriptive statistics were employed, both numerically, such as the mean standard deviation, and graphically by means of histograms.

There is now a developing emphasis on environmental management which has resulted in growing pressure to investigate the viability of reuse of all categories of waste materials. Recycled glass continues {{to be one of}} the principal waste products generated by the public and its reuse applications are urgently sought by the recycling industry. Recycled glass is a waste material produced in large quantities in municipal and industrial areas in Australia and worldwide. Currently in the state of Victoria, Australia, 186, 000 tonnes of recycled glass are stockpiled annually and these stockpiles are growing. However, there is little known reuse application for recycled glass in pavement subbase applications due to limited knowledge concerning its geotechnical properties. The reuse of recycled glass in road pavement applications will provide an opportunity to reduce the unnecessary wastage of not only diminishing virgin materials stocks but also valuable land-fill space. Using recycled glass in road pavement applications would eliminate the need for expensive sorting offering an opportunity to use it as aggregate in locations where virgin aggregate sources are scarce. The geotechnical characteristics of up to 50 % recycled glass (by mass) in blends with crushed rock and recycled crushed concrete were obtained from an extensive laboratory testing including high level of tests such as static triaxial tests and repeated load triaxial tests. The research also explores the performance of recycled glass blends in field trial pavement sections with up to 30 % recycled glass as an additive into crushed rock and recycled crushed concrete mixes for pavement base applications.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis has investigated the feasibility, characteristics and potential applications of low power wireless networking technology, particularly aimed at improving underground mine safety. Following an initial review, wireless technology was identified as having many desirable attributes as a modern underground data transmission medium. Wireless systems are mobile, flexible, and easily scalable. Installation time can be reduced and there is scope for rapid deployment of wireless sensor networks following an emergency incident such as a mine explosion or roof rock fall. Low power mesh technology, relating to the Zigbee and IEEE 802. 15. 4 LR-WPAN (low-rate wireless personal area network) standards, has been of particular interest within this research project. The new breed of LR-WPAN technology is specifically designed for low power, low data rate wireless sensor applications. The mesh networking characteristics of the technology significantly increase network robustness and resilience. The self-healing, self-organising, multiple pathway redundancy, and highly scalable attributes of mesh networks are particularly advantageous for underground, or confined space, high-integrity safety and emergency applications. The study and potential use {{of this type of}} technology in an underground mine is a novel aspect of this thesis. The initial feasibility and review examined the current and future trends of modern underground data transmission systems, with particular focus on mine safety. The findings following the review determined the ideal requirements of an underground data transmission in terms of robustness, integrity, interoperability, survivability and flexibility; with wireless mesh networking meeting many of these requirements. This research has investigated underground wireless propagation characteristics at UHF and microwave frequencies in tunnels. This has involved examining electromagnetic (EM) waveguide theory, in particular the lossy dielectric tunnel waveguide model e. g. (Emslie et al., 1975 and Delogne, 1982). Extensive tests have been carried out in three different underground locations (railway tunnel, hard rock mine, coal mine test facility) using continuous wave (CW), or â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 pureâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 transmission at 2. 3 GHz and 5. 8 GHz, along with a range of throughput performance tests using various wireless technologies: IEEE 802. 11 b, 802. 11 g, SuperG, SuperG (plus BeamFlex antennas), 802. 11 pre-n. 802. 11 draft-n, and Bluetooth. The results of these practical tests have been compared with the lossy dielectric tunnel waveguide model showing good agreement that tunnels will in fact enhance the EM propagation through the waveguide effect. Building on previous research during the last 30 years into high frequency underground radio transmission, this work presents a novel investigation into the performance of modern underground wireless technologies operating in underground mines and tunnels. 4 The feasibility and performance of low power wireless mesh networking technology, relating to Zigbee/IEEE 802. 15. 4, operating in various underground and confined space environments has been investigated through a series of practical tests in different locations including: a hard <b>rock</b> <b>test</b> mine, a coal mine and a fire training centre (confined space built infrastructure). The results of these tests are presented discussing the significant benefits in employing â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 meshâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 topologies in mines and tunnels. Following this, key applications were identified for potential development. Distributed smart sensor network e. g. environmental monitoring, machine diagnostics or remote telemetry, applications were developed to a proof-of-concept stage. A remote 3 D surveying telemetry application was also developed in conjunction with the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 RSVâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 (remote surveying vehicle) project at CSM. Vital signs monitoring of personnel has also been examined, with tests carried out in conjunction with the London Fire Service. â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 Zonal location informationâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 was another key application identified using underground mesh wireless networks to provide active tracking of personnel and vehicles as a lower cost alternative to RFID. Careful consideration has also been given to potential future work, ranging from â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 mine friendlyâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 antennas, to a â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 hybrid Zigbeeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9, such as, optimised routing algorithms, and improved physical RF performance, specifically for high-integrity underground safety and emergency applications. Both the tests carried out and key safety applications investigated have been a novel contribution of this thesis. In summary, this thesis has contributed to furthering the knowledge within the field of subsurface electromagnetic wave propagation at UHF and microwave frequencies. Key characteristics and requirements of an underground critical safety data transmission system have been identified. Novel aspects of this work involved investigating the application of new wireless mesh technology for underground environments, and investigating the performance of modern wireless technologies in tunnels through practical tests and theoretical analysis. Finally, this thesis has proved that robust and survivable underground data transmission, along with associated mine safety applications, can feasibly be achieved using the low power wireless mesh networking technology. Robust underground wireless networking also has potential benefits for other industrial and public sectors including tunnelling, emergency services and transport...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{loading test}} and {{simultaneous}} measurement of AE and electromagnetic emission {{were conducted on}} the granite samples. In the loading test, the maximum compressive load was increased step-by-step at a certain increment until the sample rupture took place to examine the Kaiser effect of the <b>rock</b> sample <b>tested.</b> The results showed that acoustic emission appeared at stress levels below the maximum previous stress, and thus the Kaiser Effect could not be clearly recognized in the <b>rock</b> <b>tested.</b> However, the electromagnetic emission appeared only when the loading stress was approached and exceeded the maximum previous stress. In the present paper, characteristics of the AE and electromagnetic emission activities are experimentally investigated and the physical meaning of the Kaiser Effect in rock sample is discussed, showing a possibility for estimating the current stress level to which rock samples have been subjected. 1. BACKGROUND OF AE AND EME FROM ROCK It has been known that the changes in geoelectric potential and the anomalous radiation of geoelectromagnetic waves were observed before major earthquakes [1 - 4].

The {{complete}} uniaxial or triaxial stressâ€"strain {{behavior of a}} rock sample can be achieved in compressive testing using a servo-controlled testing system. Initially, the load-deformation data is recorded during an experiment, and then to eliminate the scale dependency of force, this data are converted to the stressâ€"strain curve for final reporting. It {{has been found that}} because of the particular design of the current sample instrumentation system used to measure the circumferential or lateral deformation during the uniaxial or triaxial compressive tests, a modification is required {{to be included in the}} conventional method of radial strain calculation. As a result, a new analytical solution has been developed to improve the accuracy of the radial strain calculation. The modification procedure differs depending on whether the test-sample diameter is greater or less than 50 mm. A comparative study was conducted based on visual observation and quantitative analysis to show the variation in a number of rock parameters including elastic modulus, Poissonâ€™s ratio, peak stress, critical strain, residual stress strain, softening fracture energy, and residual stress when this modification was implemented. For a 50 -mm-diameter sample, which is the suggested size for <b>rock</b> <b>testing</b> according to the International Society for Rock Mechanics, the effect of this modification on the parameters obtained from the post-peak region, such as critical strain, residual stress strain, and softening fracture energy varied from 5 % to 9 %. It was concluded that the impact of this modification procedure is more significant with smaller-diameter samples used in <b>rock</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R

The {{results indicate that the}} deep clay shale of this region is characterized by high density, high mechanical strength, low deformation and strong brittleness. More specifically, according to the tests, because of their relative small particle size, the carbonate grains of clay rocks in this region are distributed more uniformly, and the average clay mineral content is comparatively low, as a result, the deep clay shale of this region are featured by large internal friction angle and high mechanical strength...|$|R
