5|$|The {{distinctive}} signal box overlooking Norwood Road {{and a similar}} signal box at {{the northern end of}} the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single signal box adjacent to the north junction. The replacement signal box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by <b>railway</b> <b>staff.</b> The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from semaphores to colour lights on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.|$|E

5|$|Worle {{has had a}} {{large number}} of {{incidents}} of railway vandalism and antisocial behaviour, and the stretch of line through Worle {{is considered one of the}} most vandalised in the United Kingdomâ€“ obstructions have been left on the line and stones have being thrown at <b>railway</b> <b>staff.</b> There have been several incidents of train guards being attacked by passengers who refused to pay their fares, including one incident where the guard was dragged from the train and knocked to the ground. Vandals have also damaged the station's ticket machines, attacked passengers and slashed the tyres of cars parked at the station.|$|E
5|$|The GWR {{attracted}} the attention of the artists from an early date. John Cooke Bourne's History and Description of the Great Western Railway was published in 1846 and contained a series of detailed lithographs of the railway that give readers a glimpse of what the line looked like in the days before photography. J. M. W. Turner painted his Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway in 1844 after looking out of the window of his train on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, and in 1862 William Powell Frith painted , a large crowd scene on the platform at Paddington. The station itself was initially painted for Powell by W Scott Morton, an architect, and a train was specially provided by the GWR for the painting, in front of which a variety of travellers and <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> form an animated focal point.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Wimmera {{was removed}} from dining car service and altered to the Medical and Vision Test Car.

5|$|The mounted police {{took on a}} {{range of}} tasks {{associated}} with the new project. Teams of police escorted the construction teams as they moved across the Rocky Mountains, having been given special jurisdiction over the area along the line of the route. They enforced the liquor laws, and oversaw the itinerant service workers who accompanied the main construction teams. They defused many of the tensions involving the construction workers and the company, including intervening to resolve cases where the workers had not been paid by the company as promised, but they also intervened to support the railway company. When the <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> went on strike for higher wages in 1883, the mounted police guarded the company's trains, escorted in new drivers and, when necessary, drove the locomotives themselves; two years later the police broke up a protest over unpaid wages by over a thousand construction workers, arresting the main leaders. The head of the Canadian Pacific Railway, William Van Horne, thanked the force for its contribution to the final completion of the project.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no central}} record of <b>railway</b> <b>staff,</b> the {{following}} list has been compiled {{as part of a}} project being run by the NYMR Archives to try to record the <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> for the whole Whitby branch.

50|$|One of Woodside's {{members was}} an {{employee}} of British Rail, and {{also a member of}} their British <b>Railways</b> <b>Staff</b> Association, which had premises just off the St Albans Road in Watford.

50|$|The station can be {{accessed}} by foot, climbing the footpath from the nearby Groudle Beach or from above, using the old pack-horse road which now provides limited vehicular access for the <b>railway's</b> <b>staff,</b> largely for delivery purposes. Other than this, rail access is {{the easiest way to}} reach the station, by informing the train guard of your intentions.|$|R
25|$|Depending on {{the amount}} of patrons through the years, each station has {{undergone}} upgrades or expansions that consist of either increasing the number of ticket counters or opening new facilities for use by passengers or <b>railway</b> <b>staff.</b> Taller, wider canopies were erected on the platforms of most stations to replace narrower, original versions in 2006 and 2007. The pace of the upgrades varies by location.|$|E
25|$|The gas was {{stored in}} {{reservoirs}} slung under the underframe and these ruptured in the collision. Escaping gas was ignited by the coal-burning fires of the engines. The gas reservoirs {{had been filled}} before leaving Larbert, and this, {{and the lack of}} available water, meant that the fire was not extinguished until the morning of the next day, despite the best efforts of <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> and the Carlisle fire brigade.|$|E
25|$|This uses bottom-contact {{composite}} third rail, with an aluminium {{body and}} a steel contact surface. The advantage {{of this is a}} low-resistance, high-current-capacity rail with a durable steel surface for current collection. The rail may be surrounded by insulating material on the top and sides {{to reduce the risk of}} electrocution to <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> and trespassers. The bottom-contact system is less prone to derangement by snow than top contact.|$|E
50|$|In January 1860 a fire {{severely}} damaged the Eastern {{part of the}} house. Within a few years the recently formed London and South West Railway Company had purchased the whole building and re-united the two parts. It became the goods' yard and locomotive works offices with the upper floors given over to a Scientific and Literary Institute for the <b>railway's</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From 2008 onwards, many {{heritage}} railways in the UK have withdrawn their [...] "Day Out With Thomas" [...] events due to HiT's revised licensing conditions, {{which includes}} the requirement for enhanced criminal records (CRB) checks on all the <b>railway's</b> <b>staff</b> and volunteers. [...] However, the [...] "Day Out With Thomas" [...] events have thrived in the United States and Canada.|$|R
50|$|It {{was almost}} {{two years after the}} end of the First World War that the Railway Commissioners decided to press ahead with construction. Delays {{occurred}} due to landslips and washaway and it was not until 27 September 1924 that a construction train reached Dorrigo. Construction was finalised by 5 December and an inspection of the line was conducted by <b>Railways</b> <b>staff</b> on the 10th.|$|R
25|$|The {{citizens}} of Shohola and nearby Barryville, New York, treated the wounded 'without {{regard to the}} colour of their uniforms' and doctors sent by two relief trains from Port Jervis worked throughout the night. The official death toll was 65 people killed composed of 44 prisoners, 17 guards, and 4 <b>railway</b> <b>staff,</b> however estimates range from between 60 and 72. A subsequent enquiry found the dispatcher, who fled the scene, to be negligent.|$|E
25|$|In 1999/2000 the Museum {{began to}} collect {{recordings}} of former <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> for a National Archive of Railway Oral History. It also holds the archive of steam train recordings by Peter Handford. In 2009 The Forsythe Collection {{of travel and}} transport ephemera was acquired for the collection. Many of the museum's artworks and posters can also be viewed through Search Engine although these are now displayed {{in a series of}} temporary exhibitions in the museum's new art gallery which opened in 2011.|$|E
25|$|According to the Report of High Level Safety Review Committee of 2012, from 2007â€“08 to October 2011 {{casualties}} in train accidents accounted for 1,019 deaths and 2,118 injuries. In the same period, 1,600 <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> {{were killed and}} 8,700 injured. The committee estimates as well that almost 15,000 persons get killed each year by what is called unlawful trespassing. A Daily Telegraph article says that Indian railway officials believe that {{a large proportion of}} bodies found dead on railways died elsewhere and were put on the railway in dishonest attempts to get compensation from the railway authorities and companies.|$|E
50|$|The {{railway station}} closed to {{passengers}} on 10 September 1962 (prior to the Beeching Axe) but remained open to goods traffic until 27 May 1963. After that date the station remained open as a coal depot until April 1965, <b>staffed</b> by British <b>Railways</b> <b>staff</b> until November 1964. Final closure came on 6 September 1965. The old goods shed marks {{the site of}} the former station.|$|R
50|$|The current {{passenger}} coaches, although rebuilt and repaired with time, still {{operate on}} the original frames. In normal operation each train consists {{of a set of}} six carriages. There are twenty-four principal carriages, made up into four train sets, and currently each individual set is painted in a particular livery, including two that advertise local businesses. Passenger coaches and goods wagons are maintained on site by the <b>railway's</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{livelihood}} of the State <b>Railways</b> <b>staff</b> was stable, which encouraged an {{ever increasing}} number of professionals in other sectors to move to HaapamÃ¤ki. The village continued to grow {{despite the fact that}} it had no industry to speak of and business was not very profitable. One of the major barriers to developing business was the free tickets that railway workers received and that they used to go to town to do business and shop.|$|R
25|$|After the 1951-52 {{financial}} year, the Victorian Railways {{were almost}} Â£6 million pounds in deficit. Freight rates and passenger fares were increased, but the VR {{still did not}} expect to make ends meet. The program of works for 1952-53 was intended to be Â£12.5 million, and was intended to cover the duplication of the Alamein line between Camberwell and Ashburton, track amplification between Flinders Street and South Yarra, a new Richmond station, importation of 1500 precut houses from England for <b>railway</b> <b>staff,</b> and the purchase of equipment for the use of pulverised brown coal in steam locomotives.|$|E
25|$|The {{line between}} Keith to Highland's Buckie station closed in 1915 and only goods traffic used {{the line from}} Buckie to Portessie. Locomotive repairs fell behind because of the {{excessive}} demands {{and many of the}} engine fitters had been called up for war service. Twenty locomotives were loaned from other railways; efforts to get engine fitters failed. 756 of the 3000 Highland <b>Railway</b> <b>staff</b> served active service and a memorial to 87 that died was placed in Station Square at Inverness. The railways were in a poor state after the war, costs having increased, with higher wages, the introduction of an eight-hour day and the price of coal having risen. A scheme was devised whereby the railways would be grouped into four large companies; this was approved by Parliament as the Railways Act 1921.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications (IRISET), {{one of the}} six Centralised Training Institutes of Indian Railways, was set up in Secunderabad by the Ministry of Railways on 24 November 1957. It {{was meant}} to cater to the {{specialised}} training needs of the <b>railway</b> <b>staff</b> and officers in the fields of railway signalling and telecommunication. Being an ISO 9001 certified training institute it today caters {{to the needs of the}} entire Afro-Asian region. In 1967 the Ajanta Express was introduced between Kachiguda Railway Station and Manmad (via Secunderabad). With an average speed of 42.5km/h it was the fastest metre gauge train in India when introduced. In 1969 the Golconda Express was introduced which would travel between Secunderabad and Vijayawada Junction. At that time it was the fastest steam-hauled train in the country with an average speed of 58km/h. and was later extended up to Guntur. To facilitate effective operational and administrative control the Secunderabad Division was split into two divisions in February 1978: Secunderabad Division and Hyderabad Division.|$|E
