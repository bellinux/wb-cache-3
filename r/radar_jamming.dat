5|$|North Vietnam's {{deployment}} of SAMs forced American pilots to make hard choices: either approach targets at higher altitudes (to avoid anti-aircraft fire) and become prey to SAMs, or fly lower {{to avoid the}} missiles and become the target of anti-aircraft batteries. Due to altered tactics and {{the increased use of}} electronic <b>radar</b> <b>jamming,</b> the record of SAM kills decreased over time. The already dismal missile success rate fell from one kill in 30 launches to less than one kill in 50.|$|E

5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 <b>radar</b> <b>jamming</b> pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles. As a result, SAM attacks {{shifted to the}} Phantoms, unprotected because of a shortage of pods. To protect the F-4s, rules of engagement that allowed the MiGCAP to escort the strike force {{in and out of}} the target area were revised in December to restrict MiGCAP penetration to the edge of SAM coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed hit-and-run tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, the threat to the force was perceived as serious.|$|E

25|$|Jamming is {{problematic}} to <b>radar</b> since the <b>jamming</b> signal only needs to travel one way (from the jammer to the radar receiver) whereas the radar echoes travel two ways (radar-target-radar) {{and are therefore}} significantly reduced in power {{by the time they}} return to the radar receiver. Jammers therefore can be much less powerful than their <b>jammed</b> <b>radars</b> and still effectively mask targets along the line of sight from the jammer to the <b>radar</b> (mainlobe <b>jamming).</b> Jammers have an added effect of affecting radars along other lines of sight through the radar receiver's sidelobes (sidelobe jamming).|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn this thesis, effort {{is made to}} incorporate the computer program, Improved Many(Jammers) -on-Many(Radars) (IMOM), into radar and electronic warfare curricula at the Naval Postgraduate School. The IMOM program is used operationally by the U. S. Air Force for electronic combat mission planning. IMOM allows the user to evaluate electronic combat effects through computer color graphics display of the electronic order of battle including terrain effects. This same program used in an academic role, provides students in radar and electronic warfare a tool for understanding <b>radar</b> principles, <b>jamming</b> principles, and the physical interaction between the two. The objective {{is to provide a}} visible link between radar range theory presented in coursework and the two-dimensional electronic combat scenarios presented by IMOM. This is done by plotting the theoretical results for radar signal return, jammer return, and the jamming to signal ratio for both self protection and stand-off jammers. A MATLAB program is used to generate plots of the <b>radar</b> and <b>jamming</b> equations and to validate the IMOM algorithm against the equations used at NPS. The effect of radar parameter changes on the system is clearly displayed, both on the graphical MATLAB output and the IMOM graphics display, therefore enhancing the student's understanding of <b>radar</b> and <b>jamming</b> principles.

2500|$|In {{response}} to the unauthorized act by Steiner and the Americans the Italians sent in two Aeritalia F-104S Starfighter warplanes of the 36° Stormo (Wing) from Gioia del Colle. These where soon joined by two more F-104s from Grazzanise airbase. In {{response to}} the Italian action, other warplanes (that have never been publicly identified but are assumed to have been American Tomcat F-14s) came up behind the Italian jets. The Italian jets also found their <b>radar</b> <b>jammed</b> above the Tyrrhenian Sea, with the assumption being it was done by a U.S. Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler. National Security Council staffer Michael K. Bohn in the White House Situation Room at the time, later recalled [...] "Pilots on board the US and Italian jets exchanged colorful epithets over the radio about their respective intentions, family heritage, and sexual preferences." [...] Once the 737 approached Rome the formation of, presumably US Naval fighters, turned back – only the T-39 with U.S. Special Forces continued to the Ciampino airport.|$|R

25|$|The Skyknight was {{the only}} Korean war jet fighter that also flew in Vietnam. EF-10Bs served in the Electronic warfare role during the Vietnam War until 1969. The large {{interior}} provided ample room for electronic equipment. U.S. Marine Composite Reconnaissance Squadron One VMCJ-1 Golden Hawks began operating the EF-10B in Vietnam on 17 April 1965 under Lt. Col Wes Corman at Da Nang Air Base Republic of Vietnam with six aircraft. No more than 10 EF-10Bs were in Vietnam at one time. The Electronic Warfare (EW) Skyknight was a valuable Electronic countermeasure (ECM) asset to jam the SA-2 surface-to-air missiles (SAM) tracking and guidance systems. VMCJ-1 made history when its EF-10Bs conducted the first USMC airborne <b>radar</b> <b>jamming</b> mission on 29 April 1965 to support a USAF strike mission. Four EF-10Bs also supported a massive strike on the SA-2 SAM sites near Hanoi on 27 July 1965.|$|E
25|$|On 27 December 1944 No. 462 Squadron was {{relocated}} to RAF Foulsham and {{became part of}} No. 100 Group RAF. This group specialised in electronic warfare and No. 462 Squadron's aircraft were modified to <b>radar</b> <b>jamming</b> equipment and other countermeasures. Until {{the end of the}} war the squadron used its special equipment and mounted small diversionary attacks to deceive the Germans as to the location of the raids conducted by Bomber Command. While the squadron maintained a high rate of operations at times, its losses were relatively light as the countermeasures carried by the aircraft also protected them from attack. No. 462 Squadron continued to operate until almost {{the end of the war}} in Europe, and was the only Australian squadron in Bomber Command to either fly a higher number of sorties in April 1945 than March or operate in May. The squadron flew its final operation of the war on the night of 2/3 May.|$|E

By 1970 the Spectre had become the most formidable weapon platform fielded by the Air Force in its war against trucks.The PAVN 377 Air Division's history notes [...] "Just one hour when AC-130s did not operate over our chokepoints was both precious and rare." ...|$|E
500|$|Big Drum {{was similar}} to the other D-Day naval deceptions, but without an {{airborne}} component.

40|$|Cross-eye jamming is an Electronic Attack (EA) {{technique}} that induces an angular {{error in the}} <b>radar</b> being <b>jammed.</b> The main benefit of cross-eye jamming {{is that it is}} effective against monopulse tracking radars, which are largely immune to other forms of jamming. The objective of this research is to gain a complete understanding of cross-eye jamming so that systems that might be developed in future can be properly specied. The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive mathematical and experimental study of retrodirective cross-eye jamming. The mathematical analysis considers all aspects of an isolated, single-loop, retrodirective cross-eye jamming engagement, thereby avoiding the approximations inherent in other cross-eye jamming analyses. Laboratory experiments that accurately represent reality by using the radar for both transmission and reception, and simulating a true retrodirective cross-eye jammer were performed to validate the theoretical analysis. Lastly, the relationship between the angular error induced in the <b>radar</b> being <b>jammed</b> and the matching required from a cross-eye jammer system is explored. The most important conclusion of this work is that the traditional analyses of cross- eye jamming are inaccurate for the conditions under which cross-eye jammers operate. These inaccuracies mean that the traditional analyses are overly conservative, particularly at short ranges and for high cross-eye gains, suggesting that practical cross-eye jammers can be realised more easily than is generally believed.
