This paper describes {{a study on the}} use of construction waste in the production of <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> for residential applications. Construction waste (concrete rubble, clay brick, low-quality and high-quality ceramic tiles, lightweight blocks, concrete masonry blocks, timber and bamboo) was crushed into fine aggregate prior to production of the <b>paving</b> <b>blocks.</b> The density, compressive strength, breaking load, modulus of rupture and water absorption were measured for these laboratory-prepared <b>paving</b> <b>blocks.</b> The results were compared with those from control <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> fabricated using river sand. The influence of iron oxide pigment on the properties of the <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> was determined.

The manufacture of <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> using bottom ash, which is normally associated with high water absorption due to its high porosity and carbon content, was examined in this study with the aim to increase the usage of this waste material. The study was done in three phases: (1) the mixture of cement and bottom ash passing sieves of 2 and 5 mm were done with ratios of 1 : 3, 1 : 4, and 1 : 5; from the best proportion, fly ash was used to replace the cement material from 10 – 80 %, and (3) samples with 30 % and 50 % fly ash replacement ratios were used in combination with 5 mm and 10 mm sieved bottom ash. Compressive strength, water absorption, and abrasion resistance tests were conducted to assess the properties of the resultant <b>paving</b> <b>block.</b> From the result, bottom ash is used to replace natural sand in making <b>paving</b> <b>blocks.</b> By optimizing the particle packing density and using fly ash as a cement replacement, the compressive strength of <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> can exceed 40 MPa...|$|R
