40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel technique of active roll damping in marine vessels by the sole use of conventional thrusters. Many marine operations, such as crane operation and helicopter landings, should {{be carried out}} in small and steady <b>roll</b> <b>motions.</b> However, active <b>roll</b> damping devices such as fins and rudders lose their efficiency in low-speed conditions. This thesis provides a new methodology for roll reduction by adjusting the shaft speed and pitch of the propellers, by use of already installed thrusters. In order to develop a simulation environment suitable for representing realistic roll damping scenarios and validate the damping contribution from the thrusters, systematic experimental trials were {{carried out in the}} large towing tank at MARINTEK. The simulation model is based on the MSS Toolbox, with additional modifications added to represent <b>roll</b> <b>motions</b> more realistically, i. e. 4 -quadrant open water results and non-linear sway and roll damping. The numerical simulations and experimental trials, presented in the thesis, are compared with ship operations that require low <b>roll</b> <b>motions,</b> and shows promising results with significant roll reduction. Seakeeping trials related to <b>roll</b> <b>motions</b> are carried out to quantify the damping contribution. Decay tests showed average damping ratio 250 % higher using the proposed anti-roll system compared to the undamped case. Furthermore, regular waves showed 40 % damping in the area around resonance. Additionally, statistical values from irregular wave trials showed damping in the regime 30 - 64 %. Lastly, operability diagrams were created using numerical simulations and was compared with helicopter landing criteria. It was shown that helicopter landings could take place 34 % more often using the active roll damping system for oblique waves and 20 % more often for beam waves. Based on the results, it is concluded that the system works very well for moderate sea states, and that the damping contributions, that is to say in moderate sea state conditions, is comparable to that of currently available anti-roll system...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{traditional}} assumption that sea sickness is uniquely provoked by heave motion characteristics, with pitch and roll movements being ineffective. In an experiment with a ship motion simulator, subjects were exposed to pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>motions</b> in combination with rather weak heave motions that have no motion sickness-inducing potential. Very high levels of motion sickness were observed (with a motion sickness rating scale) in almost 50 % of our subjects. In three control experiments, it was shown that these heave motions, when presented separately, indeed have no motion sickness-inducing potential and that pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>motions</b> presented alone or in combination with each other have only a very small motion sickness-inducing potential. These results indicate that pitch and roll when combined with small heave motions, which in themselves are not sickness provoking, produce more motion sickness than claimed by the classic models. This suggests that in models on motion sickness, pitch and roll should be combined in a nonlinear fashion with heave and that such models will remain rather crude if they do not include a description of the vestibular contribution to motion sickness...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{two-dimensional}} model tests {{has been conducted}} to study the coupling between global <b>roll</b> <b>motions</b> of a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) vessel and internal slosh-ing. The model of the FLNG is allowed to move freely in roll under the excitations of an initial heel angle, band-limited waves, and regular waves. To clarify the coupling effects, the FLNG vessel in different filling conditions is ballasted in fresh water and equivalent steel ballast weights, respectively. Time series of both the internal sloshing and the global motions of the vessel are measured. Statistical and spectral analyses {{have been carried out}} on the measured data. Sloshing oscillations in different surface modes have been observed. Asymmetry of the internal wave profile relative to still-water surface is also observed. Attempts are made to clarify the influences of the internal sloshing on the global <b>roll</b> <b>motions</b> through the comparison of the experiment results between the liquid and steel ballasting cases. The coupling phenomenon is found {{to be sensitive to the}} period and height of excitation waves.
