40|$|Abstract. The {{last years}} {{a large number}} of {{vehicles}} have been developed for their mobility characteristics over <b>rough</b> <b>terrains.</b> The new modular walking robot MERO * (MEchanism RObot-*Pelecudi Ch et. al.) by reconfiguring their architecture are built to displace the heavy loads on the <b>rough</b> <b>terrains.</b> The main characteristic of the modular walking robot is that they are able to move away on not arranged, horizontal and <b>rough</b> <b>terrains.</b> The modular mechatronic system protect much better the environment when its contact with the soil is discrete, a fact that limits appreciately he area that is crushed. Operation of autonomous walking robot MERO movement implies the existence of a close link between planning movements, environmental perception and executions order to obtain an appropriate behaviour in weakly structured environments. For further acquisition of terrain information, we propose installed active force sensor for terminal leg. This paper describes the detailed design and the prototype characterization of a novel tactile sensor force/moment sensor for MERO an intelligent walking robot’s...|$|R
40|$|Obtaining {{the optimal}} cost-to-go map for large scale <b>rough</b> <b>terrains</b> is {{computationally}} very expensive {{both in terms}} of duration and memory resources. A fast algorithm for approximation of the optimal cost-to-go map in terms of terrain traversability measures for path planning on known large scale <b>rough</b> <b>terrains</b> is developed. The results show {{that the majority of the}} cost-to-go map values, computed from every terrain location with respect to the goal location, are near-optimal. Unlike Dijkstra algorithm, the proposed algorithm has inherently parallel structure, and can be significantly speeded up depending on the number of used CPU cores...|$|R

5|$|While RCT-31 {{was under}} siege, Almond finally {{instructed}} the 1st Marine Division to rescue RCT-31 by {{breaking out of}} Yudam-ni—an impossible order for Smith to implement. Only the 31st Tank Company tried to rescue RCT-31 by attacking Hill 1221, but without infantry support, the two armored attacks on 28 and 29 November were stalled by slippery roads, <b>rough</b> <b>terrain,</b> and close infantry assaults. By 30 November the US forces evacuated Hudong-ni in order to defend Hagaru-ri, leaving the rest of RCT-31 completely stranded.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the valley between Taegu and P'ohong-dong, the terrain along the line was extremely rough and mountainous thanks to the Taebaek Mountains which ran from north to south down Korea's east coast. Northeast of P'ohong-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the northern line of the Pusan Perimeter using the terrain as a natural defense. However the <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces.|$|E
5|$|After being underfed {{and forced}} into long, grueling marches through <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> {{for nearly two}} months, the Batetela in Dhanis' column mutinied against their {{officers}} in February 1897. The mutiny {{broke out in the}} advance guard, which had been pushed the hardest of those in the expedition, but soon spread to the main army, where the massively outnumbered Belgian officers were detained by their men and killed. Dhanis himself escaped the massacre by hiding in the forest, although his brother did not manage to survive. The now disbanded army went on to rampage throughout the immediate area, terrorizing the northern Congo and causing great consternation among the Belgian officials whose jobs it was to keep the peace.|$|E

40|$|A {{major part}} of high {{frequency}} gravity signals is governed by the masses of the topography. Practically, this effect can be evaluated by using the integration formula of terrain corrections. In this study, the topographic conditions are classified as: Block I (flat), Block II (hilly) and Block III (mountainous). The analysis of {{the results indicated that}} the terrain effects is very significant for gravity field information in <b>rough</b> <b>terrains</b> compared to relatively flat areas. A denser grid spacing of Digital Elevation Model (OEM) would contain a lot of gravitational features, especially in the <b>rough</b> <b>terrains.</b> In contrast, for the flat areas, the effect of topographic masses is insignificant, resulting in very small magnitudes as would be expected...|$|R

5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, {{officials}} {{announced that the}} estimated containment date had been delayed until July 7. According to a Forest Service Spokesman, the final 7% of the perimeter was in extremely <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> that was close to impossible for hand crews or bulldozers to reach. Due {{to the difficulty of}} access the fire remained only 96% contained on July 9 and the estimated containment date was pushed back to July 21. Due to favorable conditions, on July 12, the Sherpa fire was 100% contained ahead of schedule. Because of the threat of flare ups within the burn area, patrols continued for several days.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the Naktong delta to the south, and the valley between Taegu and P'ohang-dong, the terrain is extremely rough and mountainous. Northeast of P'ohang-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the Pusan Perimeter in a location outlined by the Sea of Japan to the south and east, the Naktong River to the west, and extremely mountainous terrain to the north, using the terrain as a natural defense. However the <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces in the P'ohang-dong area.|$|E
5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{disagreements}} {{in management}} and poor communication, construction began on both routes. It was soon {{obvious that the}} southern route was unfeasible given the remote area, technology {{available at the time}} and the <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> of the San Rafael Swell. The D spent $217,470 (1883, equivalent to $4.6million in 2007) on the project before declaring it a failure. One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad fired the lead surveyor, even though the workers had graded a path past the San Rafael Reef. This route today is a jeep trail. According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), had the southern route succeeded {{it would have been the}} shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S.|$|E
