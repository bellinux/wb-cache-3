5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} grassland, {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for arable agriculture, particularly since World WarI. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by <b>rabbits</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus),</b> sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European <b>rabbits</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus),</b> mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E
25|$|Current major {{threats to}} the {{biodiversity}} of the Summerland Peninsula include predation and competition from introduced species such as foxes, feral cats (Felis catus), <b>rabbits</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus)</b> and black rats (Rattus rattus) as well as loss and degradation of native plant and animal habitat from invasive pest plants, climate change, disease, impacts to food supply, fire, oil spills and general human disturbance.|$|E

25|$|Other insect {{groups on}} the site are less well surveyed, but several rare species have been recorded, {{including}} for six species of weevil (Curculionoidea), eight species of plant bugs (Hemiptera), and two species of chrysomelid beetle, Aphthona herbigrada and Mantura matthewsii; both of which feed on the rock rose (Helianthemum). Day-flying moths recorded include for the wood tiger (Parasemia plantaginis), and the rare forester moth (Jordanita globulariae). Small mammals such as <b>rabbits</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus)</b> and badgers (Meles meles) are common to the site and the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Apparent {{competition}} {{occurs in}} populations that are predated upon. An increase in {{population of the}} prey species will bring more predators to the area, which {{increases the risk of}} an individual being eaten and hence lowers its survivorship. Like exploitative competition, the individuals aren’t interacting directly but rather suffer a reduction in fitness {{as a consequence of the}} increasing population size. Apparent competition is generally associated with inter rather than intraspecific competition, whereby two different species share a common predator. An adaptation that makes one species less likely to be eaten results in a reduction in fitness for the other prey species because the predator species hunts more intensely as food has become more difficult to obtain. For example, native skinks (Oligosoma) in New Zealand suffered a large decline in population after the introduction of <b>rabbits</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus).</b> Both species are eaten by ferrets (Mustela furo) so the introduction of rabbits resulted in immigration of ferrets to the area, which then depleted skink numbers.|$|E
500|$|The {{only other}} mammal known to {{occur on the}} island is the naturalised house mouse (Mus Musculus).

Neither rabbits nor cats are now reported as naturalised on the island.|$|E
25|$|Five {{introduced}} mammals {{have been}} identified as inhabiting the area, including: the cat (Felis catus), house mouse (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), black rat (Rattus rattus) and European <b>rabbit</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus).</b>|$|R
50|$|Seventy {{percent of}} the {{municipality}} is forested, primarily by the Pinus halepensis, the Pinus nigra and the Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris). Fauna includes the boar (Sus scrofa), the European <b>rabbit</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus)</b> and deer (Cervus elaphus and Capreolus capreolus). Falcons are also numerous.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the region, bird {{populations are}} diverse and include nesting pairs of Golden eagles.

500|$|The Egyptian vulture {{is usually}} seen singly or in pairs, soaring in {{thermals}} {{along with other}} scavengers and birds of prey, or perched {{on the ground or}} atop a building. On the ground, they walk with a waddling gait. They feed on a range of food, including mammal faeces (including those of humans), insects in dung, carrion, vegetable matter, and sometimes small animals. When it joins other vulture species at a dead animal, it tends to stay on the periphery and waits until the larger species leave. Wild <b>rabbits</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus)</b> form {{a significant part of the}} diet of Spanish vultures. In the Iberian Peninsula, landfills are an important food source, with the vultures more likely to occupy territories close to landfill sites. [...] Studies suggest that they feed on ungulate faeces to obtain carotenoid pigments responsible for their bright yellow and orange facial skin. The ability to assimilate carotenoid pigments may serve as a reliable signal of fitness.|$|E
500|$|The Andean condor is a scavenger, feeding {{mainly on}} carrion. Wild condors inhabit large territories, often {{traveling}} more than [...] {{a day in}} search of carrion. In inland areas, they prefer large carcasses. Naturally, they feed on the largest carcasses available, which can include llamas (Lama glama), alpacas (Vicugna pacos), rheas (Rhea ssp.), guanacos (Lama guanicoe), deer and armadillos. Wild individuals could acquire extra carotenoids from vegetal matter contained in carcass viscera and fresh vegetation. However, most inland condors now live largely off of domestic animals, which are now more widespread in South America, such as cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), horses (Equus ferus caballus), donkeys (Equus africanus a sinus), mules, sheep (Ovis aries), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). They also feed on the carcasses of introduced game species such as wild boars (Sus scrofa), <b>rabbits</b> (<b>Oryctolagus</b> <b>cuniculus),</b> foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and red deer (Cervus elaphus). For condors who live around the coast, the diet consists mainly of beached carcasses of marine mammals, largely cetaceans. They will also raid the nests of smaller birds to feed on the eggs. Andean condors have been observed to do some hunting of small, live animals, such as rodents, birds and rabbits, which (given their lack of powerful, grasping feet or developed hunting technique) they usually kill by jabbing repeatedly with their bill.|$|E

Our goals were to define {{the use of this}} habitat by rabbits in {{relation}} to food and shelter availability between seasons. Rabbit density, food availability and refuge abundance were analysed using multiple regression analyses. We found that, independently of season, habitat selection was principally related to cover by the woody shrub Retama monosperma which rabbits use both as a food resource and as protection against predators. Although it is an invasive native plant, the benefits that R. monosperma provides to the wild rabbit population should be taken into account when deciding wild rabbit management strategies...|$|R
