Here we show that, based on the expression of CCR 5, <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can be divided into a highly suppressive CCR 5 + and a far less suppressive CCR 5 − subpopulation, suggesting that the former represent the effector arm of <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Although <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> from CCR 5 −/− gene deletion mutants still suppress, they are less effective mediators of maternal–fetal tolerance.

In addition to the lung, mesenchymal stem cells persisted mostly in the spleen. Mesenchymal stem cells increased the percentage of <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the spleen and the ischemic kidney.

In this study, we investigated the role of TLR 5 -related signals on the generation and function of these novel CD 4 (hi) CD 25 (+) <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> It was found that induced CD 4 (hi) CD 25 (+) <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> expressed an up-regulated level of TLR 5 compared to their precursors. The blockade of TLR 5 using anti-TLR 5 antibodies during the co-culture decreased CD 4 (hi) CD 25 (+) <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> proliferation by induction of S phase arrest.

A variety of strategies have been attempted to induce <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> for control of unwanted, adverse immunity in autoimmune diseases, transplantation as well as gene transfer.

In the current study, we performed a systematic and comprehensive examination of the role and function of <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in induction and maintenance of FIX tolerance in the context of intramuscular AAV 1 gene transfer.

Compelling evidence obtained from both animal and clinical studies have now linked the expansion and accumulation of Foxp 3 + <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> associated with tumor lesions to the failure of immune-mediated tumor rejection. However, further progress of the field is hampered by the gap of knowledge regarding their phenotypic, functional, and the developmental origins in which these tumor-associated Foxp 3 + <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are derived. Here, we have characterized the general properties of tumor-associated Foxp 3 + <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and addressed the issue of tumor microenvironment mediated de-novo induction by utilizing a well known murine tumor model MCA- 205 in combination with our BAC Foxp 3 -GFP reporter mice and OT-II TCR transgenic mice on the RAG deficient background (RAG OT-II). De-novo induction defines a distinct mechanism of converting non-regulatory precursor cells to Foxp 3 + <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the periphery as opposed to the expansion of pre-existing <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> formed naturally during thymic <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> development. This mechanism is of particularly importance to how tumors induce tumor-antigen-specific suppressor cells to subvert anti-tumor immune responses. Our study has found that tumor-associated Foxp 3 + <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are highly activated, undergo vigorous proliferation, are more potent by in-vitro suppression assays, and express higher levels of membrane-bound TGF-β 1 than non-tumor <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> With Foxp 3 -GFP reporter mice or RAG OT-II TCR transgenic mice, we show that tumor tissue can induce detectable de-novo generation of Foxp 3 + <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> of both polyclonal or antigen specific naïve <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> This process was not only limited for subcutaneous tumors but for lung tumors as well. Furthermore, this process required the inducing antigen to be co-localized within the tumor tissue. Examination of tumor tissue revealed an abundance of myeloid CD 11 b+ antigen-presenting cells that were capable of inducing Foxp 3 + <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Taken together, these findings elucidate the general attributes and origins of tumor-associated Foxp 3 + <b>regulatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the tumor microenvironment and in their role in the negative regulation of tumor immunity. ...|$|R
