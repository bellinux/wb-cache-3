40|$|Background: Disorders {{resulting}} from iodine deficiency and anemia will decrease learning achievement among elementary school children. Iodine deficiency has negative {{impacts on the}} growth of nervous cells that, in turn, influence their intelligence and learning ability. Also, the anemia condition will cause difficulties in logic and analogous thinking and decrease of concentration to study that {{have a negative impact}} in the form of declined learning achievement among the students. Objectives: To examine <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of iodine deficiency disorder and learning achievement of elementary school children, examine <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of anemia and learning achievement of elementary school children, and examine <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of iodine deficiency disorder and status of anemia among the elementary children in Dairi District North Sumatra. Methods: This was an observational study using a cross-sectional design. The study population was all elementary school children in Dairi District and selected samples were 247 individuals. These samples were selected using multistage sampling design, where subjects were randomly selected. Data were processed with univariate analysis and statistical test was a bivariate using chi square test to find out <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of iodine deficiency disorder and learning achievement among the elementary school children, <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of anemia and learning achievement among elementary school children, and <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of iodine deficiency disorder and status of anemia among the elementary school children. The entire data were processed with a computer. Results: The study indicated that there was <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of iodine deficiency disorder and learning achievement among the elementary school children (p= 0. 000. There was also <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of anemia and learning achievement among the elementary school children (p= 0. 001, OR= 2. 365), but there was no <b>relationship</b> between <b>status</b> of iodine deficiency disorder and status of anemia among the elementary school children (p= 0. 749).

5|$|Challenged by Lakers' coach Phil Jackson {{to be more}} {{assertive}} while Bryant recovered from offseason knee surgery, Gasol started the season's first week averaging 25.3 points on 52.5 percent shooting, 10.3 rebounds, and five assists per game as the Lakers started 3–0. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week. He earned his third straight All-Star selection and his season averages of 19 points and 10 rebounds were nearly identical {{to what he had}} put up as a Laker the previous three seasons. Pau's play also merited him All-NBA second team honors {{for the first time in}} his career. In the playoffs, Gasol only averaged 13 points on 42% shooting over 10 games, and the Lakers were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Gasol had the worst post season performance of his career. Lakers Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst Magic Johnson cited Gasol as a possible trade option for the Lakers to acquire Magic center Dwight Howard. Gasol ignored the false reports about his <b>relationship</b> <b>status</b> with his girlfriend as the cause of his poor performance and has accepted the criticism of his play as valid. During the 2011–12 NBA season, Gasol and teammate Lamar Odom were subjected to trade rumors involving former New Orleans Hornets guard Chris Paul. After the trade fell through, Gasol vowed that it would not affect the way he played. Odom, on the other hand, was angry at the Laker organization and was traded to the 2010–11 NBA champion Dallas Mavericks for a future first round pick. After Lakers co-captain Derek Fisher was traded in March 2012, Gasol joined Bryant as co-captains of the team. He won the 2011–12 seasonlong NBA Community Assist Award.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of domains that are thought to {{contribute}} to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being. Additionally, <b>relationship</b> <b>status</b> interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.|$|E

25|$|Whether or not aging {{directly}} affects women's sexual functioning during menopause {{is another}} area of controversy. However, many studies, including Hayes and Dennerstein's critical review, have demonstrated that aging has a powerful impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically {{in the areas of}} desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm. In addition, Dennerstien and colleagues found that the primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning. This means {{that it is important to}} understand how the physiological changes in men and women can affect their sexual desire. Despite the seemingly negative impact that menopause can have on sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status. Furthermore, the impact that a <b>relationship</b> <b>status</b> can have on quality of life is often underestimated.|$|E

40|$|This article interrogates {{the extent}} to which the formal {{recognition}} and protection of same and different-sex relationships at Strasbourg and in domestic courts has been accepted as attracting human rights protection. In order to do so it considers how far equality of access to formalised <b>relationship</b> <b>statuses</b> as between same and different-sex couples has arisen in the ECHR contracting states. Inequality of access—asymmetry of access—arises, it will be argued, in its most obvious and pernicious form in those Eastern contracting states in which different-sex couples who wish to live together can access one of two options: cohabitation or marriage, while same-sex couples are confined to cohabitation only. But a form of asymmetry also arises in states which have introduced registered partnerships for same-sex couples, leaving availability of marriage only to different-sex ones. Other forms of asymmetry of access are also explored. This article argues for taking further steps towards creation of symmetry of access to formal <b>relationship</b> <b>statuses</b> in Member States on human rights grounds, but also pragmatically, in order to strengthen the consensus in the contracting states on this matter, and therefore place the Strasbourg Court more clearly at the forefront of addressing the inequalities thereby arising, where Member States have so far failed to do so...|$|R
