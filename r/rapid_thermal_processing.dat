40|$|Abstract. Radiant {{energy sources}} enable <b>rapid</b> and {{controllable}} <b>thermal</b> <b>processing</b> of wafers with closed-loop control of wafer temperature. However {{the use of}} energy sources {{that are not in}} thermal equilibrium with the wafers makes the heating process sensitive to the optical properties of the wafers. In particular, patterns on wafer surfaces can cause temperature non-uniformity at length scales where lateral thermal conduction cannot smooth out the effect. Such “pattern effects ” are even more significant for advanced processing techniques like millisecond annealing and pulsed laser annealing, because of the extremely large heating powers employed. The issue of pattern effects was recognized early on in the development of radiant heating technology, but has recently become a critical issue for process control. Despite the challenges, many counter-measures can be deployed to minimize pattern effects, including modifications to the wafer design, changes in processing recipe and equipment configuration. Such solutions have enabled the use of radiant heating for even the most demanding device fabrication applications...|$|R

In 2009 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report of an Escherichia coli outbreak resulting from consumers eating raw refrigerated cookie dough which brought attention to heat treatment of flours and powders. Chlorination of wheat flour in the European Union countries has been replaced in recent years by heat-treated flour which is used to produce high ratio cakes. By applying heat treatment, it is possible to modify the physical and rheological properties. The primary effect of heat treatment is denaturation of the proteins, partial reduction or inactivation of alpha-amylase, and partial gelatinization of the starch. Understanding of relationship between heat transfer, thermal properties of food, heating medium, thermodynamics and the functionality of the resulting heat-treated flour is of critical importance. Research reported in this dissertation has five chapters. Chapter 1 provides a general overview on the state-of-knowledge in the area. Chapter 2 focuses on developing a thermomechanical treatment (extrusion) for improving the functionality of low quality (ash > 1. 3 %) wheat flour.
