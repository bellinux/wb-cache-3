500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E

[...] "Joey was always encouraging me to write songs," [...] explained Richie, [...] "but I didn't <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> encouragement." [...] This would be the first time the band used the drummer as a songwriter since original drummer Tommy Ramone, with Joey saying he wanted to make Richie feel like a part of the band, because he felt past drummers were not {{so much a part of}} the band nor any good at writing, while calling Richie a [...] "regular Phil Collins."

2500|$|The I Am... World Tour {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from critics. Mike Ross of the website Jam! gave Knowles' [...] "spectacular" [...] performance 4.5 out of 5 stars stating that she proved she could sing traditional R {{if she wanted}} with the cover of Etta James' [...] "At Last". He further noted that the show had [...] "high-production bells... {{a wide range of}} musical styles... a remarkable vocal range, and of course the riveting presence of the star herself." [...] Stephanie Classen of The Star Phoenix remarked, [...] "Beyoncé doesn't <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> bells and whistles of a big stadium show, but it sure makes for an unforgettable concert." [...] Additional praise was received from Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press who graded her [...] "lavishly produced" [...] performance 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "In Sasha-mode... Knowles is raw energy convincingly expressing a live hard/work hard ethos with every shimmy and nimble vocal trill... But Beyoncé... showed feeling ... with more ballad-y numbers" [...] further noting that her split-personality [...] "bounces back and forth" [...] throughout the show. Alice Jones of The Independent noted that whether Knowles performed power balladry, dancehall or electro songs, [...] "she sings her heart out" [...] and further praised the [...] "astonishingly high-energy show, the ambitious choreography barely grazing her perfect, lung-busting vocals which run from caramel smooth to honeyed foghorn". She concluded her review by saying, [...] "Watching Beyoncé sing and strut her stuff can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating. She takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes, [...] "there is a breathtaking elegance in her acute desire to entertain" [...] further saying that [...] "the whole point of the dazzling show was to make you ask how she does it. Not just physically, but organizationally." [...] Ratliff also praised Knowles' [...] "hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference." [...] Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of The Belfast Telegraph described the show as [...] "incredible... mind blowing... electrifying". [...] A writer of Evening Chronicle wrote that Knowles proved she was the best entertainer [...] "with a two-hour set packed with bling, glamour and, most importantly, enthusiasm", further praising her for singing the songs live [...] "hit every note" [...] while dancing to her choreography. The writer further chose the performances of [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights during the show describing Knowles' vocals as [...] "incredible". Similarly, Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times chose the same songs as highlights during the show, further saying that [...] "Halo" [...] was the most memorable moment of the night. She also praised Knowles' [...] "enviable" [...] dancing skills, compared her with Dionne Warwick but noted that, [...] "Her brilliant performance, which was only let down by weaker, less melodic songs such as Get Me Bodied or Upgrade U, was matched by spectacular production and audio visuals." [...] Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger also wrote that [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] were as [...] "riveting as anything that had come before", further choosing the performances of [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] as other highlights. Lustig described the show as a [...] "bona fide pop spectacle" [...] noting that many of the songs which were performed had futuristic themes. Jim Farber from the Daily News viewed the tour as [...] "a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops" [...] and added that [...] "Beyoncé's presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point".|$|E

6000|$|Your good {{letter of}} {{a day or two}} ago is most {{interesting}} and suggestive and puts to me as lucidly as possible the questions with which the appearance of my so copious George Sand is involved. I have been turning the matter earnestly over, and rather think I had best tell you now at once in what form it presses on myself. This forces me to consider it in a particular light. It has come up for me that I shall be well advised (from my own obscure point of view!) to collect into a volume and publish at an early date a number of ungathered papers that have appeared here and there during the last fifteen years; these being mainly concerned with the tribe of the Novelists. This involves my asking your leave to include in the Book the article on Balzac of a few months ago, and my original idea was that if the G.S. should appear in the Supplement at once, you would probably authorize my reprinting it also after a decent little interval. As the case stands, and as I so well understand it on your showing--the case for the Supplement I mean--I am afraid that I shall <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> G.S. paper for the Volume before you will have had time to put it forth at your entire convenience--the only thing I would have wished you to consider. What should you say to my withdrawing the paper in question from your indulgent hands, and--as the possibility glimmers before me--making you a compensation in the way of something addressed with greater actuality and more of a certain current significance to the Spring Fiction Number that you mention? (The words, you know, if you can forgive my irreverence--I divine in fact that you share it!--somehow suggest competition with a vast case of plate-glass [...] "window-dressing" [...] at Selfridge's!) The G.S. isn't really a very fit or near thing for the purpose of such a number: that lady is as a fictionist too superannuated and rococo at the present time to have much bearing on any of those questions pure and simple. My article really deals with her on quite a different side--as you would see on coming to look into it. Should you kindly surrender it to me again I would restore to it four or five pages that I excised in sending it to you--so monstrously had it rounded itself!--and make it thereby a still properer thing for my Book, where it would add itself to two other earlier studies of the same subject, as the Balzac of the Supplement will likewise do. And if you ask me what you then gain by your charming generosity I just make bold to say that there looms to me (though I have just called it glimmering) the conception of a paper really related to our own present ground and air--which shall gather in several of the better of the younger generation about us, some half dozen of whom I think I can make out as treatable, and try to do under their suggestion something that may be of real reference to our conditions, and of some interest about them or help for them.... Do you mind my {{going so far as to}} say even, as a battered old practitioner, that I have sometimes yearningly wished I might intervene a little on the subject of the Supplement's Notices of Novels--in which, frankly, I seem to have seen, often, so many occasions missed! Of course the trouble is that all the books in question, or most of them at least, are such wretchedly poor occasions in themselves. If it hadn't been for this I think I should have two or three times quite said to you: [...] "Won't you let me have a try?" [...] But when it came to considering I couldn't alas, probably, either have read the books or pretended to give time and thought to them. It is in truth only because I half persuade myself that there are, as I say, some half a dozen selectable cases that the possibility hovers before me. Will you consider at your leisure the plea thus put? I shouldn't want my paper back absolutely at once, though in the event of your kindly gratifying me I should like it before very long.|$|E
