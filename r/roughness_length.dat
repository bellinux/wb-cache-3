A {{regional}} {{atmospheric climate}} model {{is used to}} examine the effect of changes in the <b>roughness</b> <b>lengths</b> of momentum (z 0 m) and heat (z 0 h) on the structure of the lower atmosphere and on the surface energy fluxes over Antarctica. Four experiments were carried out in which z 0 m and/or z 0 h were altered with respect to a control experiment. The changes consisted of (1) a lowering of z 0 m from a field aggregated from a vegetation map with an orographic correction based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts z 0 m field, to a constant value of 10 − 3 m; and (2) a lowering of z 0 h from a value equal to z 0 m to a constant value of 10 − 3 m or a value dependent on the wind speed via a surface renewal model. A reduction of z 0 m results in the expected increase in near-surface wind speed. It also results in an increase in the depth of the layer in which south-easterly near-surface winds prevail, and in a decrease in the strength of the large-scale flow over the continent, in particular in summer. In the escarpment region a decrease of z 0 m is found to result in too high wind speeds. Surface temperatures on average decrease while atmospheric temperatures increase, resulting in an increase of near-surface static stability.
