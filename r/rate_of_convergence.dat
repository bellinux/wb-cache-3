Part of this convergence is accommodated by shortening within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, {{with the remainder}} occurring {{to the north of}} the Iranian Plateau. The most active part of the Zagros is the 'Simply Folded Belt', which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs. The sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprise a basal Cambrian conglomerate and a thick sequence of limestones of Palaeozoic to Upper Cretaceous age, known together as the 'Competent Group' due to their relatively high competence, followed by a sequence of mechanically weaker marls and interbedded limestones of latest Cretaceous to Lower Miocene age topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates.

25|$|There {{are some}} unusual {{features}} at the Cascade subduction zone. Where the Juan de Fuca Plate sinks beneath the North American Plate {{there is no}} deep trench, seismicity (earthquakes) are fewer than expected, and {{there is evidence of}} a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> between the Juan de Fuca and North American Plates. These two plates converge at 3–4centimeters per year at present.

40|$|The {{most common}} class of methods for solving {{quadratic}} optimisation problems is {{the class of}} gradient algorithms, {{the most famous of}} which being the Steepest Descent algorithm. The development of a particular gradient algorithm, the Barzilai-Borwein algorithm, has sparked a lot of research in the area in recent years and many algorithms now exist which have faster <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> than that possessed by the Steepest Descent algorithm. The technology to effectively analyse and compare the asymptotic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> gradient algorithms is, however, limited and so it is somewhat unclear from literature as to which algorithms possess the faster <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence.</b> In this thesis methodology is developed to enable better analysis <b>of</b> the asymptotic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> gradient algorithms applied to quadratic optimisation problems. This methodology stems from a link with the theory of optimal experimental design. It is established that gradient algorithms can be related to algorithms for constructing optimal experimental designs for linear regression models. Furthermore, the asymptotic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> these gradient algorithms can be expressed through the asymptotic behaviour of multiplicative algorithms for constructing optimal experimental designs. The described connection to optimal experimental design has also been used to influence the creation of several new gradient algorithms which would not have otherwise been intuitively thought <b>of.</b> The asymptotic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> these algorithms are studied extensively and insight is given as to how some gradient algorithms are able to converge faster than others. It is demonstrated that the worst rates are obtained when the corresponding multiplicative procedure for updating the designs converges to the optimal design. Simulations reveal that the asymptotic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> some of these new algorithms compare favourably with those of existing gradient-type algorithms such as the Barzilai-Borwein algorithm.

25|$|Different hybrid methods exist, {{but here}} we {{consider}} hybridizing MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) and EMO (evolutionary multi-objective optimization). A hybrid algorithm {{in the context of}} multi-objective optimization is a combination of algorithms/approaches from these two fields (see e.g.). Hybrid algorithms of EMO and MCDM are mainly used to overcome shortcomings by utilizing strengths. Several types of hybrid algorithms have been proposed in the literature, e.g. incorporating MCDM approaches into EMO algorithms as a local search operator and to lead a DM to the most preferred solution(s) etc. A local search operator is mainly used to enhance the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> of EMO algorithms.|$|E

500|$|Unlike most {{subduction}} zones worldwide, {{there is}} no deep oceanic trench present along the continental margin in Cascadia. The {{reason is that the}} mouth of the Columbia River empties directly into the subduction zone and deposits silt {{at the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean, burying this large depression. Massive floods from prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula during the Late Pleistocene also deposited large amounts of sediment into the trench. However, in common with other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes, such as the magnitude 9.0Cascadia earthquake on January 26, 1700. However, earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone are less common than expected and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the last few million years. The probable explanation lies in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two tectonic plates currently converge [...] to [...] per year.
