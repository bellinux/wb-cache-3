However, these maps {{should not be}} used for site-specific liquefaction hazard assessment. Simplified probabilistic liquefaction analysis procedures can be used instead to perform site-specific liquefaction hazard assessment, but these procedures rely on probabilistic <b>reference</b> <b>parameter</b> maps that are not yet familiar to most engineering and geological practitioners. As a result, some professionals are questioning the differences between traditional liquefaction hazard maps and the new probabilistic <b>reference</b> <b>parameter</b> maps. This paper clarifies the differences between these two types of maps, and shows how each of these maps complements the other. New probabilistic <b>reference</b> <b>parameter</b> maps for liquefaction triggering and lateral spread displacement are developed and presented for San Diego, California, and simplified probabilistic equations necessary to use the <b>reference</b> <b>parameter</b> maps are summarized. An example map-based liquefaction triggering and lateral spread displacement analysis is performed for a representative site near San Diego Bay. Results of the analysis demonstrate that the probabilistic assessment confirms and augments the information conveyed by the traditional liquefaction hazard map...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will analyze {{different}} approaches to implementing vehicle CO 2 emission standards. By means of a straightforward microeconomic model we assess the relative favourability of <b>reference</b> <b>parameter</b> based vehicle emissions standards – in particular weight-based standards – compared to uniform standards. In case of heterogeneous manufacturers, vehicle specific emission targets that are set according to a certain <b>reference</b> <b>parameter</b> can improve the cost efficiency of the regulation by smoothing the marginal abatement costs, but they distort the allocation decision between different available abatement options. None of the analyzed approaches shows a general dominance over the others; however, for each set of circumstances the optimal design of the standard can be theoretically determined. First results emphasize the crucial impact of the market structure (i. e. market concentration rates, cost structures, and particularly the heterogeneity of the vehicle manufacturers) on the relative favourability.

The reset is normally done either by a physical button or in a menu of the on-board computer. iTPMS are, compared to dTPMS, more sensitive to the influences of different tires and external influences like road surfaces and driving speed or style. The reset procedure, followed by an automatic learning phase of typically 20 to 60 minutes of driving under which the iTPMS learns and stores the <b>reference</b> <b>parameters</b> before it becomes fully active, cancels out many, but not all of these. As iTPMS do not involve any additional hardware, spare parts, electronic or toxic waste as well as service whatsoever (beyond the regular reset), they are regarded as easy to handle and very customer friendly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{synthesis}} of timing parameters consists in deriving con-ditions on the timing constants of a concurrent system {{such that it}} meets its specification. Parametric timed automata are a powerful formalism for parameter synthesis, although most problems are undecidable. We first address here the following reachability preservation problem: given a <b>reference</b> <b>parameter</b> valuation and a (bad) control state, do there exist other parameter valuations that reach this control state iff the <b>reference</b> <b>parameter</b> valuation does? We show that this problem is undecidable, and introduce a procedure that outputs a possibly underapproximated answer. We then show that our procedure can efficiently replace the behavioral cartography to partition a bounded parameter subspace into good and bad subparts; furthermore, our procedure can even outperform the classi-cal bad-state driven parameter synthesis semi-algorithm, especially when distributed on a cluster. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new metric {{to assess the}} performance of different multivariate data reduction models in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed metric is called Updating Frequency Metric (UFM) which {{is defined as the}} frequency of updating the model <b>reference</b> <b>parameters</b> during data collection. A method for estimating the error threshold value during the training phase is also suggested. The proposed threshold of error is used to update the model <b>reference</b> <b>parameters</b> when it is necessary. Numerical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed metric validates its effectiveness in the performance of multivariate data reduction models in terms of the sensor node energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive threshold enhances the model's performance more than the non-adaptive threshold in decreasing the frequency of updating the model <b>reference</b> <b>parameters</b> which positively prolongs the lifetime of the node. The adaptive threshold improves the frequency of updating the parameters by 80 % and 52 % in comparison to the non-adaptive threshold for multivariate data reduction models of MLR-B and PCA-B respectively...|$|E
