40|$|Objective: To compare <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> {{anchorage}} loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary {{posterior teeth}} and amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary anterior teeth between en masse retraction and two-step <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior teeth. Materials and Methods: <b>The</b> sample consisted <b>of</b> 30 female adult patients with Class I maloc-clusion and lip protrusion who needed maximum posterior anchorage. The sample was subdivided into group 1 (n 15, mean age 21. 4 years, en masse retraction) and group 2 (n 15, mean age 24. 6 years, two-step retraction). Lateral cephalograms were taken before (T 1) and after treatment (T 2). Nine skeletal and 10 anchorage variables were measured, and independent t-test {{was used for}} statistical analysis. Results: Although <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> horizontal <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary anterior teeth was not different between the two groups, there was mild labial movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root apices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper incisors in group 2 at T 2. There {{were no significant differences}} in <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> anchorage loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary posterior teeth between the two groups. Bodily and mesial movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper molars occurred in both groups. Approximately 4 mm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper incisal edges resulted from 1 mm of anchorage loss in the upper molars in both groups. Conclusion: No significant differences existed in <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> anchorage loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper posterior teeth and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper anterior teeth associated with en masse retraction and two-step <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior teeth.

Nodules flow rearward on thin, actin-rich fibers (retraction fibers) exposed as the cell margin retracts. <b>Retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell margin and rearward flow of nodules require intact actin filaments, but are insensitive to an inhibitor of myosin function (butanedione monoxime). Using photoactivation of fluorescence marking, we have determined that actin filaments in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> fibers remain stationary while the cell margin retracts and nodules flow rearward. <b>The</b> pointed ends <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> fiber actin filaments face the cell center. We argue that nodule motility is driven by a novel actin-based force that perhaps also partially contributes to <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell margin during cell rounding at mitosis...|$|R

40|$|Attachment {{of force}} {{elements}} from <b>the</b> gingival hook <b>of</b> maxillary molar tubes during <b>the</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior teeth {{is very common}} in orthodontic practice.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{describe}} <b>the</b> CT features <b>of</b> capsular <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liver adjacent to hepatic tumors and to test the hypothesis that this finding is specific for malignant hepatic tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We first retrospectively reviewed <b>the</b> CT scans <b>of</b> eight patients with pathologically proved malignant hepatic tumors (five secondary and three primary) who had CT scans that showed <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlying liver capsule. Then, using criteria developed from the first eight cases, we prospectively studied 253 patients with pathologically proved hepatic tumors (75 benign, 178 malignant) to determine <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liver capsule shown by CT and <b>the</b> specificity <b>of</b> this finding for malignant hepatic tumors. RESULTS. CT scans in the first eight patients showed two types <b>of</b> capsular <b>retraction.</b> In seven patients, the retracted liver capsule was smooth and regular. In one patient, capsular retraction was associated with central ulceration extending to and eroding the liver capsule. Four of 253 patients studied prospectively had hepatic tumors with associated capsular retraction (prevalence, 2 %). In those four cases, the retracted liver capsule was smooth and regular. All four tumors were malignant (one fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, two carcinoid tumors, one colorectal metastasis). CONCLUSION. Capsular <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liver adjacent to hepatic tumors is an uncommon CT finding that appears to be specific for malignant hepatic tumors...|$|R
