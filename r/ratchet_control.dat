2500|$|The <b>ratchet</b> <b>control</b> {{button on}} the end of a fly-off {{handbrake}} is designed to work in the opposite way to what is normally accepted. If the lever is lifted or pulled back to the [...] "on" [...] position, on letting go it immediately releases unless the end button is pressed and held in place before letting go of the lever. Once set, the brake is released by lifting the handbrake lever (not pushing the button) in the setting direction (up or back). This mechanism was traditionally fitted to sports cars to facilitate a racing get-away, such as at traffic lights. It can also be used to help the back wheels to slide, without the worry of the ratchet leaving the brake on.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{is devoted}} to {{a survey of the}} {{ratcheting}} phenomenon and follows the study presented in [1]. Two current austenitic stainless steels 304 L and 316 L are considered and tested under cyclic stress and strain control at 350 °C. Under stress <b>control</b> <b>ratcheting</b> seems very small under proportional as well as non-proportional stress control. The elastic shakedown steady state exhibited by both materials may be explained by their capabilities to develop very significant cyclic hardening (especially isotropic) at 350 °C...|$|R

En la presente tesis investigamos ratchets de ciclo cerrado o retroalimentadas, que son aquellas ratchets cuyo mecanismo de rectificación depende explícitamente del estado del sistema. Hemos analizado la dinámica y el rendimiento de <b>ratchets</b> con <b>control</b> retroalimentado centrándonos en lo que las caracteriza, a saber, el uso de la información sobre el estado del sistema. Hemos mostrado que este uso de la información permite a las ratchets de ciclo cerrado incrementar el rendimiento sobre sus análogas de ciclo abierto. Además, la investigación sobre los efectos del retardo temporal en la retroalimentación nos revela una dinámica rica que exhibe multiestabilidad e inversiones de corriente. Estos estudios que hemos hecho sobre los efectos del retardo temporal junto con los efectos de ruidos en el control retroalimentado nos muestran la viabilidad de realizaciones experimentales de las ratchets retroalimentadas. También hemos encontrado que la combinación de una fuerza oscilante de media cero con el mecanismo de control conduce al máximo flujo que se ha obtenido en una ratchet sin un sesgo a priori. Por otra parte, en esta tesis hemos completado la termodinámica de sistemas generales con control retroalimentado calculando la reducción de entropía cuando el sistema es operado repetidamente por el controlador. Este era el ingrediente que faltaba para establecer la termodinámica de los sitemas con control retroalimentado, y en particular de los demonios de Maxwell. Finalmente, presentamos algunas cuestiones todavía abiertas y futuras perspectivas en el emergente campo de las ratchets retroalimentadas. Ratchets or Brownian motors can {{be viewed}} as controllers that act on stochastic systems with the aim of inducing directed motion through the rectification of fluctuations. In the present thesis, we investigate closed-loop or feedback <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchets,</b> which are those ratchets whose rectification action has an explicit dependence {{on the state of the}} system. We have analyzed the dynamics and performance of feedback <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchets</b> focusing on what characterizes them, namely, the use of information about the state of the system. We have shown that this use of information is what allows closed-loop ratchets to increase the performance over their open-loop counterparts. In addition, our research on the effects of time delay in the feedback has revealed a rich dynamics exhibiting multistability and current reversals. These studies of the effects of time delay together with the effects of noise in the feedback have shown the viability of experimental realizations of feedback <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchets.</b> We have also found that the combination of a zero-mean oscillating force with the feedback mechanism leads to the maximum flux that has been achieved in a ratchet device without an a priori bias. On the other hand, in this thesis we have completed the thermody- namics of general feedback controlled systems by computing the entropy reduction when the system is repeatedly operated by the controller. This was the lacking ingredient to establish the thermodynamics of feedback controlled systems, and in particular of Maxwell’s demons. Finally, we present some still open questions and future perspectives in the new emerging field of feedback ratchets...|$|R
40|$|Future {{applications}} of antiferromagnets (AFs) in many spintronics devices {{rely on the}} precise manipulation of domain walls. The conventional approach using static magnetic fields is inefficient due to the low susceptibility of AFs. Recently proposed electrical manipulation with spin-orbit torques is restricted to metals with a specific crystal structure. Here we propose an alternative, broadly applicable approach: using asymmetric magnetic field pulses to induce <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchet</b> motion of AF domain walls. The efficiency {{of this approach is}} based on three peculiarities of AF dynamics. First, a time-dependent magnetic field couples with an AF order parameter stronger than a static magnetic field, which leads to higher mobility of the domain walls. Second, the rate of change of the magnetic field couples with the spatial variation of the AF order parameter inside the domain and this enables synchronous motion of multiple domain walls with the same structure. Third, tailored asymmetric field pulses in combination with static friction can prevent backward motion of domain walls and thus lead to the desired <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchet</b> effect. The proposed use of an external field, rather than internal spin-orbit torques, avoids any restrictions on size, conductivity, and crystal structure of the AF material. We believe that our approach paves a way for the development of new AF-based devices based on controlled motion of AF domain walls. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Closed-loop or {{feedback}} <b>control</b> <b>ratchets</b> {{use information}} {{about the state of}} the system to operate with the aim of maximizing the performance of the system. In this paper we investigate the effects of a time delay in the feedback for a protocol that performs an instantaneous maximization of the center-of-mass velocity. For the one and the few particle cases the flux decreases with increasing delay, as an effect of the decorrelation of the present state of the system with the information that the controller uses, but the delayed closed-loop protocol succeeds to perform better than its open-loop counterpart provided the delays are smaller than the characteristic times of the Brownian ratchet. For the many particle case, we also show that for small delays the center-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays. However, for large delays we find the surprising result that the presence of the delay can improve the performance of the nondelayed feedback ratchet and the flux can attain the maximum value obtained with the optimal periodic protocol. This phenomenon is the result of the emergence of a dynamical regime where the presence of the delayed feedback stabilizes one quasiperiodic solution or several (multistability), which resemble the solutions obtained in the so-called threshold protocol. Our analytical and numerical results point towards the feasibility of an experimental implementation of a feedback <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchet</b> that performs equal or better than its optimal open-loop version.

40|$|Closed-loop or {{feedback}} <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchets</b> are Brownian motors {{that operate}} using {{information about the}} state of the system. For these ratchets, we compute the power output and we investigate its relation with the information used in the feedback control. We get analytical expressions for one-particle and few-particle flashing ratchets, and we find that the maximum power output has an upper bound proportional to the information. In addition, we show that the increase of the power output that results from changing the optimal open-loop ratchet to a closed-loop ratchet also has an upper bound that is linear in the information.

40|$|We {{consider}} the electron transport through driven tight-binding systems. For the theoretical description, a Floquet scattering approach and a Floquet master equation approach are derived. Both formalisms are particularly {{suited for the}} exact treatment of non-adiabatic driving. While the scattering approach describes coherent transport exactly, the master equation approach is suitable for a rather direct extension {{to the case of}} electron-phonon interaction. Moreover, we derive an expression for the corresponding transport noise which in the driven case depends on the phases of the transmission amplitudes. With these formalisms, we study different situations like the transport through driven molecular wires, the dynamics of coherent quantum <b>ratchets,</b> and the <b>control</b> of current and noise by ac fields...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} control of {{transport}} properties in a deterministic inertia ratchet system via the extended delay feedback method. A chaotic current of a deterministic inertia <b>ratchet</b> system is <b>controlled</b> to a regular current by stabilizing unstable periodic orbits embedded in a chaotic attractor of the unperturbed system. By selecting an unstable periodic orbit, which has a desired transport property, and stabilizing it via the extended delay feedback method, we can control transport properties of the deterministic inertia ratchet system. Also, we show that the extended delay feedback method can be utilized for separation of particles in the deterministic inertia ratchet system as a particle's initial condition varies.

The analysis {{within the framework of}} the hydrodynamic model shows that the ratchet current is dramatically enhanced in the vicinity of the plasmonic resonances and has nontrivial polarization dependence. In particular, for circular polarization, the current component, perpendicular to the modulation direction, changes sign with the inversion of the radiation helicity. Remarkably, in the high-mobility structures, this component might be much larger than the the current component in the modulation direction. We also discuss the non-resonant regime realized in dirty systems, where the plasma resonances are suppressed, and demonstrate that the non-resonant <b>ratchet</b> current is <b>controlled</b> by the Maxwell relaxation in the 2 D liquid.

40|$|Feedback <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchets</b> are thermal {{rectifiers}} {{that use}} {{information on the}} state of the system to operate. We study the effects of time delays in the feedback for a protocol that performs an instantaneous maximization of the center-of-mass velocity in the many particle case. For small delays the center-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays (although not as fast as in the few particle case). However, for large delays we find the surprising result that the presence of a delay can improve the flux performance of the ratchet. In fact, the maximum flux obtained with the optimal periodic protocol is attained. This implies that the delayed feedback protocol considered can perform better than its non-delayed counterpart. The improvement of the flux observed in the presence of large delays is the result of the emergence of a new dynamical regime where the presence of the delayed feedback stabilizes quasiperiodic solutions that resemble the solutions obtained in a certain closed-loop protocol with thresholds. In addition, in this new regime the system presents multistability, i. e. several quasiperiodic solutions can be stable for a fixed time delay. Comment: LaTeX, 6 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|Introduction: Some clinicians use a {{handheld}} screw driver {{instead of a}} torque wrench to definitively tighten abutment screws. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the removal torque of one-piece and two-piece abutments tightened with {{a handheld}} driver and a torque <b>control</b> <b>ratchet.</b> Methods: 40 ITI implants were placed in acrylic blocks and divided into 4 groups. In groups one and two, 10 ITI one-piece abutments (Solid®) and in groups three and four, 10 ITI two-piece abutments (Synocta®) were placed on the implants. In groups one and three abutments were tightened by 5 experienced males and 5 experienced females using a handheld driver. In groups two and four abutments were tightened using a torque wrench with torque values of 10, 20 and 35 N. cm. Insertion torque and removal torque values of the abutments were measured with a digital torque meter. Results: The insertion torque values (ITVs) of males in both abutments were significantly higher than those of females. ITVs in both Solid® and Synocta® abutments tightened with a handheld screwdriver were similar to the torque of 20 N. cm in the torque wrench. Removal torque values (RTVs) of solid® abutments were higher than those of synocta® abutments. Conclusion: The one- piece abutments (solid®) showed higher RTVs than the two-piece abutments (synocta®).

40|$|Service-cycle {{thermo-mechanical fatigue}} (TMF) tests have been {{performed}} on a 1 CrMoV steam turbine rotor steel, with unexpected consequences {{in terms of the}} observed deformation and damage development characteristics. The tests were conducted on two heats of the rotor steel using service-like cycles without and with hold times at peak temperature. The temperature and mechanical strain control profiles of the cycles were devised to represent conditions which could occur at critical locations in a high temperature steam turbine rotor during operation, both with respect to shape and transient-rate. Details of the service cycle TMF test control regime are described. A key feature of all the tests was the development of necking due to <b>ratchetting,</b> despite the <b>control</b> of mechanical strain. Clues to the experimental cause of the effect are given in this paper. A more detailed analytical explanation is provided in a companion paper in the conference proceedings. The observations question what are currently regarded as acceptable temperature control limits for TMF testing. The local deformation phenomenon had a significant influence on the fatigue and creep damage development characteristics exhibited by the two steels, as revealed by a comprehensive post-test inspection activity. A range of physical damage mechanisms were encountered, ranging from fatigue-dominated to creep-dominated, and these are rationalised with reference to a creep-fatigue damage summation diagram for the steam turbine material...|$|R
40|$|Ratchets are {{devices that}} operate away from thermal {{equilibrium}} and can rec-tify zero-mean perturbations to achieve directed transport. We implement a ratchet system by using cold atoms in a driven optical lattice. This ratchet sys-tem can be precisely controlled experimentally, by adjusting either the driving parameters or {{the characteristics of}} the optical lattice. Directed transport in our ratchet is caused by rectification of either the driving force or fluctuations. We demonstrate under which conditions these types of rectification occur. Rectification of the driving force is a deterministic process, while rectification of fluctuations implies that the atoms act as Brow-nian motors. We show that resonant activation is the underlying mechanism of operation of these Brownian motors. The <b>ratchet</b> transport is <b>controlled</b> by symmetries of the system. The temporal symmetry of the system is normally broken by a time-asymmetric driving force. Here we show that for a system with symmetric driving and a symmetric potential, directed transport can also be caused by dissipation-induced breaking of time-reversal symmetry. This happens in the limit of small driving amplitude and large dissipation. We also study quasiperiodic driving of a cold atom ratchet and examine the relationship between symmetries and transport in this case. When map-ping the route to quasiperiodicity we find a characteristic peak spectrum with transport occurring for certain ratios of frequencies. We characterize these peaks spectroscopically, and conclude that their shape is determined by the duration of driving. Finally, we investigate the coherency of transport with quasiperiodic driving and find large coherencies for certain driving parameters.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to establish a}} methodology to analyse the anisothermo-mechanical behaviour of a representative large industrial Superplastic Forming (SPF) tool made of XN 40 F material (40 % Ni, 20 % Cr, Balance Fe) to identify and evaluate different failure mechanisms to improve and predict the tool life. Sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical analyses under realistic loading conditions are developed within a general purpose non-linear Finite Element (FE) code, ABAQUS to predict and analyse the complex temperature-stress-strain cycles of the SPF tool. The temperature dependent cyclic plasticity and creep material data is established for the tool material performing the multi-strain range isothermal cyclic tests and the stress relaxation tests for a range of temperatures. Various strain controlled thermomechanical fatigue-creep and stress <b>controlled</b> <b>ratchetting</b> tests are designed and performed based on the preliminary FE analyses of the tool. The strain controlled and the stress controlled representative tests are carried out to capture the most damaging phase of the SPF thermo-mechanical cycle. In addition to above tests, heat transfer tests are also carried out on the rectangular block of tool material to validate the employed heat transfer methodology. Material constants are identified for different material behaviour models such as combined non-linear kinematic/isotropic hardening model for the cyclic plasticity, power law creep model for secondary creep and the two-layer viscoplastic model to address the combination of plasticity and creep. The identified constants are validated against the isothermal and thermo-mechanical fatigue tests. The FE modelling of the heat transfer tests using the calculated convective heat transfer coefficients and other thermal properties is carried out and the predicted thermal histories are compared with the experimental results. The validated heat transfer methodology is employed to simulate the realistic thermal cycles of the SPF tool. In addition to thermal loading, the tool gravity and the clamping pressure to counteract the forming gas pressure are employed in the thermo-mechanical analyses of the tool. The tool platen contact is also modelled where the platen is considered as analytically rigid surface. Various thermo-mechanical analyses are performed to investigate the effect of different thermal cycles, heating and cooling rates and the batch sizes, i. e. number of parts formed in a forming campaign, on the tool damage. Different strain and strain energy based thermo-mechanical fatigue life prediction methodologies are explored and evaluated using the isothermal and thermo-mechanical fatigue-creep lifing tests. The simple ductility exhaustion method is also developed to predict the ratchetting life of the specimen and the tool. The tool life predictions are performed employing the FE predicted stress-strain results into the identified stress-strain-life equations from the isothermal lifing tests. The predicted thermo-mechanical behaviour and tool lives are compared against the representative test and the industrial experience. From all thermo-mechanical fatigue-creep and ratchetting test results and thermo-mechanical analyses of the tool, the fatigue-creep interaction is found {{to be the most important}} factor in the tool failure.
