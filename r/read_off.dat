5|$|The {{architect}} Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave {{very precise}} instructions to this section. Of wide-ranging experience formed in Asia Minor and Egypt {{and under the}} influence of engineers, he asked them to keep an authentic diary of their excavations where precision measurements <b>read</b> <b>off</b> watches and compasses should be written down, to draw a map of the region they travelled, and to describe the layout of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|Stochastic {{matrices}} are square matrices whose rows are probability vectors, that is, whose {{entries are}} non-negative and sum up to one. Stochastic matrices {{are used to}} define Markov chains with finitely many states. A row of the stochastic matrix gives the probability distribution for the next position of some particle currently in the state that corresponds to the row. Properties of the Markov chain like absorbing states, that is, states that any particle attains eventually, can be <b>read</b> <b>off</b> the eigenvectors of the transition matrices.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is <b>read</b> <b>off</b> at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the first}} notion of screen reading, {{many studies have}} been {{performed}} to discern any differences between <b>reading</b> <b>off</b> of an electronic device and <b>reading</b> <b>off</b> of a paper. In a 2013 study, a group of 72 {{high school students in}} Norway were randomly assigned into one of two groups: one that read using PDF files on a computer and one that used standard paper. The students were put through various tests involving reading-comprehension and vocabulary. The results indicated that those who read using the PDF files performed much worse than those <b>reading</b> <b>off</b> of a paper. A conclusion was reached that certain aspects of screen reading, such as scrolling, can impede comprehension.|$|R

25|$|Mk. II {{also added}} {{a simple but}} {{effective}} calibration device, a shaft connected to the elevation control that extended outside the cabin. For calibration, the elevation handle would be turned to zero and a telescope connected to the shaft so it pointed at the horizon. Then a balloon would be lofted and tracked by the radar, with corrections being <b>read</b> <b>off</b> through the telescope.|$|E
25|$|Announcers in {{the stadium}} <b>read</b> <b>off</b> {{the names of the}} marching nations in French, English (the {{official}} languages of the Olympics), and Standard Chinese with music accompanying the athletes as they marched into the stadium. The leading signs of delegations, carried by young Chinese women in red dresses, had their names printed in these three languages: the Chinese version in traditional Chinese calligraphy; and above it in the other two languages, using a Roman alphabetic typeface that mimicked brush calligraphy.|$|E
25|$|To make a range measurement, the {{operator}} {{would turn the}} potentiometer dial {{in an effort to}} get the leading edge of the target blip to line up with a vertical line on the CRT. The range was not <b>read</b> <b>off</b> the CRT, but the dial. The dial also turned a magslip, or selsyn as it is more commonly known today. The output of the magslip was used to directly turn the controls on the predictor, allowing the radar to continually update the range measurement.|$|E

25|$|The D'Arsonval/Weston meter {{movement}} uses {{a moving}} coil which carries a pointer and rotates on pivots or a taut band ligament. The coil rotates in a permanent magnetic field and is restrained by fine spiral springs which {{also serve to}} carry current into the moving coil. It gives proportional measurement rather than just detection, and deflection is independent of {{the orientation of the}} meter. Instead of balancing a bridge, values could be directly <b>read</b> <b>off</b> the instrument's scale, which made measurement quick and easy.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Smith {{would put}} the seer stone into a hat, and put {{his face in the}} hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the {{darkness}} the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would <b>read</b> <b>off</b> the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph {{to see if it was}} correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.|$|E
25|$|Finally, upon {{termination}} of the algorithm, the result needs to be <b>read</b> <b>off.</b> In {{the case of a}} classical computer, we sample from the probability distribution on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000. Quantum mechanically, one measures the three-qubit state, which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution (with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for the quantum state, as described above), followed by sampling from that distribution. This destroys the original quantum state. Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability. However, by repeatedly initializing, running and measuring the quantum computer's results, the probability of getting the correct answer can be increased. In contrast, counterfactual quantum computation allows the correct answer to be inferred when the quantum computer is not actually running in a technical sense, though earlier initialization and frequent measurements are part of the counterfactual computation protocol.|$|E
40|$|As e-books {{continue}} to grow in popularity and usage, it appears quite possible that they will one day not just supplement but outright replace print books. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that <b>reading</b> <b>off</b> a screen {{is not the same}} as <b>reading</b> <b>off</b> a printed page. Print reading fosters greater concentration and the ability to think in deep, conceptual terms. Digital reading is more like a form of power browsing. Allowing print books to disappear or to become the province of a small elite could well have major social consequences. To counter this potential future, libraries should commit themselves to maintaining hybrid collections of both print and digital materials...|$|R
