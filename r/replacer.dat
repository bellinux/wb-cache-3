The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of protein sources for milk <b>replacers</b> on growth performance and serum biochemical indexes of suckling calves. Fifty Chinese Holstein bull calves with similar BW and age were randomly allocated to 5 groups (1 control and 4 treatments) of 10 calves in each group. Five types of milk <b>replacers</b> were designed {{to have the same}} level of energy and protein. The protein source for milk <b>replacers</b> of the control group was full milk protein (MP). The protein source of milk <b>replacers</b> of the 4 treatment groups was composed of MP and one vegetable protein (VP) (30 and 70 % of total protein). The 4 types of VP were soybean protein concentrate (SP), hydrolyzed wheat protein (WP), peanut protein concentrate (PP), and rice protein isolate (RP). Results of the experiment showed: 1) {{there was no significant difference}} on average daily gain (ADG) and feed:gain ratio (F:G) among the MP, SP and RP groups (P >  0. 05), whereas the ADG and F:G of the WP and PP groups were significantly lower compared with the MP group (P    0. 05). Thereby the 4 VP milk <b>replacers</b> had no adverse effects on body size of calves; 3) all groups showed no significant difference in the serum contents of urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, globulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1, and the ratio of albumin to globulin (A:G) (P >  0. 05). In conclusion, SP or RP (accounts for 70 % of the total protein) as calf milk <b>replacers</b> could substitute MP, whereas wheat gluten and PP had a significant adverse effect on growth performance in this experiment...|$|R

25|$|The main {{difference}} between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products. Ethical vegans avoid them {{on the premise that}} their production causes animal suffering and premature death. In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs. To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered. Female calves are separated from their mothers within 24 hours of birth, and fed milk <b>replacer</b> to retain the cow's milk for human consumption. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production, or reared for beef.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} part of the dairy industry is the removal of the calves off the mother’s milk after the three days of needed colostrum, allowing for the collection of the milk produced. [...] On some dairies, in order for this to take place, the calves are fed milk <b>replacer,</b> a substitute for the whole milk produced by the cow. [...] Milk <b>replacer</b> is generally a powder, which comes in large bags, and is added to precise amounts of water, and then fed to the calf via bucket or bottle. However, not all dairies use milk <b>replacer</b> - some continue to feed calves milk from the cows in the milking herd. Some dairies even pasteurize extra milk from the main herd to feed calves.|$|E
2500|$|Milk replacers are {{classified}} by three categories: protein source, protein/fat (energy) levels, and medication or additives (e.g. vitamins and minerals).

40|$|Research {{has proved}} a {{relationship}} between high fat consumption and rise in obesity, atherosclerosis, coronary heart diseases and high blood pressure. Therefore is recommended the moderate consumption of fat, such that the total fat does not exceed 30 % of total energy intake. Our body needs fats because are providers of calories, essential fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins and also they are necessary ingredients of the foods. The development of products with low-fat content can be considerate a challenge because the lipids offers aroma, texture, appearance, flavour and mouth feel, qualities that customers want in food products. A fat reduction {{can be achieved by}} using different fat <b>replacers</b> to ensure the functionality of the replaced fat. Functional components of fat <b>replacers</b> can have a significant role in promotion of wellbeing, in treating and preventing diseases. Thus, fat <b>replacers</b> should be recognized as safe and healthy, which have sensorial and functional properties. This paper reviews the fat <b>replacers</b> used to obtain foods as meat-based or dairy products. Some ways to obtain healthier meat products by reducing saturated fats content consist in the utilization of unsaturated vegetable oils, vegetable products, fibre. The utilization of fibre in products such bolognas, sausages or hamburgers, can improve the texture profile, binding properties and the characteristics regarding the cooking process. A fat reduction in dairy products can be achieved by replacing it with starches, polysaccharides, gums or fibres from cereal, vegetables and fruits. In acidified milk products, fibres have benefits as: low syneresis, sensory characteristics accepted by consumers, improvement of texture and rheological properties. In cheeses production, the fat reduction can be realised by replacing it with carbohydrate or protein-based <b>replacers</b> in order to obtain a final product with proper characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on the {{physicochemical}} and sensory parameters of low-fat white brined cheese-like product obtained from the substitution of milk fat by milk-olive oil emulsion, in comparison with full and low-fat control cheeses. Formulated milk samples were initially pasteurized at 63 °C for 30 min, cooled down to 35 °C, and subsequently 0. 35 mL L- 1 of microbial rennet were added. The obtained cheeses were stored at 4 °C during 24 hours and then analyzed for physicochemical and sensory properties. The replacement of milk fat in white brined cheese resulted in a lower total solids content due to the higher water-binding capacity of fat <b>replacers</b> used. Fat content was significantly higher for low-fat white brined cheese-like product than in low-fat control cheese. This result was attributed to fat retention capacity of the fat <b>replacers</b> used. Lipolysis index was the highest in the case of low-fat white brined cheese-like product due to changes in cheese microstructure after fat <b>replacers</b> incorporation in low-fat products. Milk-olive oil emulsion showed the lowest cheese-making yield compared to its full and low-fat counterparts.

40|$|AbstractVegetable fat for {{confectionery}} spreads {{was partially}} replaced with {{two different types}} of maltodextrin gels (potato and specialty waxy maize maltodextrin gel) used as fat <b>replacers</b> at 20 % gel concentration. The fat replacement levels were 15 %, 30 % and 50 %. Fullfat confectionery spread was used as a control sample. Steady shear (hysteresis loop, apparent viscosity and yield stress determination), oscillatory and firmness measurements were performed. Also, melting profile of a confectionery vegetable fat was determined in order to confirm the working temperatures of all tests. Reduced fat systems with fat replacement level above 15 % resulted in the formation of a product with inverted phases, so called ′ganache′ no matter of the used maltodextrin gel type. Therefore, only systems with 15 % replacement level were observed. The incorporation of both types of maltodextrin gel as fat <b>replacers</b> in reduced fat system resulted in significant increase in degree of thixotropy, yield stress value, apparent viscosity, elastic moduli and firmness value. Also, reduced fat systems prepared with potato maltodextrin gel expressed more significant increase in all tested rheological parameters in comparison to waxy maize maltodextrin gel containing systems. This study showed that incorporation of maltodextrin gels used as fat <b>replacers</b> can be performed up to 15 %. However, negative influence on system rheology was observed.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop low sodium salami {{prepared}} with pork, low-fat beef and a small quantity of pork back fat (150 g kg− 1). Sodium chloride (NaCl) was replaced by potassium chloride (KCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl 2), and salamis were tasted to obtain low-salt salami with sensory characteristics similar to those found in commercial ones. Salamis were prepared following seven different treatments. Treatments included five different combinations of KCl and CaCl 2 which varied from 5 g kg− 1 to 10 g kg− 1 and two controls containing high (25 g kg− 1) and low (10 g kg− 1) concentrations of NaCl. The right level of saltiness of each treatment was evaluated on “just-about-right” (JAR) scales and analyzed by Penalty Analysis. The results showed differences in pH and Aw (water activity) due to NaCl reduction. Salt replacement mixtures of KCl/CaCl 2 in salamis did not affect this process technologically (slicing, appearance and texture), and the decrease in Na content was approximately 55 %. Although no significant differences were observed in appearance, treatments differed (p ≤ 0. 05) in flavor, texture, and overall liking. As regards salt content of salami, consumers considered treatments with low NaCl content and <b>replacers</b> KCl and CaCl 2 (% Na) as having an acceptable level of saltiness. However, this replacement produced a strange taste. Thus, the production of low sodium salamis using salt <b>replacers</b> (KCl and CaCl 2) or salamis without <b>replacers</b> with a value higher than 1 % of NaCl can be used effectively without compromising major sensorial attributes...|$|R

40|$|Current food {{consumption}} patterns {{have a substantial}} impact on our environment and are thus considered unsustainable. In the context of global warming and a rising world population, shifting from meat towards more plant-based products holds potential to reduce {{the environmental impact of}} our {{food consumption}}. Replacing meat in the diet, however, requires compensation through other products that are able to provide the important nutrients present in meat (protein, iron, zinc and vitamin B 12). This study applies linear programming techniques with the aim to compose meat <b>replacers,</b> with equivalent nutritional value to meat (using chicken and beef as a reference), minimizing the environmental impact with regards to climate change, land use, water use and fossil fuel depletion. A life cycle approach was used to quantify the environmental impacts. Particular attention was given to protein quality and the relative quantities of essential amino acids. The results show that soy is a preferred ingredient due to its favorable amino acid profile. Among the different scenarios investigated, the vegan <b>replacers,</b> with reductions of up to 87 %, have the largest potential for impact reduction for all indicators except water use. Insect-based <b>replacers</b> have the largest potential for water use reduction (up to 47 %), but show relatively high fossil fuel depletion values.

The nutrient composition of two commonly used milk <b>replacers</b> was determined. Using titanium dioxide as an indigestible marker, nutrient digestibility was calculated from the analyses of fecal samples collected from each cub (n = 4 on formula 1, and n = 2 on formula 2). Mean apparent total tract digestibility for both formulas was > 90 % for all nutrients analyzed (crude protein, amino acids, crude fat (CF), and dry matter). However, the total CF content and the concentration of the essential fatty acids, such as a-linolenic, linolenic, and arachidonic acid, of both formulas was lower than reported for maternal cheetah milk. Additionally, one formula contained a comparatively high amount of carbohydrate, {{at the expense of}} protein. Although data were lacking for cheetah maternal milk, comparison with domestic cat milk revealed high concentrations of a number of minerals (K, Fe, Zn, and Cu), while vitamin D 3 was not detected in one formula. Both formulas were low in the majority of essential amino acids compared with domestic cat maternal milk. Despite their apparently high digestibility, neither formula was complete or balanced in terms of nutrient concentrations and ratios when maternal cheetah milk and/or the requirements established for growth in domestic cats were used as estimates of ideal.
