30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the influences of precipitators and desulfurization equipment on particle emission characteristics in the flue gas cleaning system. The particle size distributions before and after four different dust <b>removal</b> <b>devices</b> in six coal-fired power plants were measured, including the hybrid ESP/BAGs {{that have not been}} measured previously. The influence of different dust <b>removal</b> <b>devices</b> on PM 2.5 emission characteristics was also analyzed. The measurement data derived from power plants were accumulated to provide the basis for the choice of PM 2.5 control technology. In particular, the influence of hybrid ESP/BAG operating conditions on dust removal performance was explored. The concentrations and distributions of particulate matter before and after desulfurization devices were also measured in three coal-fired power plants. The results were used to analyze the cleaning effect of wet desulfurization devices on PM 2.5. The findings of this study can provide a reference for the use of wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) technology in removing fine particles in flue gas.|$|R

40|$|AbstractInhalable {{particulate}} matter, especially PM 2. 5 {{is one of}} {{the main}} pollutants in China and it's harmful to both human health and atmosphere. Since the removal efficiency of traditional dust <b>removal</b> <b>devices</b> such as ESP for PM 2. 5 is very low, pretreatment becomes necessary before the dust gets into the dust remover. Acoustic agglomeration {{is one of the}} pretreatment technologies which uses sound wave with high intensity to make fine particles get agglomerate and grow up, and improves the efficiency of traditional dust <b>removal</b> <b>devices</b> for PM 2. 5. In sound wave field, fine particles are carried by the medium which in this paper is air, and vibrate with different amplitude because of different particle sizes, thus relative movement appears and then particles have more chances to collide and get agglomerate. In this paper, the movement of particles with different sizes in travelling wave sound field and standing wave sound field were calculated, including the velocity, displacement, amplitude and so on. The situation that Re< 1 was considered and Viscous force in Stokes region was chose as the main forces here. Studying the movement of fine particle in sound field with different conditions has great meaning in learning the mechanisms of acoustic agglomeration...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Experiments {{were carried}} out to test the {{efficacy}} and safety of the heparin <b>removal</b> <b>device,</b> a plasmapheresis filter that binds and eliminates heparin, {{in the context of}} extracorporeal circulation. PROCEDURES AND FINDINGS: Six dogs were put on cardiopulmonary bypass after heparinization. Upon weaning, additional heparin was administered to obtain an activated clotting time above 900 s. The animals were connected to the heparin <b>removal</b> <b>device</b> and with flows of 500 ml/min, activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time and plasma heparin concentrations were normalised to baseline after 30 min. Hemodynamic parameters remained unaffected. A slight decrease in red and white blood cell count and in platelets was observed which however recovered spontaneously two hours after the filter procedure. No damage to blood components could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a heparin <b>removal</b> <b>device</b> is as efficient as systemic administration of protamine to reverse the effects of heparinization. It may prevent the adverse reactions linked to protamine administration and therefore be indicated in certain subgroups of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Effects of two intravaginal {{treatments}} of progesterone on the synchronization of behavioral estrus were compared in {{three groups of}} lactating dairy cows at 7 to 8 wk postpartum.
