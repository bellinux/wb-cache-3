5|$|The game {{begins with}} the land of Hyrule {{in a state of}} fear because of strange happenings that have {{occurred}} <b>recently.</b> <b>On</b> a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear that the reason for these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears, Shadow Link, who then kidnaps the maidens of the Shrines and seals them inside their crystals. Link follows him to the mysterious sanctuary where the Four Sword lies in the Pedestal, keeping the great evil sealed away. Link pulls the Four Sword out of its Pedestal, splitting into three clones of himself to destroy this doppelganger. However, The Seal that imprisoned the Sorcerer of Winds, Vaati, was broken and had released him from his Prison once again, wreaking havoc on the once peaceful kingdom of Hyrule and bringing chaos and horror.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} sedentary, {{meaning that the}} birds do not {{naturally}} leave Nauru. Banaba is the nearest island, and despite being similar to Nauru, it lacks any warblers. However, {{it is possible that}} populations of the Nauru reed warbler existed on other islands until comparatively <b>recently.</b> <b>On</b> the Marshall Islands, traditional stories refer to a small bird, known variously as annañ, anang and annãng. This bird was considered the property of chieftains. Though no physical descriptions exist of the species, it has been described as butterfly-sized, pleasant-smelling and as living among rocks on the shores of north-western islands. Ethnographers Krämer and Nevermann reported that the bird became extinct or extirpated around 1880. Based on descriptions of birds seen on Jaluit, Paul Schnee hypothesised that the annañ may have been a Nauru reed warbler. The extinction of the annañ may have been due to hunting by cats, which were introduced to the Marshall Islands by the Russian Otto von Kotzebue in 1817 to hunt rats. They then multiplied before being spread by locals as pets, after which they started to become feral.|$|E
