Officials of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) watched the video in slow motion, and announced that Phelps' victory would be upheld. Ben Ekumbo, a FINA <b>referee</b> <b>announced</b> that [...] "It's very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps." [...] Although Serbia conceded their protest, not everyone was convinced that Phelps had won the gold medal; Branislav Jevtić, Serbia's deputy chef de mission for all sports, was quoted as saying [...] "in my opinion, it's not right, but we must follow the rules.

5000|$|The Bottlegate game {{occurred}} during a late 2001 NFL season {{game between the}} Jacksonville Jaguars and Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland. The Browns were driving toward the east end zone for {{what would have been}} the winning score. Browns' wide receiver Quincy Morgan caught a pass for a first down on 4th and 1. After quarterback Tim Couch spiked the ball on the next play to stop the clock, the <b>referee</b> <b>announced</b> {{that they were going to}} review Morgan's catch, saying that the replay officials had buzzed him, indicating for a replay review, before Couch spiked the ball. The referee did not actually move to his buzzer until well after Couch had snapped and spiked the ball, but replay official would later claim that the referee merely did not react in time to stop the spike play. In reviewing the play, the referee determined that Morgan never had control of the ball, thus the pass was incomplete, and the Jaguars were awarded the ball. However, fans in the notorious [...] "Dawg Pound" [...] began throwing plastic beer bottles and other objects directed at and striking players and officials. The referee then declared the game over and sent the teams to the locker rooms. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue called the game supervisor to override the referee's decision, sending the players back onto the field after a 30-minute delay, where the Jaguars ran out the last seconds under a hail of debris.|$|E
50|$|Most Tipperary people {{believed}} that the All Ireland semi-final between Tipperary and Dublin at Cahir had finished as a one-point victory for Tipperary, although because of a disputed point by Ann Carroll from a free eight minutes into the second half some others {{thought it was a}} draw. The referee said it was a one-point victory for Dublin. Tipperary appealed against the result but their objection failed and the referee’s score of Dublin 5-0, Tipperary 3-5 was confirmed. Dublin had two goals each from Úna O'Connor and Kit Kehoe and a fifth from Judy Doyle while Tipperary had two goals from Kathleen Griffin, 1-1 from Peggy Graham (one of three sisters on the Tipperary side), three or four points (depending on your interpretation) from Ann Carroll and two points from and Margo Loughnane. Some of the Tipperary supporters acted in an unruly manner for which the county received a six-month suspended sentence. The Irish Press commented that the game was “The game was very fast and often spectacular but unfortunately was betimes robust..”The Irish Press reported There was considerable confusion {{at the end of this}} tremendously exciting All Ireland camogie semi-final at Cahir yesterday and only after an emergency meeting of the central Council in the Galtee Hotel after the game was it announced by the President, Miss Lil O’Grady (Cork) that Dublin the holders had got through to yet another final, by a single point. The Nenagh Guardian reported under the scoreline Tipperary 3-7 Dublin 5-0:Elation, disappointment, despair, absolute exasperation, these are al the words that could be used to describe the feelings of the Tipperary camogie team after last Sunday’s All Ireland semi-final against Dublin in Cahir. The excitement and the cheering when the <b>referee</b> <b>announced</b> after the game that Tipperary had own by a point was tremendous, and the exhausted Tipperary girls jumped for joy. But amid fantastic confusion there were doubts as to whether one of Tipperary’s points had been allowed or not. Despite this disappointment that the game could possibly be a draw, the absolute bombshell that was dropped when it was announced in the Galtee Hotel that Dublin had won by a point really completed a day of frustration. That a referee in an All Ireland semi-final could forget to mark down scores of one of the team is really inexplicable. All the Tipperary girls and officials were simply stunned that such a thing could happen. It was like a nightmare come true. How the referee could change so quickly from Tipperary winning by one point to the impossibility of Dublin actually winning is beyond comprehension. Margo Loughnane coolly tapped over the equalizer and seconds before the final whistle, Ann Carroll pointed to break the Dublin bogey for Tipperary camogie players for ever, no mater what the referee says. It was their tremendous spirit and determination that brought Tipperary to victory in the end. They moved as a unit with one purpose in mind, and even a deficit of eight points did not deter them from attaining the purpose, and they succeeded as far as flagged scored were concerned.|$|E
