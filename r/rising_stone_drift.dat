Twenty-nine men underground died immediately, or shortly afterwards, from the blast {{or from the}} toxic atmosphere. Two men in the <b>stone</b> <b>drift,</b> {{some distance from the}} mine workings, managed to escape. (Extract from Royal Commission of Enquiry Report on Pike River.) ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{improve the}} {{ventilation}} {{and deal with}} the gas issue it was resolved to drive a <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> from near the pit bottom towards the more remote workings. Because this was passing through rock and not coal there was thought to be little risk of firedamp, and therefore it was being blasted though for [...] "all speed". It was hoped that the final stone would be blasted out that day linking the new drift to an existing passage.|$|R
50|$|Around 22:00 Minto {{met up with}} Parkin Jeffcock, {{a mining}} {{engineer}} from Sheffield in the colliery office. Minto had previously been an under-viewer at the Oaks and could brief Jeffcock on the colliery and the steps taken so far. Jeffcock descended meeting Brown, Potter, Cooper and Platts coming off shift. At 01:30 {{most of the men}} below ground came up and Minto with Mr Smith (the mining engineer from Lundhill Colliery)went below. Minto met up with Tewart and following his directions went {{to the end of the}} <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> where he met up with Jeffcock.|$|R
40|$|At present, {{many high}} gas and {{outburst}} mines have poor gas drainage effects. An important reason influencing the gas drainage {{effect is a}} poor hole-sealing effect. Most studies on gas drainage borehole sealing focus on local and foreign borehole sealing methods, borehole sealing equipment, and borehole sealing materials. Numerical simulations of initial drilling sealing depth are insufficient because studies on this subject are few. However, when the initial sealing depth of the borehole is not chosen reasonably, air can enter the gas drainage drill hole through the circumferential crack of roadway surrounding rocks {{under the influence of}} suction pressure of the drainage system. This phenomenon ultimately affects the hole-sealing effect. To improve the drilling hole sealing of gas drainage boring, we deduced the expression formulas of the crushing zone, plastic zone, and elastic zone around the coal-seam floor <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> and conducted a stress–strain analysis of the coal-seam floor <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> of the 2145 working surfaces of the Sixth Coal Mine of Hebi Coal Mine Group Company by using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and on-scene verification. Finally, we obtain the initial drilling sealing depth, which is a main contribution of this study. The results prove the following. The performed hole-sealing process with an initial drilling sealing depth of 8 m has a gas drainage efficiency of 55...|$|R
5000|$|Surface {{mining and}} in-situ {{processing}} requires extensive land use. Mining, processing and waste disposal require land {{to be withdrawn}} from traditional uses, and therefore should avoid high density population areas. Oil shale mining reduces the original ecosystem diversity with habitats supporting a variety of plants and animals. After mining the land has to be reclaimed. However, this process takes time and cannot necessarily re-establish the original biodiversity. [...] The impact of sub-surface mining on the surroundings will be less than for open pit mines. However, sub-surface mining may also cause subsidence of the surface due {{to the collapse of}} mined-out area and abandoned <b>stone</b> <b>drifts.</b>|$|R

40|$|Key words: {{directional}} blasting; slit-charge; drifting; orthogonal {{experimental design}} method Abstract. Slit-charge for directional fracture controlled blasting technology has demonstrated the clear superiority in <b>stone</b> <b>drifting</b> in coal mines. However, the slit-charge {{has not yet been}} molded products, which limited its application to further promotion. Structural parameter optimization for slit-charge using orthogonal {{experimental design method}} was carried out. The slit-charge blasting in Lead column performed, the slit-charge blasting primary and secondary influencing factors were obtained by using range analysis; Range analysis methods were applied to analyze the sensitivity of these factors and coupling influences. Structural parameters of slit-charge were determined according to effect curves. This product is easy to use and significant effect in the field. All of half blast-hole trace ratios are more than 90 %, the driving speed could be highly increased．Contour shape of roadway is in good condition to avoid rockfalls and rockslides. Overbreak can be costly. Theoretical results are translated into technology, and technological achievements into products...|$|R

60|$|The {{fact that}} rabbits {{generally}} ran uphill was {{not new to}} him. But it presently seemed singular why this rabbit, that might have escaped downward, chose to ascend the slope. Venters knew then {{that it had a}} burrow higher up. More than once he jerked over to seize it, only in vain, for the rabbit by renewed effort eluded his grasp. Thus the chase continued on up the bare slope. The farther Venters climbed the more determined he grew to catch his quarry. At last, panting and sweating, he captured the rabbit {{at the foot of a}} steeper grade. Laying his rifle on the bulge of <b>rising</b> <b>stone,</b> he killed the animal and slung it from his belt.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{secondary}} explosions {{were generated}} by the first, and killed more miners and ponies before dissipating. In total, 20 miners {{were killed in the}} three explosions showing signs of burning, with a further 4 killed by the force of the explosion. Of the 81 men in the pit who survived the explosions, only 42 managed to reach the surface alive, as many miners were trapped by roof falls and succumbed to after-damp poisoning. Rescuers retrieving the bodies described how the miners’ footprints in the dust could be traced showing the roads they had travelled along in an endeavour to escape before they were overwhelmed. [...] All 11 miners who were in the Black Bed seam escaped. However, they heard and felt the force of the explosion in the Beeston Bed and were knocked off their feet or struck by trap doors. They were very quickly rendered unconscious for an hour by after-damp, and upon waking, the Deputy, Robert Henry Nevins, was asked by the young teenage miners to pray for them. With the cages out of operation, they had to scramble up a <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> to reach the Beeston Bed and were overcome by afterdamp again, 600 yards from shaft. Barely able to walk, they were forced to leave behind one of their party, Fred Atkinson, and upon reaching the No.2 shaft, another party of survivors gathered there witnessed them being violently ill and in distress. The sick and injured were the first to be sent up to the surface two hours later once repairs had been made to the cage.|$|R
