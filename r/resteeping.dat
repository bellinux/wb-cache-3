40|$|Steeping in dilute {{alkaline}} (0. 2 % NaOH) {{followed by}} <b>resteeping</b> in biocontrol (starters of Bacillus subtilis S 499) {{has been used}} during red sorghum malting. The effect of steeping and germination conditions has been described using 2 functions: a Weibull 4 -parameter model combined with a General Linear Model with Logarithm Link with significant goodness. Steeping conditions (combined use of NaOH and Bacillus subtilis S 499) affects the synthesis capacity of grain: when Bacillus subtilis culture used in the steeping step is diluted, lnα increases, suggesting a loss of treatment efficacy. The germination temperature affects the β-amylase synthesis rate during the induction phase: the germination temperature increase {{is accompanied by a}} decrease of the β-amylase synthesis rate. During the repression phase of β-amylase synthesis, the effect of malting conditions was found to taper. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Malting is {{the ideal}} stage to deal with β-glucans. Their {{hydrolysis}} is very important as the diffusion of both hormones and hydrolytic enzymes in the endosperm of germinated grain depend on it. A high malt β-glucanase activity is not a guarantee of an extensive hydrolysis of β-glucans. When Bacillus subtilis is used to control mould growth, red sorghum malt β-glucanase activity (measured using carboxymethylcellulose as the substrate) was improved without significantly affecting the hydrolysis of malt β-glucans. Thus, {{in order to reduce}} the residual β-glucans content, soaking in 0. 2 % NaOH was combined with a biocontrol. Soaking in 0. 2 % NaOH is recognized as capable of improving grain hydration by opening-up the endosperm cell walls. The combined use of 0. 2 % NaOH with Bacillus subtilis-based biocontrol treatments during red sorghum malting, leads to malt with increased β-glucanase activity and a significant reduction of residual β-glucans when compared with the 16 h biocontrol steeping without prior steeping in 0. 2 % NaOH. β-glucanase activity increases with increased germination temperature and time while, conversely, the residual β-glucans content of the malts decreases. Indeed, while the level of β-glucanase was not vastly different between the malts obtained after steeping in distilled water and those obtained after 8 h steeping in 0. 2 % NaOH followed by 8 h <b>resteeping</b> in distilled water (NaOH+H 2 O treatment), their residual β-glucans levels differ significantly. Bacillus subtilis-based treatment leads to malt with improved β-(1 - 3) - and β-(1 - 4) -glucanase activities without significantly improved malt β-(1 - 3),(1 - 4) -glucanase activity. While malts obtained after 84 h germination weren’t significantly different in terms of malt β-(1 - 3),(1 - 4) -glucanase activities for all steeping treatments, the use of 0. 2 % NaOH steeping prior to <b>resteeping</b> led to malts with improved β-glucans content. Combining the steeping in dilute alkaline and biocontrol enables taking advantage of the dilute alkaline effect on residual β-glucans content, due probably to the opening-up the cell walls and the improvement of water uptake, and that of the biocontrol (improvement of β-glucanase synthesis).

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes the}} precise definition of code of valued soil-ecological units (BPEJ) and climatic conditions. The thesis is {{concentrated on the}} whole system BPEJ, their origins and history. In addition to, it {{is focused on the}} approaching of the update of BPEJ in our territory. It is also described what legislation is related to breeding in the Czech Republic, which is dedicated, especially, to the spatial planning, vulnerable areas (LFA), taxes and the exclusion of the land from the agricultural land fund. Moreover, I describe the utilization of these values in science and research, where I will detaily focus on the project <b>ReSteEP,</b> the erosion control and the utilization of BPEJ in Land Consolidation...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies, Bacillus subtilis {{has been}} used to control mould growth during red sorghum malting. The use of this biocontrol in steeping liquor has been optimized with some success and the combined use of a 0. 2 % NaOH steep, followed by a <b>resteep</b> in a Bacillus subtilis-based biocontrol, has been proposed. The sharpness and variability of the β-amylase peak and the higher levels of β-glucanase obtained in the presence of B. subtilis cells were highlighted. In this work, the suitability of the Weibull 4 Parameters Model to predict sorghum malt α-amylase activity during the enzyme induction stage of red sorghum germination has been compared with those of a 2 nd Order Polynomial Model and a General Linear Model. Results obtained showed that the Weibull 4 Parameters Model could be used to predict α-amylase activity, with significant goodness of fit when compared to the 2 nd Order Polynomial Model and to the General Linear Model. The effects of steeping treatment (combined use of 0. 2 % NaOH and Bacillus subtilis S 499 starters) and the germination temperature are presented. When the Bacillus subtilis culture used as a starter was diluted, the treatment efficacy to develop α-amylase activity was lost. This study also showed that the germination temperature affected the α-amylase activity rate increase during the induction phase. Peer reviewe...|$|R
60|$|Thus in {{this matter}} of the {{hospital}} poor Mr. Quiverful had his trials, and he had also his consolations. On the whole the consolations were the more vivid of the two. The stern draper heard of the coming promotion, and the wealth of his warehouse was at Mr. Quiverful's disposal. Coming events cast their shadows before, and the coming event of Mr. Quiverful's transference to Barchester produced a delicious shadow {{in the shape of}} a new outfit for Mrs. Quiverful and her three elder daughters. Such consolations come home to the heart of a man, and quite home to the heart of a woman. Whatever the husband might feel, the wife cared nothing for frowns of dean, archdeacon, or prebendary. To her the outsides and insides of her husband and fourteen children were everything. In her bosom every other ambition had been swallowed up in that maternal ambition of seeing them and him and herself duly clad and properly fed. It had come to that with her that life had now no other purpose. She recked nothing of the imaginary rights of others. She had no patience with her husband when he declared to her that he could not accept the hospital unless he knew that Mr. Harding had refused it. Her husband had no right to be quixotic at the expense of fourteen children. The narrow escape of throwing away his good fortune which her lord had had, almost paralysed her. Now, indeed, they had received a full promise, not only from Mr. Slope, but also from Mrs. Proudie. Now, indeed, they might reckon with safety on their good fortune. But what if all had been lost? What if her fourteen bairns had been <b>resteeped</b> to the hips in poverty by the morbid sentimentality of their father? Mrs. Quiverful was just at present a happy woman, but yet it nearly took her breath away when she thought of the risk they had run.|$|R
