40|$|The city of Dubuque, Iowa, {{aimed for}} a twofer — lower energy costs for public {{facilities}} and <b>reduced</b> <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> To achieve that goal, the city partnered with the Iowa Economic Development Authority {{to establish a}} revolving loan fund to finance energy efficiency and other energy projects at city facilities.

Revolving loans use a source of money to fund initial cost-saving projects, such as energy efficiency investments, then use the repayments and interest from these loans to support subsequent projects. Berkeley Lab and the city examined two approaches to explore whether revolving loans could potentially be treated as non-debt: 1) financing arrangements containing a non-appropriation clause and 2) shared savings agreements.

40|$|As part of {{the design}} of the Process and Environmental Technology Laboratory (PETL) in FY 97, an energy {{conservation}} report (ECR) was completed. The original energy baseline for the building, established in Title 1 design, was 595, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr, site energy use. Following the input of several reviewers and the incorporation of the various recommendations into the Title 2 design, the projected energy consumption was reduced to 341, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr. Of this reduction, it is estimated that about 150, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr resulted from inclusion of more energy efficient options into the design. The remaining reductions resulted from better accounting of energy consumption between Title 1 ECR and the final ECR. The energy efficient features selected by the outcome of the ECR were: (1) Energy Recovery system, with evaporative cooling assist, for the Exhaust/Make-up Air System; (2) Chilled Water Thermal Storage system; (3) Premium efficiency motors for large, year-round applications; (4) Variable frequency drives for all air handling fan motors; (4) Premium efficiency multiple boiler system; and (5) Lighting control system. The annual energy cost savings due to these measures will be about $ 165, 000. The estimated annual energy savings are two million kWhrs electric, and 168, 000 therms natural gas, the total of which is equivalent to 23, 000 million BTUs per year. Put into the perspective of a typical office/light lab at SNL/NM, the annual energy savings is equal the consumption of a 125, 000 square foot building.

40|$|Due to {{the popular}} {{perception}} that ”natural ” is by definition and always better for the environment than ”synthetic, ” {{it has been suggested}} that petrochemical surfactants should be replaced with oleochemical ones because this would improve the environmental profile of detergents. As this will be discussed in more detail in the following pages, a total substitution is not recommended for many reasons: • The wide range in consumer needs (wash conditions) would be more difficult to meet with oleochemical surfactants alone. • Data from biodegradation, removal by sewage treatment, toxicity and LCA studies support that petrochemical and oleochemical surfactants are of comparable environmental quality. • Replacement of petrochemical by oleochemical surfactants would not lead to any significant reductions in water or air emissions, nor would it reduce energy consumption across the life-cycle of the surfactants. • Colder wash temperatures will result in energy savings during the consumer use phase of the surfactant life-cycle. This will have positive consequences for the environment: <b>reduced</b> <b>air</b> <b>emissions,</b> conservation of petroleum stocks, reduced waste. Ideally, both oleochemical and petrochemical surfactants are available to detergent formulators. Having the flexibility to use both oleochemical and petrochemical surfactants allows our formulators to create products that maximize the value in the bottle of detergent, so to speak, by optimizing cleaning ability under a variety of laundry conditions while keeping the price low in the current market. These days, our formulation scientists focus quite a lot on developing detergents that perform well at lower wash temperatures. This approach will continue to yield energy savings during the consumer use phase, hence a reduction of CO 2 emissions. ...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyIn {{this thesis}} three new {{technologies}} {{with the potential}} to significantly reduce the release of air emissions have been evaluated. The rigs considered are semi-submersibles and drillships as they have the capacity to reach ultradeep water sites. One potential method is to implement natural gas engines on MODUs, as natural gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel. LNG will allow for 20 - 25 % lower CO 2 emissions and 90 - 95 % lower SOx emissions. In addition, the NOx emissions will be significantly reduced. The technology exists and is becoming widely accepted in the shipping industry. However, there may be problems during bunkering of LNG to floating rigs, as the temperature of LNG can be down to minus 170 degrees. When the LNG enters the bunkering hose it will freeze and become brittle. The risk of breakage will therefore be significant. An alternative potable tank transfer method may be a solution to this. Also the availability of LNG is currently insufficient as mobile rigs need fuel supply at varying locations. However, LNG will become more available in the future as several new LNG powered ships are under construction or planned for the next decade. Another measure is to implement new drilling technologies, which have the potential to reduce required rig size and indirectly reduce the air emissions. There are large differences in fuel consumption for the large and the small rigs, as large rigs have higher power requirements. In addition, larger rigs require more power for station keeping which is a major fuel consumer. The RDM-Riserless drilling method from Reelwell and the slim well drilling method both have a great potential to reduce required rig size. In this thesis a semi-submersible with a displacement of 53 000 mT and a drillship with a displacement of 84 000 mT have been used to estimate the weight reduction, due to less mud and riser tension required for the new drilling methods. The new displacements are used to find the typical fuel consumptions and thus the <b>reduced</b> <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> The reductions are significant. The RDM-R method allows for the largest reduction of the two drilling methods, with 24 % reduction of air emissions for the semi-submersible considered and 33 % for the drillship. The slim well drilling method has the potential to reduce the air emissions with approximately 19 % for semi-submersible and 31 % for the considered drillship. The reductions will vary from rig to rig as the VDL is not linear to the displacement. The drilling methods have the potential to be combined. The reductions are even larger, especially for the semi-submersible which allows for a reduction of 43 %. The drillship considered allows for a reduction of 38 % when the drilling methods are combined. Both methods will lower the cost of operation and may therefore be an attractive alternative in the future. The weight reduction is only based on mud and riser weights and one can expect even larger reductions in air emissions as BOP, Xmas tree, mud pumps and associated equipment are to be implemented in the calculations. To use LNG as fuel combined with the drilling methods may be attractive for new builds as LNG is a lower cost fuel than diesel...|$|E
40|$|Transport of {{slaughter}} animals {{has been}} intensified {{in the recent}} years in Sweden. In connection to rationalization and re-structuring, many abattoirs closed down in the last decades. This implies that the animals should be transported greater distances. During transport from farms to abattoirs, animals may be subjected to un-favourable conditions leading to a compromise of animal welfare and reduced meat quality. An increase of transport work also contributes to the environmental degradation in terms of air emission emanated from the vehicle. Hitherto little or no attention has been made to optimize the transport work. Important research works have been made to determine the effect of transport and handling on meat quality. However, limited {{attention has been paid to}} a comprehensive work to determine the main factors causing stress on animals by making continues measurement. The current paper reports the results of study made on transport of tied cows between farms and Scan Farmek’ s abattoir in Uppsala region. The main purpose of the study was to gather pertinent information which may enable to assess the transport system in detail and to develop an effective transport and logistic system using information technology to promote economy, animal welfare and environment. The specific objectives were to identify main factors which may cause stress on animals during handling and transport, to simulate and optimize transport routes and to determine air emissions from the vehicle to estimate the environmental impact. The measured parameters were heart rate; pH, lactate concentration, muscle glycogen, vibrations (in tri-axial directions), temperature in the pens, vehicle’s speed, transport route and locations of farms in relation to abattoirs using the satellite steered Global Position System (GPS). The alteration of animal behaviour was also recorded using a video camera mounted in the pen. The results indicated that loading of animals at the farms, transport on rough and curved roads, variation of vehicle’s speed, mixing of animals with un-familiar animals from other farms and un-loading at the abattoir are the main events which caused significant increases of heart rate. Urination, defecation, exploration and mooing were the usual behaviour observed during loading and un-loading. The animals lost their balance and rocked during the initial motion of the vehicle and while driving on rough and curved roads. Samples for pH were taken at 45 minutes, 12 hours and 24 hours after slaughter. The result showed that pH decreased rapidly up to 12 hours and decreased slowly thereafter and maintained steady state before 24 hours. The measured pH values could be described using an exponentially decaying type of equation. About 20 % of the animals had the final pH value (measured 24 hours after slaughter) above 5. 8. Concentration of lactate was measured both in plasma and muscle. Blood samples were taken before and after transport and the concentration increased by the factor of 1. 03 to 4. 22 after transport. The measured vibration data was subjected to spectral data analysis to determine the main resonance frequencies. The identified resonance frequencies are at about 1. 3, 3, 6, l 2, 25 and 40 Hz. The first two frequencies are typical for animal transporting trucks. The variation of resonance frequencies depended on vehicle’s speed and road type and further investigations should be made to scrutinize the effect of the identified frequencies on animals. Investigation on the effect of vibration magnitude on heart rate and pH-value showed that an increase of r. m. s acceleration by about 5 times caused an increase of heart rate by 80 % and the meat pH-value of those animals transported on rough and curved roads was above 5. 8. However, further comprehensive investigation is required to determine the effect of vibration on the final pH of meat. The route planning and optimization for each journey was made using a network software, DPS. Route optimization decreased the actual transport distance by 8 % to 14 %. Air emissions such as CO 2, CO, HC and oxides of nitrogen from the vehicle were computed using MODTRANS, the model developed for food distribution and environmental research. Route planning could <b>reduced</b> <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> by 10 % to 18 %.
