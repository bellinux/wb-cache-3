5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth <b>Relic</b> <b>of</b> the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still done as a tradition in the country. The Tooth <b>Relic</b> <b>of</b> the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E

5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes.

5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. Another possibility is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and would have made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E

Watts reveals that Schlossburg had uncovered the order's burial ground.|$|E

In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US10.|$|E

5|$|NGC 821 is an E6 {{elliptical}} galaxy. It {{is unusual}} {{because it has}} hints of an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies.

The design prominently includes sumptuous edges, spread over the exterior.|$|E
