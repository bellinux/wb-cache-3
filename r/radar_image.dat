5|$|The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the {{expected}} amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area. A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts {{tend to be}} bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail. Starting {{in the mid to}} late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States. Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7hours of the time of the <b>radar</b> <b>image.</b> The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.|$|E
25|$|The tornado {{that struck}} {{the city of}} Xenia, Ohio stands as the deadliest {{individual}} tornado of the 1974 Super Outbreak, killing 32 people and destroying {{a significant portion of}} the town. The tornado formed near Bellbrook, Ohio, southwest of Xenia, at about 4:30pm EDT. It began as a moderate-sized tornado, then intensified while moving northeast at about 50mph (80km/h). The tornado exhibited a multiple-vortex structure and became very large as it approached town. Gil Whitney, the weather specialist for WHIO-TV in Dayton, alerted viewers in Montgomery and Greene Counties (where Xenia is located) about the possible tornado, broadcasting the <b>radar</b> <b>image</b> of the supercell with a pronounced hook echo on the rear flank of the storm several minutes before it actually struck. The storm was visible on radar because of raindrops wrapping around the circulation.|$|E

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{importance}} of digital terrain models in the processing, analysis, and interpretation of remote sensing data is increasing. In investigations related to the study of <b>radar</b> <b>images,</b> digital terrain models can have a particular significance, because radar reflection {{is a function of the}} terrain characteristics. A procedure for the analysis and interpretation of <b>radar</b> <b>images</b> is discussed. The procedure is based on a utilization of computer simulation which makes it possible to produce simulated <b>radar</b> <b>images</b> on the basis of a digital terrain model.

40|$|Shuttle <b>radar</b> <b>images</b> (SIR-A) of {{volcanic}} and impact craters were examined {{to assess their}} appearance on <b>radar</b> <b>images.</b> <b>Radar</b> characteristics were determined for (1) nine maarlikie craters in the Pinacate volcanic field, Sonora, Mexico; (2) the caldera of Cerro Volcan Quemado, in the Bolivian Andes; (3) Talemzane impact crater, Algeria; and (4) Al Umchaimin, a possible impact structure in Iraq. SIR-A images were compared with conventional photographs and with results from field studies. Consideration was then given to <b>radar</b> <b>images</b> available for Venus, or anticipated from the Magellan mission. Of the criteria ordinarily used to identify impact craters, some can be assessed with <b>radar</b> <b>images</b> and others cannot be used; planimetric form, expressed as circularity, and ejecta-block distribution can be assessed on <b>radar</b> <b>images,</b> but rim and floor elevations relative to the surrounding plain and disposition of rim strata are difficult or impossible to determine.

It is found that smaller look angle radar data can provide good discrimination among certain diverse materials which are not distinguishable at larger look angles, such as subpixel fault scarps and volcanic dykes. Discriminant analyses of scatterometer data of all geological targets observed gave best results with minimum data by using all wavelengths available and small look angles.

40|$|This report {{studies the}} {{capability}} of ultra wideband short-pulse (UWB SP) radar to provide through concrete walls surveillance including multistatic radar surveillance. Multistatic radar configurations are of interest since {{they can be used}} to do covert surveillance. A full wave electromagnetic simulator is used to generate high fidelity through wall radar data. These raw radar data are transformed into <b>radar</b> <b>images</b> using a generation image algorithm that is described in detail in this report. The delay of the electromagnetic wave due to concrete walls when included into the imaging algorithm considerably improves the <b>radar</b> <b>images.</b> The impact of various radar parameters and signal processing techniques on <b>radar</b> <b>images</b> are examined in detail. The goal is to optimize the development of a potential radar testbed for through-wall imaging applications. <b>Radar</b> <b>images</b> obtained using the image generation algorithm show that UWB SP radar can track targets moving inside a concrete room. The decrease in signal velocity within concrete walls has three effects on through-the-wall-imaging. It defocuses target images and displaces targets from their true positions. False targets can also be present in the <b>radar</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

Both feature extraction and matching stages are still key issues when manipulating and processing remote sensing data for many applications like change detection and land use.
