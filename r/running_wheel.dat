2500|$|Activity {{anorexia}} (AA) is {{a condition}} where rats begin to exercise excessively while simultaneously cutting down on their food intake, similar to human anorexia nervosa or hypergymnasia. When given free access to food and an exercise wheel, rats normally develop a balanced routine between exercise and food intake, which turns them into fit rats. However, if food intake is restricted and wheel access is unrestricted, rats begin to exercise more and eat less, resulting in excessive weight loss and, ultimately, death. The running cycles shift so {{that most of the}} running is done in hours before feeding is scheduled. In other conditions, AA does not develop. Unrestricted food access and restricted wheel access will not cause any significant change in either feeding or exercise routine. Also, if rats are restricted both in food intake and wheel access, they will adjust accordingly. In fact, if rats are first trained to the feeding schedule and then given unrestricted access to a <b>running</b> <b>wheel,</b> they will not develop AA behavior. Results support the notion that the running interferes with adaptation to the new feeding schedule and is associated with the reward system in the brain. One theory is that running simulates foraging, a natural behavior in wild rats. Laboratory rats therefore run (forage) more in response to food shortages. [...] The effect of semi-starvation on activity has also been studied in primates. Rhesus macaque males become hyperactive in response to long-term chronic food restriction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Introduction:. It is {{generally}} believed that exercise produces its effects by activating central opioid receptors; {{there are little}} data that support this claim. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are key nuclei in opioid-induced analgesia, and opioids interact with serotonin to produce analgesia. Objectives:. The purpose was to examine central inhibitory mechanisms involved in analgesia produced by <b>wheel</b> <b>running.</b> Methods:. C 57 /Black 6 mice were given access to <b>running</b> <b>wheels</b> in their home cages before induction of chronic muscle hyperalgesia and compared with those without <b>running</b> <b>wheels.</b> Systemic, intra-PAG, and intra-RVM naloxone tested the role of central opioid receptors in the antinociceptive effects of <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> in animals with muscle insult. Immunohistochemistry for the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the spinal cord and RVM, and pharmacological blockade of SERT, tested whether the serotonin system was modulated by muscle insult and <b>wheel</b> <b>running.</b> Results:. <b>Wheel</b> <b>running</b> prevented the development of muscle hyperalgesia. Systemic naloxone, intra-PAG naloxone, and intra-RVM naloxone reversed the antinociceptive effect of <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> in animals that had received muscle insult.

The aim of this study was to validate low profile wireless <b>running</b> <b>wheels</b> (Med Associates Inc.) against solid-surface, traditionally-mounted vertical <b>running</b> <b>wheels.</b> All animal procedures were approved by the Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M IACUC. Eleven week old female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were randomly assigned to either vertical <b>running</b> <b>wheels</b> (n= 5) or low profile <b>running</b> <b>wheels</b> (n= 5). Daily distance run was monitored for 12 days following initial wheel orientation exposure. Average daily distance run by the mice was not different (p= 0. 37) between the two types of wheels, with the mice on vertical wheels averaging 6. 74 (± 1. 74 km/day; average ±SD) versus 8. 58 (± 1. 87 km/day) on the low profile wheels. The distance run by the mice on the low profile wheels was also compared to the distance the same mice ran on the vertical wheels (8. 6 ± 1. 04 km/day; p= 0. 96). Thus data collected on the low-profile wheels was similar to the vertical <b>running</b> <b>wheels</b> not only among two age and sex-matched groups of mice, but also when the same group of mice ran on the two wheel types. However, on the low-profile wheels, the inability to measure duration of <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> due to software limitations of the data-collection bin size eliminates the calculation of running speed, both of which are important phenotypes of physical activity. Additionally, there were also numerous observations of the mice coasting on the low-profile wheels, an issue not present on the traditional, solid-surface wheels. The presence of coasting would inflate distance measures over true measures of activity and may have been responsible for the non-significant elevation of distance on the low-profile wheels. Thus, if accurate measures of distance or measurement of duration and speed are not required, the low-profile wheel is a valid methodology...|$|R

Furthermore, pairings of an episode of <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> and subsequent confinement in a specific environment can establish a conditioned place preference (CPP). This finding implies that the reinforcing effects of <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> outlast the actual occurrence of physical activity, a phenomenon referred to as aftereffect of <b>wheel</b> <b>running.</b> Aftereffect-induced CPP involves Pavlovian conditioning, i. e. repeated pairings of the aftereffect of <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> with a specific environment creates a learned association between aftereffect and environment and, in turn, a preference for that environment. Given the involvement of dopamine systems in mediating effects of Pavlovian stimuli on appetitive behavior, a role of dopamine in mediating aftereffect-induced CPP seems plausible. Here we assessed whether the mixed D 1 /D 2 receptor antagonist flupenthixol (0. 25 mg/kg, i. p.) can block the expression of an aftereffect-induced CPP. Results In line with earlier studies, our results demonstrate that rats displayed a conditioned preference for environments paired with the aftereffect of <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> and further show that the magnitude of CPP {{was not related to}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> rate.

5000|$|Dr. Mattson’s {{work has}} {{revealed}} {{mechanisms by which}} diabetes adversely affects hippocampal plasticity and cognitive function. He showed that, in both insulin-deficient rats and insulin-resistant mice, diabetes impairs hippocampus-dependent memory, perforant path synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis, and the adrenal steroid corticosterone contributes to these adverse effects. Changes in hippocampal plasticity and function in both models were reversed when normal physiological levels of corticosterone were maintained, suggesting that cognitive impairment in diabetes may result from glucocorticoid-mediated deficits in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In a related study, Mattson showed that rats fed with a high-fat, high-glucose diet supplemented with fructose corn syrup exhibit alterations in energy and lipid metabolism similar to clinical diabetes, with elevated fasting glucose and increased cholesterol and triglycerides. Rats maintained on this diet for 8 months exhibited impaired spatial learning ability, reduced hippocampal dendritic spine density, and reduced long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral—CA1 synapses. These changes occurred concurrently with reductions in levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Dr. Mattson also investigated whether manipulations that enhance neurotrophin levels will also restore neuronal structure and function in diabetes. He found that <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> activity, caloric restriction, or {{the combination of the}} two treatments increased levels of BDNF in the hippocampus of diabetic mice. Enhancement of hippocampal BDNF was accompanied by increases in dendritic spine density on the secondary and tertiary dendrites of dentate granule neurons. These studies suggest that diabetes exerts detrimental effects on hippocampal structure, and that this state can be attenuated by increasing energy expenditure and decreasing energy intake. [...] The implications of these findings for cognitive aging are clear - dietary moderation and regular exercise will enhance cognitive function.|$|E

Food intake, <b>wheel</b> <b>running,</b> body weight, and phase of the estrous cycle were monitored daily prior to, during, and after a period of restricted feeding in which access to food was limited to 2 h/day. Food intake, body weight, and estrous cyclicity were also monitored in a control group housed without access to <b>running</b> <b>wheels.</b> Prior to food restriction, rats with wheels displayed high levels of <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> and consumed more food than rats without wheels. Despite that both groups consumed similar amounts of food during the restricted-feeding phase, only rats with wheels developed symptoms of activity-based anorexia, including increased <b>wheel</b> <b>running,</b> rapid weight loss, and disruptions in estrous cyclicity. Recovery from activity-based anorexia was associated with hypoactivity and hyperphagia. Resumption of estrous cycles occurred when the weight lost during food restriction was regained. Hyperphagia, but not hypoactivity, was maintained following resumption of estrous cycles; however, this hyperphagia was limited to nonestrous phases. Our findings suggest that recovery from activity-based anorexia is mediated primarily by an increase in orexigenic signaling that promotes pronounced hyperphagia, and that the increase in satiogenic signaling during estrus abolishes this compensatory hyperphagia...|$|R

The R-l and R- 2 diets produced identical levels of <b>wheel</b> <b>running.</b> The reduced <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> observed in the BC-fed chicks was not related to a deficiency of vitamins or minerals-, when the BC was supplemented with these nutrients <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> was no different than for the unsup-plemented BC. Levels of hepatic glycogen and triglycerides in BC chicks were higher than in R-l and R- 2 groups, indicating these chicks had sufficient energy stores available to enable them to run at a higher level than that observed. The model system described demonstrates that <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> behavior of chicks may have a potential for rapid evaluation of the effects of diet composition on behavior, especially during the initial reaction to a foodstuff.

40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} (CR) {{reduces the}} rate of cell proliferation in mitotic tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} this reduction in cell proliferation may mediate CR-induced increases in longevity. However, the mechanisms that lead to CR-induced reductions in cell proliferation rates remain unclear. To evaluate the CR-induced physiological adaptations that may mediate reductions in cell proliferation rates, we altered housing temperature and access to voluntary <b>running</b> <b>wheels</b> {{to determine the effects of}} food intake, energy expenditure, percent body fat, and body weight on proliferation rates of keratinocytes, liver cells, mammary epithelial cells, and splenic T-cells in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. We found that ∼ 20 % CR led to a reduction in cell proliferation rates in all cell types. However, lower cell proliferation rates were not observed with reductions in 1) food intake and energy expenditure in female mice housed at 27 °C, 2) percent body fat in female mice provided <b>running</b> <b>wheels,</b> or 3) body weight in male mice provided <b>running</b> <b>wheels</b> compared with ad libitum-fed controls. In contrast, reductions in insulin-like growth factor I were associated with decreased cell proliferation rates. Taken together, these data suggest that CR-induced reductions in food intake, energy expenditure, percent body fat, and body weight do not account for the reductions in global cell proliferation rates observed in CR. In addition, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced cell proliferation rates could be useful as a biomarker of interventions that increase longevity...|$|R
