25|$|With an {{exchange-traded}} future, {{the clearing}} house interposes itself on every trade. Thus {{there is no}} risk of counterparty default. The only <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the clearing house defaults (e.g. become bankrupt), which is considered very unlikely.|$|E
25|$|A further, often ignored, risk in {{derivatives}} such as {{options is}} counterparty risk. In an option contract this <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the seller won't sell or buy the underlying asset as agreed. The risk can be minimized {{by using a}} financially strong intermediary able {{to make good on}} the trade, but in a major panic or crash the number of defaults can overwhelm even the strongest intermediaries.|$|E
25|$|During the {{celebrations}} a message is received that Hassan Khan's army {{has suffered a}} decisive defeat {{at the hands of}} Koroghlu's followers and it has been routed. There is a commotion among the guests. The feast turns to a council of war. Everybody offers its own plan for suppression of the rebels. Khan's jester Hamza's curious offer is the most acceptable: it is to steal Koroghlu's favorite black horse the Ghirr Aat. This will trick Koroghlu to come to free his loyal friend, allowing Khan's men to capture him, depriving the rebellion of its leader. But who will have the courage to steal the horse from the rebels' tower (Chenlibel)? Bald-headed Hamza is chosen to steal the horse. The <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Nigar, Koroghlu's beloved who is in Khan's captivity will know of the plot. But it is a risk to be taken. Hasan khan agrees.|$|E
50|$|Manufactured <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} by the modernization process, particularly by innovative developments in science and technology. They create risk environments that have little historical reference, and are therefore largely unpredictable. Manufactured risk produces a risk society.|$|R

25|$|In finance, {{standard}} deviation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk {{is an important factor in}} determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.|$|E
500|$|One major {{seamount}} <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> often, in {{the late}} of stages of their life, extrusions begin to seep in the seamount. This activity leads to inflation, over-extension of the volcano's flanks, and ultimately flank collapse, leading to submarine landslides {{with the potential to}} start major tsunamis, which can be among the largest natural disasters in the world. In an illustration of the potent power of flank collapses, a summit collapse on the northern edge of Vlinder Seamount resulted in a pronounced headwall scarp and a field of debris up to [...] away. A catastrophic collapse at Detroit Seamount flattened its whole structure extensively. Lastly, in 2004, scientists found marine fossils [...] up the flank of Kohala mountain in Hawaii (island). Subsidation analysis found {{that at the time of}} their deposition, this would have been [...] up the flank of the volcano, far too high for a normal wave to reach. The date corresponded with a massive flank collapse at the nearby Mauna Loa, and it was theorized that it was a massive tsunami, generated by the landslide, that deposited the fossils.|$|E
2500|$|The Times {{commented on}} the day after the arrests, that the {{economic}} effects were minor. It observed that the real commercial <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "people may stop travelling ... because they are tired of complying with necessary security measures." ...|$|E

50|$|Gazprom has {{identified}} {{a number of}} risks related to the project. According to Igor Meshcherin, head of Gazprom's project evaluation directorate, environmental <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> the congested Gulf of Finland and Danish Straits, and ice conditions.

2500|$|A third <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{payments}} on the receivables can shrink the pool balance and under-collateralize total investor interest. [...] To prevent this, often {{there is a}} required minimum seller's interest, {{and if there was}} a decrease then an early amortization event would occur.|$|E
2500|$|A second <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the total}} {{investor}} {{interests and the}} seller's interest are limited to receivables generated by the credit cards, but the seller (originator) owns the accounts. [...] This can cause issues with how the seller controls the terms and conditions of the accounts. [...] Typically to solve this, there is language written into the securitization to protect the investors and potential receivables.|$|E
2500|$|A {{market maker}} in {{corporate}} bonds is constantly trading bonds when clients {{want to buy}} or sell. [...] This can create substantial bond positions. [...] The largest <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> interest rates overall move. [...] The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his long positions in corporate bonds. [...] In this way, the risk that remains is credit risk of the corporate bonds.|$|E
5000|$|One of the <b>risks</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{by cutting}} the tissues, excess scar tissue can [...] "tighten" [...] the airway {{and make it}} even smaller {{than it was before}} UPPP.

2500|$|Another <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a given stock {{may become}} [...] "hard to borrow." [...] As {{defined by the}} SEC and based on lack of availability, a broker may charge a hard to borrow fee daily, without notice, for any day that the SEC {{declares}} a share is hard to borrow. Additionally, a broker {{may be required to}} cover a short seller's position at any time ("buy in"). [...] The short seller receives a warning from the broker that he is [...] "failing to deliver" [...] stock, which leads to the buy-in.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} risks {{involved}} with master trusts specifically. One <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> timing of cash flows promised to investors {{might be different}} from timing of payments on the receivables. [...] For example, credit card-backed securities can have maturities of up to 10 years, but credit card-backed receivables usually pay off much more quickly. To solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period, an accumulation period, and an amortization period. [...] All three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables. During the revolving period, principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables. During the accumulation period, these payments are accumulated in a separate account. During the amortization period, new payments are passed through to the investors.|$|E
2500|$|The other style, the [...] "ghost rider," [...] when {{performed}} correctly, can {{be faster}} than the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] style, but has the tendency to be more dangerous, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it is no longer taught to rookies during rookie week. In order to perform the exchange the rider goes through all the same steps as in the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, except, instead of stepping off the bike, the rider sets the handlebars and then grabs hold of the seat. Once set, the rider will push herself off the back of the bike while it is still moving. As long as the handle bars stay in line and the rider clears the back wheel, then the bike will keep going straight on its own until the other rider grabs hold and jumps on. The name [...] "ghost rider" [...] comes from the fact that when the first rider gets off, the bike keeps going as if someone were really still on it, like a ghost. There are several risks to this exchange. The first is if the first rider doesn't set the handle bars properly, then when she lets go, the bike will swerve and the rider will be thrown from the bike, and possibly take out other members of hers or other teams. Any rider performing this exchange must also be careful to clear the back wheel of the bike or else face the inevitable injuries associated with this type of accident. Another <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the second rider can miss the bike and it will cut into other teams exchanges or even worse, race traffic. In the women's race, the only team to consistently use this technique is Kappa Alpha Theta.|$|E

We have {{to invent}} a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be {{sufficiently}} secure to bring the children up. Yes--wait a bit, and I'll make it clearer what I think ought to be done. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations they'll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! The <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we who keep wild will go savage--degenerate {{into a sort of}} big, savage rat. [...] . You see, how I mean to live is underground. I've been thinking about the drains. Of course those who don't know drains think horrible things; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of miles--and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet and clean. The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone. Then there's cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways. Eh?

40|$|The {{advantage}} of knowing about <b>risks</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{we can change}} our behavior to avoid them.

Even a bath could be dangerous. I could not receive this prize if I sought to avoid all <b>risks.</b> There <b>are</b> some <b>risks</b> we choose to take because the benefits from taking them exceed the possible costs. Optimal behavior takes <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> worthwhile. This is the central paradigm of finance; we must take risks to achieve rewards but not all <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> equally rewarded. Both the risks and the rewards are in the future, so it is the expectation of loss <b>that</b> <b>is</b> balanced against the expectation of reward. Thus we optimize our behavior, and in particular our portfolio, to maximize rewards and minimize risks. time series;...|$|R
