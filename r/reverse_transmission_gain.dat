However, for very high control inputs, i.e., significantly above ξ _ 0, the signal output decreases instead of staying constant as would be desirable for a step-function like profile. We found that this issue can be addressed by transmitting the control input through a single mode Kerr-nonlinear cavity, with resonance frequency chosen such that the <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> |c'/c| is peaked close to c'=ξ_ 0.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Investigate the {{effectiveness}} and frequency dependence of central drive transmission via the alpha-motoneuron pool to the muscle. METHODS: We describe {{a model for}} the simulation of alpha-motoneuron firing and the EMG signal as response to central drive input. The transfer in the frequency domain is investigated. Coherence between stochastical central input and EMG is also evaluated. RESULTS: The transmission of central rhythmicities to the EMG signal relates to the spectral content of the latter. Coherence between central input to the alpha-motoneuron pool and the EMG signal is significant whereby the coupling strength hardly depends on the frequency in a range from 1 to 100 Hz. Common central input to pairs of alpha-motoneurons strongly increases the coherence levels. The often-used rectification of the EMG signal introduces a clear frequency dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Oscillatory phenomena are strongly transmitted via the alpha-motoneuron pool. The motoneuron firing frequencies do {{play a role in the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>gain,</b> but do not influence the coherence levels. Rectification of the EMG signal enhances the <b>transmission</b> <b>gain,</b> but lowers coherence and introduces a strong frequency dependency. We think that it should be avoided.

40|$|In this study, a new {{theoretical}} {{foundation for}} the Discrete-Time Feedback Error Learning (DTFEL) method is proposed. This method {{is analogous to the}} original Continuous-Time Feedback Error Learning (FEL) originally proposed as a control model of the cerebellum in the field of computational neuroscience. DTFEL is superior to FEL since it is applicable for digital controllers which are commonly used nowadays. Based on the strictly positive realness, the stability of DTFEL has been validated. However, from the viewpoint of adaptive control, this condition is restricted since some required assumptions cannot be satisfied in real systems, such as the direct input-output <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> is required to be large. Moreover, the stability of the system is guaranteed by selecting a sufficiently large positive constant feedback gain, which is a vague requirement from the viewpoint of control system design. This study proposes another scheme for the DTFEL method which does not require any positive real condition and overcomes the direct input-output <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> requirement. This can be achieved by utilizing the error signal more effectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully integrated transmitter with embedded on-chip antennas to demonstrate on-wafer wireless testing. First, on-chip antenna characterization methods {{based on the}} measured <b>transmission</b> link <b>gain</b> are described. From the measured <b>transmission</b> link <b>gain,</b> the on-chip antenna gain is determined using the known transmitter gain, a path loss, and an off-chip antenna gain. The proposed two-step method utilizes a high-gain off-chip antenna transmission link for base line calibration data to obtain better gain accuracy. For wireless testing, a fully integrated a 1. 2 -GHz Hartley image-reject transmitter is implemented in an 40 -GHz ft InGaP/GaAs HBT process. The image rejection (IR) ratio is measured to demonstrate process control monitoring of device mismatches. Both dipole and loop antennas are integrated to study their radiation efficiency as their dimensions are much less than the wavelength. The loop antenna provides about 7 dB better <b>transmission</b> <b>gain.</b> The IR ratio is measured wirelessly from a number of samples to monitor the die-to-die variations in the in-phase/quadrature mismatch.

50|$|At high frequencies, the {{parasitic}} capacitances of the transistors (gate-to-drain, gate-to-source, drain-to body, and bipolar equivalents) must {{be included}} in the hybrid pi models to obtain an accurate frequency response. The design goals also differ from the emphasis on overall high gain as described above for low-frequency design. In high frequency circuits, impedance matching at the input and output of the amplifier is typically desired in order to eliminate signal reflections and maximize power gain. In the cascode, the isolation between the input and output ports is still characterized by a small <b>reverse</b> <b>transmission</b> term g12, making it easier to design matching networks because the amplifier is approximately unilateral.|$|R
