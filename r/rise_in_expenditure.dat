By way of comparison, an additional year of schooling of the most educated male in the household is associated with a 3 percentage-point rise in the probability of initial purification, while a standard-deviation increase in the wealth index is associated with a 12 percentage-point rise in this probability and an $ 11. 75 <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Initially purifying households that received a “no contamination ” result did not react by reducing purification.

40|$|Many {{countries}} {{in the developed world}} are ageing in terms of their distribution of population. Conversely, a number of {{countries in}} the south have younger population. India for example, has 60 % of its population in the age group of 15 - 59, with the mean age close to 27 years as of present times. The lower share of population in the higher and lower age brackets make the dependency ratio lower than that of the ageing countries. The economic growth such a large share of working age population can usher in lies {{at the core of the}} demographic dividends. However, low human capital, poor health and inadequate physical infrastructure seems to create significant hurdles in the potential growth path such countries can achieve.

40|$|After {{stabilising}} in {{the years}} after 1995, the Austrian social expenditure ratio went up again, albeit slightly, in 1999. As reported by the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) used by the EU, Austria spent ATS 781 billion (€ 56. 8 million) on social security in 1999, which translated into a growth of 4. 9 percent over the previous year, whereas nominal GDP rose by just 3. 5 percent. In terms of GDP, the social expenditure ratio, at 28. 9 percent, thus was 0. 4 percentage points higher than in 1998. Almost half of the social expenditure (47. 6 percent) was spent on old age and survivors' pensions; 26. 2 percent went to health spending, whereas expenditure on families, at 10. 4 percent, was the third-largest segment in social expenditure. Another 8. 8 percent was paid out as invalidity pensions to people below the age of 60. The remaining 5. 5 percent were expenditures on active and passive labour market policies, rounded off by 1. 6 percent in other expenditures. In comparison with the previous year an above-average growth was found for expenditure on families (7. 7 percent), health (6. 4 percent) and invalidity (6. 1 percent). The increase was even more substantial for the "other expenditures" item (20. 3 percent). These include social assistance paid by the states, benefits in kind rendered at local government level, housing assistance and other benefits to prevent marginalisation. The growth shown by old-age and survivors pensions and unemployment was less pronounced than the overall <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>expenditure</b> on social security. In a European comparison, the Austrian social expenditure ratio of 1998 (social expenditure for 1999 reported in line with the ESSPROS system is not yet available for the EU), is 0. 8 percentage points above the EU- 15 average of 27. 7 percent. In Sweden, France, Denmark and Germany, the ratio was higher than in Austria. Broken down by function groups, deviations from the EU average were found for old age and survivors' pensions and in children and family benefits. In each of these sectors, Austria spends 1. 4 percentage points more, whereas its expenditure on unemployment, housing and efforts to prevent social marginalisation is lower than the EU- 15 average.

40|$|During 2007 - 2009 the U. S. economy {{experienced}} {{the most severe}} financial crisis since the Great Depression. Why did the financial crisis turn into such a severe recession? And what were {{the causes of the}} Great Recession? This dissertation consists of two essays examining these questions. In the first essay I study {{the extent to which the}} increase in uncertainty might have contributed to the severity of the crisis. The second essay examines the reasons behind the fall in the personal saving rate as measured in the National Income and Product Accounts. In the first essay I study the effects of changes in uncertainty on optimal financing and investment in a dynamic firm financing model in which firms have access to complete markets subject to collateral constraints. Entrepreneurs finance projects with their net worth and by issuing state-contingent securities, which have to be collateralized with physical capital. An increase in uncertainty leads to deleveraging, as entrepreneurs reduce their demand for external financing and fund a larger share of their investment from net worth. Upon an increase in uncertainty, investment initially falls as entrepreneurs decrease the scale of their projects. Investment recovers as entrepreneurs build up net worth and transition into an environment with high uncertainty. Quantitatively, changes in uncertainty have large effects on optimal leverage and investment dynamics. The spendthrift nature of U. S. households leading up to the financial crisis has been cited as a major contributing factor for the Great Recession. Indeed, the personal saving rate has been falling since the end of the 1970 s, dropping to as low as nearly 1 percent before the financial crisis. The reasons behind the decline in the personal saving rate have yet to be understood, and thus constituting an important puzzle for economic research. In the second essay, joint work with Maurizio Mazzocco, we provide a potential explanation for the decline in the personal saving rate. Specifically, we show that a single variable can potentially explain the decline in the U. S. personal saving rate from 10 percent in the early eighties to nearly 1 percent in 2007. This variable is medical expenditure by health institutions net of the employers' contributions to pension and insurance funds. Furthermore, if we differentiate between contributions to pension funds and to health plans, we find that the main reason behind the dramatic reduction in the U. S. personal saving rate is the stagnation of employers' contributions to pension funds that started in the early eighties combined with the sharp <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>expenditure</b> by health institutions.

Most of the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>expenditures</b> <b>in</b> 2012 was due to a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> incomes from 2011 to 2012.

40|$|Agricultural input {{expenditures}} {{have not}} been widely incorporated in most partial equilibrium models. Thus, investigating the effect of economic policies and other exogenous factors on the agricultural sector will produce only a partial analysis, since the simultaneous impact of these factors on input expenditures is excluded. This study, therefore, extends the existing partial equilibrium multi-market model of the South African agricultural sector (BFAP model) by incorporating agricultural input expenditure. Thus, {{the analysis of the}} impact of economic policies on the agricultural sector, which was limited only on the gross income (production, area planted and prices), has now been extended to assess their effects on input expenditures, gross value added and net farming income of the sector. In addition, the analysis is further extended to evaluate the financial and economic position of the agricultural sector by investigating the implications of the policies on the asset and debt values of the sector. The comparative result obtained from the shocks of a crude oil and world fertiliser price rise shows that due to the inclusion of the recursive effect from the output to input side of the sector and vice versa and endogenising input costs, the effect of the shock on gross value added and net farming income converges slowly and cyclically in the recursively linked model, compared to the unlinked model, in which the effect abruptly halts after a single year. Thus, the recursively linked integrated model replicates the dynamics experienced by the agricultural sector better than the recursively unlinked integrated model. In addition, the endogenisation of domestic input costs on the integrated model allows a comprehensive analysis of the effect of macroeconomic variables on the agricultural sector by considering their impact on both outputs and inputs. Thus, using the recursively linked model, a fifty percent devaluation of exchange rate is assessed. The result showed that a depreciation of exchange rate resulted in a net benefit for the sector, as the gain from enhancing agricultural income outweighs the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Excluding the simultaneous impact on input expenditure would have overestimated the benefit by looking only at its effect on gross income. The integrated model was also used to project a baseline for the South African agricultural sector’s main aggregate variables for the medium term (2010 - 2015) under the status quo of policy assumptions and forecast values of exogenous variables. The baseline projections of the gross income, intermediate input expenditure and gross value added show a modest average annual growth rate during the baseline period. The net farming income, however, depicts a relatively lower growth due to the general modest rise in agricultural gross income compared with total input expenditure. Based on the projected values of main aggregate variables, several financial and economic performance indicators for the agricultural sector are also projected. In general, the economic performance indicators of the sector, measured by the net return on the sector’s investment and equity, show good performance when compared with the average cost of borrowing during the baseline period. Thus, this study shows that integrating input expenditure in a multi-market output model by recursively linking both sides and endogenising domestic input costs would improve the result of the standard partial equilibrium by generating projections for several key aggregate variables, providing the net effect of economic policies on the agricultural sector and replicating the dynamics of the agricultural sector better than models that have few/no input components or that assess the effects separately and ignore the recursive linkage. Thus, this study provides a powerful modelling tool to be used by policy makers to comprehensively investigate the net effects of economic policies on the agricultural sector and to answer several ‘what if’ questions.

Even with the increase, spending is still below the 2008 level of $ 50, 486. The <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>expenditures</b> <b>in</b> 2011 was due in part to a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> incomes from 2010 to 2011 and the effect of inflation on prices paid by consumers.
