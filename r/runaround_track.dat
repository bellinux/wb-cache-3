2500|$|This video, {{which was}} shot in 2009, shows the <b>runaround</b> <b>track</b> that still exists as of 2012. [...] Also shown are {{the remains of the}} {{abandoned}} Delawanna Plastics siding, which crossed Utter Ave into the site of the former North Hawthorne yard as recently as 2008. [...] At this point, most of the siding has been pulled up, and the crossing has been rebuilt with modern protection.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} layout {{consists of}} a simple yard, with five switches (three lefthand, two righthand), five spurs, and a <b>runaround</b> <b>track</b> at the center. Power is supplied to the track, sufficient to run a locomotive at a fixed slow speed, controlled by a simple center-off reversing switch. Several freight cars are placed on the track, and {{the object is to}} move all of them to clearly marked destination positions.|$|E
50|$|Modifications to the Wilson Yard are {{currently}} being made to accommodate the new Toronto Rocket trains, the Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension and increased demand on Line 1 Yonge-University. Work includes expansion of the carhouse, a new hostler platform to support new the north-end entry/exit track, a new north-end <b>runaround</b> <b>track</b> connecting 8 new storagetracks in the west yard, a new power substation and a new training building with a simulator for TR trains.|$|E
5000|$|Lemmy {{appeared}} on BBC 6 Music's radio programme, Bruce Dickinson's Friday Rock Show [...] on 11 July, 2008, {{to promote the}} album, playing the <b>tracks</b> <b>Runaround</b> Man, which he described as: [...] "..nonsense set to an infectious beat.." [...] Rock Out and The Thousand Names of God, of which he mentioned: [...] "..It's completely extraneous, the title... It's about soldiers being conned into going into battle, for like, business men. It isn't even a cause anymore.." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, SAW {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the highest-selling {{album of the}} year, Jason Donovan's Ten Good Reasons. Donovan had been Minogue's co-star in Neighbours, and his success for a time equalled hers. In 1988-89, SAW recorded three tracks with Judas Priest, a cover and their own tracks I Will Return and <b>Runaround.</b> These <b>tracks</b> were never released, and {{are said to be}} in Judas Priest's possession. Pete Waterman also owns a copy of the recording, commenting to Drowned in Music: [...] "“I occasionally dig the record out and play it to people, and they’re amazed that we made heavy metal.” and also [...] " [...] “They’re probably the best tracks we ever did, but quite rightly their manager said no.". In 2015, a snippet of their cover version of The Stylistics hit [...] "You are everything" [...] was posted on the hard rock news site blabbermouth.net ...|$|R
5000|$|Under the Seaboard Coast Line the {{railroad}} was operated {{in a similar}} fashion to the ACL, with a local freight daily, with the exception of Sundays. Under the SCL, the local train numbers changed to 639 and 638 respectively. Employee timetables of the era scheduled departure of the local in the early morning from Dothan, exiting the mainline at Waterford - a wye junction near Newton - beginning its journey on the designated Elba subdivision of the Waycross division. The local train, or [...] "turn" [...] as it was commonly referred to on account of the train being turned (either via wye or <b>runaround</b> <b>track)</b> {{at the end of the}} line. The [...] "Elba turn" [...] ended its westbound trip at the large Dorsey Trailer facility at the namesake city, Elba, where an additional wye allowed the train to be turned for the return trip east towards Enterprise and eventually Dothan. This routine as established by timetable remained relatively unchanged through the creation of the Seaboard System. Dorsey trailers operated one of the largest trailer manufacturing facilities in the U.S. at Elba, and provided many piggyback trailers for the SCL among other railroads. Later, Utility Trailer opened a plant at Enterprise and constructed a piggyback ramp served by {{the railroad}}.|$|E
50|$|The {{interchange}} of {{cars with}} the national rail system occurs only at the Lee Hall junction where interchange tracks exist linking the FEMRR to (originally) the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) (now CSX). FEMRR engines and cars were not permitted on C&O tracks beyond the Yorktown Road grade crossing except in emergencies. Cars outbound from Fort Eustis would be spotted on a designated interchange track (other than passing track #493, which was a dedicated <b>runaround</b> <b>track)</b> and deemed delivered to the C&O when the bills of lading and switch lists were signed by the C&O station agent. Inbound cars would be spotted on the interchange track by the C&O and deemed delivered to the Government when uncoupled from the engine (or {{the rest of the}} train) that brought them there. FEMRR engines and trains were not allowed on the C&O main line except in emergencies. However, with proper prior arrangement, C&O trains or light engines (engines under power but not coupled to cars or dead engines) were allowed to operate on FEMRR tracks on the Industrial Subdivision (save the Port Branch), the Wye Tower Interlocking Plant, and the part of the James River Subdivision between O’Brien, the wye and Hanks, including Hanks Yard. The Commanding Officer, Company A, 714th TBROS&DE had to approve the use of any other tracks by the C&O. All C&O trains and light engines were to be provided a pilot and any necessary highway crossing protection.|$|E
5000|$|The Gilded Age iron {{industrialist}} {{and railroad}} president Robert Habersham Coleman {{decided that a}} 4-mile (7-kilometer) narrow-gauge railroad {{to the top of}} nearby Governor Dick Mountain would provide an additional tourist draw, and a 0.6-mile (1 kilometer) spur at milepost 0.75 could service the Pennsylvania National Guard rifle ranges nearby. [...] The line was built to the rare (in North America) and very narrow gauge of 24 in. Locomotives, apart from an early and unsuccessful H. K. Porter, Inc 0-4-4 Forney locomotive, were three 4-4-0 [...] "American" [...] types (#11, #12 and #15) built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. Locomotive #12 was ordered on 22 June 1889 and built in only 8 days to be ready for anticipated Independence Day crowds after the Porter Forney wheelbase proved too rigid for reliable service on small-radius curves. The Baldwin locomotives featured lagged smokeboxes and were the only [...] gauge 4-4-0s ever operated in North America; although Baldwin built a [...] gauge 4-4-0 for the Ferrocarril de Tacubaya of Mexico City in 1897.Rails weighing [...] were spiked onto the 4 in face of ties 3 ft long. A turntable, engine-house, water tank, <b>runaround</b> <b>track,</b> and storage tracks were near the junction with the Cornwall & Lebanon at Mount Gretna. Return loops were built near the rifle range and around Governor Dick peak. During the summer of 1889 passengers were carried in one conventional coach and 7 open-sided observation cars boarded from long foot-boards running along the length of either side of the car. Two more observation cars were added when locomotive #15 was purchased for the summer of 1890. [...] At first the railroad was popular, but the tourist trade declined after the novelty had died down. The loop around Governor Dick was dismantled after the summer of 1896, but the railroad continued operation for the National Guard rifle range. A serious accident in 1915 killed off that traffic. One of the observation cars overturned on a sharp curve when a large number of guardsmen attempted to board simultaneously {{from one side of the}} car. [...] There were some serious injuries, and the tiny railroad ceased operation in the summer of 1916, shortly after its parent company's purchase by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The narrow-gauge equipment was loaded aboard standard gauge cars on 14 September 1916.|$|E
