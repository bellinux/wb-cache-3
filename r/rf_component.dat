A metal transfer mechanism is introduced into the conventional micro-molding process to realize polymer-core <b>RF</b> passive <b>components</b> and integration. A system-on-package (SOP) integration scheme of front-end <b>RF</b> <b>components</b> can be realized by this process. Several air-lifted <b>RF</b> <b>components</b> based on MTM technology have been presented with excellent performance. As an integration application of the MTM technology, a novel wireless passive airflow sensor based on the RF evanescent-mode cavity resonators has been also presented. The sensor makes use of RF technology to measure wind velocity through changes in the resonant frequency with applied airflow. Compared with reported wireless sensors based on conventional RF cavity resonator, this design has advantages such as compact size and greatly improved sensitivity. Wireless interrogating has also been demonstrated for the passive sensor. Overall, the <b>RF</b> <b>components</b> developed in this thesis illustrate the great potential of MTM technology in both wireless communication and sensor areas. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Mark G.
