5|$|The Wii's success caught {{third-party}} developers by surprise, {{leading to}} apologies {{for the quality}} of their early games. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. Take-Two Interactive, which released few games for the Nintendo GameCube, changed its stance towards Nintendo by placing a higher priority on the Wii.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have portable cases, {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to come to them. Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes of sand and other particles held together by silk and anchored to the bottom, and feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across the surface.|$|E
5|$|The band's third album, Emotive, was {{released}} on November 2, 2004 - the actual U.S Presidential Election Day. However, the album received a much more polarizing reception than the prior two albums, with some critics and fans not appreciating the band's move into more political content, or the radical liberties they had taken with the album's cover versions. Other's accused the band of <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> a third album {{in order to fulfill}} the band's three album contractual obligation to Virgin Records, a claim refuted as false by Howerdel. The album still managed to receive a generally positive reception from critics. Sales were similarly positive, but less so than prior albums. The position debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 142,000 copies in its first week - matching Thirteenth Step's peak chart placement, but selling almost 90,000 copies less. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA, indicating 500,000 units sold.|$|E

It might not even figure in the Top 10 of reasons to <b>rush</b> <b>out</b> and buy 'The Greatest Hits of Calvin Harris', for all that it has {{earned the right to}} be on there in the first place. In fact, it possibly isn't even among the Top 5 of reasons to <b>rush</b> <b>out</b> and buy Calvin's current album 'Ready For The Weekend', from which it is taken. And that's assuming that people still <b>rush</b> <b>out</b> to buy albums, which apparently they do not.|$|R

5|$|In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. Although not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play the ball out from the back on the ground to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, or find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E
25|$|On 23 January 1958, a coup d'état was {{performed}} against Pérez Jiménez. Pérez Jiménez, fleeing from Miraflores Palace, went to La Carlota Airport to seek exile in the Dominican Republic.

25|$|The two valleys {{are quite}} {{different}} in character. Spiti is more barren and difficult to cross, with an average elevation of the valley floor of 4,270 m (14,009ft). It is enclosed between lofty ranges, with the Spiti river <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> of a gorge in the southeast to meet the Sutlej River. It is a typical mountain desert area with an average annual rainfall of only 170mm (6.7inches).|$|E

25|$|The frantic pace of The Tracey Ullman Show {{was one of}} the {{key factors}} in her {{decision}} to give up television. That show was shot in front of a live studio audience and featured her playing on average three characters a week. She frequently wore layers of costuming to disguise herself. The prosthetic makeup was at times excessive. In her book Tracey Takes On, she recalls an incident where she fainted on the makeup room floor, having to be revived before <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> to give a performance.|$|E
25|$|Collishaw {{had quite}} a few close escapes during the war. His plane was hit often by bullets, but Collishaw escaped unscathed in the air. His {{aircraft}} was shot down {{out of control and}} crashed several times. Once, lost in a fog, he landed on a German aerodrome, and was actually taxiing to the tarmac when he saw German insignia on the grounded planes, and German troops <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> to arrest him. He opened his throttle wide, took off, and escaped. On another occasion, his goggles were shattered by an enemy bullet. He once had his controls disabled by German machine gun fire from the ground and had to ride out the flight until the aircraft crash-landed – luckily near the British front trenches.|$|E

25|$|Charles Carroll {{was portrayed}} by actor Terrence Currier in the 2004 film National Treasure with Nicolas Cage. He is {{accurately}} {{described as the}} last living signatory of the Declaration of Independence. Although the film does not explicitly state it, it is implied that Carroll died in Washington, D.C. It is inaccurately stated that Carroll was a Mason; historians of freemasonry agree {{that there is no}} evidence that he was, though his son (also named Charles Carroll) is known to have been a member. A scene which did not make the final cut of the film (but appears as a deleted scene on the DVD) shows then-President Jackson <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> of the White House to find Carroll's body in a carriage. Carroll is mentioned in the movie Gone with the Wind.|$|E
25|$|The Chittorgarh Fort is {{the largest}} in India; it is a symbol for Rajput resistance. Chittorgarh Fort was sacked three times during the 15th and 16th centuries by Muslim armies. In 1303 Allauddin Khalji {{defeated}} Rana Ratan Singh; in 1535 Bahadur Shah, the Sultanate of Gujarat defeated Bikramjeet Singh; and in 1567 Akbar defeated Maharana Udai Singh II, who left the fort and founded Udaipur. Each time the men fought bravely <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> of the fort walls charging the enemy, but lost. Following these defeats, Jauhar was committed thrice {{by many of the}} wives and children of the Rajput soldiers who died in battles at Chittorgarh Fort. The first time, this was led by Rani Padmini wife of Rana Rattan Singh who was killed in the battle in 1303, and later by Rani Karnavati in 1537.|$|E
25|$|Crocodiles are ambush predators, {{waiting for}} fish or land animals to come close, then <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> to attack. Crocodiles mostly eat fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, reptiles, and mammals, and they {{occasionally}} cannibalize smaller crocodiles. What a crocodile eats varies greatly with species, size and age. From the mostly fish-eating species, like the slender-snouted and freshwater crocodiles, {{to the larger}} species like the Nile crocodile and the saltwater crocodile that prey on large mammals, such as buffalo, deer and wild boar, diet shows great diversity. Diet is also greatly affected by the size and age of the individual within the same species. All young crocodiles hunt mostly invertebrates and small fish, gradually moving on to larger prey. Being ectothermic (cold-blooded) predators, {{they have a very}} slow metabolism, so they can survive long periods without food. Despite their appearance of being slow, crocodiles have a very fast strike and are top predators in their environment, and various species have been observed attacking and killing other predators such as sharks and big cats. As opportunistic predators, crocodiles would also prey upon young and dying elephants and hippos when given the chance. Crocodiles are also known to be aggressive scavengers who feed upon carrion and steal from other predators. Evidence suggests that crocodiles also feed upon fruits, based on the discovery of seeds in stools and stomachs from many subjects as well as accounts of them feeding.|$|E

2500|$|That day, the EU {{proposed}} issuing £135,000,000 {{in agricultural}} compensation to its farmers.

The EU's health commissioner, John Dalli, had formally criticised Germany earlier that day for <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> [...] "premature conclusions" [...] about the source of an outbreak, and only helped to spread alarm among the public and farmers and untimely leading to the damaging the EU's agriculture sector.
