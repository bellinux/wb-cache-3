[...] For the Arts Council, he wrote the ballet portion of their 1969 plan, A Report on Opera and Ballet in the United Kingdom 1966-69, which resulted in the creation of regional companies such as the Northern Dance Theatre. He chaired the Arts Council's dance advisory committee from 1973 to 1980. He founded and chaired the Dancers' Pensions and <b>Resettlement</b> <b>Fund</b> from 1975 to 1992.

40|$|The {{stacking}} {{orders in}} few-layer graphene (FLG) strongly influences the electronic {{properties of the}} material. To explore the stacking-specific properties of FLG in detail, one needs powerful microscopy techniques that visualize stacking domains with sufficient spatial resolution. We demonstrate that infrared (IR) scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (sSNOM) directly maps out the stacking domains of FLG with a nanometric resolution, based on the stacking-specific IR conductivities of FLG. The intensity and phase contrasts of sSNOM are compared with the sSNOM contrast model, {{which is based on}} the dipolar tip-sample coupling and the theoretical conductivity spectra of FLG, allowing a clear assignment of each FLG domain as Bernal, rhombohedral, or intermediate stacks for tri-, tetra-, and pentalayer graphene. The method offers 10 - 100 times better spatial resolution than the far-field Raman and infrared spectroscopic methods, yet it allows far more experimental flexibility than the scanning tunneling microscopy and electron microscopy.

50|$|Since his {{appointment}} as the Mayor of Rongelap, Matayoshi campaigned vigorously for anti-nuclear causes and often attended memorial events pertaining to nuclear warfare in Japan {{as well as}} the Marshall Islands. Between 2005 and 2007, Matayoshi led lobbies against the Nuclear Claims Tribunal to provide monetary compensation to victims of nuclear bombs testings, which were targeted to be used for reconstruction efforts and facilitating resettlement in Rongelap. Japan also provided <b>resettlement</b> <b>funds</b> to Rongelap to 2005, which was motivated in part to Matayoshi's ancestral and diplomatic ties that he established with Japan.|$|R

40|$|Each year, over 100, 000 {{children}} are apprehended entering the United States unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, and without valid immigration documents. As many as 8, 000 of these {{children are}} placed in an elaborate sys-tem of border patrol detention centers, shelter facilities, and courts. While the Department of Health and Human Services (through the Office of Refugee <b>Resettlement)</b> <b>funds</b> programs that care for the undocumented immigrants, the Department of Justice, (through the Department of Homeland Security) sweeps up and deports the very same children (or their parents). Apprehended children therefore bring to light the competing agendas of security and humanitarian-ism. Based on interviews with policy makers and program officers, visits to the shelters, and interviews with the children, this article explores the politics of compassion surrounding these migrants.

50|$|In the 1850s H.W. {{participated in}} the public discussions of the era {{concerning}} slavery. H.W. was a Congregationalist and abolitionist. As the political turmoil increased he decided on {{a course of action}} inspired by the New England Emigrant Aid Company of Boston. This company was formed to facilitate overland treks to Kansas of Free-Stater families to help throw pre-statehood Kansas into the abolitionists camp. The New England Emigrant Aid Company was formed to help <b>fund</b> <b>resettlement</b> of abolitionist sympathizers in Kansas prior to referendums to determine if Kansas would be a slave state. Three groups sponsored by the Society set out for Kansas - the first in March 1855. H.W. didn't leave New England until March 4, 1856 with his new wife who was pregnant and with his two small daughters from his first marriage. It took six weeks to trek by wagon to Kansas.|$|R
5000|$|Pole Evans {{set about}} {{expanding}} the Dongola Botanical Reserve. By the early 1940s the reserve {{had grown to}} include 27 farms, including Greefswald, the property on which the Mapungubwe Hill is situated. Pole Evans lobbied to have the reserve proclaimed as a national park, {{with the support of}} Prime Minister Jan Smuts. In 1944 Minister of Lands, Andrew Conroy proposed the formation of the Dongola Wild Life Sanctuary which would include 124 farms, 86 of which were privately owned. This proposal was strongly opposed by the National Party, then the official opposition in parliament and the National Parks Board of Trustees. In one of the longest running debates {{in the history of the}} South African parliament, supporters argued that it was necessary to conserve the country's natural assets, that the land set aside for the proposed reserve was unsuitable for agricultural purposes and that the area had a rich archaeology which should be protected. Those opposed to the establishment of the reserve argued that it was unacceptable to alienate agricultural land for wildlife conservation, to expropriate private land or to evict people from land they had occupied for generations. The debate, which has become known as the [...] "Battle of Dongola", resulted in the declaration of a much reduced area as the Dongola Wildlife Sanctuary, after members of the ruling United Party voted in favour of the proposal. The National Party won the elections in 1948, and the sanctuary was abolished in 1949. Expropriated farms were returned to their original farmers, farms owned by the state were allocated for <b>resettlement</b> and <b>funds</b> returned to donors.|$|R
40|$|Though they {{represent}} {{a small proportion of}} the total immigrant population in the U. S., refugees {{play a significant role in}} many cities and towns that have recently received substantial numbers of refugees but have little experience with immigrants. Despite their access to temporary <b>resettlement</b> services <b>funded</b> by the federal government, refugees experience constant and intense needs that are rarely fulfilled by formal assistance alone. Since most refugees lack strong social networks, they typically rebuild their social networks and use them for informal support after they arrive in the U. S. Because refugees are such extreme cases, I argue that focusing on their experiences offers important insights into how individuals create and use social capital, and what effect it has on various outcomes in their lives. This dissertation uses a mixed-methods approach to examine three distinct facets of social capital in the lives of refugees living in a non-gateway city. Multiple regression models reveal that social capital can affect earnings positively for male refugees, but negatively for female refugees. The different ways that male and female refugees experience social norms and reciprocal obligations that accompany social capital help to explain these divergent outcomes. When choosing which social ties to ask for assistance, interviews with Somali and Sudanese refugees indicate that, in addition to considering their self-interest, refugees also seek to maintain a dignified self. Further, refugees use social status and justifications for why they need assistance to help determine whom they ask for help. Finally, as "incubators" of social capital, religious institutions can play an important role in the lives of refugees. (cont.) Evidence from interviews and participant observation at multiple religious institutions suggests that, in a non-gateway context, the functions of religious institutions differ for refugees from majority and minority religious traditions. I found that Catholic refugees use their church for bonding and bridging purposes, while Muslim refugees use their mosque primarily for bonding purposes. What role a religious institution plays in the life of a refugee is directly related to the interaction between context, and the socio-economic status and religious affiliation of refugees. by Ryan Allen.
