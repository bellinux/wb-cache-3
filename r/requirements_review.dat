25|$|The {{roots of}} the Howze Board {{may be found in}} the 1960 Army Aircraft <b>Requirements</b> <b>Review</b> Board (commonly {{referred}} to as the Rogers Board, after its chairman, Lieutenant General Gordon B. Rogers). The Rogers Board concentrated on evaluating aircraft designs (both helicopters and light fixed wing designs) for the Army and did not develop plans for their operational use, focusing instead on design issues and the question of how often replacement designs should be considered. It did recommend that an operational use study be considered, and mentioned the possibility of creating a unit to test operational concepts. Both these suggestions would find expression in the Howze Board.|$|E

The Rogers Board's members included Major Generals Hamilton H. Howze, Thomas F. Van Natta, Alva R. Fitch, Richard D. Meyer, Ernest F. Easterbrook, and chairman Lieutenant General Gordon B.

2500|$|On January 4, 2007, NASA {{announced}} that the Ares I had completed its system <b>requirements</b> <b>review,</b> the first such review completed for any manned spacecraft design since the Space Shuttle. This review {{was the first major}} milestone in the design process, and was intended to ensure that the Ares I launch system met all the requirements necessary for the Constellation Program. In addition to the release of the review, NASA also {{announced that}} a redesign in the tank hardware was made. Instead of separate LH2 and LO2 tanks, separated by an [...] "intertank" [...] like that of the Space Shuttle External Tank, the new LH2 and LOX tanks would have been separated by a common bulkhead like that employed on the Saturn V S-II and S-IVB stages. This would have provided a significant mass saving and eliminated the need to design a second stage interstage unit that would have had to carry the weight of the Orion spacecraft with it.|$|E
