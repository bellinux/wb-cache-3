He became a full professor in 1952 and {{was the director of}} Nevis Laboratories from 1951 to 1954 and again from 1957 to 1961. He worked with his student Val Fitch on studies of muonic atoms, atoms where an electron is replaced by a muon. After 1965, he worked on turning the Nevis synchrotron into a meson facility. When a reporter <b>rang</b> <b>in</b> 1975 to inform him that he had won the Nobel Prize in Physics, he initially thought that it was for his work on muonic atoms. Several hours passed before he discovered that it was for his was for his work on atomic structure, the Nobel Prize being shared with Bohr and Mottelson.|$|E

We investigate in this work the set of intermediate <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> such <b>ring</b> extensions.

25|$|The {{qualifying}} round {{was played}} in two parts. In the first part, {{a clue to}} the word was given. The point value for the word decreased by five points from a starting value of 100 for every third of a second no one <b>rang</b> <b>in.</b> If the value reached 25 points, host Chuck Henry would tell the contestants what line the word was on. In {{the second part of the}} round, a new board was played and the point values doubled. The first contestant to reach 1,000 points advanced to the championship round while the losing contestant went home with parting gifts.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} {{territory of}} Champa roughly equals the South Central Coast region, {{although it has}} at times extended well into the North Central Coast and its influence also extended into the Central Highlands. Except for its first capital, all of Champa's political centers were located in the South Central Coast. Some of the earlier capitals, {{as well as the}} religious center of Mỹ Sơn and the port city of Hội An were located in the territory of present-day Quảng Nam Province. Probably due to defeats in wars against Đại Việt the political center shifted further south to Vijaya in what is now Bình Định Province. After the fall of Vijaya to Vietnam in 1471, Champa had to retreat to the southern principality of Panduranga (now at Phan <b>Rang</b> <b>in</b> Ninh Thuận Province), while much of occupied Champa continued to exist as a sort of protectorate within Vietnam for some time.|$|E
50|$|The {{three classes}} of prostanoids have {{distinctive}} <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> {{the center of}} the molecule. They differ in their structures. The PGH compounds (parents to all the rest) have a 5-carbon ring, bridged by two oxygens (a peroxide.)

500|$|... "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] {{garnered}} {{a generally}} positive response amongst music critics. Christina Garibaldi of MTV News was complimentary of the song, praising Carey's [...] "impressive" [...] vocal range and specifically {{drawing attention to}} the high note that she ends the song with. Garibaldi stated that [...] "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] serves as a reminder as to why Carey is [...] "still the fiercest diva in the game". Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshutz noted that the slow structure {{for the majority of}} the song could have made it a [...] "sleepy" [...] R song, but noted that the [...] "inevitable" [...] high note saves it from becoming so. Jamieson Cox of Time echoed Garibaldi's sentiments, writing [...] "It's a gaseous, fluffy ballad that feels like a direct descendant of the song that <b>rang</b> <b>in</b> her mid-career renaissance, 2005's mega-hit 'We Belong Together': plinking piano melodies, a typically fluttering Carey vocal take, and a very similar beat. Only time will tell if 'You're Mine (Eternal)' can duplicate that song's record-breaking success".|$|E
500|$|From {{the premiere}} of the {{original}} Jeopardy! {{until the end of}} the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring-in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing-in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal; attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second. The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was [...] "distracting to the viewers" [...] and sometimes presented a problem when contestants <b>rang</b> <b>in</b> while Trebek was still reading the clue. Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud.|$|E
