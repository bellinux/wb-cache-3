5|$|Several {{currently}} prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including Adderall, AdderallXR, Mydayis, , DyanavelXR, and Evekeo, {{the last}} of which contains <b>racemic</b> amphetamine sulfate. Amphetamine is also prescribed in enantiopure and prodrug form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of <b>racemic</b> amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. However, oral suspension and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the free base were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.|$|E
5|$|One {{published}} {{study that}} analysed samples of mephedrone bought {{using the internet}} in the UK in 2010 found it was <b>racemic</b> (a mixture of both stereoisomers) and of high purity. An unpublished study of six samples also ordered off the internet in the UK in 2010 found they contained very few organic impurities. Four products sold in Irish head shops were tested in 2010 and were found to contain between 82% and 14% mephedrone, with some products containing benzocaine and caffeine.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{consists}} of a <b>racemic</b> mixture of two active enantiomers—R- and S- forms—each of which is cleared by different pathways. S-warfarin is 2-5 times more potent than the R-isomer in producing an anticoagulant response. Both the enantiomers of warfarin undergo CYP-mediated metabolism by many different CYPs to form 3',4',6,7,8 and 10-hydroxy warfarin metabolites, major being 7-OH warfarin formed from S-warfarin by CYP2C9 and 10-OH warfarin from R-warfarin by CYP3A4.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives <b>racemic</b> mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
25|$|Most complex natural {{products}} are chiral, and the bioactivity of chiral molecules {{varies with the}} enantiomer. Historically, total syntheses targeted <b>racemic</b> mixtures, mixtures of both possible enantiomers, after which the <b>racemic</b> mixture might then be separated via chiral resolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Racemic</b> {{epinephrine}} {{has historically}} been used {{for the treatment of}} croup. Regular epinephrine however works equally well. <b>Racemic</b> adrenaline is a 1:1 mixture of the dextrorotatory (D) and levorotatory (L) isomers of adrenaline. The L-form is the active component. <b>Racemic</b> adrenaline works by stimulation of the alpha adrenergic receptors in the airway, with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema, and by stimulation of the β adrenergic receptors, with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam {{exists as}} a <b>racemic</b> mixture. Early {{attempts}} to isolate enantiomers were unsuccessful; the corresponding acetate has been isolated {{as a single}} enantiomer. Given the different rates of epimerization that occur at different pH levels, {{it was determined that}} there would be no therapeutic benefit to the administration of a single enantiomer over the <b>racemic</b> mixture.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the first}} study elucidating {{reasonably}} the formation of chirality from <b>racemic</b> amino acids with experimental evidences.|$|E
25|$|Subcutaneous {{injection}} of <b>racemic</b> synephrine into rabbits {{was reported to}} cause a large rise in blood sugar.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{was awarded}} 1,500 francs in 1853 by the Pharmaceutical Society for the {{synthesis}} of <b>racemic</b> acid. In 1856 the Royal Society of London presented him the Rumford Medal for his discovery {{of the nature of}} <b>racemic</b> acid and its relations to polarized light, and the Copley Medal in 1874 for his work on fermentation. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1869.|$|E
25|$|Common salts of <b>racemic</b> synephrine are its hydrochloride, C9H13NO2.HCl, m.p.150–152°, the oxalate (C9H13NO2)2.C2H2O4, m.p.221–222°C, and the {{tartrate}} (Sympatol), (C9H13NO2)2.C4H6O6, m.p.188–190°C.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethylphenidate is {{much more}} {{bioavailable}} than levomethylphenidate when administered orally, and is primarily responsible for the psychoactivity of <b>racemic</b> methylphenidate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Racemic</b> {{methionine}} can be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate by alkylation with chloroethylmethylsulfide (ClCH2CH2SCH3) {{followed by}} hydrolysis and decarboxylation.|$|E
25|$|Homochirality {{refers to}} the {{geometric}} property of some materials that are composed of chiral units. Chiral refers to nonsuperimposable 3D forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. Living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality ("handedness"): with almost no exceptions, amino acids are left-handed while nucleotides and sugars are right-handed. Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but {{in the absence of}} a chiral source or a chiral catalyst, they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both enantiomers (called a <b>racemic</b> mixture). Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from <b>racemic</b> starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the Earth's rotation, statistical fluctuations during <b>racemic</b> synthesis, and spontaneous symmetry breaking.|$|E
25|$|In insects, synephrine {{has been}} found to be a very potent agonist at many {{invertebrate}} octopamine receptor preparations, and is even more potent than octopamine at a locust (Schistocerca americana gregaria) nerve-muscle preparation. Synephrine (<b>racemic)</b> is also more potent than octopamine (<b>racemic)</b> at inducing light-emission in the firefly (Photinus species) light organ. Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity and in decreasing clotting time in lobster (Homarus americanus) hematocytes. <b>Racemic</b> synephrine was found to increase cAMP in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with octopamine in stimulating JH (juvenile hormone) release in the corpora allata of honey bee (Apis mellifera), but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of JH III, in in vitro preparations from the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus.|$|E
25|$|Ofloxacin is a <b>racemic</b> mixture, which {{consists}} of 50% levofloxacin (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or enantiomer dextrofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Racemic</b> synephrine, given intramuscularly, or by instillation, {{was found}} to {{significantly}} reduce the inflammation caused by instillation of mustard oil {{into the eyes of}} rabbits.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} formula of zileuton is C11H12N2O2S with a molecular weight of 236.29. The formulation from the manufacturer is a <b>racemic</b> mixture of R(+) and S(-) enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|Levofloxacin is the levo isomer of the {{racemate}} ofloxacin, another quinolone antimicrobial agent. Levofloxacin, a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is {{the pure}} (−)-(S)-enantiomer of the <b>racemic</b> ofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Racemic</b> synephrine {{has been}} shown to be an agonist of the TAAR1, {{although}} its potency at the human TAAR1 is relatively low (EC50 = 23700 nM; Emax = 81.2%).|$|E
25|$|The two crystal {{forms for}} <b>racemic</b> menthol have melting points of 28°C and 38°C. Pure (−)-menthol has four crystal forms, {{of which the}} most stable is the α form, the {{familiar}} broad needles.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} {{medications}} derived from methylphenidate's isomers: a <b>racemic</b> mixture of half d-threo-methylphenidate and half l-threo-methylphenidate called methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), and an enantiopure formulation containing just d-threo-methylphenidate called dexmethylphenidate (Focalin).|$|E
25|$|Ketorolac acts by {{inhibiting}} {{the bodily}} synthesis of prostaglandins. Ketorolac in its oral (tablet or capsule) and intramuscular (injected) preparations is a <b>racemic</b> mixture of both (S)-(−)-ketorolac, the active isomer, and (R)-(+)-ketorolac.|$|E
25|$|Burgen and Iversen, {{examining}} {{the effect of}} a broad range of phenethylamine-based drugs on -norepinephrine-uptake in the isolated rat heart, observed that <b>racemic</b> synephrine was a relatively weak inhibitor (IC50 = 0.12 μM) of the uptake.|$|E
25|$|Deprenyl is a <b>racemic</b> compound, {{a mixture}} of two isomers called enantiomers. Further work {{determined}} that the levorotatory enantiomer was a more potent MAO-inhibitor, {{which was published in}} 1967, and subsequent work was done with the single enantiomer L-deprenyl.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide is {{provided}} as a <b>racemic</b> mixture of two enantiomers; {{while there are}} reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects, the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Known {{mechanisms}} {{for the production}} of non-racemic mixtures from <b>racemic</b> starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during <b>racemic</b> synthesis. Once established, chirality would be selected for. A small enantiomeric excess can be amplified into a large one by asymmetric autocatalysis, such as in the Soai reaction. In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.|$|E
25|$|Morphine {{and most}} of its {{derivatives}} do not exhibit optical isomerism, although some more distant relatives like the morphinan series (levorphanol, dextorphan and the <b>racemic</b> parent chemical dromoran) do, and as noted above stereoselectivity in vivo is an important issue.|$|E
25|$|A later study, by Lands and Grant, {{showed that}} a dose of ~0.6mg/kg of <b>racemic</b> synephrine, given {{intravenously}} to anesthetized dogs, produced a rise in blood pressure of 34mmHg lasting 5–10 minutes, and estimated that this pressor activity was about 1/300x that of epinephrine.|$|E
25|$|Methylphenidate was {{originally}} available as an immediate-release <b>racemic</b> mixture formulation under the Novartis trademark name Ritalin, although {{a variety of}} generics are now available, some under other brand names. Generic brand names include Ritalina, Rilatine, Attenta, Medikinet, Metadate, Methylin, Penid, Tranquilyn, and Rubifen.|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; {{mianserin}} {{was developed}} by the same team of organic chemists and mirtazapine differs from it via addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings. It is a <b>racemic</b> mixture of enantiomers. The (S)-(+)-enantiomer is known as esmirtazapine.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in 2004 that excess <b>racemic</b> D,L-asparagine (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing <b>racemic</b> amino acid such as arginine (Arg), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), leucine (Leu), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), serine (Ser), valine (Val), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp). The enantiomeric excess {ee=100x(L-D)/(L+D)} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly {{with that of the}} inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 D,L-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess D,L-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized. It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in L- or D-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee {{was reported}} to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of <b>racemic</b> amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid is chiral, {{consisting}} of two optical isomers. One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (S)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D-(−)-lactic acid or (R)-lactic acid. A mixture of the two in equal amounts is called DL-lactic acid, or <b>racemic</b> lactic acid.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} {{virtually}} all other simple phenylethanolamines (β-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (R)-(−)-, or l-, enantiomer of synephrine is more potent than the (S)-(+)-, or d-, enantiomer in most, {{but not all}} preparations studied. However, the majority of {{studies have been conducted}} with a <b>racemic</b> mixture of the two enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the synephrine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists {{in the form of}} two enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, or as the <b>racemic</b> mixture, d,l- synephrine. The dextrorotatory d-isomer corresponds to the (S)-configuration, and the levorotatory l-isomer to the (R)-configuration.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commercial}} {{process is}} the Haarmann-Reimer process. This process starts from m-cresol which is alkylated with propene to thymol. This compound is hydrogenated in the next step. <b>Racemic</b> menthol is isolated by fractional distillation. The enantiomers are separated by chiral resolution in reaction with methyl benzoate, selective crystallisation followed by hydrolysis.|$|E
