NEXRAD precipitation products {{are used to}} simulate space-time rainfall #elds, which can be sampled by hypothetical <b>raingage</b> networks.

40|$|Spatial {{interpolation}} {{of precipitation}} data {{is of great}} importance for hydrological modelling. Geostatistical methods (kriging) are widely applied in spatial interpolation from point measurement to continuous surfaces. The first step in kriging computation is the semi-variogram modelling which usually used only one variogram model for all-moment data. The objective {{of this paper was}} to develop different algorithms of spatial interpolation for daily rainfall on 1 km 2 regular grids in the catchment area and to compare the results of geostatistical and deterministic approaches. This study leaned on 30 -yr daily rainfall data of 70 <b>raingages</b> in the hilly landscape of the Ourthe and Ambleve catchments in Belgium (2908 km 2). This area lies between 35 and 693 m in elevation and consists of river networks, which are tributaries of the Meuse River. For geostatistical algorithms, seven semi-variogram models (logarithmic, power, exponential, Gaussian, rational quadratic, spherical and penta-spherical) were fitted to daily sample semi-variogram on a daily basis. These seven variogram models were also adopted to avoid negative interpolated rainfall. The elevation, extracted from a digital elevation model, was incorporated into multivariate geostatistics. Seven validation <b>raingages</b> and cross validation were used to compare the interpolation performance of these algorithms applied to different densities of <b>raingages.</b> We found that between the seven variogram models used, the Gaussian model was the most frequently best fit. Using seven variogram models can avoid negative daily rainfall in ordinary kriging. The negative estimates of kriging were observed for convective more than stratiform rain. The performance of the different methods varied slightly according to the density of <b>raingages,</b> particularly between 8 and 70 <b>raingages</b> but it was much different for interpolation using 4 <b>raingages.</b> Spatial interpolation with the geostatistical and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) algorithms outperformed considerably the interpolation with the Thiessen polygon, commonly used in various hydrological models. Integrating elevation into Kriging with an External Drift (KED) and Ordinary Cokriging (OCK) did not improve the interpolation accuracy for daily rainfall. Ordinary Kriging (ORK) and IDW were considered to be the best methods, as they provided smallest RMSE value for nearly all cases. Care should be taken in applying UNK and KED when interpolating daily rainfall with very few neighbourhood sample points. These recommendations complement the results reported in the literature. ORK, UNK and KED using only spherical model offered a slightly better result whereas OCK using seven variogram models achieved better result. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Precipitation data have been analyzed by several investigators over the years. Arizona has been subdivided into precipitation zones, and seasonal and annual precipitation isohyetal maps are available from several sources. Because of a paucity of <b>raingages</b> in the more mountainous regions, however, isohyetal lines in these regions have been largely estimated based on the assumptions of topographic influences. Now, with 158 <b>raingages</b> with 30 {{or more years of}} record, topographic factors can be combined with greater knowledge of the sources and paths of moisture into the state to better define annual and seasonal precipitation variability. Elevation and aspect appear to be the principal parameters for analyzing precipitation within the state, with the Mogollon Rim exerting the greatest influence on winter precipitation.

The potential for these events is particularly high in the western U.

In this work, a hydrologic model is developed that is capable of effectively describing the rainfall-runoff relationship of extreme thunderstorms in arid and semi-arid regions. The model was calibrated and validated using data from ten storms at the semi-arid Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. A methodology is also proposed for reducing the amount of <b>raingages</b> required to provide acceptable inputs to the hydrologic model, and also determining the most appropriate placement location for these gages. Results show that the model is capable of reproducing peak discharges, peak timings, and total volumes to within 22. 1 %, 12 min, and 32. 8 %, respectively. Results of the gage reduction procedure show that a decrease in the amount of <b>raingages</b> used to drive the model results in a disproportionally smaller decrease in model accuracy.

Thus, this paper aims to study the rainfall frequencies in such region through the wavelet transform. An application of wavelet analysis is done with long time series of the total monthly rainfall amount of several places from Paraíba state in northeastern Brazil. The main frequency components in the time series are studied by the global wavelet spectrum and the modulation in separated periodicity bands were done in order to extract additional information, e. g., the 8 and 16 months band was examined by an average of all scales, giving a measure of the average annual variance versus time, where the periods with low or high variance could be identified. In Taperoá II and Bodocongó <b>raingages,</b> important reductions were observed in the average variance for the following periods: 1998 to 2000 and 1993 to 1997, which can be considered as dry periods. Although, the precipitation in Taperoá II and Bodocongó <b>raingages</b> showed a similar global wavelet spectrum, their wavelet spectrum revealed particular features.

This pPrecipitation data requires a preliminary spatial interpolation prior to hydrological modeling. The accuracy of modelling result is determined bydepends on the accuracy of the interpolated spatial rainfall which differs according to different interpolation methods. The accuracy of the interpolated spatial rainfall is usually determined by cross-validation method. The objective of this study is to assess the different interpolation methods of daily rainfall at the watershed scale through hydrological modelling and to explore the best methods that provides a good long term simulation. Four versions of geostatistics: Ordinary Kriging (ORK), Universal Kriging (UNK), Kriging with External Dridft (KED) and Ordinary Cokriging (OCK) and two types of deterministic methods: Thiessen polygon (THI) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) are used to produce 30 -year daily rainfall inputs for a distributed physically-based hydrological model (EPIC-GRID). This work is conducted in the Ourthe and Ambleve nested catchments, located in the Ardennes hilly landscape in the Walloon region, Belgium. The total catchment area is 2908 km², lies between 67 and 693 m in elevation. The multivariate geostatistics (KED and OCK) are also used by incorporating elevation as external data to improve the rainfall prediction. This work also aims at analysing the effect of different <b>raingage</b> densities and position used for interpolation, on the stream flow modelled to get insight in terms of the capability and limitation of the geostatistical methods. The number of <b>raingage</b> varies from 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 8 to 4 stations located in and surrounding the catchment area. In the latter case, we try to use different positions: around the catchment and only a part of the catchment. The result shows that the simple method like THI fails to capture the rainfall and to produce good flow simulation when using 4 raingages. The KED and UNK are comparable to other methods for a <b>raingage</b> case that in which stations are located around the catchment area, especially in the high elevation catchment but the worst methods for other <b>raingage</b> position cases where the rainfall stations are located only at a part and mostly outside of the catchment area. However, three methods (IDW, ORK and OCK) can overcome this problem since they are more robust and can provide good performance of simulation in all <b>raingage</b> densities.

This issue is still controversial, but {{important for the}} choice of the best suited rainfall simulation approach to generate realistic synthetic series. It is firstly shown, through a simple theoretical example (the logistic model), that the efficiency of the nonlinear analysis tools dedicated to the identification of chaotic behavior, especially the correlation dimension method (CDM), is drastically reduced if the data are contaminated by noise. The results of a CDM based analysis of a eight year {{point rainfall}} record with a time resolution of fiveminutes are then presented. More precisely, the series of rainfall disaggregation weights between the 10 -minute and 5 -minute time steps is studied. The discrete nature of tipping bucket data appears as a limiting factor at this time resolution for the analysis. To overcome this problem, optical <b>raingage</b> data are also studied. The results obtained in both - tipping bucket and optical <b>raingage</b> - cases show actually no clear evidence of a low-dimensional chaotic behavior. Furthermore, the results obtained suggest that the CDM is an effective tool for exploring data also in other contexts in addition to chaos analysis.

These results are interpreted in terms of the FACE conceptual model...|$|R
