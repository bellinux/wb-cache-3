50|$|The {{church was}} built in 1845 by the Sheffield {{architect}} Joseph Mitchell. It was consecrated on 19 June 1845 Further additions were made in 1880 and 1885 to 1886. The changes in 1885 included the <b>re-enlargement</b> of the chancel, extending it by 27ft in length. The floor of the chancel was laid with encaustic tiles by Maw and Son of Bentall, Staffordshire.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of Romania's <b>re-enlargement</b> {{at the end of}} World War II, with the {{restitution}} of Northern Transylvania after the nullification of The Second Vienna Award, non-Orthodox ethnic minorities became more numerous. Rivalries developed in the different religious groups and the government used this to its own advantage by letting the Romanian Orthodox church to strengthen its position in society in exchange for giving greater communist control over the church.|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} <b>re-enlargement</b> of a {{squamous cell}} carcinoma without recurrence. The tumour regressed markedly after concomitant chemoradiotherapy, but within 1 month, we supposed that the tumour had enlarged again and resection was performed. The resected tissue showed evidence of haemorrhage and several lymphocytes and macrophages, but no malig-nant cells were detected. We herein report a rare case of lung cancer showing a pathological complete response despite <b>re-enlargement</b> of tumour lesion. Key words: lung cancer – pseudoprogression – complete response – haemorrhage – necrosi...|$|E
30|$|She was {{discharged}} from the hospital on the 12 th postoperative day. However, on the 66 th day after the cardiac surgery, she died from heart failure because of <b>re-enlargement</b> of the residual tumor in the right ventricle.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{encountered}} {{a patient with}} a huge osteoma extending {{over half of the}} mandible, which was incidentally discovered on a head-and-neck computed tomography (CT) by an otolaryngological examination for vertigo. A tumorous lesion of the right mandible was noted, and the patient was referred to our department. The tumor extended from the median mandible over the right anterior margin of the ramus of the mandible. To improve the abnormal intraoral morphology, tumor resection and orthopedic surgery were performed. The histopathological diagnosis was a cancellous osteoma. Dentures were attached after surgery, and the postoperative course has been favorable with no tumor <b>re-enlargement...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{develop and}} test {{a new concept}} of the {{degradation}} kinetics of newly developed coron-ary stents consisting of magnesium alloys. Methods: Design of a coronary stent prototype consisting of the non-commercial magnesium based alloy AE 21 (containing 2 % aluminium and 1 % rare earths) with an expected 50 % loss of mass within six months. Eleven domestic pigs underwent coronary implantation of 20 stents (overstretch injury). Results: No stent caused major problems during implantation or showed signs of initial breakage in the histological evaluation. There were no thromboembolic events. Quantitative angiography at follow up showed a significant (p < 0. 01) 40 % loss of perfused lumen diameter between days 10 and 35, corresponding to neointima formation seen on histological analysis, and a 25 % <b>re-enlargement</b> (p < 0. 05) between days 35 and 56 caused by vascular remodelling (based on intravascular ultrasound) resulting {{from the loss of}} mechanical integrity of the stent. Inflammation (p < 0. 001) and neointimal plaque area (p < 0. 05) depended significantly on injury score. Planimetric degradation correlated with time (r = 0. 67, p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Vascular implants consisting of magnesium alloy degradable by biocorrosion seem to be a realistic alternative to permanent implants...|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} Nohalo level 1 (“Nohalo”), {{the simplest}} {{member of a}} family of image resamplers which straighten diagonal interfaces without adding noticeable nonlinear artifacts. Nohalo is interpolatory, co-monotone, coconvex, antialiasing, local average preserving, continuous, and exact on linears. Like many edge-enhancing methods, Nohalo has two main stages: first, nonlinear interpolation is used to create a double-density version of the original image; this doubledensity image is then resampled with bilinear interpolation. Nohalo is especially suited for GPU computing because the nonlinear slopes can be computed once and stored in a low bit-depth texture without rounding error, because the final bilinear stage can be performed in hardware, and because monotonicity allows full use of the texture’s dynamic range. Demand-driven implementations for CPUs and SMPs are more complex, and require extra work to fix bottlenecks. Efficient implementations of the minmod function are key to performance. Three implementations of Nohalo are presented and benchmarked: a CPU version in C for the graphics library GEGL, an SMP version in C++ for the graphics library VIPS and a GPU version in HLSL for DirectX. The GPU implementation is branch-free thanks to the discovery of a simple formula for the pixel values of the double density image. Branches are eliminated in the demand-driven C/C++ implementations by reflecting, if needed, Nohalo’s 12 -point stencil with pointer shifts. Overall, Nohalo is not much slower than standard bicubic resamplers. Compared to twenty-three alternatives in tests involving the <b>re-enlargement</b> of images downsampled with nearest neighbour, Nohalo gets the best PSNRs...|$|E
