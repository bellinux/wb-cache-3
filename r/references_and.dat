40|$|A {{challenge}} {{to the value of}} <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citations is sometimes heard in design research circles. This challenge questions the value of good <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citations to research and practice in design. This article will address the misunderstandings that give rise to these challenges. This article outlines the foundations of <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citation. It clarifies central issues in <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citation. It discusses literature review as an exercise linked to good <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> it offers resources and tools for design research. Most important, it discusses the role of evidence in analyzing and solving problems in design research. While some design problems involve taste and interpretation, most design arguments rest on statements of fact. Statements of fact have truth-value established by evidence. References make evidence accessible distinct from the person and claims of the writer. By providing evidence for reasoned argument, good <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citation serves both the field of design practice and the discipline of design research. Good referencing is central to the growing literature of design research for four main reasons: reasoned argument, access to common evidence, building the field, and improving the intellectual and practical quality of the discipline...|$|R

5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, <b>references,</b> <b>and</b> completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase the grant of arms. For corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E

5|$|If {{traditional}} {{practices were}} adhered to, feasting would have continued for two days, while guests {{would have given}} gifts, mainly of money, to the newlyweds. The wedding ceremony would have culminated with the guests entering the bridal chamber, where they would have made various sexual <b>references</b> <b>and</b> innuendos, led by a figure with his face painted black. In Chinese rural tradition, the bride was expected to show the bloodstains on the bed sheets from her wedding night to prove that her hymen had been broken during sexual intercourse, {{and that she had}} therefore been a virgin.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Jabala Upanishad was composed, {{as is true}} with most ancient Indian texts. Textual <b>references</b> <b>and</b> {{literary}} style suggest that this Hindu text is ancient, composed before the Asrama Upanishad which is dated to 300 CE. Hajime Nakamura, a Japanese scholar of Vedic literature, dates Jabala Upanishad along with Paramahamsa Upanishad to around {{the start of the}} common era. The German scholar of Upanishads, Joachim Sprockhoff, assigns it to be from the last few centuries prior {{to the beginning of the}} common era, while the German Indologist Georg Feuerstein dates it to around 300 BCE. The text is one of the oldest renunciation-related Upanishads.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and <b>references</b> <b>and</b> parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands. Development was shared between DMA Design, based in Edinburgh and Rockstar, in New York City. Much of the development work constituted transforming popular series elements into a fully-3D world. The game was delayed following the September 11 attacks, to allow the team to change <b>references</b> <b>and</b> gameplay deemed inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{addresses}} hominization from {{an ironic}} point of view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society with history, technology and cultural expression is compressed into only seven days. The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With {{the evolution of}} mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an Australopitecus afarensis found. The characters mention that Homo erectus would be the hominid species to tame fire. Orrorin and Toumaï represent two of the oldest-known hominin ancestors, while Aegyptopithecus zeuxis {{is one of the}} earliest primates. Through scientific <b>references</b> <b>and</b> a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her review that the book cannot be taken in by any religion or fundamentalism.|$|E

Over 2,000 single- and four-colour illustrations depict Bangladeshi art and architecture, everyday life, cities and villages and personages. It has about 2,100 cross-references, cartographic information, tables and statistics. It is laid out in alphabetical order and is prefaced by an essay by the Chief Editor.

5|$|To {{create the}} sounds he sought, Adams {{augmented}} the orchestra {{with a large}} saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz <b>references,</b> <b>and</b> big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.|$|E
