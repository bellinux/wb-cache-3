5000|$|Glyceria maxima - reed mannagrass, English watergrass, <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> - Eurasia from Ireland to Xinjiang ...|$|E
50|$|Larva pinkish ochreous with a pale lateral line; the tubercles black; head yellow brown; {{thoracic}} and anal plates black brown.The larva feeds and overwinters on {{reed canary-grass}} (Phalaris arundinacea), Glyceria spectabilis and <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> (Glyceria maxima).|$|E
50|$|Sections {{of dense}} growth of <b>Reed</b> <b>Sweet-grass</b> and Creeping Bent are removed {{in the autumn}} to create areas of bare soil {{necessary}} for germination of Adder's tongue Spearwort. Pollarding of the adjacent willows controls light and the water levels.|$|E
50|$|On {{the shores}} are plants like alders, hybrid crack willows, osiers, elms, ashes, grey willow, birch, aspens, great yellow-cress, gypsywort, skullcap, whorled mint (a hybrid species between corn mint and water mint), trifid bur-marigold, slender tufted-sedge, <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass,</b> annual meadow-grass, {{silverweed}} and purple-loosestrife.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{unimproved}} wet grassland and fen, {{which contains}} uncommon and declining swamp plant species. The wettest part {{is dominated by}} <b>Reed</b> <b>Sweet-grass,</b> and the ditches by branched reed-bur. The site is also of interest for over-wintering birds and aquatic insects, especially dragonflies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} diverse {{habitats}} of grassland, woods, hedges, scrub, ponds and marsh. The grassland is grazed by rabbits, and invertebrates include minotaur beetles and bee wolf wasps. The woodland is mainly oak, ash and hawthorn, and the pond banks have reedmace and <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{reported from}} the Malltraeth Marshand and Cors Ddyga consist of reed canary-grass, water-plantain, branched bur-reed, club rush and <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass.</b> Spiked water-milfoil, blunt-leaved pondweed, horned pondweed are also {{reported in the}} marsh land, apart from rare species of flowering rush, water-violet and marsh stitchwort.|$|E
50|$|The reedswamp of {{the lower}} Ley is {{dominated}} by common reed (Phragmites australis), while further upstream the vegetation contains a mixture of other tall fen species including hemlock water-dropwort (Oenanthe crocata), yellow flag (Iris pseudacorus), great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum) and <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> (Glyceria maxima). There are also dense stands of willow (Salix) in the middle areas of these upper regions.|$|E
50|$|The site covers {{more than}} fifteen sinkholes, {{the only ones in}} chalk which are a {{permanent}} feature of the landscape. Next to the holes is a swamp area of willow carr which is biologically important, and in deep water there is <b>Reed</b> <b>Sweet-grass.</b> The site also has areas of woodland and grassland. From the sinkholes the waters become the Colne.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} aquatic plants is {{relatively}} small, with the lake floor dominated by rigid hornwort, and free-floating plants including Lemna minor, yellow water-lily, white waterlily, broad-leaved pondweed, and amphibious bistort. Along the shores are Alisma, slender tufted-sedge, cyperus-like sedge, <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass,</b> yellow iris, purple loosestrife, Phragmites, Rorippa amphibia, and many others. Common trees found {{around the lake}} include black alder and grey sallow.|$|E
50|$|Habitats include tall wash grassland, {{which is}} now rare, marsh and {{waterlogged}} grassland. It has {{a wide variety of}} plant species, including <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> and meadowsweet. There are flowers such as fen bedstraw and early marsh orchid. Breeding birds include snipe and water rails. The site also has the endangered Desmoulin's whorl snail, which is in the Red Date Book, together with diverse dragonflies, damselflies, birds, bats, small mammals and reptiles.|$|E
50|$|Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb. (syn. G. aquatica (L.) Wahlenb.; G. spectabilis Mert. & W.D.J. Koch; Molinia maxima Hartm.; Poa aquatica L.), {{commonly}} known as Great Manna Grass, Reed Mannagrass, and <b>Reed</b> <b>Sweet-grass,</b> is a species of rhizomatous perennial grasses in the mannagrass genus native to Europe and Western Siberia and growing in wet areas such as riverbanks and ponds. It is highly competitive and invasive and is often {{considered to be a}} noxious weed outside its native range.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of oxbow lakes in the Towy valley provides some spectacular shows through the year. In summer at Bishop's Pond in Abergwili (actually a magnificent oxbow lake formed when the river flooded in 1802) there's a spectacular show of yellow water lilies on the pond {{when the water}} level drops and <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> fringes the edges - a species also found nearby in the Teifi valley, further west in Pembrokeshire, on Gower, in Powys (especially along the Montgomery Canal), on Anglesey and in several other sites along the North Wales coast.|$|E
50|$|The {{trees along}} the canal include pedunculate oak, ash, crack willow and field maple. The area is colonised with common reed, <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> and the more open areas support marsh-marigold, yellow water-lily, water dock and gipsywort. Meadowsweet and great willowherb flourish. There is also common valerian, purple-loosestrife, common marsh-bedstraw, yellow iris, ragged robin and marsh woundwort. Woodland flowers such as primrose, bluebell, yellow {{archangel}} and bugle thrive in a small wood near the tunnel entrance and under the towpath hedgerows. This wetland area supports a variety of fungi, liverworts and mosses.|$|E
5000|$|Most European reed beds mainly {{comprise}} Phragmites australis {{but also}} include many other tall monocotyledons adapted to growing in wet conditions [...] - [...] other grasses such as <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> (Glyceria maxima), Canary reed-grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and small-reed (Calamagrostis species), large sedges (species of Carex, Scirpus, Schoenoplectus, Cladium and related genera), yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus), reed-mace ("bulrush" [...] - [...] Typha species), water-plantains (Alisma species), and flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus). Many dicotyledons also occur, {{such as water}} mint (Mentha aquatica), gipsywort (Lycopus europaeus), skull-cap (Scutellaria species), touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), brooklime (Veronica beccabunga) and water forget-me-nots (Myosotis species).|$|E
50|$|The site is {{the largest}} area of {{freshwater}} marsh in Greater London. It is very diverse, with large areas of <b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass,</b> common reed swamp, wet neutral grassland and tall fen. These habitats have {{a wide variety of}} invertebrates and breeding birds. Invertebrates include sixteen nationally scarce fly, beetle dragonfly and cricket species. There are two nationally rare Red Data Book species, the hoverfly Anasimyia interpuncta and the scarce emerald damselfly Lestes dryas. 61 species of bird regularly breed on the site, such as the common redshank and the northern lapwing. Common cuckoos exploit the nests of reed warblers and sedge warblers. Havering Council has raised the water level and reintroduced grazing to protect the wetland.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the emerging weed Glyceria maxima (<b>Reed</b> <b>sweet-grass)</b> in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga Province is possibly a threat to aquatic ecosystems. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if G. maxima exhibits traits that indicate its potential for invasiveness. Additional aims included determining environmental factors that influence G. maxima establishment, preferred habitat and its impacts on plant species diversity in the invaded sites. The study was carried out at a dam at Mt. Shannon, Boston, and the Luhane River, Bulwer, both in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. The littoral zone was divided into five elevational sampling zones in relation to water depth (i. e. from the terrestrial to aquatic habitat). Vegetation sampling was carried out twice in the 2008 / 09 and 2009 / 10 growing seasons. Water depth was found to be the major factor that determines the distribution patterns of G. maxima. Glyceria maxima’s preferred habitat was found to be semi-aquatic and aquatic habitats with a water depth of 130 cm. An unplanned fire event at Mt. Shannon Dam resulted in an increase in G. maxima vegetative recruitment. Glyceria maxima’s mode of spread within the study sites was found to be mainly vegetative reproduction as no seedlings were found. This was supported by a very low seed germination percentage (0. 3 - 2...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNumerical {{studies of}} the {{relationships}} between littoral processes and environmental variables are important because they provide understanding of the impacts of natural and human factors on lake systems. In this study, littoral paludification, its occurrence, types and main environmental determinants were studied in boreal lakes with varying size (41 – 560 km 2) and total phosphorus content (4. 5 – 35. 5 μgL− 1) in Finland. The relative importance of catchment characteristics, water quality and water level regulation on paludification was analysed at the lake level (n= 20), whereas the importance of site morphology, soil quality and aquatic vegetation was analysed at the site level (n= 289). This study utilised two novel statistical methods in numerical analyses: generalised linear mixed models and variation partitioning (VP). Bottom ward overgrowth was the main paludification type in the studied lakes. At the lake level, the magnitude of spring flooding and the altitude of the lake had a negative response to paludification, whereas the existence of water level regulation, cover of clay soil and total phosphorus content correlated positively to paludification. At the site level, the paludification was negatively related to slope angle, and positively to the occurrence of clay soil, Glyceria maxima (<b>reed</b> <b>sweet-grass)</b> and the abundance of eutrophy indicator species. However, a considerable amount of variation in littoral paludification both at lake and site levels was accounted for by the joint effects of predictors and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of predictors...|$|E
