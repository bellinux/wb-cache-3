Wodehouse contains an amusing assessment of Wodehouse's writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not <b>really</b> <b>make</b> him a traitor.

25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to <b>really</b> <b>make</b> music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

I have to be honest and admit I also met some nice people in the church. It's just that I have a huge problem with their discriminatory attitude toward gays."

500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound."

We wanted to <b>really</b> <b>make</b> sure that we weren’t doing things, like, just to put a wacky keyboard sound in. It had to be doing something constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E

[...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say so I can go really far out with this and <b>really</b> <b>make</b> it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ain't It Fun" [...] {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Writing for Alternative Press, Scott Heisel felt {{the song was}} one of the [...] "moments of diversity that <b>really</b> <b>make</b> Paramore shine". Billboards Brad Wete remarked that the song's instrumentation helped it pass an [...] "average rock song" [...] status. Matt Collar of AllMusic billed the song as an [...] "immediate classic". For Stereogum, Chris DeVille opined that the song was [...] "crack". Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone commented that, on [...] "Ain't It Fun", Williams transitions to a new musical genre on Paramore with an [...] "I-will-survive warrior priestess" [...] attitude. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly, Brian Mansfield from the USA Today newspaper and Consequence of Sound's Amanda Koellner selected [...] "Ain't It Fun" [...] as a standout from the album. Koellner commented that [...] "when the band allows each track a little more breathing room, they show some growth {{and have a good time}} doing it." [...] On behalf of The Arts Desk, Lisa-Marie Ferla classified it as Paramores [...] "strongest moment".|$|E
500|$|David Greenwald of Billboard {{magazine}} described [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] as a [...] "profanity-laced and Clash-channeling" [...] track.

Rather, this is an assault against the dubbed-out sound {{that seems to be}} dominating today’s air waves, Green Day’s own and only pretend bloody dubstep demolition." [...] Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times, criticizing the single, said, [...] "It's all played rather straight. 'I'll pick up what's left in the club,' Armstrong sings suspiciously, and the video released Tuesday doesn't do much to present the song as a statement". Alex Young, writing for Consequence of Sound said the opening clips of the band driving motorbikes were irrelevant. Young said, [...] "There’s also a random scene of the band riding dirt bikes through the desert, which doesn't <b>really</b> <b>make</b> sense {{in the context of the}} video but seems like a good way to spend an excess video budget".|$|E

500|$|EMI's Parlophone label {{released}} Rubber Soul on 3 December 1965, with [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] sequenced as the penultimate track. In the United States – where Capitol Records typically {{altered the}} content of the Beatles' albums, reducing the number of songs and using single A- and B-sides to create further album releases – the track instead appeared on the North American album Yesterday and Today in June 1966. The song was widely considered to be Harrison's best composition to date; according to music critic Richie Unterberger, [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] and [...] "Think for Yourself", which also appeared on the UK version of Rubber Soul, were the first Harrison-written songs [...] "to <b>really</b> <b>make</b> people sit up and notice". In his review for the NME, Allen Evans described it as [...] "a quick-tempo up-beater" [...] and a [...] "more-ish track".

[...] Robert Christgau gave the album a B but criticized [...] "Mountain Jam" [...] length: [...] "I know the pace of living is slow down there, but this verges on the comatose. And all the tape in the world isn't going to bring Duane back." [...] In a {{retrospective}} review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the record a solid five stars, calling the record a showcase of [...] "the Allmans at their peak." [...] David Quantick of BBC Music also considered it their [...] "creative peak," [...] praising the album's [...] "well-played, surprisingly lean bluesy rock." [...] The album is mentioned as the band's top studio recording in the 2008 book 1,000 Recordings To Hear Before You Die (2008), with author Tom Moon praising the record's [...] "sedate, beautifully contemplative studio material." ...|$|E
500|$|In the first, 1930 {{edition of}} his global survey The Film Till Now, British cinema pundit Paul Rotha declared, [...] "A film in which the speech and sound effects are {{perfectly}} synchronised and coincide with their visual image on the screen is absolutely contrary to the aims of cinema. It is a degenerate and misguided attempt to destroy the real use of the film and cannot be accepted as coming within the true boundaries of the cinema." [...] Such opinions were not rare among those who cared about cinema as an art form; Alfred Hitchcock, though he directed the first commercially successful talkie produced in Europe, held that [...] "the silent pictures were the purest form of cinema" [...] and scoffed at many early sound films as delivering little beside [...] "photographs of people talking". In Germany, Max Reinhardt, stage producer and movie director, expressed {{the belief that the}} talkies, [...] "bringing to the screen stage plays... tend to make this independent art a subsidiary of the theater and <b>really</b> <b>make</b> it only a substitute for the theater instead of an art in itself... like reproductions of paintings." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was <b>really</b> <b>make</b> that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember something important, to <b>really</b> <b>make</b> it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E
500|$|Natalie Finn from E! Online was {{disappointed}} with the track, feeling that although the releases from Born This Way were not that [...] "catchy", {{all of them were}} about the same subject of [...] "the importance of being ourselves. Oh well, maybe we're just waiting for the next 'Bad Romance' to sweep us off our feet. Or the next 'Speechless' to make us cry. Or even the next 'Just Dance' to <b>really</b> <b>make</b> us want to dance." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism, with Gaga's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a [...] "derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga's had in the last 12 months: schmaltzy piano-woman melodies, overwrought choruses, inexplicable sax solos." [...] Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, called [...] "Hair" [...] a [...] "great tune" [...] and an [...] "Europop high-energy epic", while giving it four out of five points. Ian Hope from [...] BBC Online described [...] "Hair" [...] as an [...] "empowering freeway rocker about self expression." [...] The Independent writer Andy Gill compared the song to those by guitarist David Crosby, and described it as a statement of rebellious individuality. According to Los Angeles Times Randall Roberts, Gaga [...] "celebrates her follicles" [...] in the song.|$|E
