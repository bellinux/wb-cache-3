5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core <b>radius</b> (r'c), the half-light <b>radius</b> (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) <b>radius</b> (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core <b>radius</b> is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light <b>radius,</b> or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core <b>radius.</b>|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light <b>radius</b> {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of the cluster that happen to lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass <b>radius</b> (r'm)—the <b>radius</b> from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. When the half-mass <b>radius</b> of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An example of this is Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass <b>radius</b> of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E

The admission of the hypothesis of a finite <b>radius</b> of the electron is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero <b>radius)</b> generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E

Large outside <b>radii</b> are preferable to small <b>radii.</b> Large inside <b>radii</b> are also preferable to small inside <b>radii.</b> This allows for a more even flow of material and a more even wall thickness. However, an outside corner is generally stronger than an inside corner.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the three types of}} regular polytopes which exist in all {{dimensions}} [...] regular simplices, cubes and regular cross-polytopes [...] and their outer and inner <b>radii.</b> While the inner <b>radii</b> of regular simplices are well studied, only a few cases are solved for the outer <b>radii.</b> We give a lower bound on these <b>radii,</b> and show that this bound is tight in almost 3 out of 4 dimensions. In a further section we complete the results about inner and outer <b>radii</b> of general boxes and cross-polytopes. Finally, because cubes and regular cross-polytopes are radii-minimal projections of simplices, we show {{that it is possible to}} deduce the results about their <b>radii</b> from the results about the outer <b>radii</b> of simplices.

40|$|Abstract: The {{theoretical}} {{method of}} determination of absolute atomic size, discussed in Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2002, 3, 87 - 113, is exploited to calculate absolute <b>radii</b> of the ions whose experimental <b>radii</b> are published by Shanon. The computed <b>radii</b> are found to reproduce the expected periodic variation of size in periods and in groups and nicely reproduce the d-block and f-block contractions in the respective series. It is pointed out that experimental <b>radii</b> of d and f block transition metal ions make erroneous and misleading representation of the size behaviour of the respective series. A detailed comparative study of the crystal <b>radii</b> vis-ÃƒÂ -vis the theoretical <b>radii</b> is reported. A rationale of the double hump curve of the experimental <b>radii</b> of 3 d-block transition metal ions is put forward {{in terms of the}} crystal field theory and Jahn-Teller distortion. The theoretical <b>radii</b> are exploited to calculate the diamagnetic susceptibility, polarizability and chemical hardness of the ions and compared with available experimental data. The fact of good agreement between the experimental and computed global hardness of ions and correct demonstration of d-block and f-block contraction by the computed <b>radii</b> are used as benchmark to test the validity of the values of the computed theoretical <b>radii</b> of the ions as their representative sizes. It is concluded that the theoretically computed <b>radii</b> of ions are visualizable size representation of ions and can be used as their absolute <b>radii</b> at the respective oxidation states...|$|R

The functional <b>radii</b> of the dentin discs ranged from 5 to 40 % of the ana-tomic <b>radii.</b> This difference {{was due to the}} fact that SEM visualizes only the surface while the functional techniques measure the <b>radii</b> within dentin tubules.

5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his {{coworkers}} produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial <b>radius</b> of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar <b>radius</b> 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar <b>radius</b> from pole to equator.

The tilt adjustment was carried out using the <b>radii</b> averages. The surface angle averages for the N and S <b>radii</b> were adjusted (by rotating the disc mathematically) to make the N and S <b>radii</b> equal and opposite in sign with the corresponding adjustment of measured dive angles in the E and W <b>radii.</b> Similarly E and W <b>radii</b> were used to adjust the N and S dive angles.|$|R

5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the <b>radius</b> {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the <b>radius</b> is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the <b>radius</b> becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how <b>radius</b> varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. <b>Radius</b> is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E
50|$|Coronagraphs {{allowed for}} {{measuring}} {{the properties of the}} comet as it reached very close to the sun. It was noted that sungrazing comets tend to peak in brightness at a distance of about 12.3 solar <b>radii</b> or 11.2 solar <b>radii.</b> It is thought that this variation stems from a difference in dust composition. Another small peak in brightness has been found at about 7 solar <b>radii</b> from the sun and it is possibly due to a fragmentation of the comet nucleus. An alternative explanation is that the brightness peak at 12 solar <b>radii</b> comes from the sublimation of amorphous olivines and the peak at 11.2 solar <b>radii</b> is from the sublimation of crystalline olivines. The peak at 7 solar <b>radii</b> could then be the sublimation of pyroxene.|$|R

The proton <b>radii</b> in Be and B isotopes changes rapidly as N increases, reflecting the cluster structure change along the isotope chains, whereas those in C isotopes show a weak N dependence because of the stable proton structure in nuclei with Z= 6. In neutron-rich Be and B isotopes, the proton <b>radii</b> are remarkably increased by the enhancement of the two-center cluster structure in the prolately deformed neutron structure. I compare the N dependence of the calculated proton <b>radii</b> with the experimental ones reduced from the charge <b>radii</b> determined by isotope shift and those deduced from the charge changing interaction cross section.
