This provides <b>redundancy</b> in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ.

30|$|In {{many of the}} {{previous}} MVC schemes [4 – 7], intra, inter, and interview prediction compensation technologies are adopted to reduce spatial, temporal, and interview <b>redundancies.</b> Additionally, YUV color space transform, integer transform, and quantization technologies are also utilized to explore visual <b>redundancies</b> including chroma <b>redundancies</b> and high frequency <b>redundancies.</b> According to the studies on visual psychology, the Human Visual System (HVS) in fact does not treat visual information equally from regions to regions of the video content [8]. It is mentioned that HVS is {{more sensitive to the}} distortion in the Region-Of-Interests (ROIs) or attention areas than those in background regions [9]. Those are visual <b>redundancies</b> coming from regional interests existing in 3 DV. However, previous MVC schemes have not taken the regional selective property and 3 D depth perception of HVS into consideration. Applying the concept of ROI to video coding is regarded as a promising way to improve coding efficiency by exploiting regional visual <b>redundancies.</b> However, there are two major problems to be tackled, they are ROI detection and the ROI-based bits allocation.|$|R

A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons).

This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the <b>redundancy</b> of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.

40|$|Abstract. As the {{popularity}} of XML as a format for data representation grows the need for storing XML data in an effective way grows as well. Recent research has provide us with effective solutions based on storing XML data into relational databases and with new technologies based on storing XML data in the native form. However, design of XML databases has not been studied sufficiently yet. In this paper, we suppose a set of XML schemes that describe XML representation of our data in several types of XML documents. We show {{that we can not}} usually store the data directly in this representation because it can contain <b>redundancies.</b> To design an optimal database schema we therefore need to locate these <b>redundancies</b> and eliminate them. We describe two types of <b>redundancies</b> in XML data in this paper and show how to utilize a conceptual schema of the XML schemes to locate such <b>redundancies.</b> We also show how to normalize the XML schemes to eliminate these <b>redundancies...</b>|$|R

40|$|As XML becomes widely used, {{dealing with}} <b>redundancies</b> in XML data {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} important issue. Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data <b>redundancies</b> can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent. One way to avoid data <b>redundancies</b> is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent {{studies have focused on}} defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data <b>redundancies.</b> We observe further that XML databases are often “casually designed ” and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data <b>redundancies</b> (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and {{is an integral part of}} the schema refinement process. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for efficient discovery of XML data <b>redundancies.</b> It employs a novel XML data structure and introduces a new class of partition based algorithms. DiscoverXFD can not only be used for the previous definitions of XML functional dependencies, but also for a more comprehensive notion we develop in this paper, capable of detecting <b>redundancies</b> involving set elements while maintaining clear semantics. Experimental evaluations using real life and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system is practical and scales well with increasing data size. 1...|$|R
