5000|$|... "Endoscopic ear surgery" [...] or [...] "EES" [...] {{is defined}} as the use of the <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscope,</b> in {{contrast}} to the operating room microscope, to visualize the middle and inner ear during otologic surgery.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{the early}} years of FESS - {{functional}} endoscopic sinus surgery, EES has been controversial since early descriptions in the 1960s. One of the benefits of an endoscope compared to the microscope is the wide-field view of the middle ear afforded by the location of the light source {{at the tip of the}} instrument and the availability of various types of angled lenses. Middle ear procedures that utilize a <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscope</b> for viewing may reduce the need to drill for enhanced exposure of the operative field. The traditional otologic operating microscopes typically require larger portals (e.g., postauricular approaches) to enable adequate passage of light for intraoperative viewing and follow-up surveillance in the clinic. One handed dissection is cited as the main drawback to EES.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rigid</b> <b>endoscopes,</b> {{such as an}} Arthroscope, can be sterilized in {{the same}} way as {{surgical}} instruments, whereas heat labile flexible endoscopes cannot.|$|R

50|$|The {{indications}} {{for this}} relatively new technique are evolving. The use of <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscopes</b> to perform ear surgery (operative EES), {{rather than just}} to visualize {{the contents of the}} middle ear (observational EES), is increasing as optimized instrumentation and operative approaches become available.|$|R
50|$|Vocal fold imaging {{techniques}} {{are used by}} clinicians to examine the vocal folds and allows them to detect vocal pathology and assess {{the quality of the}} vocal fold vibrations. Laryngeal stroboscopy is the primary clinical tool used for this purpose. Laryngeal stroboscopy uses a synchronized flashing light passed through either a rigid or flexible laryngoscope to provide an image of the vocal fold motion; the image is created by averaging over several vibratory cycles and is thus not provided in real-time. As this technique relies on periodic vocal fold vibration, it cannot be used in patients with moderate to severe dysphonia. High speed digital imaging of the vocal folds (videokymography), another imaging technique, is not subject to the same limitations as laryngeal stroboscopy. A <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscope</b> is used to take images at a rate of 8000 frames per second, and the image is displayed in real time. As well, this technique allows imaging of aperiodic vibrations and can thus be used with patients presenting with all severities of dysphonia.|$|E
50|$|Colon polyps are not {{commonly}} associated with symptoms. Occasionally rectal bleeding, and on rare occasions pain, diarrhea or constipation may occur because of colon polyps. Colon polyps are a concern {{because of the potential}} for colon cancer being present microscopically and the risk of benign colon polyps transforming over time into malignant ones. Since most polyps are asymptomatic, they are usually discovered at the time of colon cancer screening. Common screening methods are occult blood test, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy (usually flexible sigmoidoscopy, using a flexible endoscope, but more rarely the older rigid sigmoidoscopy, using a <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscope),</b> lower gastrointestinal series (barium enema), digital rectal examination (DRE), and virtual colonoscopy. The polyps are routinely removed at the time of colonoscopy either with a polypectomy snare (first description by P. Deyhle, Germany, 1970) or with biopsy forceps. If an adenomatous polyp is found with sigmoidoscopy or if a polyp is found with any other diagnostic modality, the patient must undergo colonoscopy for removal of the polyp(s). Even though colon cancer is usually not found in polyps smaller than 2.5 cm, all polyps found are removed since the removal of polyps reduces the future likelihood of developing colon cancer. When adenomatous polyps are removed, a repeat colonoscopy is usually performed in three to five years.|$|E

Five acoustic measurements including fundamental frequency (F 0) values, percent jitter values, relative average perturbation of F 0 shimmer, and noise-to-harmonic ratios were used to represent participants' voice quality. Results indicated that F 0 values were significantly influenced by the angle of sitting position, while percent jitter values, relative average perturbation of F 0, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonic ratios were affected by the presence of a <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscope</b> and tongue anchoring.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{mentioned in}} the second type is mainly used to improve the image quality of flexible endoscopes, replacing traditional fiberscopes. Nevertheless, laparoscopes are <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscopes.</b> The rigidity is required in clinical practice. The rod-lens based laparoscopes dominant overwhelmingly in practice, due to their fine optical resolution (50 µm typically, dependant on the aperture size used in the objective lens), and the image quality can be better {{than that of the}} digital camera if necessary. The second type of laparoscope is very rare in the laparoscope market and in hospitals.|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen peroxide, in both {{liquid and}} as vaporized {{hydrogen}} peroxide (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is strong oxidant, which {{allows it to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat or temperature sensitive articles such as <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscopes.</b> In medical sterilization hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Background : The {{flexible}} fibreoptic bronchoscope and bonfils <b>rigid</b> intubation <b>endoscope</b> {{are being}} widely used for difficult intubations. Methods: The haemodynamic response to intubation under general anaesthesia was studied in 60 adult female {{patients who were}} intubated using either flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope or bonfils <b>rigid</b> intubation <b>endoscope</b> (30 in each group). Non-invasive blood pressure and heart rate (HR) was recorded before induction of anaesthesia, immediately after induction, {{at the time of}} intubation and, thereafter, every minute for the next 5 min. The product of HR and systolic blood pressure (rate pressure product) at every point of time was also calculated. Statistical Analyses: Graph pad prism, 5. 0 statistical software, independent t test and repeated measure ANOVA test were used. Results: Both bonfils <b>rigid</b> intubation <b>endoscope</b> and flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope required a similar time (less than 1 min) for orotracheal intubation. After intubation, there was a significant increase in HR, blood pressure and rate pressure product (P< 0. 001) in both the groups compared with the baseline and post-induction values. There {{was no significant difference in}} HR, blood pressure and rate pressure product at any of the measuring points or in their maximum values during observation between the two groups. The time required for recovery of systolic blood pressure and HR to post-induction value (± 10 %) was not significantly different between the two groups (more than 2 min). Conclusion: In female adults under general anaesthesia, bonfils <b>rigid</b> intubation <b>endoscope</b> and flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope require a similar time for successful orotracheal intubation and cause a similar magnitude of haemodynamic response...|$|R

40|$|Combined {{use of an}} {{operating}} microscope and a middle ear endoscope seems to be helpful for selecting an appropriate surgical technique and for identifying more patients in whom cholesteatoma can be removed by a trans-canal approach alone. To investigate whether attic cholesteatoma can be treated by a trans-canal approach alone, a review was performed of patients who had undergone endoscopically assisted tympanoplasty and the outcome of surgery was compared with the preoperative CT findings. Using a <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscope</b> (3 mm in diameter and 6 cm in length with a viewing angle of 30 °), twenty eight patients were examined to determine whether total resection of the cholesteatoma was possible by trans-canal atticotomy alone.

40|$|Surgeons may {{occasionally}} encounter {{difficulty in}} visualizing the whole larynx with a direct laryngoscope. In such cases, rigid endoscopic laryngosurgery using a direct laryngoscope is an optimal solution. Multidirectional {{examination of the}} larynx using <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscopes</b> during direct laryngoscopy, leads to better control {{and management of the}} ventricle, inferior surface of the vocal fold and subglottis, and the anterior commissure. Currently, 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 70 degrees and 120 degrees angled rigid telescopes are used worldwide. Our experience in telescopic endolaryngeal surgery provided us the opportunity to work with AESOP 3000 (automated endoscope system for optimal positioning), coupling a robotic arm to a rigid endolaryngeal telescope. The use of this device allows the surgeon to control the field of view and operate with both hands. A total of 20 patients presenting a laryngeal lesion were randomly selected and included in this study undergoing a robot-assisted procedure. Three of 20 patients presented a difficult laryngeal exposure with direct laryngoscopy due to a rigid, short neck (1 male, 1 female) and prominent teeth (1 male). We used Karl Storz Hopkins II long <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscopes</b> having 0 degrees, 30 degrees and 70 degrees direction of view, a Storz Xenon 300 cold light, a Storz Tricam SL camera, the Kleinsasser direct laryngoscope. The instruments we used are all commercially available for microlaryngeal surgery and included upward curved instruments in case of difficult laryngeal exposure. The operative equipment was the same for all procedures. We evaluated the acquisition of skills in controlling the AESOP 3000, the feasibility of a single surgeon performing procedures with this machine, and any advantages that it might offer to endolaryngeal surgery. The use of robotic devices improves the precision of surgical procedures, offering surgeons a more comfortable working position, particularly for longer procedures, and without an assistant to hold the camera...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design and produce a working {{prototype}} of a device {{that could be used}} in upper airway Otolaryngology surgeries to increase nasopharynx visualization. The nasopharynx is the anatomical region of the airway that is behind the nose and above the palate, and therefore very difficult for surgeons to access and properly visualize. Traditional methods include the blind removal of diseased tissue or the use of a small, hand-supported, dental-style mirror for visualization during tissue removal with a cutting tool. The blind method is severely limiting for the surgeon. The use of the mirror has advantages over the blind method, but has a restricted field of view and limits the surgeon's ability to visualize the procedure as well. The proposed endoscopic enabled mouth gag (EEMG) device attaches to the traditional mouth gag and allows for the fixation of a <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscope</b> that can be positioned as needed and locked into place. The improved field of view of the endoscope over the mirror allows for superior visualization for the surgeon.

50|$|There were {{physical}} {{limits to}} the image quality of a fibroscope. A bundle of say 50,000 fibers gives effectively only a 50,000-pixel image, and continued flexing from use breaks fibers and so progressively loses pixels. Eventually so many are lost that the whole bundle must be replaced (at considerable expense). Harold Hopkins realised that any further optical improvement would require a different approach. Previous <b>rigid</b> <b>endoscopes</b> suffered from low light transmittance and poor image quality. The surgical requirement of passing surgical tools {{as well as the}} illumination system within the endoscope's tube - which itself is limited in dimensions by the human body - left very little room for the imaging optics. The tiny lenses of a conventional system required supporting rings that would obscure the bulk of the lens area; they were difficult to manufacture and assemble and optically nearly useless.|$|R
