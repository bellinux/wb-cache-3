5|$|In September 1939, Fegelein {{commanded}} the SS Totenkopf Reiterstandarte (Death's-Head Horse Regiment), which arrived in Poland {{shortly after the}} end of the Polish Campaign. The unit was placed under the command of the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; order police) and was split into small groups assigned to support police activities at posts throughout the Poznan district. On 15 November, Himmler ordered the expansion of the regiment from four to thirteen squadrons and renamed it as 1. SS-Totenkopf-Reiterstandarte (1st Death's Head Cavalry Regiment). Additional men were recruited from ethnic Germans living in the General Government and further afield. Many of the officers, including Fegelein, had never attended officer training school, so much of the training provided to new recruits was rudimentary. However, it was <b>rigorous,</b> <b>and</b> the men developed a strong camaraderie. Fegelein's unit was involved alongside the Orpo in the extermination, ordered by Hitler, of members of the Polish elite such as intellectuals, aristocrats, and clergy, in an action called Intelligenzaktion. On 7 December 1939 Fegelein's unit was involved in the mass shooting of 1,700 such people in the Kampinos Forest.|$|E

25|$|Constantine's son, Leo IV (775–80) {{was less}} <b>rigorous,</b> <b>and</b> {{for a time}} tried to mediate between the factions. When he died, his wife Irene took power as regent for her son, Constantine VI (780–97). Though icon veneration {{does not seem to}} have been a major {{priority}} for the regency government, Irene called an ecumenical council a year after Leo's death, which restored image veneration. This may have been an effort to secure closer and more cordial relations between Constantinople and Rome.|$|E

25|$|Modernism and {{liberalism}} do {{not constitute}} <b>rigorous</b> <b>and</b> well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought {{into the spirit of}} the Age of Enlightenment. New understandings of history and the natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|To the ancients, the {{parallel}} postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They {{were concerned with}} creating a system which was absolutely <b>rigorous</b> <b>and</b> to them {{it seemed as if}} {{the parallel}} line postulate should have been able to be proven rather than simply accepted as a fact. It is now known that such a proof is impossible. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the Elements: the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.|$|E
