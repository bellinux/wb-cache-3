50|$|The {{blinking}} in nanocrystals {{was first}} reported in 1996. The discovery was unexpected. The {{consensus is that}} blinking happens because illuminated nanocrystals can be charged (or ionized), and then neutralized. Under normal conditions when nanocrystal is neutral, a photon excites an electron-hole pair, which then recombines, emitting another photon and leading to photoluminescence. This process is called <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination.</b> If however, the nanocrystal is charged, the extra carrier triggers a process called non-radiative Auger recombination, where exciton energy is transferred to an extra electron or hole. Auger recombination occurs orders of magnitude faster than the <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination.</b> So photoluminescence is almost entirely suppressed in charged nanocrystals. Scientists still do not fully understand {{the origin of the}} charging and neutralization process. One of the photoexcited carriers (the electron or the hole) must be ejected from the nanocrystal. At some later time, the ejected charge returns to the nanocrystal (restoring charge neutrality and therefore <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination).</b> The details of how these processes occur still are not understood.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> is slow in {{indirect}} band gap materials also means that, under most circumstances, radiative recombinations {{will be a}} small proportion of total recombinations, with most recombinations being non-radiative, taking place at point defects or at grain boundaries. However, if the excited electrons are prevented from reaching these recombination places, they {{have no choice but to}} eventually fall back into the valence band by <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination.</b> This can be done by creating a dislocation loop in the material. At the edge of the loop, the planes above and beneath the [...] "dislocation disk" [...] are pulled apart, creating a negative pressure, which raises the energy of the conduction band substantially, with the result that the electrons cannot pass this edge. Provided that the area directly above the dislocation loop is defect-free (no non-radiative recombination possible), the electrons will fall back into the valence shell by <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination,</b> thus emitting light. This is the principle on which [...] "DELEDs" [...] (Dislocation Engineered LEDs) are based.|$|E

Coalescence induces {{the formation of a}} network of boundary dislocations, above which I(1) -type basal-plane stacking faults are nucleated. The former contributes to the reduction in the crystalline quality at the bottom of coalesced nanowires while the latter leads to intense excitonic radiative transitions at 3. 42 eV in their center.

50|$|Interactions among electrons, holes, phonons, photons, {{and other}} {{particles}} {{are required to}} satisfy conservation of energy and crystal momentum (i.e., conservation of total k-vector). A photon with an energy near a semiconductor band gap has almost zero momentum. One important process is called <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination,</b> where an electron in the conduction band annihilates {{a hole in the}} valence band, releasing the excess energy as a photon. This is possible in a direct band gap semiconductor if the electron has a k-vector near the conduction band minima (the hole will share the same k-vector), but not possible in an indirect band gap semiconductor, as photons cannot carry crystal momentum, and thus conservation of crystal momentum would be violated. For <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> to occur in an indirect band gap material, the process must also involve the absorption or emission of a phonon, where the phonon momentum equals the difference between the electron and hole momentum. (It can also, instead, involve a crystallographic defect, which performs essentially the same role.) The involvement of the phonon makes this process much less likely to occur in a given span of time, which is why <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> is far slower in indirect band gap materials than direct band gap ones. This is why light-emitting and laser diodes are almost always made of direct band gap materials, and not indirect band gap ones like silicon.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} explanation is local disruption of the Earth's magnetic field and/or ionosphere {{in the region of}} tectonic stress, resulting in the observed glow effects either from ionospheric <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> at lower altitudes and greater atmospheric pressure or as aurora. However, the effect is clearly not pronounced or notably observed at all earthquake events and is yet to be directly experimentally verified.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{reverse of}} <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> is light absorption. For {{the same reason}} as above, light with a photon energy close to the band gap can {{penetrate}} much farther before being absorbed in an indirect band gap material than a direct band gap one (at least insofar as the light absorption is due to exciting electrons across the band gap).|$|E

50|$|It is {{should be}} noted that there are no photon flux data in the small photon energy range from 0 eV to 0.3096 eV because the {{standard}} (AM1.5) solar energy spectrum for hÎ½ < 0.31 eV are not available. Regardless of this data unavailability, however, the graphical QE analysis can be done using the only available data with a reasonable assumption that semiconductors are opaque for photon energies greater than their bandgap energy, but transparent for photon energies less than their bandgap energy. This assumption accounts for the first intrinsic loss in the efficiency of solar cells, which is caused by the inability of single-junction solar cells to properly match the broad solar energy spectrum.However, the current graphical QE analysis still cannot reflect the second intrinsic loss in the efficiency of solar cells, <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination.</b> To take the <b>radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> into account, we need to evaluate the radiative current density, Jrad, first.

Equations of the MHD model include Shakura and Sunyaev equations, induction equation and equations of ionization balance. Magnetic field is determined taking into account ohmic diffusion, magnetic ambipolar diffusion and buoyancy. Ionization fraction is calculated considering ionization by cosmic rays and X-rays, thermal ionization, <b>radiative</b> <b>recombinations</b> and recombinations on the dust grains. Analytical solution and numerical investigations show that the magnetic field is coupled to the gas in the case of <b>radiative</b> <b>recombinations.</b> Magnetic field is quasi-azimuthal close to accretion disk inner boundary and quasi-radial in the outer regions. Magnetic field is quasi-poloidal in the dusty "dead" zones with low ionization degree, where ohmic diffusion is efficient. Magnetic ambipolar diffusion reduces vertical magnetic field in 10 times comparing to the frozen-in field in this region. Magnetic field is quasi-azimuthal close to the outer boundary of accretion disks for standard ionization rates and dust grain size a_d= 0. 1 micrometers. In the case of large dust grains (a_d > 0. 1 micrometers) or enhanced ionization rates, the magnetic field is quasi-radial in the outer regions. It is shown that the inner boundary of dusty "dead" zone is placed at r=(0. 1 - 0. 6) AU for accretion disks of stars with M=(0. 5 - 2) M_.

30|$|In conclusion, {{we present}} the {{investigation}} of annealing effect on the optical and structural properties of vertically aligned ZnO NRs on AZO substrates by a single-step aqueous solution method at low temperature. The annealing temperature strongly affects both the NBE and visible emissions. We found the optimum annealing temperature to be 400 Â°C. It yields a sharp and intense NBE emission and effectively suppressed visible emission. The enhancement of NBE {{is due to the}} activation of <b>radiative</b> <b>recombinations</b> associated with hydrogen donors while the reduction of DE is ascribed to the annihilation of OH groups. These results are useful to understand and optimize ZnO NRs grown in a low-temperature solution. Our approach has the advantages of low cost, fine quality, and straightforward one-step synthesis, which is promising to realize facile and controlled ZnO-based nanodevice fabrication.|$|R
40|$|The {{circular}} polarization of direct gap emission of Ge is studied in optically excited tensile-strained Ge-on-Si heterostructures {{as a function}} of doping and temperature.

By photoluminescence (PL) measurements and tight-binding calculations we show that this exceptionally high value is due to the characteristic energy dependence of the optically induced electron spin population.
