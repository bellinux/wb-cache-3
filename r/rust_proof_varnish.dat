50|$|In {{the context}} of {{composite}} metals is an alloy. A blend of a metal {{with one or more}} metallic or nonmetallic materials is an alloy. The components of an alloy do not combine chemically but, rather, are very finely mixed. An alloy might be homogeneous or might contain small particles of components that can be viewed with a microscope. Brass is an example of an alloy, being a homogeneous mixture of copper and zinc. Another example is steel, which is an alloy of iron with carbon and possibly other metals. The purpose of alloying is to produce desired properties in a metal that naturally lacks them. Brass, for example, is harder than copper and has a more gold-like color. Steel is harder than iron and can even be made <b>rust</b> <b>proof</b> (stainless steel).|$|R

50|$|In 1998, the Ffestiniog and the Welsh Highland Railway Heritage Groups {{together}} undertook {{the restoration}} of the Spooner Family Grave in Beddgelert Churchyard. This consists of a large double plot with two carved slate memorial tops surrounded by iron railings, which had been specially made in the Ffestiniog Railway Boston Lodge works. One stone commemorates Charles Easton Spooner and his eldest son John Eryri, the other his wife Mary, with their infant son James and also their daughter Mary who died aged five allegedly of bubonic plague but more probably of typhoid. A separate grave alongside the first is that of the nurse Elizabeth Preece who cared for Mary and who herself died of the same disease two days later. The restoration work, which involved heavy weed clearance, the cleaning of the stones, and the <b>rust</b> <b>proofing</b> and painting the railings, caught the attention of Cadw, resulting in the graves now being listed as grade 2 monuments.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his book}} Crap Cars, writer Richard Porter says [...] "the only {{bit of the}} Allegro they got even vaguely right was the rust-proofing". The Allegro was placed second worst in his list, beaten only by the VW Beetle. Despite this, the Allegro picked up a {{reputation}} for rust problems during its life. This was probably due to association with many other cars of the period (both from BL and other manufacturers) which had poor <b>rust</b> <b>proofing.</b> An early edition of What Car? ran a feature on the then new Allegro, including an interview with staff at a BL dealership, who were asked if any problems occurred with the car in service. They replied that the car suffered from rust problems to its rear subframe. However, the staff thought they were being asked about the 1100/1300 car, which {{had been out of}} production for five years. Nonetheless, the magazine went on to report on the Allegro's non-existent rust problems, creating a serious image problem.|$|R
50|$|Somewhat {{analogous}} to the improved manganese phosphating process improvements discovered by Baker and Dingman, a similarly improved method was found for an improved zinc phosphating process as well. This improvement was discovered by Darsey of the Parker <b>Rust</b> <b>Proof</b> Company, who filed a patent in February 1941, which was granted in August 1942, , that improved upon the zinc phosphatizing (Parkerizing) process further. He discovered that adding copper reduced the alkalinity requirement over what had been required, and that also adding a chlorate to the nitrates that were already used would additionally permit running the process {{at a much lower}} temperature in the range of 115 to 130 F, reducing the cost of running the process further. With these process improvements, the end result was that a low-temperature (energy-efficient) zinc phosphating (Parkerizing) process, using strategic materials to which the United States had ready access, became the most common phosphating process used during World War II to protect American war materials such as firearms and planes from rust and corrosion.|$|R

Mini CNC machine is a small CNC machine that can operate like a normal CNC machine with a limited area of the machining. The objectives of this project are to develop the mini CNC Machine and to develop the software to control the machine. This thesis describes {{the development of the}} machine and the criteria needed to build the machine. The Mini CNC Machine is initially sketched by referring to the criteria that was decided. The criteria are the travel path length, type of linear motion, type of linear drive, motor and controller, and type of material that used.

40|$|The {{construction}} technology now {{has become more}} and more advanced allowing the development of new technologies or material to replace the previous one and also solved some of the troubles confronted by construction experts. The Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composite is an alternative to replace the current usage of steel as it is <b>rust</b> <b>proof</b> and stronger in terms of stiffness compared to steel. Furthermore, GFRP bars have a high strength-to-weight ratio, making them attractive as reinforcement for concrete structures. However, the tensile behavior of GFRP bars is characterized by a linear elastic stress–strain relationship up to failure and, therefore, concrete elements reinforced with GFRP reinforcement exhibit brittle failure without warning. Design codes encourage over-reinforced GFRP design since it is more progressive and leads to a less catastrophic failure with a higher degree of deformability. Moreover, because of GFRP low modulus of elasticity, GFRP reinforced concrete members exhibit larger deflections and wider cracks width than steel reinforced concrete. This aims {{of this paper is to}} developed 2 D Finite Element (FE) models that can accurately simulate the respond on an improvement in the deflection of GFRP reinforced concrete beam externally strengthened with CFRP plates on the tension part of beam. The prediction of flexural response according to RCCSA software was also discussed. It was observed that the predicted FE results are given similar result with the experimental measured test data. Base on this good agreement, a parametric study was the performed using the validation FE model to investigate the effect of flexural reinforcement ratio and arrangement of the beams strengthened with different regions of CFRP plates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRust is a {{new systems}} {{programming}} language that promises to overcome the seemingly fundamental tradeoff between high-level safety guarantees and low-level control over resource management. Unfortunately, none of Rust's safety claims have been formally proven, and {{there is good reason}} to question whether they actually hold. Specifically, Rust employs a strong, ownership-based type system, but then extends the expressive power of this core type system through libraries that internally use unsafe features. In this paper, we give the first formal (and machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a realistic subset of <b>Rust.</b> Our <b>proof</b> is extensible in the sense that, for each new Rust library that uses unsafe features, we can say what verification condition it must satisfy in order for it to be deemed a safe extension to the language. We have carried out this verification for some of the most important libraries that are used throughout the Rust ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|The Application {{of solar}} drying for food {{commodity}} {{has been widely}} used in Indonesia. This Cost efficiently drying technique become a commonly use since {{it is easy to}} build, cheap and could be applied in any area as long as it has enough sun intensity trough out the year. Since this type of drying very dependent to sun, it has a limitation to be used in places where rainy days are longer than sunny days. This research has been conducted to solve the problem by implementing a rack type solar dryer with another heat resource which is a gas stove. A rack type solar dryer has build with a secondary heat source using gas fireplace. The rack build from light material using fickle timber and aluminums made it become portable. The dryer build with a knock down system, so it can be assemble and disassemble to reposition it in area with better solar recipient.

40|$|A {{sustainable}} energy cycle may include enhanced utilization of solar energy and atmospheric CO 2 to produce biomass and enhanced utilization of exhaust CO 2 from power plants for synthetic gas production. The reaction of carbon with CO 2 is potentially {{one of the}} important processes in a future sustainable carbon cycle. Reactions involving carbon and CO 2 are also relevant to the chemical process and metal industries. ^ Biomass char has been recognized as a present and future alternative to fossil-fuels for energy production and fuel synthesis. Therefore, biomass char gasification with CO 2 recycling is proposed as a sustainable and carbon-neutral energy technology. Biomass char is a complex porous solid and its gasification involves heat and mass transfer processes within pores of multiple sizes from nanometer to millimeter scales. These processes are coupled with heterogeneous chemistry at the internal and external surfaces. Rates for the heterogeneous carbon gasification reactions are affected by inorganic content of the char. Furthermore, pore structure of the char develops with conversion and influences apparent gasification rates. Effective modeling of the gasification reactions has relied on the best available understanding of diffusion processes and kinetic rate property constants from state of the art experiments. Improvement of the influences of inorganic composition, and process parameters, such as pressure and temperature on the gasification reaction rates has been a continuous process. Economic viability of gasification relies on use of optimum catalysts. These aspects of the current status of gasification technologies have motivated the work reported in this dissertation. ^ The reactions between biomass chars and CO 2 are investigated {{to determine the effects of}} temperature and pressure on the reaction rates for large char particles of relevance to practical gasification technologies. An experimental apparatus consisting of a high-pressure fixed-bed reactor with product gas sampling for tracking the reaction progress, supported by independent gravimetric measurements of mass loss, is described. The effects of pressure and temperature on the char-CO 2 reaction are investigated at elevated pressures up to 10 atm. Measurements of reaction rates at multiple temperatures and pressures for a low-ash pinewood char are presented. Kinetic rate parameters for the char-CO 2 reaction are reported with detailed uncertainty calculations and discussed in the context of the structural changes of the char with mass loss. The effects of pressure and temperature on the internal mass transfer processes and the intrinsic reaction rates are assessed using Thiele analysis for non-isothermal particles with the nth order and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic rate models. The effects of potassium, calcium and iron catalysts on the CO 2 gasification rates of an activated coconut char are investigated. A catalyst treatment method for obtaining high catalyst loadings (~ 12 wt. %) is described. The effects of the catalysts on the surface reaction rates and the activation energies are reported. The results of this study are encouraging in the context of potential future discovery of a viable low-temperature catalytic gasification process for sustainable use of biomass as a renewable energy resource. Utilization of plant based substances such as citric acid to provide higher catalytic activity and the potential for utilizing the high initial activity of iron by using <b>rust</b> <b>proofing</b> compounds for maintaining high reactivity are recommended for further development. ...|$|R
