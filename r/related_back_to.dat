2500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the sixth}} century, the leaders of these {{communities}} were styling themselves kings, though it should not be assumed that all of them were Germanic in origin. The Bretwalda concept is taken as evidence of a number of early Anglo-Saxon elite families. What Bede seems to imply in his Bretwalda is the ability of leaders to extract tribute, overawe and/or protect the small regions, which may well have been relatively short-lived in any one instance. Ostensibly [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] dynasties variously replaced one another in this role in a discontinuous but influential and potent roll call of warrior elites. Importantly, whatever their origin or whenever they flourished, these dynasties established their claim to lordship through their links to extended kin ties. As Helen Peake jokingly points out, [...] "they all just happened to be <b>related</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Woden".|$|E
2500|$|The Bretwalda {{concept is}} taken as {{evidence}} for a presence {{of a number of}} early Anglo-Saxon elite families and a clear unitary oversight. Whether the majority of these leaders were early settlers, descendant from settlers, or especially after the exploration stage they were Roman-British leaders who adopted Anglo-Saxon culture is unclear. The balance of opinion is that most were migrants, although it shouldn't be assumed they were all Germanic (see Elite personal names evidence). There is agreement: that these were small in number and proportion, yet large enough in power and influence to ensure [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] acculturation in the lowlands of Britain. Most historians believe these elites were those named by Bede, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and others, although there is discussion regarding their floruit dates. Importantly, whatever their origin or when they flourished, they established their claim to lordship through their links to extended kin ties.

2500|$|Austin confessed {{he had a}} major rift with Triple H's role in {{the company}} upon his return in 2002, but insisted as of 2003 they {{resolved}} their issues. In addition, he claimed a brief dispute with The Rock was resolved quickly upon his return, and that none of his disputes with the talent roster continued or played the major part in his departure. In February, Austin returned at No Way Out by defeating Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania in another short match against Bischoff on Raw, but was then defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania XIX, who returned {{about the same time}} as a smug, [...] "sell out" [...] villain, which, ultimately, became Austin's last official match in WWE. It was also revealed in the documentary The Mania of Wrestlemania (based around the WrestleMania XIX event) that the letters [...] "OMR", meaning [...] "One More Round", were put on his jacket for his match against The Rock. The night after on Raw, Bischoff [...] "fired" [...] Austin on medical grounds. The next morning, Austin gave an interview on WWE.com announcing his retirement from wrestling, although he stated that he and Vince McMahon had reached an agreement seeing him only appear in non-wrestling roles on a weekly basis. In reference to Bischoff firing him on Raw that week, he said that although firing was for storyline purposes, he admitted the medical problems read out on Raw were real and mainly <b>related</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his injury sustained at SummerSlam in a match with Owen Hart in August 1997, and had begun to seriously plague him since late 2001. He confessed wrestling against the advice of his doctors up to his departure in 2002, which forced him to quit wrestling, and cited this as the sole reason as to why he suddenly departed, with doctors advising an awkward or violent move performed on him could have resulted in Austin being permanently disabled or resulting in death.|$|E
