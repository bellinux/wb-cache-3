The BCCI claimed that it had sent several <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> to the franchise owners but received no response. On 19 September 2011, then BCCI president N.

2500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England, Ranjitsinhji hired a country house at Shillinglee and {{spent much of}} his time entertaining guests, hunting and playing cricket. Such a lifestyle was expensive, but there is no evidence he paid many bills and ran up considerable debts. Freed from his previous financial difficulties, he seems to have tried to repay the hospitality he had enjoyed. However, he made no attempt to pay for his lifestyle and ignored any <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> sent to him. Nevertheless, he came under increasing financial pressure throughout 1908. [...] Mansur Khachar came to England in an attempt to recover his loan, and contacted the India Office. He claimed Ranjitsinhji repeatedly misled him, although he could not provide evidence for all of his statements. Ranjitsinhji denied many of the claims but agreed to repay the initial loan to prevent embarrassment if the story got out. He offered to repay half of the sum, but in the event gave back less than a quarter. Another dispute arose with Mary Tayler, an artist who was commissioned in April 1908 to create a miniature portrait of Ranjitsinhji at an agreed cost of 100 guineas for one and 180 guineas for a pair. Ranjitsinhji became increasingly uncooperative and when the finished work arrived two weeks afterwards, he eventually returned them, stating that he was dissatisfied with the likeness. In response, Tayler issued a writ for 180 guineas. When the case came up at Brighton county court, Ranjitsinhji's solicitor, Edward Hunt, claimed that as a ruling sovereign, English courts had no authority over him. However the Secretary of State for India, Lord Morley, became involved and Hunt offered to make a settlement. By August, after a delay of seven weeks, Tayler was told that the matter could not be settled as MacLaren, Ranjitsinhji's secretary and a vital witness, was injured. But when Tayler discovered that this was untrue, she wrote to the India Office. She had no proof that a fee was agreed, but in November the India Office decided Ranjitsinhji should pay £75 as a gesture of good faith, and criticised Ranjitsinhji and [...] "his ridiculous private secretary". Ranjitsinhji also came before the courts over an 1896 loan covenant in a dispute between four women and himself and three other people. Ranjitsinhji had his name taken out of the claim on the grounds that he was a ruling sovereign, a view which was supported by the India Office.|$|E

5000|$|Before his {{departure}} for Berlin, State Department officials set as his priority {{the need to}} ensure that the German government did not default on its debts to American lenders. Dodd met with a group of bankers in New York City who recognized that economic conditions in Germany made full payment unlikely. They hoped he could argue against a German default and suggested they would agree to lower the interest on their loans from 7% to 4% to prevent it. National City Bank and Chase National Bank held over 100 million dollars in German bonds, which Germany later proposed to pay back at the rate of thirty-cents on the dollar. Dodd was not sympathetic to the bankers or the high interest rates they charged. He repeatedly registered protests with the German government when payments were suspended or debts to United States lenders were treated differently from debts owed to those in other countries. Yet he remained fundamentally in sympathy with Germany's request that interest rates be lowered. As Secretary of State Hull insisted that Dodd renew his <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment,</b> Dodd expressed frustration in his diary: [...] "What more can I say than I have said a score of times? Germany is in a terrible plight and for once she recognizes war is no remedy." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an exploratory study investigating the ethical implications {{of searching for}} a kidney donor online. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} eight individuals – four people who found a kidney donor online and four people who were still searching – about the process of looking for an altruistic kidney donor on the Internet. To explore ethical issues discussed by participants, the interviews were coded using the resource-product-target model of information ethics. All three types of moral issues outlined in this model were present in the data. When viewing information as a resource, participants discussed their choice to go online to find a donor, the process of encouraging others to share their solicitation message, and ways of handling <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> in exchange for a donation. In the information-as-product perspective, people discussed the management of their online persona. Finally, the ramifications of patients and caregivers choosing to share personal health information online was discussed when participants considered information as a target. Several fruitful areas for future research are identified in this study, which is the first qualitative study investigating the phenomenon of searching for a kidney donor online – an area of great interest to information scientists, healthcare providers, medical ethicists, and chronic kidney disease patients.

40|$|For {{the last}} ten years we have devoted our time and {{financial}} resources to Open Access electronic (online) journal publication [1 - 3]. During this time we have tried to balance the commitment to scientific publication with the realities of sustaining such an enterprise financially. As our readership and authors will be aware from previous editorials, authors ’ contributions of publication fees have been our main source of revenue. As clearly stipulated in our Instructions for Authors, this was always based on an honour system whereby authors would be invoiced after acceptance and publication of their papers, and requests for reduced payments were always considered based on the respective author’s circumstances, but increasingly this has been abused by authors who after publication have then ignored our <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment,</b> {{while at the same time}} the number of papers submitted, processed and published has increased dramatically, leading to the need to set up and staff an Editorial Office to handle these tasks. We have therefore decided that effective immediately and for all MDPI journals we shall have a two tier system, in which we will continue to offer full Open Access publication to those authors willing to contribute financially to support this option, while providing authors with the alternative choice of free publication without Open Access for those who prefer not to pay. This was essentially the policy in effect during 1997 - 2001...|$|E
40|$|Hugh Synnot Hull {{entered the}} civil service {{at the age of}} 15 in 1867 as a clerk in the Parliamentary Library, and in 1874 he was {{transferred}} to the Office of Stores. By 1879 he was earning 150 pound per annum and in 1893 he succeeded C H Huxtable as Government Storekeeper. Some of the Huxtables were also family friends. Hugh corresponded with his childhood friend Hugh Ralston Huxtable, who had gone to Edinburgh, UK and was for a short time engaged to Emily Agnes Huxtable. In 1878 Hugh became engaged to Laura Ann Allison, daughter of Frank Allison of Sandy Bay and was married to her on 10 January 1880 by Rev J Scott of St John's Presbyterian Church Hobart, at the Allison home in Sandy Bay. Hugh and Laura were both fond of music and were often invited to sing or play accompaniments to entertain friends or for charitable concerts. Hugh {{was a member of the}} Orpheus Choir, St Andrew's Church Choir and St Andrew's Choral Society. His cousin, Anna Hull* of Glenorchy also wrote about a visit from Amy Sherwin, the Tasmanian singer, 'she sings splendidly', in 1878 (Hll/ 61). Life was not easy for the couple as Hugh's salary was not high and although,as resident clerk to the Stores, he had a rent free Government cottage in Castray Esplanade, this was rather small for a family. Indeed in 1893 he requested better accommodation as three rooms were insufficient for a family of 7, for as he pointed out, three children with croup had to occupy the same bedroom as their parents.
