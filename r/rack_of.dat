5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E

25|$|In some Jewish {{communities}} a tallit gadol {{is given}} {{as a gift}} by a father to a son, a father-in-law to a son-in-law, or a teacher to a student. It might be purchased to mark a special occasion, such as a wedding or a bar mitzvah. Many parents purchase a tallit gadol for their sons {{at the age of}} 13, together with tefillin, though among the orthodox a male child will have been wearing a tallit katan from pre-school age. In the non-Orthodox Reform and Conservative movements in addition to the men, some women nowadays also wear a tallit gadol. While many worshipers bring their own tallit gadol to synagogue, there is usually a <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> them for the use of visitors and guests.|$|E

Notably, hummus bi tahini, [...] mukhluta, sometimes nearly a dozen variations of eggplant salad, tabbouleh, fattoush, chili pepper and red cabbage salads and dishes made up by the chef are served. Kibbee balls and sfiha are the primary hot appetizers available. Heavy meals are rarely provided by restaurants, instead however, the entrées include shish kebab, shish taouk, <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> lamb and chicken breasts.

500|$|According to Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{by the end}} of {{the first}} episode, it becomes clear that Underwood both literally and figuratively uses meat as his metaphor of choice. He may begin a day with a celebratory <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> ribs, because [...] "I'm feelin' hungry today!", and he depicts his life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak" [...] and plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time". He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, as he tells the audience, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." ...|$|E

In The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy felt the female characters were a [...] "standard <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> female anime archetypes" [...] and that the series as a whole was a [...] "culmination of a decade of geek-centered anime". Kenneth Lee, writing for Ex.org, praised the look and quality of the animation, highlighting the benefits of the digital creation of the adaption over traditional cel animation. Lee recognised elements from other series such as Maison Ikkoku and Kimagure Orange Road, and summarised the series as [...] "simply wonderful".|$|E

500|$|Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{notes that}} by the end of the first episode Frank establishes that his metaphor of choice is meat because both literally and figuratively it is his preference. He may begin a day with a celebratory <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> ribs, because [...] "I’m feelin’ hungry today!", but also he describes life with meat metaphors: he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak."; he plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time."; and he endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, he tells us, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." [...] Poniewozik notes that all of this comes from a character whose name, Underwood is a reference to the hallmark deviled ham of the William Underwood Company.|$|E
500|$|When the [...] (C.12) was {{reported}} sunk by a submarine, Omaha {{set out from}} Recife, on 8 July 1945, on a search and rescue operation. A report {{came in from the}} British steamer Balfe that they had picked up 33 survivors from Bahia. Omaha set course to intercept Balfe so she could transfer her medical staff and aid in treatment of the remaining survivors. In all, only 44 sailors were rescued, with seven dying from their injuries, and eight bodies recovered, out of a crew of 346. An investigation into the sinking of Bahia later determined that on 4 July 1945, while conducting anti-aircraft training, a gunner that had shot down a trailing target kite continued to fire as he was trailing the target's descent. Because the proper safety stops had not been installed on the gun he was able to inadvertently fire into a <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> live depth charges that were positioned on the fantail of the ship.|$|E
500|$|The first {{additional}} gait is a four-beat lateral ambling gait {{known as}} the tölt. This {{is known for its}} explosive acceleration and speed; it is also comfortable and ground-covering. There is considerable variation in style within the gait, and thus the tölt is variously compared to similar lateral gaits such as the <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> the Saddlebred, the largo of the Paso Fino, or the running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse. Like all lateral ambling gaits, the footfall pattern {{is the same as the}} walk (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds, from the speed of a typical fast walk up to the speed of a normal canter. Some Icelandic horses prefer to tölt, while others prefer to trot; correct training can improve weak gaits, but the tölt is a natural gait present from birth. There are two varieties of the tölt that are considered incorrect by breeders. The first is an uneven gait called a [...] "Pig's Pace" [...] or [...] "Piggy-pace" [...] that is closer to a two-beat pace than a four-beat amble. The second is called a Valhopp and is a tölt and canter combination most often seen in untrained young horses or horses that mix their gaits. Both varieties are normally uncomfortable to ride.|$|E

500|$|Known {{for taking}} the stage at early concerts with {{hundreds}} of clothespins attached to his hair and clothes, Haynes would often strip throughout a show until he was down to his underwear, or less, by the end. Other attire included flasher-style trench coats over his nakedness, ridiculously home-styled wigs and cross-dressing; often enjoying a skirt made of an American flag and a large '60s torpedo-style stuffed bra. At other times he would hide condoms full of stage blood in his clothes and repeatedly fall to the floor, appearing to bleed profusely. Some of Haynes' other favorite tricks involved throwing handfuls of photocopied cockroach images into the crowd, rolls and rolls of toilet paper tossed across the audience, as well as filling an inverted cymbal with lighter fluid, setting it (and sometimes his hand) on fire, and repeatedly hitting it with a mallet. As previously mentioned he would sing through almost anything that would alter his voice, including toilet paper rolls and megaphones early on, which eventually evolved into [...] "Gibby's kit", a.k.a. [...] "Gibbytronix," [...] a <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> vocal effects stacked as high as he could reach, before which he would often stand {{for the majority of}} the show in later performances. He also often utilized various foot switches which would be used to activate certain vocal effects, and when thought to be dancing during some performances he would actually be stepping on his various pedals. Adding to the spectacle were Coffey and Nervosa, who played in unison on stand-up drum kits; behind which they would collapse onto the floor and out of eyeshot, to collect their breath and strength before rising just in time to play the next song. Finally, the whole band would often tear apart stuffed animals while on stage, throwing the stuffing through the air, creating a rather disturbing throbbing effect, caused by the stroboscopes that were always on.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the table}} lifts the {{remaining}} pins, the machine runs the sweep, clearing dead pins from the pin deck, then {{returns to the}} guard position. Ball and pins travel on a continuously running carpet belt {{at the bottom of}} the pit. The ball, being heavier, travels to one of the side kick-backs where it enters the ball return, shared by adjacent lanes. The pins travel under the cushion into the ring-shaped, revolving circular pin elevator, at the rear center of the unit, which brings the pins up to a [...] "distributor arm" [...] that travels laterally as well as forward and back (on the 82-30, [...] governs the distributor's head piece movements) over the table , to deliver the pins to the corresponding bins or [...] "spotting cups" [...] as known in the 82-30's factory manuals, awaiting the next spotting cycle. In the 82-30, its semi-cylindrical [...] "spotting cup" [...] bins are part of the visible spotting table (unique to the design of the 82-30) suspended below the table's frame, each at a roughly a 45° angle with each [...] "cup" [...] inclined, pin-base-forward, in front of each spotting cell, and clearly visible to the bowler whenever the table approaches its lowermost position. After the table returns to its upper position, the sweep also lifts, and the machine shuts down to await the next ball. For spotting the new <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> pins, the 82-30 version tilts the pin-filled spotting cups vertically as the table descends, and tilts the cups slightly rearwards [...] to clear the new <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> pins just as the table starts upwards, leaving the new <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> pins spotted on the lane for the next frame.|$|E

2500|$|The , [...] lane is bordered {{along its}} length by semicylindrical {{channels}} called [...] "gutters", which {{are designed to}} collect errant balls. The overall width of the lane including the channels is [...] [...] The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry (knock down) all ten pins for a strike. Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning (hook shape reaction) ball to overcome this. A foul line is marked at the seam of {{the start of the}} lane and end of the approach. If any part of a bowler's body touches the line itself or beyond (anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes) after the ball is delivered, the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero (0). The bowler is allowed one shot at a new <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame, and if all ten pins are knocked down on this shot, it is scored as a spare. Behind the foul line is an [...] "approach" [...] approximately [...] long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it.
