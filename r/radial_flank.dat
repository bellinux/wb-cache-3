40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{synthesis}} of ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 differential SAR interferometry (InSAR) observations of Mt. Etna volcano over roughly {{the past ten years}} from 1002 - 2002. Through this time period Mount Etna underwent a cycle of eruptive activity starting with a large flank eruption that ended in March 1993, followed by two years quiescence, with resumed summit activity starting in the summer of 1995, culminating in the recent large flank eruptions of 2001 and 2002 / 2003. InSAR observations reveal patterns of surface deformation that result from the changing magma and structural dynamics of the volcano. Individual interferograms spanning each of these major volcanic episodes during the last ten years reveal the essential deformation patterns. Similarities between groups of similar time-span interferograms for both ascending and descending ERS satellite passes show common fringe patterns among each group and distinctive differences between the ascending and descending interferograms are related to true ground deformation and are not dominated by atmospheric effects. In general the deformation patterns are related to a combination of magma chamber inflation/deflation plus nearly <b>radial</b> <b>flank</b> motion to the W, S, and E. To make sense of the large number o...|$|E

Separation and bisection discrimination and just-detectable differences in line length are examples of radial thresholds. Vernier and alignment detection are tangential thresholds.

50|$|There is {{evidence}} of a large sector collapse on San Pedro, which removed the northwestern flank of the volcano and formed a large debris avalanche deposit. This avalanche deposit covers a surface area of 120 km2 and its front is 35 - 40 m high in the Pampa de la Avestruz. The debris flow formed by the sector collapse does not have many of the typical hummock-like hills of volcanic sector collapse deposits and instead features groves and <b>radial</b> ridges. Such <b>flank</b> collapse occurred notably on Mount St. Helens during its eruption in 1980. A 250 m high scarp west of the eastern summit was left {{by the collapse of}} San Pedro; otherwise much of the evidence was buried by later volcanic activity. As with the mudflows, the steep slopes of San Pedro probably facilitated the onset of the sector collapse, which dropped down an elevation difference of about 2845 m.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{plane stress}} sectorial domain is {{analysed}} {{according to a}} state-space formulation of the linear theory of elasticity. When loading {{is applied to the}} straight <b>radial</b> edges (<b>flanks),</b> with the circular arcs free of traction, one has the curved beam; when loading is applied to the circular arcs, with the flanks free of traction, one has the elastic wedge. A complete treatment of just one problem (the elastic wedge, say) requires two state-space formulations; the first describes radial evolution for the transmission of the stress resultants (force and moment), while the second describes circumferential evolution for determination of the rates of decay of self-equilibrated loading on the circular arcs, as anticipated by Saint-Venant’s principle. These two formulations can be employed subsequently for the curved beam, where now radial evolution is employed for the Saint-Venant decay problem, and circumferential evolution for the transmission modes. Power-law radial dependence is employed for the wedge, and is quite adequate except for treatment of the so-called wedge paradox; for this, and the curved beam, the formulations are modified so that lnr takes the place of the radial coordinate r. The analysis is characterised by a preponderance of repeating eigenvalues for the transmission modes, and the state-space formulation allows a systematic approach for determination of the eigen- and principal vectors. The so-called wedge paradox is related to accidental eigenvalue degeneracy for a particular angle, and its resolution involves a principal vector describing the bending moment coupled to a decay eigenvector. Restrictions on repeating eigenvalues and possible Jordan canonical forms are developed. Finally, symplectic orthogonality relationships are derived from the reciprocal theorem...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In NC milling process, {{tool wear}} has great {{influence}} on the machining quality of product. In this paper, a mapping measurement method is used to obtain tool wear and a data processing method is proposed {{to deal with the}} data getting from the measurement. First, tool wear along radius of tool’s cross-section, which is called radial wear, can be obtained by mapping measurement method. Then tool flank wear can be easily calculated based on the established relationship between <b>radial</b> wear and <b>flank</b> wear. In order to get radial wear, we process those measured data that are obtained from mapping measurement. In this process, least square method is adopted to fit these data to get the radius of section circle at a certain position. So the radial wear can be obtained by comparing the radius of the fitting circle and the original radius of tool at a certain section. Finally, the data processing software is realized by using Visual C++ development tool according to the designed data processing method of tool wear...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{access to}} energy in {{developing}} countries without exacerbating climate change requires novel technical strategies. MicroCSP power plants using organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) are {{one example of a}} promising approach for meeting this challenge. Specifically, expander development has been identified as a critical component for enhancing the performances of small ORC units. The goal of this project is to develop an optimized two-stage scroll expander to be integrated in a MicroCSP power plant designed to supply remote, off-grid areas. The expansion requirements are firstly defined so as to meet production specifications. Then, employing a deterministic model and a selection process, optimal scroll geometries are chosen for both expansion stages. The deterministic model is executed with Matlab and accounts for the relevant physical phenomena i. e. <b>radial</b> and <b>flank</b> leakages, throttling losses at the intake and exhaust processes, friction between the two scrolls and mechanical losses in the different bearings. A performance enhancement of about 6 % of the isentropic efficiency is predicted in comparison with baseline practice. A CAD model of a single-stage prototype is developed in Solidworks following the main architectural features of a compliant HVAC scroll compressor. This CAD is updated and improved with the optimal scroll geometries and some parts are 3 D printed to verify their mechanical assembly. Toolpaths to control CNC machines are generated using the CAM program HSMXpress and the parts constituting the expander prototype are manufactured in a machine shop. In conclusion, the properties of the enhanced scroll expander are evaluated {{in the context of a}} typical Micro-CSP plant. A simple steady state model in EES is developed to quantify how three parameters (T_ev, T_cond and eta_exp) influence the power plant overall sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency (a gain of 0. 73...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a comprehensive R- 410 A scroll compressor model. The model is based on a previously existing R- 22 scroll compressor model. This comprehensive compressor model combines a detailed compression process model and an overall compressor model and was used to investigate the compressor 2 ̆ 7 s performance under different operating conditions and subject to design changes. ^ The governing mass and energy conservation differential equations were developed for each chamber in the detailed compression process model. Models for the refrigerant flow in the suction process, discharge process as well as the flow due to the <b>radial</b> and <b>flank</b> leakage, models for heat transfer between the gas and scroll wraps, and models for solving the mechanical losses are coupled to the conservation equations. The state of the refrigerant changes with a period of 2 π, and thousands of steps are used to solve the governing differential equations. Each step covers a small angle, such as 2 π/ 1000 radians. It is assumed that in each step the compressor is in steady state. Iteration is applied until the convergence criteria that the refrigerant returns to the original state after a rotation of 2 π is satisfied. ^ In the overall model, compressor components are modeled in terms of six different elements. Steady-state energy balance equations were established using the lumped elements. In combination with the detailed compression process model, these equations were implemented into computer code and are solved iteratively. In this way, the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant in different compressor chambers, the temperature distributions in the scroll wraps, and the temperatures of the other compressor elements can be obtained. Thereafter, power consumption and efficiency of the compressor can be calculated. ^ Overall and detailed compressor performance measurements were conducted using a hot-gas bypass compressor load stand. Based on the these measurements, validation of the compressor model was conducted. ^ Using the simulation program of the compressor model, parametric studies of the scroll compressor were performed, and the effects of internal leakage and heat transfer losses, and external frictional losses were investigated. Results from these investigations were used to make recommendations for design improvements. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Galapagos Archipelago is {{characterized}} by numerous contemporaneous volcanoes, some with plume magma sources, others from the asthenosphere, possibly due to the young and thin oceanic crust. The GSC caused structural weaknesses in this thin lithosphere leading to eruptions forming the Galapagos Platform. Fernandina and Isabela in particular are aligned along these weaknesses. Lacking a well-defined rift zone, the islands have {{a high rate of}} inflation prior to eruption. Sierra Negra on Isabela Island experienced a 240 cm uplift between 1992 and 1998, most recent eruption in 2005, while Fernandina on Fernandina Island indicated an uplift of 90 cm, most recent eruption in 2009. Alcedo on Isabela Island had an uplift of greater than 90 cm, most recent eruption in 1993. Additional characteristics of the Galapagos Archipelago are closer volcano spacing, smaller volcano sizes, and larger calderas. For instance, Isabela Island includes 6 major volcanoes, Ecuador, Wolf, Darwin, Alcedo, Sierra Negraa and Cerro Azul, with most recent eruptions ranging from 1813 to 2008. The neighboring islands of Santiago and Fernandina last erupted in 1906 and 2009, respectively. Overall, the 9 active volcanoes in the archipelago have erupted 24 times between 1961 and 2011. The shape of these volcanoes is that of an [...] "overturned soup bowl" [...] as opposed to the [...] "overturned saucer plate" [...] of the Hawaiian Islands. The Galapagos shape is due to the pattern of radial and circumferential fissure, <b>radial</b> on the <b>flanks,</b> but circumferential near the caldera summits. It is the circumferential fissures which give rise to stacks of short lava flows.|$|R
50|$|The lawns which {{frame the}} main {{approach}} to the hall are bounded by yew hedges which were first recorded by William Freeman of Hamels in 1745. Surrounding the hall on three sides is the dry Moat. The plantings in the moist, sheltered conditions of the moat were considerably revised by Lindsay who introduced hosta, species of hydrangea, buddleia and rosemary. To {{the rear of the}} property is the noted Parterre garden which is located on the east lawn. Originally created as a Victorian sunken garden it was remodelled by Lindsay in the early 1930s. Set around an 18th-century listed stone fountain, she divided the garden into four large, colourful herbaceous beds surrounded by L shaped borders stocked with roses and catmint with an acorn shaped yew marking each corner. In the terraces above the parterre there are plantings of peony, seasonal beds and the Double Borders created in 2006, contain a wide variety of perennials, shrubs and grasses with colours ranging from hot to cool. Close by, are the White and Black Borders which were established in 2009, together with a collection of elaeagnus. The western side of the garden features the lawned Acre which is fringed by a spreading oriental plane tree. Outdoor sports such as croquet are played here in the summer months. Further highlights are a collection of magnolia underplanted with autumn cyclamen, the shell fountain and the kitchen garden. To the north of the parterre is the Wilderness garden which is bisected by <b>radial</b> grassed avenues <b>flanked</b> with turkey oak, lime and beech trees and naturalised bulbs. The wilderness hides a Secret Garden with a summerhouse, scented plants and a central sundial. Nearby is the listed 18th century orangery which houses a collection of citrus trees. Adjacent, to the building is the steep sided Dell which is home to many woodland plants including a selection of hellebore and foxglove. In 2009, an area of woodland was cleared close to the orangery to create a new garden. Stocked {{with a wide range of}} woodland plants including camellia and varieties of mahonia. Opened in 2010, it will be known as the Orangery Garden. The Grade II listed Temple is approached by the Temple walk which is lined with azalea planted by Lindsay in her original 1930s design. Scattered throughout the garden are many garden ornaments including thirty pieces supplied to Lady Lothian in 1877 by Austin & Seeley of Euston Road, London. Future projects include the creation of a philadelphus and rose garden, both of which will be located in the Wilderness and open to the public in the near future.In 2015, it was announced that Blickling's unused walled garden covering 1.5 acres is to be regenerated. The project will take five years to complete.|$|R
