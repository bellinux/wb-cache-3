40|$|Plasma {{actuators}} {{based on}} dielectric barrier discharge promise {{a bright future}} in aerodynamical applications. By creating a body force in the surrounding gas through plasma – gas interaction, plasma actuators, operated in quiescent air, induce a weak flow above their surface with a velocity of typically 5 - 8 m/s, the so called ionic wind. The ionic wind can influence the boundary-layer of any externally applied flow. Thus, plasma actuators are used for flow-control applications {{with a wide range}} of different flow velocities, temperatures and pressures. In the present work, the impact of these environmental conditions on the power consumption, plasma length and resonance behavior of the plasma actuators is studied. It is shown that an increase of the temperature or decrease of the pressure favor the discharge, as they increase the plasma length and the power consumption for a constant voltage amplitude. During the experiments temperatures from ambient temperature up to 600 °C were tested and the pressure ranges from ambient pressure down to p = 0. 11 bar. Scaling numbers and power laws were found to describe the impact of these parameters on the power consumption and plasma length. A hypothesis that the mean free path of the ions and electrons could be the dominant impact factor on the discharge was derived. Thus, the temperature and pressure dependence on the mean free path leads to the observed effects. Also, it is shown that the impedance of the plasma actuator, which is a product of an active and passive component of the actuators capacitance, is increased by an increasing temperature or decreasing pressure. This effects lead to a decrease of the resonance frequency of the circuit. External flows with small velocities between 0 m/s and 21 m/s have no effect on the power consumption and resonance behavior of an actuator. High velocities decrease the power consumption and the impedance, as they reduce the discharge volume and <b>relative</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>duration.</b> These effects are shown in different experiments of a plasma actuator exposed to flow Mach numbers between 0. 42 and 0. 7. The second part of this thesis focuses on the investigation of the environmental and voltage impact on filaments in the discharge that are caused by an instability in the discharge process. It is shown that increasing the pressure or flow velocity stabilizes the discharge and thus delays the onset of the formation of filaments towards higher voltages. The temperature seems to have no impact on the onset voltage. These effects are in good agreement with the predications by a theoretical model of the filaments. With the help of streak-camera images it is shown that the filaments only occur during the negative half-cycle. Increasing the voltage amplitude or temperature increases the spacing between the filaments, which typically ranges in between 2 mm and 4 mm. The same effect is achieved by decreasing the pressure. Measurements with a Pitot tube and particle image velocimetry show that the filaments increase the local velocity of the ionic wind by a factor of roughly 1. 1 - 1. 6. Thus, the ionic wind of a discharge with filaments looses its two-dimensional character and becomes three-dimensional. This effect may allow advanced flow-control strategies, for example active vortex generation using the discharge filaments...|$|E

The synchronicity of these potentials (recorded at distances up to 5 mm) was decreased by GJ blockers within 20 min of application, while prolonged GJ blockers treatment at higher doses made them disappear with different time courses.

40|$|The catastrophic {{outcome of}} {{accidental}} explosions to humans and property has caused an increased {{need for new}} knowledge {{in order to prevent}} and mitigate the effects of such events. Amongst other substances, a wide range of gases and dusts can cause such explosions. The present experimental study is concerned with electrostatic- spark-initiation of dust explosions. Lycopodium clavatum was chosen as the test dust, partly because this dust has been widely used in previously published investigations on various aspects of dust explosions. Also, the dust can be obtained throughout the world and research results from various researchers can be compared. In the present study transient experimental clouds of lycopodium clavatum in air were produced by dispersing a given amount of the dust, placed in a small cavity {{at the bottom of the}} explosion vessel, by a blast of air. In almost all experiments the nominal dust concentration was stoichiometric. In a few experiments it was twice the stoichiometric. Synchronization of the transient experimental dust cloud and the spark discharge was brought about by the dust cloud itself, when it entered the spark gap that had already been charged to a voltage somewhat below the natural breakdown voltage in just air. This breakdown mechanism may well be one of the mechanisms of dust cloud/spark synchronization that can actually operate in accidental industrial dust explosions initiated by electrostatic spark discharges. One specific problem studied in the present investigation was the influence of the spark <b>discharge</b> <b>duration</b> on the ease by which the dust cloud could be ignited when using the inherent spark discharge triggering method. It was known from the literature that the lowest electric spark energy that can ignite a dust cloud depends strongly on the discharge time of the spark discharge. In the present experiment the <b>discharge</b> <b>duration</b> was varied by varying the series inductance in the discharge circuit. The experimental probabilities of ignition, based on 40 - 100 apparently identical successive experiments, were presented as functions of the spark <b>discharge</b> <b>duration,</b> electrode shape, spark energy and spark resistance. The influence of air humidity on the natural breakdown voltages of the two different spark gap geometries used was also investigated. The experiments confirmed that the minimum stored capacitor energies required for igniting the dust clouds decreased markedly with increasing spark <b>discharge</b> <b>duration.</b> There was only a modest influence of the spark electrode geometry on the minimum ignition energy (MIE). Experimental correlations between various other parameters were also obtained.

40|$|Abstract. Electrical {{discharge}} {{phenomena in}} EDM {{occur in a}} very short time period and in a very narrow space, thus making both observation and theoretical analysis extremely difficult. For this reason, the material removal mechanism in EDM has yet to be understood clearly. EDM is a thermal process. Thermal energy is generated by a pulse discharge between the workpiece and the tool electrode. It results in melting and evaporating followed by removal of both the workpiece and tool electrode, forming a discharge crater on both surfaces. In this paper, the hydrostatic pressure distribution in melting area was simulated by Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods. The analysis shows that after discharge is ignited, extremely high pressure is generated inside the melting area. The pressure distribution along the central axis of the melting area at different times indicates that during the <b>discharge</b> <b>duration,</b> the hydrostatic pressure quickly increases to a peak value along the depth direction of melting area and then reduced to 0 GPa in the unaffected area. It was also found that with the passage of time, the depth of the point where the pressure peaks increases with the formation of the discharge crater, accompanied by the decrease in the peak pressure. In addition, the ejected material atoms at different times during the removal process were also analyzed. It was found that the material ablation occurs mostly during the <b>discharge</b> <b>duration...</b>|$|R

Multiple regression analyses of rainfall, pre-event discharge, single point soil moisture profiles from representative locations and peak <b>discharge,</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>duration,</b> <b>discharge</b> volume are discussed. The soil moisture profiles are selected along a convergent slope connected to the groundwater in flood plain within the small-scale catchment Husten (2. 6 km²), which is a headwater catchment of the larger Hüppcherhammer catchment (47. 2 km², Germany). Results show that the number of explanatory variables in the regression models is higher in summer (up to 8 variables) than in winter (up to 3 variables) and higher in the meso-scale catchment than in the small-scale catchment (up to 2 variables). Soil moisture data from selected key locations in the small catchment improves the quality of regression models established for the meso-scale catchment. For the different target variables peak <b>discharge,</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>duration</b> and <b>discharge</b> volume the adding of the soil moisture from the flood plain and the lower slope as explanatory variable improves the quality of the regression model by 15 %, 20 % and 10 %, respectively, especially during the summer season.

The appearance of the soil moisture variables in the stepwise regression indicates their varying importance, depending on which characteristics of the discharge are focused on. Thus, we conclude that point data for soil moisture in functional landscape elements describe the catchments’ initial conditions very well and may yield valuable information for flood prediction and warning systems...|$|R

PhrMNs were classified as early (Early-I) or late inspiratory (Late-I) according to burst onset relative to the contralateral phrenic neurogram during normocapnic baseline conditions. During hypoxia (FIO 2 = 0. 12 – 0. 14, 3 min), both Early-I and Late-I PhrMNs abruptly increased discharge frequency. Both cell types also showed a progressive increase in frequency over the remainder of hypoxia. However, Early-I PhrMNs showed reduced overall <b>discharge</b> <b>duration</b> and total spikes/breath during hypoxia, whereas Late-I PhrMNs maintained constant <b>discharge</b> <b>duration</b> and therefore {{increased the number of}} spikes/breath.

In contrast, both Early-I and Late-I PhrMNs showed post-hypoxia STP as reflected by greater discharge frequencies and spikes/breath during the post-hypoxic period (P < 0. 01 vs. baseline). We conclude that the expression of phrenic STP during hypoxia reflects increased activity in previously active Early-I and Late-I PhrMNs and recruitment of silent PhrMNs. post-hypoxia STP primarily reflects persistent increases in the discharge of PhrMNs, which were active before hypoxia...|$|R
