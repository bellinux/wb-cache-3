40|$|Mothers of Sparta is a {{collection}} of thirteen personal essays that examine place—knowing one’s place, and finding one’s place in the world. The narrative arc chronicles the narrator’s childhood, young adulthood, marriage and child <b>rearing</b> <b>years,</b> ultimately encompassing the difficulties of raising a child who, due to brain damage, faces an uncertain future. As the narrator grows older, place shifts from a concrete knowledge of the physical world around her, to learning her place within gendered and regional social constructs, and defining her place through roles such as wife, mother, student and writer. These essays are diverse in style. Woven throughout is a theme of violence, weighted with visceral language: the violence of accident and death, the violence that occurs in nature and in domestic spaces, and the violence that often goes unnoticed because we live in a violent world...|$|R

40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Research {{shows that}} {{raising a child}} with a {{developmental}} disability is associated with high levels of stress and low social participation by parents. Because social participation is associated with psychological health in the general population, low social participation might predict distress for these parents. Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, a three-step procedure of linear regression analyses examined social participation as a mediator of stress associated with raising {{a child with a}} developmental disability, which predicts depression for these parents as opposed to a group of matched controls in later life. Contrary to the hypotheses, the groups did not significantly differ in depression symptoms in later life, and also did not significantly differ on any of the social participation variables in the early child <b>rearing</b> <b>years.</b> However, the groups did significantly differ in terms of friendship participation in midlife and late life with lower rates in the developmental disability group. Several of the measures of social participation at various points in adulthood predicted later life depression. Future directions and limitations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Ploeger Model of enhanced maternal {{and child health}} (EMCHN) nursing practice that has been operationalised since 1997. These EMCHNs work with families whose infants and children are exposed to violence. Family violence is complex and many layered. It presents a situation of fear and unpredictability that is difficult to identify and manage. If this situation continues during the child <b>rearing</b> <b>years</b> the effect on the health and wellbeing of infants and children may range from death to life long disabilities. Maternal, siblings and families&# 039; health and wellbeing can also be impacted upon for life. The need for enhanced skills for identifying and supporting vulnerable families and safeguarding children at risk has been highlighted by the Department of Health (2004). The Ploeger Model provides an example of early identification and intervention using both secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to identify and make referrals within a multidisciplinary, collaborative partnership, and a process of mutual clinical supervision. Another feature of the model is &# 039;assertive outreach&# 039;, which assists with early engagement with the family focusing on social support. Each of these helps achieve positive outcomes for children and their families. Such front line professionals must have the knowledge, skills, time and management support to work effectively with these families...|$|R

40|$|We present {{research}} and management implications for captive propagation {{of the endangered}} Fijian Ground Frog Platymantis vitiana to develop methods for supplementing populations in the wild. In 2004, a captive propagation program was instituted at Kula Ecopark, Sigatoka, Fiji. However, there was little success with only a single froglet <b>reared</b> after three <b>years.</b> In 2006, a more intensive programme was undertaken between the University of the South Pacific (USP), Kula Ecopark and the community on Viwa Island. The aim of this programme was to create an outdoor enclosure to mimic natural habitat conditions so the frogs could exhibit natural breeding behaviour. A total of 39 froglets was <b>reared</b> after one <b>year</b> of this programme. We provide information on the methods of captive management, reproductive biology, captive diet varieties, and on problems of rearing froglets in captivity. This research is useful baseline information in guiding captive propagation techniques in zoological parks like the Kula Ecopark and for {{organizations such as the}} National Trust of Fiji.

5000|$|A single female queen with, on average, 9.1 foundresses, usually initiates the {{construction}} of new combs and cells to form nests. The more foundresses in a colony, the more combs produced. The preemergence period of comb development lasts from initiation of the first comb until the first adult offspring emerges, when the postemergence period begins. On average, combs grow for 15.4 days and achieve a size of 30.8 cells. Although comb enlargement tends to stop when the oldest brood in that comb had pupated, in many cases the brood is still in the egg stage, so the stage of brood development in the comb does not seem to provide the cue that causes the queen to cease comb development. The egg to adult development period takes around 40 days, during which time the first helpers emerge in the nest. Unlike other species of Polistes, no more than one generation of broods is housed in a comb. Therefore, as older combs are abandoned, brood rearing moves into new combs, with most colonies having about 38 combs. This multiple comb-building tactic is thought to be a defense mechanism against brood loss to moth infestations. Broods are <b>reared</b> <b>year</b> round and two or three generations of offspring are reared during the colony cycle of several months. The red paper wasp is an [...] species, meaning that {{there appears to be no}} relationship between the time of the year and the colony’s development. Colonies are observed to be founded or abandoned at any time of the year, but the mean duration of the brood development stages differ between cold-dry and warm-rainy seasons.|$|R
