40|$|A bstract This study aims to {{investigate}} the effect of heat input of outside SAW weld on low temperature toughness(- 20 ℃) of inside SAW weld for API 5 L X 70 with sour gas resistance. As increasing heat input of the outside weld, low temperature toughness of the inside weld was decreased. Especially, {{in spite of the}} same heat input, the value of low temperature toughness was fluctuated. On the basis of fracture and microstructure analysis, the low temperature toughness is correlated with the fracture area ratio of shear lips and four kinds of fracture sections. These sections were divided with size and shape of dimple correlated with grain boundary ferrite and cleavage correlated acicular and polygonal ferrite in grain. Therefore, it was seen that these sections were two of final solidification area in the inside weld and the outside weld, no <b>reheated</b> <b>zone</b> and <b>reheated</b> <b>zone</b> in the inside weld. In conclusion, it is thought that the difference of low temperature toughness at the same heat input {{is due to the fact}} that each of impact test specimens could have the different microstructure, even though the notch was machined under the erro...|$|R
40|$|The {{metallurgical}} {{and mechanical}} characteristics, toughness and corrosion resistance of dissimilar welds between super duplex stainless steel UNS S 32750 and carbon steel ASTM A 516 Gr. 70 have been evaluated. Three heat inputs of 21. 12, 24. 00, 26. 88 kJ/cm {{were employed to}} make joints of dissimilar metals with flux cored arc welding(FCAW). Based on microstructural examination, vermicular ferrite was formed in the first layer of weld at low heat input(21. 12 kJ/cm) and Creq/Nieq of 1. 61 while acicular ferrite was formed in last layer of weld at high heat input(26. 88 kJ/cm) and Creq/Nieq of 1. 72. Ferrite percentage in dissimilar welds was lowest in the first layer of weld regardless of heat inputs and it gradually increased {{in the second and}} third layers of weld. Heat affected zone showed higher hardness than the weld metal although <b>reheated</b> <b>zone</b> showed lower hardness than weld metal due to the formation of secondary austenite. Tensile strengths of dissimilar welds increased with heat input and there was 100 MPa difference. The corrosion test by ferric chloride solution showed that carbon steel had poor corrosion resistance and pitting corrosion occurred in the first layer(root pass) of weld due to the presence of <b>reheated</b> <b>zone</b> where secondary austenite was formed. The salt spray test of carbon steel showed that the surface only corroded but the amount of weight loss was extremely low...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, AISI M 2 powder was {{selected}} primarily through various literature {{in order to}} improve the hardness and wear resistance. Among the laser metal deposition parameters, laser power was studied to improve the deposition efficiency in the laser metal deposition using a diode pumped disk laser. SKD 61 hot work steel plate and AISI M 2 powder were used as a substrate and powder for laser metal deposition, respectively. Fixed parameters are CTWD, focal position, travel speed, powder feed rate, etc. Experiments for the laser metal deposition were carried out by changing laser power. Through optical micrographs analysis of cross-section in LMD track, effect of the major parameters were predicted by track pitch. As the track pitch increased, so the <b>reheated</b> <b>zone</b> width, the overlap width and the minimum thickness was decreased. The hardness was decreased in the HAZ area, the hardness in the reheated HA...|$|R
50|$|Air Handling units (AHU) and Roof Top units (RTU) {{that serve}} {{multiple}} zones should vary the DISCHARGE AIR TEMPERATURE SET POINT VALUE automatically {{in the range}} 55 F to 70 F. This adjustment reduces the cooling, heating, and fan energy consumption. When the outside temperature is below 70 F, for zones with very low cooling loads, raising the supply-air temperature decreases the use of <b>reheat</b> at the <b>zone</b> level.|$|R
40|$|Since {{terminal}} boxes {{do not have}} a modulation damper in constant volume (CV) air handling unit (AHU) systems, <b>zone</b> <b>reheat</b> coils have to be modulated to maintain the space temperature with constant supply airflow. This conventional control sequence causes a significant amount of reheat and constant fan power under partial load conditions. Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) can be installed on these constant air volume systems. The fan speed can be modulated based on the maximum zone load. This paper present the procedure to control the supply fan speed and analyzes the thermal performance and major fan energy and thermal energy savings without expensive VAV retrofit through the actual system operation...|$|R
40|$|Intelligent {{building}} technology for building operation, called the optimization process, is developed in this thesis. The optimization process, when installed {{in parallel with}} a building's central control system, will permit the optimal operation of HVAC systems. Using this proposed optimization process, the supervisory control strategy set points, such as supply air temperature, supply duct static pressure, chilled water supply temperature, supply C 02 concentration (or minimum outdoor ventilation), <b>reheat</b> (or <b>zone</b> supply air temperature), and zone air temperature are optimized with respect to energy use and thermal comfort. The multi-objective genetic algorithm that is developed and validated using mathematic and simplified HVAC system problems is used to solve the optimization problem. Detailed VAV components are developed and validated against the monitored data of the investigated existing HVAC system. Adaptive VAV component models using artificial neural networks are also developed for working with most existing building energy management control systems. A ventilation control strategy using supply CO 2 concentration set points is developed and integrated into the optimization process. The strategy allows the on-line control of the outdoor air in response to actual building occupancy while ensuring the ventilation requirements of each individual zone. The optimization of the existing HVAC system is done for the three different weather weeks taken from July 2002, February 2003, and May 2003. The simulation results show that by comparing actual and optimal energy use, the on-line implementation of the optimization process could save energy by 19. 5...|$|R
40|$|Tensile, {{crack opening}} {{displacement}} (COD), blunt notch, and Charpy impact tests {{were used to}} investigate cleavage initiation in the intercritically <b>reheated</b> coarse-grained heat-affected <b>zone</b> (IC CG HAZ) of three steels. The steels were chosen to provide different distributions and morphologies of MA (high-carbon martensite with some retained austenite) particles within the IC CG HAZ structure. Observation of minimum impact toughness values for the IC CG HAZ {{was found to be}} associated with a particular microstructure containing a near-connected grain boundary network of blocky MA particles, the MA particles being significantly harder than the internal grain microstructure. The initiation mechanism for this structure was determined to be from a combination of an overlap of residual transformational induced stress fields, due to the formation of the MA particles, between two closely spaced particles and stress concentration effects resulting from debonding of the particles. © 1994 The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, and ASM International...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{the effect of}} {{different}} levels of Ti, N, and Ti/N ratios on microstructure and properties in the intercritically <b>reheated</b> coarse-grained heat-affected <b>zone</b> (ICCGHAZ) of two-pass submerged arc welds in API 5 L grade X 70 pipe. Gleeble simulation was employed to reproduce the ICCGHAZ of actual welds. Hardness and Charpy V-notch (CVN) tests were performed on the simulated samples. The microstructure of simulated ICCGHAZ was characterized by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). LePera color etching technique was employed to identify and quantify the martensitic-austenitic (M-A) constituent. Results show that the simulated ICCGHAZ exhibited extremely low toughness, but in the studied range of Ti and N, there was no correlation with Ti/N ratio. The beneficial effect of near-stoichiometric Ti/N ratio observed in coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) did not translate to ICCGHAZ. This {{was because of the}} negative effect of the blocky M-A constituent formed on prior austenite grain boundaries...|$|R
40|$|The Langford ?A? {{building}} houses the College of Architecture on TAMU campus. There are ten singleduct variable air volume (VAV) air-handling units (AHUs) without reheat serving the building. The local pneumatic thermostats modulate the dampers of VAV boxes to maintain room temperature at their setpoints. The thermostat action is switched from direct acting (DA) to reverse acting (RA) {{when the season}} changes from fall to winter and vice versa from winter to spring, based on the out side air temperature, when season changes. This results {{in various parts of}} the building ether too cold or too hot during the season change. This paper presents that the thermostat action will be switched according to cooling loads or discharge air temperature, instead of outside air temperature. For the interior zone, thermostat action does not need to be switched at all. The comfort is improved and savings is achieved by the new control scheme. Because some air-handling units (AHUs) serve both interior and exterior zones, this system never worked as intended. The system must be modified to have <b>zone</b> <b>reheat</b> and the AHUs discharge air temperature is set below dew point for humidity control...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} paucity of {{measured}} equipment load data for laboratories and other complex buildings and designers often use estimates based on nameplate rated data or design assumptions from prior projects. Consequently, peak equipment loads are frequently overestimated, and load variation across laboratory spaces within a building is typically underestimated. This results in two design flaws. Firstly, the overestimation of peak equipment loads results in over-sized HVAC systems, increasing initial construction costs as well as energy use due to inefficiencies at low part-load operation. Secondly, HVAC systems that are designed without accurately accounting for equipment load variation across zones can significantly increase simultaneous heating and cooling, particularly for systems that use <b>zone</b> <b>reheat</b> for temperature control. Thus, when designing a laboratory HVAC system, the use of measured equipment load data from a comparable laboratory will support right-sizing HVAC systems and optimizing their configuration to minimize simultaneous heating and cooling, saving initial construction costs as well as life-cycle energy costs. In this paper, we present data from recent studies to support the above thesis. We first present measured equipment load data from two sources: time-series measurements in several laboratory modules in a university research laboratory building; and peak load data for several facilities recorded in a national energy benchmarking database. We then contrast this measured data with estimated values that are typically used for sizing the HVAC systems in these facilities, highlighting the over-sizing problem. Next, we examine the load variation in the time series measurements and analyze {{the impact of this}} variation on energy use, via parametric energy simulations. We then briefly discuss HVAC design solutions that minimize simultaneous heating and cooling energy use...|$|R
40|$|This work {{represents}} the collaborative effort between American Air Liquide and Physical Sciences, Inc. {{for developing a}} sensor based on near-IR tunable diode lasers (TDL). The multi-species capability of the sensor for simultaneous monitoring of CO, O 2, and H 2 O concentration as well as gas temperature is ideal for in-situ monitoring on industrial furnaces. The chemical species targeted are fundamental for controlling the combustion space for improved energy efficiency, reduced pollutants, and improved product quality, when coupling the measurement to a combustion control system. Several add-on modules developed provide flexibility in the system configuration for handling different process monitoring applications. For example, the on-Demand Power Control system for the 1. 5 ?m laser is used for high particle density exhaust streams where laser transmission is problematic. For long-distance signal collection a fiber optic communication system is used to reduce noise pick-up. Finally, hardened modules to withstand high ambient temperatures, immune to EMF interference, protection from flying debris, and interfaced with pathlength control laser beam shielding probes were developed specifically for EAF process monitoring. Demonstration of these different system configurations was conducted on Charter Steel's reheat furnace, Imco Recycling, Inc. (now Aleris International, Inc.) aluminum reverberatory furnace, and Gerdau Ameristeel's EAF. Measurements on the <b>reheat</b> furnace demonstrated <b>zone</b> monitoring with the measurement performed close to the steel billet. Results from the aluminum furnace showed the benefit of measuring in-situ near the bath. In this case, low-level furnace optimization was performed and demonstrated 5 % fuel savings. Monitoring tests on the EAF off-gas demonstrated the level of industrialization of the sensor to survive the harsh EAF environment. Long-term testing on the EAF has been on-going for over 6 months with essentially zero maintenance. Validation of the TDL measurement on the EAF was confirmed by comparison with extractive sampling CO measurements...|$|R
