25|$|Many South American zoos hold tinamous, as do {{some private}} estates. Examples of captive {{breeding}} are small-billed tinamou in Minas Gerais and <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> in Rio Grande do Sul. The small-billed tinamou has looked promising for domestication as the birds can raise 3–4 broods {{per year and}} are resistant to diseases that affect domestic chickens.|$|E
25|$|No tinamou {{species has}} been {{successfully}} domesticated so far, despite their ability to breed well in captivity. The <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> has been bred on farms in France, Great Britain, Belgium, and Denmark. They, {{along with some of}} the Crypturellus species, are being bred in Rio Grande do Sul to boost numbers for hunting. Hybridization can occur.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts to introduce or reintroduce tinamous to {{various parts of the}} world. The <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> has been reintroduced to the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where its wild population was hunted to extermination {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. France, Germany, and Hungary have all, unsuccessfully, attempted to introduce them into their countryside.|$|E
25|$|By 20 days, {{the young}} slaty-breasted tinamou has gained adult size, though not adult weight. The spotted nothura will go from 10% of adult weight to 90% within 85 days, and the <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> {{will do so}} in 108 days. Sexual {{maturity}} comes {{at the age of}} one year, although some species may be physiologically mature by 57 days. However, some behavior may need to be learned before the birds can breed successfully.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral and {{ecological}} separation of tinamou species is evident where their ranges overlap through {{the utilization of}} different food sources and occupation of limited micro-habitats. These micro-habitats are {{not always easy to}} identify, and are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Some species, such as the <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou,</b> utilize multiple habitats such as the open savannas of Amazonia and the dry valleys of the Andes. Similarly, brown tinamous occur in both the Amazon basin and the humid montane forests on the Andean slope.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} fairly deeply colored, {{usually in a}} single color, and have a hard porcelain-like gloss. Colors vary with species, ranging through green, purple, violet, turquoise, steel grey, {{chocolate}} and lemon-yellow. White is rare, but does occur. Though the eggs are bright and colorful when laid, over time they fade and become duller. For example, the egg of the <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> dulls from purple to leaden. Most tinamou eggs are solid colored, without spots or specling; however, the eggs of Tinamotis species may exhibit small white speckles. The benefit of laying brightly colored eggs is unknown, but is not detrimental as most tinamou predators hunt at night.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several {{unsuccessful}} attempts to introduce tinamous to the United States. In Oregon, between 1966–1974, 473 ornate tinamou and 110 <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> were brought in. In 1966 and 1971, Florida introduced 128 spotted nothura. In 1969, 47 and 136 spotted nothura were introduced to Alabama and Texas. 1970 saw Colorado and Oklahoma introducing 164 and 100 Darwin's nothura respectively. In 1971, Nebraska brought 256 elegant crested tinamou, and California introduced 217 in 1969, and 1200 between 1971 and 1977. The 1885 introduction of Chilean tinamou to Easter Island was successful, though the population has not prospered since Chimango caracaras were introduced in 1928.|$|E

5000|$|To start a {{standardized}} classification and nomenclature of the Neotropical avifauna, Van Remsen sent {{a proposal to}} the American Ornithologists' Union in 1997 to create a South American counterpart to the already known AOU Check-list Committee which covered the avifauna of the Western Hemisphere from Panama and north to the Caribbean.

40|$|The <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Rhynchotus rufescens), a bird {{from the}} Tinamidae family, {{can be easily}} adapted to captivity. It is {{considered}} suitable for producing good quality meat while presenting great feed conversion rate, characteristics that make it interesting for commercial production. Therefore, {{in order to determine}} the major diseases that affect these birds, 114 birds from two different aviary types that died over a 12 -year period, 1994 - 2006, were analyzed macro- and microscopically. Anatomical and pathological examinations showed that the most frequently affected systems were the urinary and digestive tracts. In the urinary tract, the main finding was gout, followed by amyloidosis and parasitism by the trematode Paratanaisia confusa. In the digestive tract, the presence of foreign material and parasitism by Capillaria penidoi were observed in the esophagus and crop.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effects of incubation temperature (34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C) and relative humidity (RH, 50 % and 60 %) on egg weight loss, embryo mortality, hatchability, incubation time and chick weight in eggs from <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou.</b> The eggs were placed in incubators that were operated at 34 °C, 36 °C, or 38 °C and 50 % or 60 % RH (mean wet bulb temperatures of 28 °C and 30 °C, respectively) from day 1 to hatching. Each treatment had two replicate groups of 30 eggs each. Hatchability varied with incubation temperature and RH and was highest for eggs incubated at 36 °C and 60 % RH and lowest for eggs incubated at 38 °C. Early, intermediate and late embryo mortality were highest at 38 °C, 38 °C/ 50 % RH, and 50 % RH, respectively. Incubation period was longest at 34 °C and shortest at 38 °C/ 50 % RH. Present results show the highest hatchability of <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> eggs after incubation at 36 °C and 60 % RH; highest embryo sensitivity to high temperature in the early period of incubation (1 to 7 days), to high temperature and low RH in the second period of incubation (8 - 14 days) and to low RH in the late period of incubation (after 15 days) and shortest incubation period with increasing temperature and RH...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{structures of the}} three major bile acids present in the gallbladder bile of the <b>Red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Rhynchotus rufescens), an early evolving, ground-living bird related to ratites, were determined. Bile acids were isolated by preparative reversed-phase HPLC. Two of the compounds were identified as the taurine N-acylamidates of (25 R) - 3 α, 7 α-dihydroxy- 5 β-cholestan- 27 -oic acid (constituting 22 % of biliary bile acids) and (25 R) - 3 α, 7 α, 12 α-trihydroxy- 5 β-cholestan- 27 -oic acid (constituting 51 %). The remaining compound, constituting 21 % of biliary bile acids, was an unknown C 27 bile acid. Its structure was elucidated by LC/ESI-MS/MS and NMR and shown to be the taurine conjugate of (25 R) - 1 β, 3 α, 7 α-trihydroxy- 5 β-cholestan- 27 -oic acid, a C 27 trihydroxy bile acid not previously reported. Although C 27 bile acids with a 1 β-hydroxyl group have been identified as trace bile acids in the alligator, this is the first report of a major biliary C 27 bile acid possessing a 1 β-hydroxyl group...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} litter substrates on the performance, carcass traits, and environmental comfort of <b>red-winged</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Rhynchotus rufescens). In this experiment, 160 birds, with 100 and 300 days of age, were housed into 20 pens, and distributed according to a completely randomized experimental design into five treatments with four replicates of eight birds each. Treatments consisted of five litter substrates: wood shavings, rice husks, peanut hulls, grass hay, or sand. Feed intake; weight gain; breast, hock, and footpad lesions; back feathering; total meat production; carcass and parts yield; and leukocyte counts were evaluated. Litter substrates were analyzed for dry matter content, standard microbial count, ammonia volatilization potential, water content, water holding capacity, temperature, and radiant heat load. The results showed that litter substrate did not influence the evaluated bird parameters, despite the higher microbial counts and released ammonia values determined in peanut hulls and sand, respectively. Sand also tended to have higher average temperature than the other litter substrates. It was concluded that litter substrate should be chosen at farmer discretion, taking into consideration its cost and utilization after use...|$|E
