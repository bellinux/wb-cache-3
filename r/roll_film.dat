5|$|The Kinetoscope is {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window {{at the top of}} the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using <b>roll</b> <b>film</b> first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.|$|E

25|$|Downey used Joseph Swan's carbon {{process for}} their best work. In the 1880s Mawson, Swan & Morgan of Newcastle, was the world's largest {{manufacturer}} of photographic dry plates, {{the convenience of}} which made photography a commercial reality. George Eastman spent some time there during the eighties and afterwards invented the Box Brownie and <b>roll</b> <b>film,</b> ending the monopoly of studios on permanent images.|$|E
25|$|Ambrose's acrobatic {{saxophone}} playing, {{along with}} Lytle on the double bass – literally on it, riding {{it like a}} pony, and holding {{it over his head}} –were highlights of the band's live performances during this time. Their music and their act were part of a tradition in jazz and rhythm and blues, but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience. In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a short subject entitled Round Up of Rhythm, performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and <b>roll</b> <b>film</b> release.|$|E
500|$|Some scholars—in particular, Gordon Hendricks, in The Edison Motion Picture Myth (1961)—have {{argued that}} the lab began working on a filmstrip machine much later and that Dickson and Edison {{misrepresented}} the date to establish priority for reasons of both patent protection and intellectual status. In any event, though film historian David Robinson claims that [...] "the cylinder experiments {{seem to have been}} carried on to the bitter end" [...] (meaning the final months of 1890), as far back as September 1889—while Edison was still in Europe, but corresponding regularly with Dickson—the lab definitely placed its first order with the Eastman company for <b>roll</b> <b>film.</b> Three more orders for <b>roll</b> <b>film</b> were placed over the next five months.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{flexible}} photographic <b>roll</b> <b>film</b> was marketed by George Eastman in 1885, {{but this}} original [...] "film" [...] {{was actually a}} coating on a paper base. As part of the processing, the image-bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support. The first transparent plastic <b>roll</b> <b>film</b> followed in 1889. It was made from highly flammable nitrocellulose ("celluloid"), now usually called [...] "nitrate film".|$|E

2500|$|Photographic {{film is a}} {{sheet of}} {{material}} coated with a photosensitive emulsion. When the emulsion is sufficiently exposed to light {{or other forms of}} electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays and is developed it forms an image. George Eastman and his company, Eastman Kodak, invented the first flexible photographic film as well as the invention of <b>roll</b> <b>film</b> in 1885. This original [...] "film" [...] used a paper carrier. The first transparent plastic film was produced in 1889. Before this, glass photographic plates were used, which were far more expensive and cumbersome, although of better quality due to their size. Early film was made from flammable nitrocellulose with camphor as a plasticizer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{outline design}} of the F24 camera {{was carried out by}} the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, and it was {{introduced}} in 1925. Detailed design, and most production, was by Williamson Manufacturing Company Ltd of Willesden Green, London NW.10. The F24 was designed to be lighter and smaller than the F8 camera of 1919, but the F8 continued to be used in less demanding installations. The main component units of the F24 are a body with roller blind focal plane shutter, gearbox, film magazine, and lens cone. Image film format is 5"×5", on 5" [...] wide <b>roll</b> <b>film,</b> with magazine capacity up to 250 exposures (the F8 offered images up to 8"×7.5" [...] on 9" [...] wide film).
