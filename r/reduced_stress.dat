25|$|Glucocorticoids are {{released}} by the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress, of which cortisol is the most prominent in humans. Results in adults suggest that reduced levels of cortisol, linked to lower fear or a <b>reduced</b> <b>stress</b> response, {{can be associated with}} more aggression. However, it may be that proactive aggression is associated with low cortisol levels while reactive aggression may be accompanied by elevated levels. Differences in assessments of cortisol may also explain a diversity of results, particularly in children.|$|E
25|$|Smokers often {{report that}} {{cigarettes}} help relieve feelings of stress. However, the stress levels of adult smokers are {{slightly higher than}} those of nonsmokers. Adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking, and smoking cessation leads to <b>reduced</b> <b>stress.</b> Far from acting as an aid for mood control, nicotine dependency seems to exacerbate stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Thus, the apparent relaxant effect of smoking only reflects the reversal of the tension and irritability that develop during nicotine depletion. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal.|$|E
25|$|Absorbent {{underwear}}: Absorbent underwear or diapers {{can reduce}} embarrassment for bedwetters and make cleanup easier for caregivers. These products {{are known as}} training pants or diapers when used for younger children, and as absorbent underwear or incontinence briefs when marketed for older children and adults. Some brands of diaper are marketed especially for people with bedwetting. A major benefit is the <b>reduced</b> <b>stress</b> on both the bedwetter and caregivers. Absorbent underwear can be especially beneficial for bedwetting children wishing to attend sleepovers or campouts, reducing emotional problems caused by social isolation and/or embarrassment in front of peers. Extended diaper usage may interfere with learning to stay dry at night, at least in adults with severe disabilities.|$|E

25|$|The Mantram Handbook was {{the primary}} {{instructional}} text in several research studies on mantram repetition conducted through the Veterans Administration in San Diego, California, by Jill Bormann and her colleagues. Randomized trials that she led have reported benefits from mantram repetition that include higher quality of life, increased use of positive strategies of coping with stress, gains in faith/assurance and spiritual connectedness, and reductions in psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and anger. Additional research findings offered evidence linking mantram use with <b>reduced</b> <b>stress,</b> anxiety, anger, and PTSD symptoms, as well as increased {{quality of life and}} spiritual well-being, and documenting that study participants found mantram repetition useful for managing stress, emotions, sleep/insomnia, and unwanted thoughts. The Mantram Handbook was also cited as a main source in developing a mantram-centered intervention for nurses in Korea. The intervention was found to reduce burnout, and to enhance well-being, spiritual integrity, and leadership practice.|$|E

Upon entering the studio, the album already had its title, {{derived from a}} lyric in the song [...] "Just Barely Breathing." [...] The band members all had jobs and some were going to school during the recording of the album, so each member came in for short periods as they had time available. Stroetzel said this was helpful, as it <b>reduced</b> <b>stress,</b> but regretted {{that they were not}} able to get more done in one session. A problem that D'Antonio, Dutkiewicz, and Stroetzel encountered was keeping their guitars in tune during the sessions. They spent a large amount of the recording budget buying new guitars to improve the tuning. Since the recording of Alive or Just Breathing, they have learned how to keep in tune better as they record.|$|E
