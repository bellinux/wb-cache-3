For this purpose, the stools positive by ICT were cultured according to 3 different protocols: Karmali agar, Preston enrichment broth subcultured on Karmali agar, and a filtration method on a blood agar without antibiotics, all incubated for 7 days at 37 °C. Out of 609 stools from adults and children with community acquired enteritis, the reference methods detected 25 positive cases (4. 1 %) (culture: 19, specific PCR and ELISA both positive: 6) and the ICT: 31 including the 25 true positives.

Methods: The study consisted of 62 patients with NSTE-ACS. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) values were measured at arrival. Myoglobin and H-FABP were obtained if cTnI level was found to be elevated. A control group included 20 subjects with normal cTnI and CK-MB values. H-FABP was determined by a <b>rapid</b> qualitative <b>immunochromatographic</b> <b>test.</b> Patients were classified as MMD-ACS group if they had abnormal cTnI and normal CK-MB (n= 24) and as NSTEMI-ACS group if they had elevated both cTnI and CK-MB (n= 38). The diagnostic accuracy of H-FABP for minor myocardial damage was determined using ROC analysis. Results: The sensitivity of the H-FABP was significantly higher for NSTEMI-ACS than for MMD-ACS (44. 7 % vs 0 %, p 3 -fold increase in cTnI than those with < 3 -fold increase in cTnI (46. 8 % vs. 6. 7 %, p< 0. 001).

The inclusion of rapid antigen detection techniques increased the percentage of diagnosis to 54. 2 %, which represents a total increase of 17. 8 % (P= 0. 034). ConclusionsThe data obtained in this study indicate that rapid urine antigen tests are very useful to determine CAP etiology in adults and, consequently, to quickly identify a group of patients in whom narrow spectrum antibiotics may be used...|$|E
40|$|A <b>rapid</b> IgM-detection <b>immunochromatographic</b> <b>test</b> (WITNESS® Lepto, Zoetis) has {{recently}} become available to identify acute canine leptospirosis {{at the point}} of care. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test were evaluated by comparison with the microscopic agglutination assay (MAT), using a positive cut-off titer of ≥ 800. Banked serum samples from dogs exhibiting clinical signs and suspected leptospirosis were selected to form three groups based on MAT titer: (1) positive (n= 50); (2) borderline (n= 35); and (3) negative (n= 50). Using an analysis to weight group sizes to reflect French prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity were 98 % and 93. 5 % (88. 2 % unweighted), respectively. This test rapidly identifies cases of acute canine leptospirosis with high levels of sensitivity and specificity with no interference from previous vaccination...|$|R
50|$|The ICT antigen card test {{is widely}} used in the {{diagnosis}} of W. bancrofti, but commercial antigens of B. malayi have not been historically widely available. However, new research developments have identified a recombinant antigen (BmR1) that is both specific and sensitive in the detection of IgG4 antibodies against B. malayi and B. timori in ELISA and <b>immunochromatographic</b> <b>rapid</b> dipstick (Brugia Rapid) test. However, it appears that immunoreactivity to this antigen is variable in individuals infected with other filarial nematodes. This research {{has led to the}} development of two new <b>rapid</b> <b>immunochromatographic</b> IgG4 cassette <b>tests</b> - WB rapid and panLF rapid - which detect bancroftian filariasis and all three species of lymphatic filariasis, respectively, with high sensitivity and selectivity.|$|R
40|$|Background: Current {{guidelines}} recommend non-invasive {{testing and}} treatment of young dyspeptic patients without alarm symptoms. Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of a new <b>rapid</b> <b>immunochromatographic</b> stool <b>test</b> to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection before and after treatment compared with a gold standard. Methods: Prospective, single-blind study, performed in a tertiary care hospital. A total of 303 consecutive dyspeptic patients underwent endoscopy with multiple biopsies. Infected patients were offered a treatment and invited to come back 4 - 6 weeks {{after the end of}} therapy to repeat the endoscopy. Patients were also asked to provide a stool sample before and after therapy. Results: About 149 patients were H. pylori infected. The sensitivity and specificity before treatment were 91. 3 and 93. 5 %; after treatment 92 and 100 %. The likelihood ratios were robust enough to produce significant changes from pretest to post-test probability both in pretreatment (LR+ = 14, LR- = 0. 093) and post-treatment (LR+ = 19. 6, LR- = 0. 095). Conclusions: The novel <b>immunochromatographic</b> stool <b>test</b> is fast, easy to perform and provides good differentiation between positive and negative results. It might become a rapid near patients test easily performed in the doctor office...|$|R
