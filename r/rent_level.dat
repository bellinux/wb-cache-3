50|$|The average {{decrease}} of population between 2009 and 2012 was -0.05% p.a, whereas {{the population in}} bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Gotha. It occurred after reunification {{for a short time}} in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas are situated within the administrative city borders. During the 1990s and the early 2000s, many inhabitants left Gotha to search for a better life in west Germany or other major east German cities like Jena or Erfurt. Since 2005, emigration is not a big issue anymore. Today, the birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because immigration is nott sufficient to compensate for it in all the recent years. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 9% (according to the 2011 EU census). A side effect of the high vacancy rate is Gotha's low <b>rent</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{what are}} the {{residential}} rent determinants in Helsinki and how {{the impact of the}} housing attributes differs between districts, questions that interest many parties, such as investors, of the real estate market. The study focuses on new rental agreements of rental apartments for which there are no restrictions with regard to their rent levels. These kinds of rental dwellings are most strongly linked to the owner-occupied housing market as well as the financial market. The rentable area, age and location of a flat have the greatest effects on the rents of market based rental apartments in Helsinki, according to the estimated models. Rent levels decrease exponentially as the rentable area increases, while the flat's age decreases the <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> most when considering flats of the age of 30 and substantially over 90 years olds. In addition, a sauna increases <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> by approximately 5 percent, and rental flats located in non-subsidized buildings also have circa 4 - 5 percent higher rents compared to flats located in interest subsidized buildings in Helsinki. Furthermore, new apartments have a premium in the <b>rent</b> <b>level.</b> The floor level also increases <b>rent</b> <b>level.</b> However, the neighbourhood and locational characteristics also play important roles in determining the <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> of rental apartments. Distance to the CBD decreases housing rents as the distance increases, in ceteris paribus. Apartments located in the proximity of a metro or train station have lower rent levels than dwellings located within a circa 1 - 2 kilometre distance from the nearest station - thus the impact of the station on the <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> is rather quadratic than linear. Distance to a highway, main road and seashore also impact the residential rents. Furthermore, the image of the district reflects either positively or negatively on rent levels in Helsinki. Nevertheless, the effects of the attributes vary across Helsinki, indicating spatial heterogeneity of the parameters. For example, a flat's age has a different impact on the flat's <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> between the major districts of Helsinki. The effect in the Southeastern Major District of Helsinki is not as large compared to the Northeastern Major District. Moreover, the rent premium of new flats is strongest in the southeastern areas of Helsinki. In addition to spatial heterogeneity, spatial autocorrelation is also strongly involved in housing rents due to clustered apartments in same buildings and same areas. In consequence, the traditional OLS models produce biased estimates due to the spatial effects while the spatial models outperform the OLS models in terms of AIC and Likelihood ratio test statistics as well as when the goodness-of-fit between the models is compared. However, the spatial models do not describe the <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> variation correctly either since there are several unobserved housing characteristics that the models do not take into account but which still {{have an effect on the}} rent levels. Moreover, one has to take into account the representativeness of the data used in estimation when inferring and applying the results. Therefore, the estimated models have some shortcomings when they are applied, for example, in <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> evaluation across Helsinki...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{increase}} in transportation costs impacts {{the welfare of}} households living {{on the outskirts of}} the city more than the other inhabitants and, in the short term, limited housing supply stops them from moving toward the center. Over a longer period, however, urban adjustments cancel out this inequality: (1) in the center, <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> rises because of higher demand, inducing investment in additional housing and increasing city density; (2) on the outskirts, housing demand decreases until <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> decreases and compensates for higher transportation expenditures. Inertia in housing supply and household re-locations leads, therefore, to the development of spatial inequalities. To investigate this issue, we built a dynamic model that reproduces urban transitions in monocentric cities, and enables quantifying in continuous time their spatialized consequences. Applied to the implementation of a transportation tax, the model suggests that a rapid implementation would induce (i) higher welfare losses than can be inferred from traditional models and (ii) major redistributive effects throughout the city. Finally, the model suggests that an early and progressive implementation is to be preferred to late and aggressive action. These results challenge current assessment methods of climate change stabilization strategies and show that it is essential to take into account urban dynamics and inequalities in the design of climate policy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Privatization {{refers to}} the shift of {{ownership}} of a property or service from the public sector to the private sector. It has often {{been used as a}} technique to increase the efficiency, release the costs of operations and generate income from selling off the assets. Privatizing the public properties will affect the society in different ways, both positively and negatively. There are many examples of privatization of public properties around the globe and in Hong Kong. For people in Hong Kong, privatizing the commercial properties of Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) by The Link Real Estate Investment Trust (The Link REIT) in November 2005 would be the latest and most well-known example of privatization of public properties and the case will be further studied in this research in order to find out the effects on the society which are caused by the privatization of public properties. The properties which are now owned by The Link REIT are divided into three groups according to their size, and one shopping centres will be picked randomly from each group. The nearest HKHA shopping centres to the three selected The Link REIT shopping centres will be picked as comparisons. Questionnaire, interviews and goods prices comparisons will take places in those shopping centres. Findings from the research have proved that there are different impacts on the shoppers and tenants of the privatized shopping centres when comparing to those shopping centres still owned by HKHA. Some of the differences are positive while some are negative. These differences mainly occur on the environment, property management, <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> and prices level. As expected, the management of The Link REIT shopping centres has better comment but the shoppers and tenants are not pleased with the prices level and <b>rent</b> <b>level.</b> On the other hand, the financial status of HKHA before and after The Link REIT's privatization has also been studied in this research and it proves that selling off the commercial properties to The Link REIT did help HK. HA to overcome the financial difficulty. It is believed that the negative impacts are the "side effect" of privatization which could not be really eliminated, but should be able to mitigate. Hence, several recommendations have been made which are mainly about improving the public relations between The Link REIT and the public as well as the way the company adjusts the <b>rent</b> <b>level.</b> iipublished_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been a clear trend {{regarding}} demand for office space in the central business district, CDB. The <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> is far greater there than in any other area, and vacancy is very low compared to other submarkets. People tend to prefer greater office location over salary and the office location works as a status symbol. Over {{the past few}} years companies have started to rearrange their offices, both interior wise and location wise. Some larger firms have moved their headquarters and offices from the central to prime suburbs, and many more are following this strategy. This study examines, by comparing different sub markets in Stockholm with similar submarkets in Boston, how the commercial real estate market in Stockholm will develop and what movements to expect in the office market. Are Stockholm’s sub markets following the Boston sub markets footsteps? Stockholm is growing rapidly both economically and population wise. Access to land in the city is limited and the boundaries of the inner city are pushed outwards. To the meet the demand in the inner city a common trend {{the past few years}} has been to reconstruct and convert office space to housing. Former industrial premises that earlier where converted to offices are now reconstructed as housing. Another trend has been to exploit and develop new areas outside the city to meet today’s demand. Problems occur when the majority of offices operate within the city, pushing the demand for transportation and increasing the density of 2 commuting. Since the commuting hours are becoming greater the demand for adjacent work places and offices may increase. The purpose of this master thesis is to investigate how the trends for office locations in Stockholm may change. In addition to that a comparison to the office market in Boston will be made. The areas that are defined in the study are Solna, Sundbyberg and Stockholm City in Sweden and Cambridge, Seaport and Downtown in Boston, USA. Every office market and sub market is unique in many ways which always needs to be {{in the back of the}} head of the reader when looking at this report. Boston and Stockholm are both premier cities when it comes to center of education and being a hub for tech start-ups and financial giants and are both following the general ups and downs of the economy.

Regarding the <b>rent</b> <b>level,</b> Solna and Sundbyberg will, unlike Cambridge and Seaport, most likely not exceed the <b>rent</b> <b>level</b> in CBD and also not fall below in vacancy rate.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the impacts environmentally certified office space in Sweden might have on office employees’ assessed health, productivity and image and also to reflect if any positive effects justify a higher <b>rent</b> <b>level.</b> The empirical part of the study implements a quantitative method consisting of twelve questions in a survey. These questions were distributed by e-mail to contact persons of companies working in LEEDcertified office buildings. 84 office workers from at least four different companies responded to the survey. The chapter frame of reference contains material which will not be subject to the empirical survey but that is still deemed necessary for the context of the study and when fulfilling the purpose. The theory chapter covers previous work in the area and represents the bank of information which is to be analyzed against our empirical results. The result of the empirical survey shows a marginal improvement of assessed productivity. It also indicates that environmentally certified office space has no positive impact on sick leave. Regarding the image aspects of the survey our results show that environmental certification has different effects on the different types of image that the company emits. In the conclusions, we state that the assessed benefits found in the results are marginal and that they alone do not warrant a higher <b>rent</b> <b>level.</b> It is probable that other incentives, than those included in this study, exist and that they together with improved health, productivity and image justify a rental premium for environmentally certified office space. A possible incentive might be the fact that environmentally certified office space often tend to be newer and more modern in comparison with non-certified office space. ...|$|E
