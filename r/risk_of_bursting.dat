30|$|Once zones at {{elevated}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursts</b> are identified, {{the next}} step is to determine appropriate control techniques to employ within each one.

2500|$|Skip {{breathing}} is a controversial technique to conserve breathing gas when using open-circuit scuba, {{which consists of}} briefly holding one's breath between inhalation and exhalation (i.e., [...] "skipping" [...] a breath). It leads to CO2 not being exhaled efficiently. There is also an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>burst</b> lung (pulmonary barotrauma of ascent) if the breath is held while ascending. [...] It is particularly counterproductive with a rebreather, where the act of breathing pumps the gas around the [...] "loop", pushing carbon dioxide through the scrubber and mixing freshly injected oxygen.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} constant conductance {{heat pipes}} (CCHPs) currently used on most spacecraft run the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> the pipe when the working fluid is frozen and later thawed. One method to avoid pipe bursting {{is to use}} a gas-charged heat pipe (GCHP) that can sustain repeated freeze/thaw cycles. The construction of the GCHP {{is similar to that of}} the traditional CCHP except that a small amount of non-condensable gas (NCG) is introduced and a small length is added to the CCHP condenser to serve as the NCG reservoir. During the normal operation, the NCG is mostly confined to the reservoir, and the GCHP functions as a passive variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP). When the liquid begins to freeze in the condenser section, the NCG will expand to fill the central core of the heat pipe, and ice will be formed only in the grooves located on the inner surface of the heat pipe in a controlled fashion. The ice will not bridge the diameter of the heat pipe, thus avoiding the risk of pipe bursting during freeze/thaw cycles. A GCHP using ammonia as the working fluid was fabricated and then tested inside a thermal vacuum chamber. The GCHP demonstrated a heat transport capability of more than 200 W at 298 K as designed. Twenty-seven freeze/thaw cycles were conducted under various conditions where the evaporator temperature ranged from 163 K to 253 K and the condenser/reservoir temperatures ranged from 123 K to 173 K. In all tests, the GCHP restarted without any problem with heat loads between 10 W and 100 W. No performance degradation was noticed after 27 freeze/thaw cycles. The ability of the GCHP to sustain repeated freeze/thaw cycles was thus successfully demonstrated...|$|E

30|$|Managing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coal <b>bursts</b> {{begins with}} an {{evaluation}} of the factors that increase the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>bursts.</b> These include the depth of cover, the presence of past mining above or below, the roof and floor geology, and the presence of faults and other geologic factors. A past history <b>of</b> <b>bursts</b> is one <b>of</b> the most powerful indicators <b>of</b> <b>burst</b> <b>risk</b> during any type <b>of</b> mining. Major <b>bursts</b> have often been preceded by smaller ones. Often these “precursors” have occurred at the same stage in the mining process as the subsequent large event (for example, in the same location on the longwall face). Also, once a mine has experienced bursts, later situations with similar geology and mining methods should also be considered high risk.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRock <b>burst</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the coal}} and rock {{dynamical}} disasters {{that must be}} kept in mind in mining activities. With the increase of mining depth, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> rock <b>burst</b> becomes increasingly great. At present, the risk prediction for rock burst mostly is still in the stage of simple statistical study and single factor forecast, making the prediction precision be not a desired one. Using the knowledge of fuzzy mathematics and neural network, we propose a fuzzy neural network risk prediction model for rock burst trained with the improved BP algorithm based on the typical rock burst data. This method is an improvement of comprehensive index judgment and multi-index judgment with fuzzy mathematics. Practical engineering applications in Sanhejian Coal Mines indicate that this method is not only precise and simple, but also intelligent, with the predicted results well agreeing with the practical conditions. Therefore, this method {{can be applied to the}} relevant engineering projects with satisfactory results...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a disease}} in which low bone mass and microarchitectural {{deterioration}} of bone tissue lead to enhanced bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Due to the complex anatomy of the vertebral body, the difficulties associated with obtaining bones for in vitro experiments, and the limitations on {{the control of the}} experimental parameters, finite element models have been developed to analyze the biomechanical properties of the vertebral body. We developed finite element models of the L 2 vertebra, which consisted of the endplates, the trabecular lattice, and the cortical shell, for three age-related grades (young, middle, and old) of osteoporosis. The compressive strength and stiffness results revealed that we had developed a valid model that was consistent with the results of previous experimental and computational studies. The von-Mises stress, which was assumed to predict the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a <b>burst</b> fracture, was also determined for the three age groups. The results showed that the von-Mises stress was substantially higher under relatively high levels of compressive loading, which suggests that patients with osteoporosis should be cautious <b>of</b> fracture <b>risk</b> even during daily activities...|$|R
40|$|Fault slip burst is {{a serious}} dynamic hazard in coal mining. A static and dynamic {{analysis}} for fault slip was performed to assess the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> rock <b>burst.</b> A numerical model FLAC 3 D was established to understand the stress state and mechanical responses of fault rock system. The results obtained from the analysis show that the dynamic behavior of fault slip induced by stress waves is significantly affected by mining depth, as well as dynamic disturbance intensity and {{the distance between the}} stope and the fault. The isolation effect of the fault is also discussed based on the numerical results with the fault angle appearing to have the strongest influence on peak vertical stress and velocity induced by dynamic disturbance. By taking these risks into account, a stress-relief technology using break-tip blast was used for fault slip burst control. This technique is able to reduce the stress concentration and increase the attenuation of dynamic load by fracturing the structure of coal and rock. The adoption of this stress-relief method leads to an effective reduction of fault slip induced rock burst (FSIRB) occurrence...|$|R

40|$|The MECTUB {{code was}} {{developed}} to evaluate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> swelling and <b>bursting</b> <b>of</b> Steam Generator (SG) tubes. This code deals with the physic of intermediate steam-water leaks into sodium which induce a Sodium-Water Reaction (SWR). It {{is based on a}} one-dimensional calculation to describe the thermomechanical behavior of tubes under a high internal pressure and a fast external overheating. The mechanical model of MECTUB is strongly correlated with the kind of the material of the SG tubes. It has been developed and validated by using experiments performed on the alloy 800. A change to tubes made of Modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel requires more knowledge of Modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel behavior which influences the bursting time at high temperatures (up to 1200 °C). Studies have been initiated to adapt the mechanical model and to qualify it for this material. The first part of this paper focuses on the mechanical law modelling (elasticity, plasticity, and creep) for Modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel and on overheating thermal data. In a second part, the results <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> tests performed on Modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo tubes in the SQUAT facility of CEA are used to validate the mechanical model of MECTUB for the Modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo material...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe solid {{dispersion}} method was originally {{used to improve}} the dissolution properties and the bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs by dispersing them into water soluble carriers. In addition to the above, dissolution retardation through {{solid dispersion}} technique using water insoluble and water swellable polymer {{for the development of}} controlled release dosage forms has become a field of interest in recent years. Development of controlled release solid dispersion has a great advantage for bypassing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a <b>burst</b> release <b>of</b> drug; since the structure of the solid dispersion is monolithic where drug molecules homogeneously disperse. Despite the remarkable potential and extensive research being conducted on controlled release solid dispersion system, commercialization and large scale production are limited. The author expects that recent technological advances may overcome the existing limitations and facilitate the commercial utilization of the techniques for manufacture of controlled release solid dispersions. This article begins with an overview of the different carriers being used for the preparation of controlled release solid dispersion and also different techniques being used for the purpose. Kinetics of drug release from these controlled release solid dispersions and the relevant mathematical modeling have also been reviewed in this manuscript...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} sections, which apply dynamic economic models to study different economic issues. The Section Two studies the optimal {{design of the}} Pacific Salmon Treaty, which was signed by the U. S. and Canada in 1999 to share salmon on the Pacific coast. Moral hazard exists because countries may steal from each other. If a country?s observed output is suspiciously too high, the treaty either reduces the country?s future share, or asks the country to make a monetary transfer to its opponent. A calibrated version of our model shows that it is optimal for the U. S. to pay Canada $ 327. 58 million every 30. 68 years. Switching to the optimal contract improves the total welfare by 1. 54 %. The Section Three studies Chinese housing market. China?s housing price has been growing steadily over the past decade, {{despite the fact that}} capital return has fallen dramatically. In a rational bubble framework, the fast growth rate of housing price implies a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> housing bubble. We study the impact <b>of</b> bubble <b>burst</b> on China?s economy, where the government?s infrastructure investment, largely funded by land sale, is excessive. Our calibrated model shows that if the bubble bursts in 2017, then in the short run GDP growth rate falls to 2. 3 % due to the hit to the housing sector, but GDP in the long run exceeds that under the bubble because excessive infrastructure investment is no longer sustainable. If the bubble remains, however, implementing property tax will reduce its size and increase long-run output...|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} developed and presented stochastic simulation platform ('ENVIRONMENT' [12, 25]), which extends Gillespie's algorithm for chemically reacting, fixed-volume, homogeneous systems to volume-changing and globally heterogeneous conditions, {{is applied to}} investigate the dynamic behaviour of self-(re-) producing vesicles whose membrane consists of both lipids and small peptides. We claim that {{it is through the}} integration of these two types of relatively simple -and prebiotically plausible- components that protocells could start their development into functional supramolecular structures, allowing the formation of increasingly complex reaction networks in their internal aqueous milieu. The model is not spatially explicit, but takes into account quite realistically volume-surface constraints, osmotic pressure, diffusion/transport processes, structural elasticity. In this framework the time evolution of non-equilibrium proto-metabolic cellular systems is studied, paying special attention to the capacity of the system to get rid of its waste material, which proved critical for balanced cell growth (avoiding the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> an osmotic <b>burst).</b> We also investigate the effects of including an explicit feedback mechanism in the system: the case in which waste transport mediated by peptide chains takes place only under osmotic stress conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the massive {{property}} bubbles that have been bursting in the USA, Spain and Ireland during the last decade, {{the aim of this}} thesis is to clarify whether – or to what degree - the municipality of Stockholm might experience a property bubble in the near future. The municipality of Stockholm is undergoing a housing shortage and house prices have risen during the last few years. Neoliberalism and property bubbles are used as a theoretical framework in this paper. The methodology consist of semi structured interviews, analysis of documents and statistical data from Eurostat, Valueguard and the Swedish administrative authority; Statistiska centralbyrån (SCB). The house market of Stockholm municipality has since 1990 been influenced by neoliberal ideologies. The state of Sweden has eliminated house subvention and interest contribution during the government of the liberal parties. Rented apartments have been converted to co-operative apartments as they generate a higher value, but they also claim a higher economic strength by its speculators. Special design program for new house constructions is another turn to neoliberal ideology by the municipalities. They desire to build outstanding top projects to generate more attractive areas. The result however, demonstrates that there is no existing <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a <b>bursting</b> property bubble in the municipality of Stockholm. Even if {{there is a lack of}} housing, there are more dwellings than we think. There must be mobility in the existing stock of dwellings. Political regulations, as capital gains tax, discourage this mobility. Together with the increase in population and a shortage of new house constructions, the house prices have risen. The reason for the property bubble not existing mostly depends on three factors; fundamental values that explain the increasing house prices; persons with high mortgage loan also have high income; Sweden has no tradition of seeing dwellings as a speculative resource...|$|R
