5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which may <b>result</b> <b>in</b> its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E

5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> myxedema and severe cases can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Another {{disorder}} {{is that of}} thyroid dysgenesis which can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> various presentations {{of one or more}} misplaced accessory thyroid glands. These can be asymptomatic.|$|E
5|$|As 91 {{votes are}} needed to elect the Governor from the 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> his winning 93–87.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will <b>result</b> <b>in</b> smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will <b>result</b> <b>in</b> slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E
