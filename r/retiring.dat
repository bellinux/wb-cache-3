Hypotheses about the factors that constitute the contribution by <b>retired</b> to the overall inequality in health were tested (the share of the population being <b>retired,</b> the health of <b>retired,</b> and the income of <b>retired).</b> We used data from the European Household Panel and SHARE and found that all three factors contribute to the high contribution by <b>retired</b> to the overall inequality index particularly from Denmark. The contribution was most remarkable for the oldest age group among <b>retired,</b> which is explained by the fact that the group of younger <b>retired</b> has better coverage through labour market related pensions in supplement to the universal public pension scheme.
