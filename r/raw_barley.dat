Antioxidative properties were investigated using methyl linoleate model system, by assessing the DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity and metal chelating activity. The results were compared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). <b>Raw</b> <b>barley</b> and buckwheat groats extracts showed higher DPPH scavenging ability com-pared to boiled barley and buckwheat groats extracts. <b>Raw</b> <b>barley</b> groats extract exhibited higher antioxidant activity than boiled groats extract in the methyl linoleate emulsion. Higher chelating ability in relation to Fe (II) ions was observed for boiled groats extracts as compared to raw groats extracts. BHT showed small antiradical activity and metal chelating activity, while showing higher antioxidative activity in emulsion sys-tem. The analysis of groats extracts using HPLC method showed the presence of rutin, catechin, quercetin, gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, o-coumaric, vanillic, sinapic, and ferulic acids. Differences in the content of dietary fiber and its fractions were observed in the examined products. The highest total dietary fiber content was detected in boiled buckwheat groats, while the lowest- in boiled barley groats.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Amines {{formed by}} {{biosynthesis}} in germinated barley {{have been suggested}} as precursors for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in barley malt dried by direct-fired kilning. This hypothesis was verified by germinating <b>raw</b> <b>barley</b> and exposing the resulting malt roots and clean malt to nitrous acid. Quantitation of the NDMA formed indicated that malt roots contained relatively large amounts of NDMA precursor which {{could only have been}} formed as a result of germination. The clean malt also contained NDMA precursor, but the amount of precursor in clean malt was only slightly higher than the level of precursor already present in <b>raw</b> <b>barley.</b> The two tertiary amine alkaloids, hordenine and gramine, which are biosynthesized in malt during germination were subjected to nitrosation. Nitrosation of both amines at 65 ° (pH 4. 4 or pH 6. 4) resulted in NDMA formation. Gramine was highly susceptible to nitrosation to yield NDMA. At 24 ° in dilute acetic acid (pH 3. 4), the initial rate of nitrosation of gramine to yield NDMA was nearly equal to the initial rate of NDMA formation from dimethylamine. The ratio of initial rates of formation of NDMA from gramine and trimethylamine was 6250 : 1. At 23 °, the ratio of initial rates of formation of NDMA from gramine and hordenine was 5200 : 1. N-Methyltyramine and N-methyl-S-aminomethylindole, the immediate biosynthetic precursors of hordenine and gramine, were synthesized. Nitrosation of N-methyltyramine yielded p-hydroxy-N-nitroso-N-methyl- 2 -phenylethylamine as the major reaction product and p-hydroxy-m-nitro- N-nitroso-N-methyl- 2 -phenylethylamine as the minor product. Nitrosation of N-methyl- 3 -aminomethylindole yielded N-nitroso-N-methyl- 3 - aminomethylindole as the minor reaction product; the major product was a dinitroso compound identified as N¹-nitroso-N-nitroso-N-methyl- 3 - aminomethylindole. Investigation of the products of hordenine nitrosation at 65 ° (pH 4. 4) indicated the formation of NDMA and p-hydroxy-m-nitro-N-nitroso- N-methyl- 2 -phenylethyl amine; p-hydroxy-N-nitroso-N-methyl- 2 - phenylethylamine was not observed as a product of hordenine nitrosation at 65 °. NDMA appeared to be the major nitrosamine formed from hordenine. The rapid reaction of gramine with nitrous acid and investigation of the gramine nitrosation reaction products both indicated that gramine did not undergo nitrosation by the expected mechanism of nitrosative dealkylation. A new mechanism is proposed to explain the rapid reaction of gramine with nitrous acid and to account for the fact that NDMA was the only N-nitrosamine formed during the nitrosation of gramine...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The malt {{alkaloids}} N-methyltyramine, N,N-dimethyltyramine (hordenine), N-methyl- 3 -aminomethylindole and N,N-dimethyl- 3 -aminomethylindole (gramine) {{are known}} precursors for N-nitrosamines. Analytical procedures were developed {{and applied to}} extract and quantify these alkaloids from malt, green malt, malt roots, and <b>raw</b> <b>barley.</b> A ground malt sample under nitrogen atmosphere was extracted with 5 percent concentrated ammonium hydroxide in methanol {{at room temperature for}} 24 hours. After purification, the extracted alkaloids were quantitated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using both phosphate buffer and ion-pairing solvent systems. The recoveries obtained for the alkaloids listed were, respectively, 77. 4, 92. 0, 74. 0 and 80. 5 percent with detection limit of 0. 2, 0. 2, 0. 1 and 0. 1 μg/gm. Conformation of identity of each alkaloid was accomplished by TLC, UV, and MS. Twenty-three samples of kilned malts, five samples of green malts, ten samples of kilned malt roots, five samples of green malt roots, and ten <b>raw</b> <b>barley</b> samples, from a total of 11 varieties of Hordeum vulgare were analyzed for the alkaloids of interest. N-Methyltyramine was found in every sample from all sources with a mean and range, respectively, of 26. 8 (15. 7 - 48. 5), 21. 4 (11. 6 - 37. 5), 1959. 8 (1358. 4 - 2798. 4), 1532. 5 (962. 3 - 2091. 1) and 4. 7 μg/gm (0. 4 - 17. 9 μg/gm) on a dry weight basis. The means and ranges for hordenine were, respectively, 28. 1 (8. 9 - 42. 4), 21. 2 (9. 6 - 35. 5), 4066. 4 (2741. 2 - 5180. 1), 3363. 3 (1956. 2 - 4744. 3) and 0. 7 μg/gm (0. 5 - 1. 0 μg/gm). Gramine was found in only two barley malt varieties examined where kilned and green malts contained, respectively, mean values and ranges of 7. 4 (4. 9 - 10. 0) and 6. 0 μg/gm (4. 7 - 7. 3 μg/gm). N-Methyl- 3 -aminomethylindole was not detected in any of the samples examined. The results of this investigation indicated that the variety of barley affected alkaloid production during malting. The results also showed that the kilning step of the malting process increased the total amount of each alkaloid produced. Finally, room temperature nitrosation of five varieties of kilned and green malts, in which the contents of hordenine and gramine were known, was carried out with an excess of nitrite in acetic acid at pH 3. 2 for 18 hours. The amounts of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) obtained from this nitrosation were far greater than the expected yields for NDMA from the hordenine and gramine present in the malts. The results strongly suggest that the alkaloids hordenine and gramine were not the only precursors for NDMA and that there must be additional precursors; dimethylamine was suggested as a possibility...|$|E

We then examined their spatial and temporal expression patterns by immunostaining and qPCR. Two CKX-specific antibodies, anti-HvCKX 1 and anti-HvCKX 9, predominantly detect proteins in the aleurone layer of maturing grains and leaf vasculature, respectively. In addition, two selected CKX genes were used for stable, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of the barley cultivar Golden Promise. The results show that constitutive overexpression of CKX causes morphological changes in barley plants and prevents their transition to flowering. In all independent transgenic lines roots proliferated more rapidly and root-to-shoot ratios were higher than in wild-type plants. Only one transgenic line, overexpressing CKX under the control of a promoter from a phosphate transporter gene, which is expressed more strongly in root tissue than in aerial parts, yielded progeny.

After the opening, the beverage becomes supersaturated due to the drop of pressure. A loss of gas is thermodynamically favored and occurs via two processes; by diffusion and by bubble formation. The last one required nucleation sites. Two types of gushing are defined. Primary gushing is related to the use of contaminated <b>raw</b> materials (<b>barley,</b> malt,…) and secondary gushing to technical and technological problems (crystals). With bad weather conditions, barley crops are contaminated by filamentous fungi such as Fusarium sp., Aspergillus sp [...] Those are known to produce hydrophobins. 40 years ago, the hydrophobin cerato-ulmin was considered as a primary wilt toxin. Studies in 1995 - 1997 indicated that this hypothesis was incorrect. It is now admitted that the presence of cerato-ulmin gives a selective advantage to the pathogen due to confering resistance to dessication. Hydrophobins are amphiphilic (both hydrophilic and hydrophobic) proteins that are able to self-assemble at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, are recognized as primary gushing inducers but can be used in aerated food products too. When barley or malt contaminating by hydrophobins are used to produce beer, the production shows primary gushing.

40|$|Barley straw, an {{agricultural}} byproduct, {{was identified as}} a potential adsorbent material for wastewater treatment as it offers various advantages such as abundant availability at no or very low cost, little processing cost and ability to biodegradation. The <b>raw</b> <b>barley</b> straw, however, needs to be modified as a preliminary study showed less favorability of the <b>raw</b> <b>barley</b> straw in removing oil and anionic dyes. Barley straw was chemically pretreated with sodium hydroxide and modified using a cationic surfactant, hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate (CPC). Generally, the treatment with NaOH increases the negatively charged sites on straw surface and the cationic surfactant introduced forms a hydrophobic layer on the straw surface and changes the surface potential charge from negative to positive. From this exercise, four different adsorbents have been prepared, viz; <b>raw</b> <b>barley</b> straw (RBS), <b>raw</b> <b>barley</b> straw pretreated with sodium hydroxide (RBS-N), and the modification of RBS and RBS-N with the cationic surfactant CPC, which were labelled as surfactant modified barley straw (SMBS) and base pretreated surfactant modified barley straw (BMBS). Several physical and chemical techniques were employed to characterize barley straw samples to understand the properties of raw and modified straws as well as to study the effects of modification on the textural and surface properties of the <b>raw</b> <b>barley</b> straw. Chemical compositional analyses showed that the amounts of potassium, sodium, arsenic and cadmium existing in RBS, RBS-N were generally low. The availability of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in RBS offers the great potential of using the barley straw as a biosorbent material. Surface group measurement by the Boehm titration showed higher acid groups in the base-treated straw (RBS-N) than raw straw due to the base hydrolization of lignocellulosic material, which is responsible for the increase in surface acidic sites such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups. The percentages of carbon and nitrogen for SMBS and BMBS were greater compared to RBS and RBS-N, due to loading of CPC. Based on carbon and nitrogen values, the impregnated CPC on SMBS and BMBS was calculated as 0. 086 and 0. 109 mmol g- 1, respectively. For the surfactant modified straw, lower BET surface area was observed and could be explained by the attachment of the surfactant moieties to the internal framework of raw adsorbents causing the constriction of pore channels. The electrical conductivity was found much lower in surfactant modified straw due to significant reduction in water soluble mineral after the surfactant modification. Higher bulk density of SMBS and BMBS was due to the addition of CPC onto the straw surface. SEM microphotos of all the prepared adsorbents showed the highly irregular shapes and sizes. The treatment with alkaline solution partly removed the protective thin wax on straw surface. The surfactant modified surface appeared to be rough, indicating that the surface had been covered with organic molecules. FT-IR spectra of RBS and RBS-N did not show any radical changes indicating that the treatment with mild base solution did not significantly alter the chemical properties of the straw. Two new bands lying at about 2920, 2850 cm- 1 referred as asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of methylene (C-H) adsorption bands originated from the alkyl chain of CPC were observed on SMBS and BMBS, proving the existence of CPC on straw surface. Desorption of CPC from the surfactant modified straw was observed to increase with increasing acid solution concentration. The increasing desorption of CPC (with increased in acid solution) describes that ion exchange is the major binding mechanism. The sorption of CPC generally showed that the sorption capacity of CPC increases with increasing CPC equilibrium concentration for both RBS and RBS-N. The surfactant sorption was at the maximum when the equilibrium surfactant concentrations reached the critical micelle concentration, CMC. Preliminary experiments found the effectiveness of the prepared adsorbents, namely; RBS, RBS-N, SMBS and BMBS in removing different types of emulsified oil from wastewater such as canola oil (CO) and standard mineral oil (SMO). Comparing to SMBS and BMBS, RBS and RBS-N showed low removal efficiency of the emulsified oil. This provided a sensible justification in using SMBS and BMBS as adsorbent materials. The adsorption tests were performed using SMBS and BMBS on CO and SMO by batch adsorption. For the sorption of CO and SMO on SMBS and BMBS, the adsorption was less favorable at high acidic condition and the maximum adsorption capacity was observed at about neutrality. Larger particle size would result in lower adsorption while adsorption temperature would not affect adsorption significantly. The kinetic study revealed that equilibrium time was short and pseudo first order model provided the best correlation for the kinetic adsorption data of CO and SMO on both SMBS and BMBS. The film diffusion was observed as the rate limiting in the sorption of CO and SMO on SMBS and BMBS. The isotherm data for sorption of CO and SMO on SMBS and BMBS indicated that the adsorption was fitted well by the Langmuir model. The Langmuir adsorption capacities of CO and SMO on SMBS were 576. 00 and 518. 63 mg g- 1; and 613. 29 and 584. 22 mg g- 1 on BMBS, respectively. Desorption experiments also showed the stability of the oil loaded on straw. The adsorbent was later evaluated in a fixed bed column. The breakthrough curves indicated the favorable performance of SMBS and BMBS for both CO and SMO; however, less success was observed for RBS and RBS-N. The modeling of column tests showed a good agreement of experimental data of oil adsorption on SMBS and BMBS with the Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models. The column adsorption capacities from the Thomas model for SMBS and BMBS were 368. 82 and 440. 74 mg g- 1 for CO; and 310. 16 and 336. 31 mg g- 1 for SMO, respectively. The applicability of the prepared adsorbents was also evaluated for treating dye containing wastewater. The adsorption tests were performed using SMBS and BMBS on anionic dyes of Acid Blue 40 (AB 40), Reactive Blue 4 (RB 4) and Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) as the preliminary batch adsorption experiments showed low removal percentage of dyes on RBS and RBS-N. The batch study also revealed that the adsorption was a function of dye concentration, pH and temperature. Adsorption capacity was found higher at pH about neutrality for AB 40, and at acidic condition (pH 3) for the other dyes. Adsorption capacity of AB 40 increased at increasing experimental temperature whereas no significant change was observed for RB 4 and RB 5. The kinetic experiment revealed that adsorption of dyes was rapid at initial stage followed by a slower phase where equilibrium uptake was achieved. Based on batch kinetic study of adsorption of AB 40, RB 4 and RB 5 on SMBS and BMBS, the pseudosecond- order model fitted well with the kinetic data other than the pseudo first order model. The film diffusion was observed as the rate limiting in the sorption of AB 40, RB 4 and RB 5 on SMBS and BMBS. The isotherm data of dye adsorption on SMBS and BMBS indicated that the adsorption was fitted well by the Langmuir model. The Langmuir adsorption capacities of AB 40, RB 4 and RB 5 were 45. 4, 29. 16 and 24. 92 mg g- 1 for SMBS and 51. 95, 31. 50 and 39. 88 mg g- 1 for BMBS, respectively. Desorption experiments also showed that the dye loaded straw was stable at acidic condition but desorption increased as the pH increased (i. e pH 11). The applicability of the adsorbents for AB 40 and RB 5 removal was also tested in a fixed bed column study. Similar to the column system for CO and SMO, the breakthrough curves on RBS and RBS-N was also poor, however, favorable column breakthrough performance was observed on SMBS and BMBS. The column breakthrough modeling showed the better fit of the experimental data of SMBS and BMBS with the Thomas and Yoon-Nelson breakthrough models. The adsorption capacities from the Thomas model for SMBS and BMBS were estimated as 53. 39 and 77. 29 mg g- 1 for AB 40; and 24. 57 and 33. 46 mg g- 1 for RB 5, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Antifungal {{compounds}} {{produced by}} Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) metabolites can be natural and reliable alternative for reducing fungal infections pre- and post-harvest with {{a multitude of}} additional advantages for cereal-base products. Toxigenic and spoilage fungi are responsible for numerous diseases and economic losses. This thesis includes {{an overview of the}} impact fungi have on aspects of the cereal food chain. The applicability of LAB in plant protection and cereal industry is discussed in detail. Specific case studies include Fusarium head blight, and the impact of fungi in the malting and baking industry. The impact of Fusarium culmorum infected <b>raw</b> <b>barley</b> on the final malt quality was part of the investigation. In vitro infected barley grains were fully characterized. The study showed that the germinative energy of infected barley grains decreased by 45 % and grains accumulated 199 μg. kg- 1 of deoxynivalenol (DON). Barley grains were subsequently malted and fully characterized. Fungal biomass increased during all stages of malting. Infected malt accumulated 8 -times its DON concentration during malting. Infected malt grains revealed extreme structural changes due to proteolytic, (hemi) -cellulolytic and starch degrading activity of the fungi, this led to increased friability and fragmentation. Infected grains also had higher protease and β-glucanase activities, lower amylase activity, a greater proportion of free amino and soluble nitrogen, and a lower β-glucan content. Malt loss was over 27 % higher in infected malt when compared to the control. The protein compositional changes and respective enzymatic activity of infected barley and respective malt were characterized using a wide range of methods. F. culmorum infected barley grains showed an increase in proteolytic activity and protein extractability. Several metabolic proteins decreased and increased at different rates during infection and malting, showing a complex F. culmorum infection interdependence. In vitro F. culmorum infected malt was used to produce lager beer to investigate changes caused by the fungi during the brewing processes and their effect on beer quality attributes. It was found, that the wort containing infected malt had a lower pH, a higher FAN, higher β-glucan and a 45 % increase in the purging rate, and led to premature yeast flocculation. The beer produced with infected malt (IB) had also a significantly different amino acid profile. IB flavour characterization revealed a higher concentration of esters, fusel alcohols, fatty acids, ketones, and dimethylsulfide, and in particular, acetaldehyde, when compared to the control. IB had a greater proportion of Strecker aldehydes and Maillard products contributing to an increased beer staling character. IB resulted in a 67 % darker colour with a trend to better foam stability. It was also found that 78 % of the accumulated mycotoxin deoxynivalenol in the malt was transferred into beer. A LAB cell-freesupernatant (cfs), produced in wort-base substrate, was investigated for its ability to inhibit Fusarium growth during malting. Wort was a suitable substrate for LAB exhibiting antifungal activity. Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 19280 inhibited 104 spores. mL- 1 for 7 days, after 120 h of fermentation, while Lactobacillus reuteri R 29 inhibited 105 spores. mL- 1 for 7 days, after 48 h of fermentation. Both LAB cfs had significant different organic acid profiles. Acid-base antifungal compounds were identified and, phenyllactic, hydroxy-phenyllactic, and benzoic acids were present in higher concentrations when compared to the control. A 3 °P wort substrate inoculated With L. reuteri R 29 (cfs) was applied in malting and successfully inhibited Fusarium growth by 23 %, and mycotoxin DON by 80 %. Malt attributes resulted in highly modified grains, lower pH, higher colouration, and higher extract yield. The implementation of selected LAB producing antifungal compounds can be used successfully in the malting process to reduce mould growth and mycotoxin production...|$|E

Talbina was prepared from two barley varieties namely: Giza 126 and Giza 130 by adding whole barley flour to water (1 : 10 w/v) and (1 : 5 w/v) for germinated barley then heating at  80 ° C for 5 minutes with continuous stirring until reaching a porridge like texture. The present investigation {{was carried out}} in an attempt to clearly the nutritional assessment of talbina as a functional food. The study included the determination of gross chemical composition, caloric value, mineral composition, vitamins composition and the amino acids composition. Meanwhile, computation of the chemical scores (CS) and A/E ratios were carried out for <b>raw,</b> germinated <b>barley,</b> talbina, germinated talbina and commercial talbina. The data revealed that protein content of the all raw studied and processing treatments ranged from 8. 75 - 18. 34 g/ 100 g on dry weight basis. Besides, the all treatments recorded rather slight decrease in crude fat content. Likewise, ash and carbohydrates ranged between 2. 29 - 2. 86 and 73. 40 - 82. 66 %, respectively. Whereas crude fiber had an increase after treatments and it ranged from 3. 83 - 4. 37 %. On the other hand by making talbina iron, manganese, copper and zinc increased especially zinc, which recorded higher value than that recommended daily.

40|$|It {{is quite}} clear that in vitro {{experiments}} with pure substrates and highly purified enzyme preparations can {{do no more than}} indicate types of possible action. Therefore, already having a method of isolating a barley 	β -glucosan in a very high degree of purity, means for obtaining enzyme preparations of enhanced purity were sought, and it was hoped, by employing these preparations in the degradation of initially-water-soluble 	β -glucosan, to provide further evidence of the complex nature of the degradative scheme. Included in this approach are attempts to differentially inactivate endo- and exo-	β-glucosanases and cellobiase, and it will be seen that confirmation of an earlier assumption of the mechanism for the degradation of β -glucosan has arisen from this study. Furthermore, chromatographic and ionophoretic analyses of the degradation products of β -glucosan enzymolysis also offer the possibility of deteimining tne manner in which the β - 1, 3 - and (3 - 1, 4 - linkages are distributed within the β-glucosan molecule. With the realisation of the important part played by the β -glucosanases in modification, the opportunity has been taken to show some aspects of the behaviour of endo- and exo-β -glucosanases and cellobiase during the course of commercial maltings. During one such series of investigations the water-soluble and alkalisoluble carbohydrates were isolated and analysed with the intention of obtaining sane indication of the manner in which endospermic cell-walls are broken down. At the same time there was the possibility that an opportunity would arise to support or overthrow the theories that either "cellulase" activity of a barley or its green malt or gum content alone or a combination of both gives an indication of the malting properties of a particular barley.

The purpose is to measure by NIR the "malting quality" (MQ) parameter of barley, to monitor the malting process and to know if {{a certain type of}} barley is suitable for the production of beer and spirits. Moreover, NIR will be applied to monitor the brewing process. 	First of all, it was possible to check the quality of the <b>raw</b> materials like <b>barley,</b> maize and barley malt using a rapid, non-destructive and reliable method, with a low error of prediction. The more interesting result obtained at this level was that the repeatability of the NIR calibration models developed was comparable with the one of the reference method. Moreover, about malt, new kinds of validation were used in order to estimate the real predictive power of the proposed calibration models and to understand the long-term effects. Furthermore, the precision of all the calibration models developed for malt evaluation was estimated and statistically compared with the reference methods, with good results. 	Then, new calibration models were developed for monitoring the malting process, measuring the moisture content and other malt quality parameters during germination. 	Moreover it was possible to obtain by NIR an estimate of the "malting quality" (MQ) of barley and to predict whether if its germination will be rapid and uniform and if a certain type of barley is suitable for the production of beer and spirits. 	Finally, the NIR technique was applied to monitor the brewing process, using correlations between NIR spectra of beer and analytical parameters, and to assess beer quality. 	These innovative results are potentially very useful for the actors involved in the beer production chain, especially the calibration models suitable for the control of the malting process and for the assessment of the “malting quality” of barley, which need to be deepened in future studies. ...|$|R
40|$|Brewing with {{fractionated}} barley Beer is a globally consumed beverage, {{which is}} produced from malted barley, water, hops and yeast. In recent years, {{the use of}} unmalted barley and exogenous enzymes have become more popular because they enable simpler processing and reduced environmental impact. <b>Raw</b> <b>barley,</b> however, contains less endogenous enzymes and more undesired components {{for the use of}} beer brewing, compared to malted barley.   The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate how barley can be fractionated to optimize the use of resources for the beer brewing process, while maintaining the quality of the brewed beer. A resource use efficiency analysis was performed to verify the presumed benefits on the environmental sustainability of the proposed process change. The work was based on the hypothesis that fractionation of the unprocessed barley will reduce the amount of undesired components, which leads to improvements in the brewing process based on partial or no malting. Fractionation can be performed by milling and separation, which requires physical disentanglement of the components. This fractionation can be influenced by properties of the components of the material, such as the glass transition temperature (Stuart et al.). Fractionation by abrasive milling, also known as pearling, is another possibility: here one makes use of the spatial distribution of components in the kernels. In case of barley for brewing this technique is especially promising as most of the undesired components are in the outer layer of the kernel. In addition, the removal of bran from the barley reduces the amount of water needed in the process. It will also reduce the volume of spent grains, hence reducing wastes and energy required for drying the spent grains. A disadvantage of pearling is however that it lowers the ability of the barley kernel to produce enzymes. This leads to the need of the addition of exogenous enzymes, as is the case when the malting step is omitted.   Chapter 2 describes the glass-to-rubber transition of protein and starch isolated from the barley endosperm, for different moisture levels. The hypothesis for this chapter is that dry fractionation by milling is facilitated by milling conditions in which the protein is in a rubbery state and the starch in a glassy state. Two methods were used to measure the Tg; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-mechanical compression tests (TMCT). The methods gave different results due to the differences in moisture content range, and heating rates, which may lead to conformational changes of the protein. The value of the Tg of partially crystalline materials, such as starch in barley, was not unambiguous when using TMCT because the mechanical effect of expansion of these materials was smaller. For both results, the Tg lines were modelled using the Gordon-Taylor equation. Based on sorption isotherms, it was concluded that moisture does not distribute evenly over the protein and starch in the kernel. Starch absorbs more moisture than protein at given water activities. This required a correction of the Tg lines. After this correction, the glass transition lines of starch and protein were closer together. The expectation is therefore that achieving good separation between the components based on having one glassy component and one rubbery component is challenging. For this reason, another dry fractionation technique, pearling, was considered. Chapter 3 describes the chemical composition of the barley and of fractions removed by pearling. Pearling was shown to selectively remove insoluble fibre, ash, protein and polyphenols, while the β-amylase activity and starch content of the remaining kernel was hardly affected. For example, removing the outer 5 % of the kernel reduced insoluble arabinoxylans (15 %), insoluble fibres (23 %), ash (19 %), polyphenols (11 %) and water holding capacity of the non-starch components (25 %), while only lowering starch content by 0. 20 %. The water holding capacity of the barley fractions was strongly related to the fibre content. This indicates that when the fibre content in the mash was reduced by pearling, the spent grains will take up less water, leading to less wort and sugar losses in this waste stream, and hence better use of the raw materials and less wastes. Chapter 4 compares a traditional brewing process to an enzyme-assisted brewing process with respect to their resource use efficiency, which is one aspect of the sustainability of the processes. The use of exogenous enzymes is found to be more efficient than producing enzymes through the malting process. The exergetic efficiency of the conventional malting process was 77 %. The main losses stem from the use of natural gas for removal of moisture from the barley in the kilning process, and from the loss of starch in the germination process. In case of the use of exogenous enzymes, it was concluded that the chemical exergy content of the enzymes was not a good measure for the exergy content of the enzymes. Instead, we proposed to use the cumulative exergetic consumption in the enzyme production rather than just the chemical exergy content of the enzymes. This cumulative exergetic consumption in the production of the enzymes was ± 30 times higher than their standard chemical exergy. This shows that the cumulative exergetic costs of minor components should be taken into account if a process uses them in significant quantities. This can be done by extending the system boundaries to include the production process of the purified components. The exergy efficiency of the enzyme formulation production process ranges between 20 % and 42 % depending on whether the by-product of the fermentation broth was considered as useful as the enzyme product. Even though the cumulative exergy consumption of the process was 30 times the standard chemical exergy of the dry enzyme, the total exergy input (i. e. both wasted and destroyed) for the production of 100 kg of beer was still larger for the conventional malting process (441 MJ) than for the enzyme-assisted process (354 MJ). In addition, beer produced using exogenous enzymes reduces the use of water by 7 %, of raw materials by 14 %, and of natural gas by 78 %. Thus, the exergy loss of the enzyme production process is more than compensated by the prevention of exergy loss in the total beer brewing process. Chapter 5 describes brewing tests using malted, unmalted and pearled, unmalted barley kernels. Brewing with unmalted barley saves material, energy and water in the malting stage but may result in complications during processing. Pearling mitigates these problems. Exogenous enzymes were used to compensate for the low enzyme activity in unmalted barley. Lautertun filtration and mash filtration were considered as filtration methods. Principle component analysis was performed on the chemical composition of the wort and the various spent grains, to investigate the effect of the malt-to-barley ratio, the degree of pearling and the filter method. A mash filter is optimal for this type of process, and we identified a window of operation in which optimal use is made of the raw materials while maintaining the end product quality, judged on basis of 4 quality parameters. The concluding chapter 6 presents a general discussion of all results described in this thesis. In addition, the benefits of pearling over that of milling and fractionation, and the effect of pearling on milling properties were discussed. Furthermore, it explores the advantages in environmental sustainability that can be achieved by pearling. Pearling as a pre-treatment for malting reduces the enzyme activity of germinating barley, and therefore the mash quality. This thesis provides insights in how pre-treatment of barley can make beer brewing more efficient in the use of resources. It stresses the need to optimally use all material streams in a process, to be able to design an environmentally sustainable process, and it shows that efficient resource use is key for achieving this. Additionally the value of enzymes as processing aids was discussed. A clear result is that one needs to include the resource use in the production of enzymes or other processing aids, when analyzing the environmental sustainability of a process, since this can be significant in the overall process.    ...|$|E
40|$|Primary beer gushing is defi ned as {{the wild}} and {{uncontrolled}} overfoaming of packaged beer induced by contaminated <b>raw</b> materials as <b>barley</b> and malt. It is generally admitted that most probably amphipathic molecules such as hydrophobins and non-specific lipid transfer proteins (ns-LTPs) are responsible for this phenomenon. These molecules are synthesized by moulds and by vegetal tissues respectively in order to modify the polarity of surfaces and the solubility of molecules. At present, hydrophobins are extensively studied as they are considered as the major responsible molecules involved in primary gushing. Although a strong reduction (more than 85 %) of the initial concentration of hydrophobins present in malt occurs during the brewing process, the residual quantity remaining in fi nished beer is sufficient to provoke the gushing of packaged beer and the subsequent dramatic commercial damages to a particular beer brand. This review compiles the relevant fundamental {{physical and chemical properties}} of CO 2 and experimental observations at laboratory and pilot scale. A plausible mechanism of primary gushing is presented. It is based on the effective role of hydrophobins association to CO 2 nanobubbles, acting as “nanobombs” and perhaps as “nucleation sites” causing effects from overfoaming to strong gushing depending on the concentration and the carbonation rate. In beer formation of CO 2 bubbles proceeds through heterogeneous nucleation. The rapid heterogeneous nucleation initiated {{at the opening of the}} container in excessively gushing beer suggests the the presence of catalysts to overcome the energy barriers. Since hydrophobin molecules are able to bind to carbonic acid, they prevent part of the CO 2 from dissolution. These structures will aggregate in timeframes of days or even weeks depending on the beer by forming nanobubbles of a typical critical radius. The internal pressure of these nanobubbles is proportional to the carbonation pressure of gaseous CO 2 in the container at filling (about 3. 0 till 4. 0 ATU of CO 2). At the opening of the container, the difference of partial pressure of carbonic acid in the bottle and in the atmosphere provokes the explosion of these nanobubbles and results in a strong gushing effect. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The first topic {{presented}} in the dissertation thesis is determination of isoprostanes as markers of oxidative stress and other compounds affected by presence of oxidative stress. Isoprostanes iPF 2 -III, iPF 2 -VI, iPF 2 -VI, astaxanthin and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially arachidonic acid (AA) were monitored in Atlantic salmon eggs (Salmo salar). Methods for the determination of these compounds have been developed and optimized using chromatographic separation coupled to conventional or mass spectrometric detection. Freshly laid eggs, eyed embryos and non-viable eggs were used to test a general hypothesis that egg viability can be affected by susceptibility to oxidative stress, either through the specific fatty acid concentration and/or the antioxidant capacity of the eggs. Levels of isoprostanes and arachidonic acid (AA) were significantly higher in non-viable eggs than in control (eyed embryos) as well as relative abundance of PUFA. While no difference of isoprostanes was found between freshly laid and control those from the Atlantic stock except iPF 2 -VI which was observed under the LOQ in the control. Higher levels of PUFA and AA {{in comparison with the}} control were observed in the freshly laid eggs. However, the only statistically significant difference was observed in the amount of astaxanthin. Different levels of PUFA and astaxanthin may be related to their biochemical consumption during the development of eggs. This work evaluated potential effect on the viability of eggs Salmo salar due to the presence of oxidative stress. The monitoring of mycotoxins in food and feed was the subject of the second topic. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by fungi. They are ubiquitous undesirable natural contaminants that are toxic for humans and animals. Today are known more than 500 mycotoxins. However, only few of them are regulated by the European Union. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to provide a scientific opinion on other mycotoxins for which statutory limits could be developed. In this study is proposed simultaneous screening allowing fast, reliable and sensitive approach, identification and quantification of 17 mycotoxins in food and feed sample. The method includes both mycotoxins regulated by the EU and selected mycotoxins required by the EFSA (aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisin, ochratoxin A, T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin, enniatins and beauvericin). Analytes are isolated by the modified QuEChERS method. For separation and target mycotoxins detection, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC –MS/MS) was employed. The method also allows determination of ergot alkaloids (ergocornine, ergosine, ergocryptine, ergocristine and their respective epimers). The developed method was used either for monitoring mycotoxins and ergot alkaloids in feed and <b>raw</b> materials and <b>barley</b> and malt prepared from it...|$|R
40|$|To {{overcome}} the `post-weaning growth check' commonly seen at weaning, {{the incorporation of}} antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) to the diet has been a useful management tool. Recent legislation within the European Union banning the use of AGPs at sub-therapeutic levels in animal feed means {{that the quality of}} dietary ingredients used in weaner diets has assumed a much more fundamental role. In order to improve the availability of starch in the piglet diet, processing of cereals is widely practised. However, descriptions of processing techniques used in many studies are simply referred to by name, with no regard of the precise variables used. In addition, many of the feed materials are simply referred to as `cooked' which gives little indication of nutritional value. Five trials were conducted in order to assess the use of raw and processed cereals on diet component digestion, digesta properties and gut morphology in newly-weaned piglets. The main objective was to examine the use of precisely controlled processing variables, such that starch digestibility was maximised with benefits for the gastrointestinal environment. A second aspect of the programme of work reported was the application of a number of analytical tests commonly used in the field of human food science, to examine the physicochemical properties of starch granules, and the changes they undergo upon processing. Using this approach, a comparison could be made between in-vitro (rheological) results and in-vivo (biological) responses. Trials 1 and 2 examined variability between <b>raw</b> cereals. Wheat, <b>barley,</b> rye and triticale were assessed in Trial 1. Wheat (identical batch), naked oats, whole oats and maize were evaluated in Trial 2. Coefficients of apparent digestibility (CAD) for starch and nitrogen revealed considerable variation between the cereals. In Trial 1, there was a strong trend (P = 0. 051) for starch digestion to be highest for the rye diet and lowest for triticale. CAD for starch was not significantly affected by cereal type in Trial 2. Despite having more viscous intestinal digesta than other animals (P = < 0. 001), pigs fed the rye-based diet did not experience any detrimental effects to animal performance. Trial 3 examined the use of raw wheat, of either hard or soft endosperm texture. From 5 days post-weaning, piglets fed the soft wheat diet had a tendency (P = 0. 063) to have higher feed intakes. In addition, pigs fed soft wheat diets had significantly less viscous tract digesta (P = 0. 029) than those animals fed the diet based on hard wheat. There {{was no significant difference in}} CAD for starch between the two dietary treatments but CAD for nitrogen was found to be significantly higher (P = 0. 006) in the distal region of the small intestine for pigs fed the soft wheat diet. The results from Trial 3 suggest that endosperm texture of wheat can have an effect on nutritional value, and that wheat of soft endosperm texture is more beneficial than hard wheat for the young piglet. Trial 4 was a 2 x 2 factorial study examining wheat endosperm texture (hard vs. soft) and degree of micronisation (high cook vs. low cook). CAD for starch was not affected by endosperm texture, although degree of cook was an important factor with significantly higher starch digestion for the high cook diets, compared to low cook (P = 0. 047). The use of micronised wheat lessened the reduction in starch digestibility seen on day 4 post-weaning in the small intestine, compared against the decline seen using raw wheat diets in Trial 3. In summary, Trial 4 demonstrated that micronisation can enhance the nutritional value of wheat for the weaned piglet, with degree of cook, a more significant factor than wheat endosperm texture. Trial 5 assessed wheat endosperm texture (hard vs. soft) and degree of extrusion (high cook vs. low cook). Raw soft wheat was used as a control. Results showed that CAD for starch in the small intestine was noticeably higher than in the other animal trials. Starch digestion was significantly affected by endosperm texture (greater coefficients for soft than hard; P < 0. 001) and by degree of cook (high SME greater than low SME; P < 0. 001). The use of extruded wheat diets almost eliminated the drop in starch digestion at the 0. 5 intestinal site seen on day 4 post-weaning. Wheat of soft endosperm texture responded better to extrusion processing than hard wheat under the conditions of Trial 5. The use of computer modelling was able to demonstrate a correlation between in-vitro starch parameters and in-vivo starch digestion in the small intestine of the piglet.
