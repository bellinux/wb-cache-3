50|$|Throughout the 50s and 60s, {{surfboard}} designers {{experimented with}} a variety of components to make the nose hold up longer and noserider surfboard designs became the hot sellers throughout the 60s. The combinations of template (outline shape), thickness, weight, <b>rocker,</b> <b>rail</b> shape, concaves, convexs, flats and fins vary with the individual surfer's style and size, and continue to be an experiment. To this day, noserider designs continue to be refined.|$|E
40|$|A major {{challenge}} of lightweight construction of car bodies, particularly with materials with high density, such as steel, {{is the need}} to use a very low wall thickness. This makes the structures sus-ceptible to buckling, especially in crash load cases. The DLR’s institute of vehicle concepts therefore investigates the use of hybrid structures, for exam-ple by reinforcing the steel shell of a beam with lightweight cores. This leads to a higher stability of the structure, especially for the side impact or the pole crash, which results in a much higher weight specific energy absorption. In order to maximize the performance, a specific balance between several parameters such as the wall thickness, the material properties of the core and material properties of the shell, must be achieved. A multi-parameter optimization was therefore conducted, using LS-Dyna and LS-Opt, in order to maximize the weight specific energy absorption. Also, the impact of different materials on the performance of such structures was investigated. Possible uses for metal-hybrid structures are a <b>rocker</b> <b>rail,</b> or a door reinforcement, for example. They are also extensively used in the car body of a lightweight vehicle which is currently under de-velopment at the institute of vehicle concepts...|$|E
40|$|Lightweight {{magnesium}} alloys and polyurethane foams {{have attracted}} much attention in automotive industry due to their potential to reduce vehicle weight. This study conducted quasi-static and dynamic three-point bending tests to acquire preliminary knowledge of the energy absorption characteristics and deformation behaviour of empty and polyurethane foam-filled magnesium alloy AZ 31 B thin-walled beams, and to make comparisons with mild steel DC 04 beams. The results suggested that both deformation/fracture modes and energy absorption capacity of the thin-walled beams subjected to bending loads depends on loading rate and other parameters, such as the beam material’s strength and ductility, foam density and wall thickness. It was found that both the steel and magnesium thin-walled beams reach higher energy absorption under dynamic bending condition. There is a clear tendency showing that a foam-filled beam with a higher foam density achieves higher load carrying capacity, but it fractures at a smaller deflection. The experiments demonstrated that AZ 31 B may significantly outperform DC 04 in terms of Energy Absorption (EA) and Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) for foam-filled thin-walled beams subjected to bending loads, when the fracture deflection is constrained to a medium value. However, this outperformance could be weakened when the performance is assessed at a larger fracture deflection because foam-filled AZ 31 B beams tend to fracture earlier. For applications with limited deformation, {{there is a possibility}} to develop lightweight auto-body structures such as <b>rocker</b> <b>rails</b> by substituting AZ 31 B for mild steels, while maintaining or exceeding their current crashworthiness and safety...|$|R
25|$|For the 2012 model year, the Journey becomes Dodge's {{smallest}} SUV after FCA stopped manufacturing {{smaller but}} more expensive counterpart, the Nitro. In 2014, the Journey Crossroad was introduced. The Crossroad has chrome accents along {{the lower part}} of the body and in the interior, a large bumper, smoked head- and taillights, a black grille, <b>rocker</b> panels, <b>rails</b> for a roof rack, and a skid plate simile at the rear. Chrysler added the revised Dodge logo with two slanted rectangles for the 2013 Model Year. For the 2016 model-year, the Journey's AVP and Limited trims are discontinued and the Crossroad Plus trim is added and also for the 2017 model-year, the R/T trim is replaced by the GT trim.|$|R
50|$|The board's {{rails and}} deck {{may also be}} {{referred}} to as having rocker. A board with a v-shaped tail, for example, has had the lower/ outer portion of its rear rails reduced, increasing its tail <b>rail</b> <b>rocker.</b> Having a flat, even deck rocker will increase a board's flexibility, while a convex deck rocker creates a board that is thicker along the board's stringer and stiffer in the water.|$|R
2500|$|The top of {{the line}} models were named American GFS (Concord DL two-door), American ECD (Concord DL four-door), and Camioneta American Automática (Concord DL wagon).

The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, fan shroud, coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|R

5000|$|For 1968 only, {{a special}} {{high-performance}} {{version of the}} 302 was offered for the Shelby GT350. Its main features included an angled, high-rise aluminum or iron intake manifold, a larger Holley four-barrel carburetor, and bigger valves of 1.875 in intake and 1.6 in exhaust. It had a longer-duration camshaft, still with hydraulic lifters. The block was made in Mexico. [...] "Hecho en Mexico" [...] casting marks {{are present in the}} lifter valley, and its main strength was the appearance of much larger and stronger two-bolt main bearing caps on the engines bottom end - the same as the HP-289, but not made from nodular iron rather Fords standard material. The heads had special close-tolerance pushrod holes to guide the pushrods without <b>rail</b> <b>rocker</b> arms or stamped steel guide plates. The combustion chambers also featured a smaller quench design for a higher compression ratio and enhanced flow characteristics. Additionally, high-flow cast exhaust manifolds similar to those on the 289 Hi-Po K-code engine further improved output. Heavy-duty connecting rods with high-strength bolts and a nodular iron crankshaft were also included in this package. Rated power (SAE gross) was estimated at [...] at 6,000 rpm and 333 lbft Nm at 3,800 rpm. The package, which cost $692 including some other equipment, was not popular and did not return for 1969. This engine was not a factory engine. Rather, like all Shelby Mustang engines, it was modified by Shelby American in their capacity as a vehicle upfitter. This special engine is well documented in the Ford factory engine repair manual for 1968 Mustangs and Fairlanes. This engine block is considered the strongest production 302 block other than the Boss 302 and the Trans Am 302. The Mexican 302 block was produced through to the mid-1990s and even showed up in Ford cars, trucks, and vans throughout the 1970s and early 1980s (Mexican-made 302 engines were often used by the USA car plants when CEP1 could not produce enough engines and many Ford replacement engines were Mexican).|$|R
