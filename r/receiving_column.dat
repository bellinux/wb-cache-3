30|$|Table  4 {{reports the}} effect of {{receiving}} SSS payouts on whether (and how much) an individual received and gave cash transfers to their family and friends. The coefficients for the announcement and disbursement effects of SSS, βann and βdisb, are statistically insignificant across all transfer-related variables. These coefficients are also close to zero for the variables related to whether an individual received or gave private cash transfers (columns (1) and (4) respectively), and positive for variables related {{to the amount of}} private transfers <b>received</b> (<b>columns</b> (2) and (3)). 29 Our results on the probability of receiving private cash transfers (the extensive margin) are similar to results from papers studying non-contributory pensions in Bolivia, Chile, and China (Behrman et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2018; Hernani-Limarino and Mena 2015), and precise enough to exclude falls of the magnitude (7 – 8 percentage points) seen in Peru and Mexico (Amuedo-Dorantes and Juarez 2015; Bando et al. 2016), while our results related to the amount of private transfers received suggest that it is unlikely that private transfers to SSS recipients fell along the intensive margin.|$|R

40|$|A 9 -month-long {{continuous}} flow column study {{was carried out}} to investigate Cr(VI) removal by Fe 0 {{with the presence of}} humic acid. The study focused on the influences of humic acid promoted dissolved iron release and humic acid aggregation in Fe 0 <b>columns</b> <b>receiving</b> synthetic Cr(VI) contaminated groundwater containing various components such as bicarbonate and Ca. The effects of humic acid varied significantly depending on the presence of Ca. In Ca-free columns, the presence of humic acid promoted the release of dissolved iron in the forms of soluble Fe-humic acid complexes and stabilized fine Fe (hydr) oxide colloids. As a result, the precipitation of iron corrosion products was suppressed and the accumulation of secondary minerals on Fe 0 surfaces was diminished, and a slight increase in Cr(VI) removal capacity by 18 % was record compared with that of humic acid-free column. In contrast, in the presence of Ca, as evidenced by the SEM and FTIR results, humic acid greatly co-aggregated with Fe (hydr) oxides and deposited on Fe 0 surfaces. This largely inhibited electron transfer from Fe 0 surfaces to Cr(VI) and reduced the drainable porosity of the Fe 0 matrix, resulting in a significant decrease in Cr(VI) removal capacity of Fe 0. The Cr(VI) removal capacity was decreased by 24. 4 % and 42. 7 % in humic acid and Ca <b>receiving</b> <b>columns,</b> with and without bicarbonate respectively, compared with that of Ca and humic acid-free column.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{efficacy}} of matrix-based fertilizers (MBFs) to reduce Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp., NH₄, NO₃, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and total phosphorus (TP) in leachate and soil after dairy manure application in greenhouse column studies. The MBFs are composed of inorganic N and P in compounds that are relatively loosely bound (MBF 8) to more tightly bound (MBF 9) mixtures using combinations of starch, cellulose, lignin, Al₂(SO₄) ₃ 18 H₂O, and/or Fe₂(SO₄) ₃ 3 H₂O to create a matrix that slowly releases the nutrients. One day after the first dairy manure application, E. coli numbers were greater in leachate from control columns than in leachate from <b>columns</b> <b>receiving</b> MBFs. After three dairy manure applications, E. coli and Enterococcus spp. numbers in leachates were not consistently different between controls and <b>columns</b> <b>receiving</b> MBFs.

40|$|Neuronal {{populations in}} the sensory cortex exhibit {{fluctuations}} in excitability, and the present experiments tested the hypothesis that these variations coincide with peaks and troughs in cortical modifiability. The activity of multiunit neuronal clusters under light urethane anesthesia was recorded through 100 -microelectrode arrays implanted in the infragranular layers of rat barrel cortex. Spontaneous activity was characterized by “bursts ” of spikes, synchronized across the barrel cortex. This allowed activity at one selected electrode to {{be taken as a}} reliable monitor of widespread cortical bursts. We used spikes at the selected electrode to trigger stimulation of two pairs of whiskers during a 50 min conditioning procedure: (1) for the “burst-conditioned ” whisker pair, each stimulus was delivered 1 msec after the triggering spike, activating cortex coincident with the burst; and (2) for the “interburst-conditioned ” whisker pair, each stimulus was delivered 300 msec after the triggering spike, activating cortex during the trough between bursts. The cross-correlation between cortical neurons in the pairs of columns matching the stimulated whisker pairs was estimated after the termination of the conditioning procedure. Conditioning produced a twofold increase in the degree of co-firing between infragranular neurons in <b>columns</b> <b>receiving</b> burstconditioned costimulation but no significant change in connectivity between infragranular neurons in <b>columns</b> <b>receiving</b> interburstconditioned costimulation, although the two pairs of <b>columns</b> <b>received</b> an equal number of sensory inputs.
