A common way of manufacturing these is to take a thin sheet of metal with pieces cut out (typically, a series of rectangular holes) and insert this in the waveguide {{in much the same way}} as finline. However, a finline filter is able to implement patterns of arbitrary complexity whereas the metal insert filter is limited by the need for mechanical support and integrity.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} optical waveguides are in common use. A <b>ridge</b> <b>waveguide</b> {{is created by}} etching {{parallel}} trenches in the quantum cascade gain material to create an isolated stripe of QC material, typically ~10 um wide, and several mm long. A dielectric material is typically deposited in the trenches to guide injected current into the ridge, then the entire ridge is typically coated with gold to provide electrical contact and to help remove heat from the ridge when it is producing light. Light is emitted from the cleaved ends of the waveguide, with an active area that is typically only a few micrometers in dimension.|$|E
5000|$|A {{distributed}} Bragg reflector laser (DBR) {{is a type}} {{of single}} frequency laser diode. Other practical types of single frequency laser diodes include DFB lasers and external cavity diode lasers. A fourth type, the cleaved-coupled-cavity laser has not proven to be commercially viable. VCSELs are also single frequency devices.The DBR laser structure is fabricated with surface features that define a monolithic, single mode <b>ridge</b> <b>waveguide</b> that runs {{the entire length of the}} device. A resonant cavity is defined by a highly reflective DBR mirror on one end, and a low reflectivity cleaved exit facet on the other end. Within the cavity is a gain ridge portion, where current is injected to produce a single spatial lasing mode. The DBR mirror is designed to reflect only a single longitudinal mode. As a result, the laser operates on a single spatial and longitudinal mode. The laser emits from the exit facet opposite the DBR end. The DBR is continuously tunable over approximately a 2 nm range by changing current or temperature. The temperature coefficient is approximately 0.07 nm/K, and the current coefficient is approximately [...]003 nm/mA. DBR lasers are stable, low noise optical sources. When operated with a low noise power supply at constant temperature, edge emitting DBR lasers have a linewidth of less than 10 MHz. Power levels typically can run up to several hundred milliwatts.|$|E

30|$|Recently, Goshima et al. [10] {{reported}} a 1.3 -μm InAs/GaAs QD LC-DFB laser fabricated by deep gratings vertically etched into the <b>ridge</b> <b>waveguide</b> structure, {{and a low}} slope efficiencies below 0.03  W/A and a small SMSR of 20  dB were observed, which are mainly due to the large waveguide losses caused by the deep etching process. With a shallow-etched grating structure, Briggs et al. [23] have successfully fabricated GaSb-based LC-DFB lasers with a larger SMSR of 25  dB. But further improvement was limited by the lower coupling coefficient due to the large distance between the gratings and the <b>ridge</b> <b>waveguide,</b> which is crucial {{for the performance of}} a LC-DFB laser. In our work, the narrow <b>ridge</b> <b>waveguide</b> and the grating structures were fabricated separately, resulting in a very sharp and smooth sidewall of the <b>ridge</b> <b>waveguide</b> and therefore little waveguide loss. The shallow etching method for the grating fabrication employed in our experiments can sharply reduce the aspect ratio of the etched gratings and allow the making of the high-quality first-order grating structure which ensures good coupling with light. By carefully controlling the thickness of the PMMA resist and the EBL lithography parameters, the stacking phenomena of photoresist aside the sidewall of ridges were effectively alleviated, which leads to the formation of gratings tightly adjacent to the laser <b>ridge</b> <b>waveguide.</b> In addition, the high dot density of ~[*] 4.3 [*]×[*] 1010  cm− 2 obtained by optimizing the MBE epitaxy growth parameters and the high gain of the QD assemblies realized by the modulation p-doping and the post-growth annealing treatment may account for the large 47  dB SMSR of our LC-DFB laser.|$|E
