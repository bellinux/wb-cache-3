Th e {{focus of}} this article is to analyse the {{development}} of large fi nancial groups in the fi nancial market called fi nancial conglomerates, and to analyse the adequacy of their supervision, weather procedures and instruments of <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> enable supervisory authorities to get the required information and to take eff ective decisions. In this article, the re-view of scientifi c literature allowed to distinguish three main typologies of fi nancial conglomer-ate structures. Analysis shows that a large variety of fi nancial conglomerate structures causes the risks of contagion, risk of concentration, management complexity and confl icts of interests and requires more intense and a diff erent kind of their <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision.</b> Th e current European Union legislation provides for a comprehensive set of <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> but the latest fi ndings have indicated that group risks arise across the whole fi nancial sector, underscor-ing the importance of the supplementary supervision of the links within fi nancial groups and between fi nancial institutions. Supplementary supervision on group risks will enhance fi nancial stability and better protection of depositors, insurance policy holders and investors. JEL classifi cation: G 24, G 28...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether risk-based regulation is an efficient approach to the regime of Central Counterparties (CCPs) in the OTC derivatives market. The discussions below will first attempt to throw some light on the way risk-based regulation operates. They highlight the benefits, limits and complexities tied to the adoption of this approach to regulation. The core of the study in this paper is the analysis concerning the parameters that risk-based regulation offers to assess the current regime of Central Counterparties in the OTC derivatives market in the UK. The paper explores the UK risk-based model of regulation and supervision governing OTC derivatives. It is specifically focused <b>on</b> <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> and conduct of business rules governing OTC derivatives transactions and the increasing tendency to use Central Counterparties CCPs. Additionally, this study will identify and assess the risks to the regulator’s objectives that are posed by the Central Counterparties CCPs, and to address those using various regulatory tools...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the case for regulating financial innovation in light of the recent global financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach – Responsibility for assuring the bank customers are “treated fairly” in the UK currents belongs to the Financial Services Authority (FSA), whilst the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) oversees the Consumer Credit Act. The paper argues for the regulation of retail banking and financial service provision as a utility, leaving the FSA to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> and the OFT to concentrate on its other responsibilities. Financial innovation in wholesale and investment banking should be regulated by the prudential authorities. Findings – New financial instruments are frequently underpriced, which may be in part to encourage rapid and widespread adoption. Practical implications – Good, transactions cost and risk reducing, retail financial innovation should be encouraged. New wholesale financial products should be thoroughly “stress tested” prior to being licensed, analogous to the testing of new medical “drugs” by the pharmaceutical industry. Originality/value – The global banking crisis led to calls for banks to maintain lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises and households (especially mortgages). This implies that access to finance, like access to water and electricity, should be assured and that customers should be protected against the “monopoly” powers of large suppliers. Hence, retail banks are utilities and should be regulated as such. Banks, Derivative markets, Innovation, Regulation, Securities, United Kingdom...|$|R
40|$|The {{sovereign}} debt {{crisis in the}} Eurozone has evidenced the shortcomings offinancial supervision and regulation in the EU. In the summer of 2012, {{at the height of}} the crisis, and in the absence of a clear protector of financial stability in the Eurozone, it was the bold pledge of the President of the European Central Bank (ECB) to do "whatever it takes to preserve the euro " that managed to restrain contagion. But did the ECB really have the power to act as the safeguard of financial stability in the Eurozone? EU Policy makers have reacted to those shortcomings by introducing deeply transformative changes in financial regulation. The birth of the Banking Union might be the paramount example. In the institutional landscape arising from the Banking Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) stands as a central player, especially as the competent authority for the <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> of the most significant credit institutions in the Eurozone. Yet the scope of its new powers as the guardian of financial stability is unclear. For example, in the event of another financial crisis, could the ECB provide financial assistance to credit institutions facing liquidity problems as a Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) ? In this paper, we look at the ECB 's core mandates in the Treaties to delineate the scope of those new powers. Unlike monetary policy, financial stability is not a core mandate of the ECB under the TFEU. We begin by exploring whether the ECB could perform LOLR functions within its core mandates; particularly, within its mandate of monetary policy. For that, we delve into the recent decision of the CJEU in Gauweiler and others v. Deutscher Bundestag and Bundesregierung, and propose aframework to define the scope of the ECB 's monetary policy mandate. We then examine the <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> powers conferred <b>on</b> the ECB under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), and explore the possible limitations arising from the distribution of competences at the vertical and horizontal levels. We conclude with an analysis of the limitations that may arise if the ECB's powers <b>on</b> <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> were to clash with its monetary policy mandate...|$|R

Curiously, early contributions to post-Asia literature about how {{to make the world a}} safer financial place said little about the choice of exchange rate regime, focusing instead <b>on</b> transparency, <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> policy toward capital flows, and IMF reform. 1 The emphasis in recent writings is different; there, the exchange rate has taken center stage. 2 In a sense, this shift reflects a maturation of the debate [...] -a recognition that exchange-rate policy and the other items on the architects' agenda are connected.

40|$|The OTC {{derivatives}} {{market has}} {{captured the attention of}} regulators after the Global Financial Crisis due to the risk it poses to financial stability. Under the post-crisis regulatory reform the concentration of business, and risks, among a few major players is changed by the concentration of a large portion of transactions in the new market infrastructures, the Central Counterparties (CCPs). This work, for the first time, analyses the regulatory response of the United Kingdom, the largest centre of OTC derivatives transactions, and highlights its shortcomings or 'fractures'. The work uses a normative risk-based approach to regulation as a methodological lens to analyse the UK regime of CCPs in the OTC derivatives market (OTCDM). It is specifically focused <b>on</b> <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> and conduct of business rules governing OTC derivatives transactions and the move towards enhancing the use of central clearing. The resulting analysis, from a normative risk based approach, suggests that the UK regime for CCPs does not fulfil what would be expected if a coherent risk based approach were taken. The main contribution of this work is to highlight the risk based 'fractures' affecting the regulation and supervision of CCPs in the OTCDM. The absence of a coherent conduct of business regime of CCPs, the insufficient legal framework underpinning CCPs' operations, the lack of a Special Resolution Regime for CCPs are some notable absences. However the failure to rule 'Innovation Risk' from a risk based approach raises material concerns. It is therefore argued that these fractures hinder the achievement of the regulatory objectives. The regulator's objective is to enhance the stability of the OTCDM by ensuring the safety and soundness of Central Counterparties CCPs...|$|R
40|$|Currency {{and banking}} have a {{relatively}} long tradition in Ireland. Coins have circulated for about 1, 000 years and banking has been practised for some 300 years. Significant financial change was a feature of earlier periods {{as it has been}} over the past twenty five years. Current indications are that the rate of structural change in the financial sector will gain momentum between now and the end of this century. An appreciation of the past can contribute to understanding the present. Influence over future events can be improved by a greater awareness of how we adapted to change in the past. With this in mind, a brief review of the evolution of currency and banking in Ireland, both in the Republic and Northern Ireland, is presented here together with a preview of some of the major changes that will be occurring in the decades ahead. The emphasis is on the structural changes that occurred rather than an evaluation of the policies pursued but many of the issues raised are relevant to the debate about the expected changes in the financial sector in the 1990 s. A wide range of publications on Irish banking has been drawn upon, many of which are cited in the Bibliography. The review is divided into three parts. Part I concentrates on the historical background and outlines the origins and development of money and banking in Ireland up to the middle of this century. Part II concentrates on the significant changes in banking and other financial institutions that have occurred in Ireland in recent decades, including the 1980 s. Finally, Part III looks towards the twenty first century and integration within Europe with the emphasis <b>on</b> <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> of banks, other financial institutions and the capital markets...|$|R

40|$|Regulation allows {{microfinance}} {{institutions to}} evolve more fully into banks, particularly for institutions aiming to take deposits. But there are potential trade-offs. Complying with regulation and supervision can be costly. The authors examine {{the implications for}} the institutions’ profitability and their outreach to small-scale borrowers and women. The tests draw on a new database that combines high-quality financial data on 245 of the world’s largest microfinance institutions with newly-constructed data <b>on</b> their <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision.</b> Ordinary least squares regressions show that supervision is negatively associated with profitability. Controlling for the non-random assignment of supervision via treatment effects and instrumental variables regressions, the analysis finds that supervision is associated with substantially larger average loan sizes and less lending to women than in ordinary least squares regressions, {{although it is not}} significantly associated with profitability. The pattern is consistent with the notion that profit-oriented microfinance institutions absorb the cost of supervision by curtailing outreach to market segments that tend to be more costly per dollar lent. By contrast, microfinance institutions that rely on non-commercial sources of funding (for example, donations), and thus are less profit-oriented, do not adjust loan sizes or lend less to women when supervised, but their profitability is significantly reduced.

40|$|The recent {{crisis has}} {{promoted}} a rethinking of financial globalisation, a revision that has also partially interested some official circles. National supervisors have often {{reacted to the}} crises of cross-border banks by ring fencing local interests. Some proposals (e. g. the Vickers Report and the Fed’s subsidiarisation of US establishments of foreign banks) de facto imply a partial de-globalisation of both banks and their supervision. Orthodox regulators and large banks point, on the contrary, to deepen globalisation by means of more homogeneous international standards for prudential regulation and bank resolution. After all, that was the original message of the G 20. The champions of globalisation argue that the new <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>prudential</b> regulation and bank resolution will make bank crises less frequent and serious, while shielding public finances if they occur. Much of the current debate focuses on whether the new rules, especially for bank capitalisation, are strict enough to deliver financial stability. The present paper objects to focusing regulation and supervision solely on stability, to linking stability only to prudential rules and to enhancing the international harmonisation of those rules. The criticism, based on a simple exercise, looks at the structural heterogeneities that characterise both the banking systems and the growth trajectories of some developed economies. Homogenous rules, if effective, would produce inflationary or deflationary strains. If banks must serve economic growth, regulation should found financial stability mainly on structural measures, and supervision should be transformed {{into one of the}} policy tools flexibly looking after local conditions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> is {{dealt with}} {{here as a}} matter of both {{regulation}} and control on a global or a regional level of the international activities of the various financial « industries ». While an analysis of the underlying rationale of <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> is not within the ambit of the report, the risks resulting from the structure of international financial marks, both systemic and for the « consumers » are briefly explained {{as a matter of}} introducing into a field of law which is characterized by a puzzling array of institutions and arrangements. These are then examined in more detail in two sections, one devoted to the global level of regulation of financial markets, the other to the particular structure of the « Eurosystem ». With respect to the former, the examination starts with a presentations of the complex, multi-organic and largely informal « international financial architecture », before it enters into an evaluation of its merits and limits. In this regard, the problems of legitimacy and representativity of the regulatory mechanisms, of the distribution of authority within the regulatory system and of the legal nature of the mostly non-mandatory, but indirectly binding regulatory rules and the prospects of enhancing their effect, are successively analysed. In addition, future developments of the overall architecture of the system are discussed, in particular the controversy about instituting a « lender of last resort », {{and the role of the}} private sector. With respect to the Eurosystem the report outlines, first, its organisational structure as provided for in the EC-Treaty and in the statutes of the ECBS as well as the forms of cooperation characterising the network of European and national authorities. The report then discusses the issues related to establishing a « lender of last resort » or a substitute for it. The subsequent evaluation of the existing system stresses the specific risks resulting from the high degree of concentration of banking markets in Europe, and of reliance on « national champions » before presenting a broad examination of the European controversy <b>on</b> centralisation of <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> and of the propositions made to enhance the effectiveness of the system. The report concludes on a cautionary tone of suggesting prudent approaches to <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> and of insisting on the necessity to equally care for the democratic accountability of the institutions of the developing Eurosystem.

It identifies possible drivers of changes in these supervisory structures using a panel ordered probit analysis. The results show that (i) countries advancing to a higher stage of economic development tend to integrate their financial sector supervisory structure. Similarly, improvements in overall public governance drive countries to adopting more integrated supervisory arrangements. (ii) Greater independence of the central bank could entail less integration of <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> but not necessarily of business conduct. (iii) Small open economies opt for more integrated structures of financial sector <b>supervision,</b> especially <b>on</b> the <b>prudential</b> side. (iv) Financial deepening makes countries integrate supervision progressively more, however, greater development of the non-bank financial system including capital markets and the insurance industry makes countries opt for less integrated <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> but not business conduct supervision structures. (v) The lobbying power of concentrated and highly profitable banking sectors acts as a significant negative force against business conduct integration. (vi) Countries with banking sectors that have been more exposed to aggregate liquidity risk, due to their high share of external funding, tend to integrate more their <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision.</b> Finally, (vii) a country that has experienced past financial crises is more likely to integrate its supervisory structure for financial services. ...|$|R

In particular, it focuses on two principal regulatory tools which constitute {{the basis of the}} framework promulgated by recent Basel Committee's initiatives, that is, Basel III.

This paper aims to explain why the Basel Committee's liquidity requirements and present proposals aimed at addressing liquidity risks, still represent a very modest milestone in efforts aimed at addressing challenges in <b>prudential</b> regulation and <b>supervision.</b> Even though problems attributed to capital adequacy requirements are considered by many authorities to have triggered the recent Crisis, the paper will highlight how runs on banks are triggered by liquidity crises and that liquidity risks cannot be isolated from systemic risks. In so doing, it will incorporate the roles assumed by information asymmetries and market based regulation – hence elaborate on how market based regulation could serve to address problems which trigger liquidity risks. Imperfect knowledge being a factor which is contributory to liquidity crises and bank runs, and market based regulation being essential in facilitating disclosure - since the Basel Committee's focus <b>on</b> banks and <b>prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> cannot <b>on</b> its own, address the challenges encountered in the present regulatory environment.
