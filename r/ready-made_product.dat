40|$|This paper re-examines {{whether or}} not mothers' labor supply discourages home production, {{focusing}} on cooking at home in Japanese families. The previous empirical studies using time use data have not always found a negative relationship between mothers' market labor supply and home production. We use alternative data to measure home production: scanner data on daily goods purchased by each household. We measure how much time-consuming home production is conducted, based on the composition of daily food expenditure for cooking. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity among households by a panel structure of our scanner data, we first show that there exists a negative effect of mothers' labor supply on home production. Working mothers may purchase more <b>ready-made</b> <b>products</b> in the market, reducing home production time. Second, we show that this negative effect is more apparent in lower social classes. Households in lower social classes purchase more <b>ready-made</b> <b>products</b> in the market, especially when the mothers are working as part-time workers. Thirdly, the smaller negative effect among higher social classes is partly caused by stronger health-consciousness and aversion to less healthy market products among working mothers in high social classes. 本研究は母親の市場労働が家計生産に与える影響について明らかにする．具体的には，家計生産の中でも最も大きな時間を占める「調理」をとりあげ，母親の就労によって調理時間が減少する可能性について再検討する．分析には，先行研究で使われてきた時間配分データではなく，家計の購入品目データを用いる．購入品目から分かる調理時間（家計生産時間）を必要とする財の購入状況を見ることで，家計内で生産される食事量（家計生産量）を測定する．　日本の Scanner panel data を用いて，母親や家計の観察される属性と観察されない属性を考慮しながら分析した結果，第一に，母親の就労は家計生産量を減少させることが分かる．母親の就労により家計内で手間のかかる調理が敬遠され，既製食品を市場から調達する量が増加するといえる．第二に，母親の就労による家計生産抑制効果は生活水準の低い家計で大きいことが示される．第三に，上位階級で家計生産抑制効果が見られにくいことは，家計で作られる健康的な財への選好がこの階級で強いことが理由であることが示される．下位階級では，とくに母親がパートタイム労働を行う場合に，家計での調理品よりも健康に良くないとされる財を市場から購入する傾向が確認される...|$|R

30|$|During {{the last}} decade {{impressive}} improvements in digital technology have unleashed new functionalities with implications for product architecture, value-creation, and environmental settings. Products and infrastructures have changed their very nature since digital technology increasingly permeates goods, services, and processes. This phenomenon is often denoted as Industrial Internet, Industry 4.0 or Internet of Things. Fixed product design dissolved {{in favor of a}} layered modular architecture (i.e. contents, service, network, and device layer) and the process of value creation changed fundamentally from linear-oriented sequential value chains to complex value networks. Due to the generativity of digital products heterogeneous firms are able to limitlessly mix-and-match combinations of various products and services and to establish new forms of value co-creation. Whereas certain layers may serve as digital platforms upon which others are endorsed to apply and integrate resources, other layers may function as components for different platforms. Firms co-create value across firms and industry boundaries. This results in blurred industry structures and the emergence of digital ecosystems. A digital ecosystem describes a network of various, heterogeneous, and diverse actors who differently participate and contribute to value creation processes. Due to the heterogeneous and unpredictable role of actors a digital ecosystem is a highly volatile, complex, and uncertain environment. These digital ecosystems are considered to be the playing field, which restrict and enable firms in their competitive actions. The high degrees of uncertainty impede firms’ ability to base strategic decisions on predictive rationality. Instead, firms may effectuate their environment in order to shape it for their benefit and, thus, for long-term performance. Due to the hardly predictable nature of complex ecosystems and, in particular, such dynamic value creation processes, the exchange value of goods and services tends to be more volatile and unsure. In contrast to the prevailing notion of value focusing on actors’ willingness to pay for a <b>ready-made</b> <b>product</b> or service, the value of a digitized product or service is – according to the S-D logic – a result or function of the value being created while it is used. The increase in value of a digital platform is determined by how this platform is used (both by applying and integrating resources). Due {{to the fact that the}} eventual purpose of a product or service is not predefined, not easily anticipated, and in a permanent state of flux, exchange values of goods and services are also hardly predictable.|$|E

40|$|Service {{thinking}} and {{the transition from}} a product-logic-perspective to a process-perspective are catchwords in current management research (e. g. Grönroos 2000, Kowalksowski 2006, Söderström 2003, Stremersch et al. 2001, Oliva & Kallenberg 2003, Lele 1986) While the product-logic is based on value distribution via the transition of a <b>ready-made</b> <b>product</b> or service, the service-process logic focuses on value-in-use that is created together with the customer. (Grönroos 2007) In the current service management view, value creation is regarded as the result of exchange with network partners in the perception of the customer (Normann & Ramirez 1998). This is why service thinking includes that a company seeks for co-operation with suppliers and customers through activated relationships, networks (Syson & Perks 2004). Coming from a product-delivery-perspective on doing business can challenge a service provider to adapt to a service-process view. Legally and historically founded prerequisites, as well as for example corporate culture and financial resources, can be obstacles {{on the way to a}} service-process business approach. The purpose of this study is to gain insight into how these obstacles influence the possibility of a service operator to adapt to the service logic with customer- and supplier-interaction. To gain deeper insight into the service thinking of a company in a network environment, a qualitative single case study on the public transport organisation “County Transport” has been used. Based on three personal interviews and literature study, this case explores how a public service organisation deals with its service mission. It also identifies and describes hinders on the way to a service logic approach. The organisation of County Transport was found to be steered a lot on the basis of numbers and material parts of the service offering such as the bus itself and different support tools on the busses. County Transport follows the rules of the Public Procurement Act which gives the public transport operation a contract framework of a tendering based choice of operators for the time of 8 - 10 years. The relationship between County Transport and its operator “The Operator” can be seen as comparatively secure relationship without an introduction phase in which trust and adaptations to each other can be developed. With this quite formal relationship under economic pressure it was found that the cooperation between The PTA of County Transport and The Operator was worse than desired. Especially the influence of the brut contract on tender basis seemed to be hindering a good cooperation in a long-term perspective. It might be that a steering by costs and numbers on one side does not help to create a value-creating relationship based on adaptations and soft factors on the other side...|$|E

The years 1926–1935 were favourably viewed by many Polish Jews, whose situation improved especially under the cabinet of Pilsudski’s appointee Kazimierz Bartel. However, a combination of various factors, including the Great Depression, meant that the situation of Jewish Poles was never very satisfactory, and it deteriorated again after Piłsudski's death in May 1935, which many Jews regarded as a tragedy.

Development and production of the small-sized equipment for realization of heat treatment processes of foodstuff in vacuum would create technical and economic conditions for implementation of temperature processing processes of foodstuff at farms, hotels and even at home that would promote creation of new food, development of new recipes and, in general, development of the new direction in cookery. So the article describes the problem of equipment construction for the process of thermal processing of food in vacuum such as cooking jam, concentration of juices and dairy products, distillation, drying, pickling, {{and the possibility of}} building inexpensive compact vacuum unit for the implementation of these processes (crock-pot) for use at hotels, farms and even for domestic purposes. The analysis of technological schemes for energy efficient evaporation process in vacuum crock-pot is provided. The developed technological scheme of vacuum crock-pot with thermoelectric converters and principle of its operation are considered. Microprocessor block diagram of a multichannel data acquisition system consisting workstation for investigation of thermoelectric vacuum crock-pot as a control object is presented and control algorithms helping to reduce energy consumption and to increase operational reliability in implementing processes and the quality of <b>ready-made</b> <b>products</b> are provided. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} fixed dose {{combination}} (FDC) tablets of Lamivudine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) is increasing {{due to increased}} incidences of HIV/Hepatitis B and HIV/TB co-infections. This {{is likely to increase}} the financial crisis due to limited resources for funding procurement of <b>ready-made</b> <b>products</b> from the pharmaceuticals manufacturing leading countries. Therefore, production of local oral tablets containing Lamivudine and TDF FDC is inevitable. Lamivudine 300 mg/TDF 300 mg tablets were developed and optimized by D-optimal mixture design and produced by direct compression technique. Twenty trial formulations with independent variables, including PVP-CL 1 – 12. 00 %, PVP-K 30 1 – 10. 00 %, starch- 1500 2. 5 – 12. 5 % and Avicel-PH 102 2 – 19. 25 % were prepared by direct compression technique. The formulations were assessed on assay, dissolution, friability, weight variation and disintegration time. It was found that assay ranged from 98. 13 – 101. 95 % for Lamivudine, 98. 25 – 102. 84 for TDF, both were within the in-house assay specification of 95 to 105 %. Dissolution at single point was above 80 % for Lamivudine 93. 96 – 100. 55 % and 95. 85 – 103. 15 % for TDF, disintegration time was between 1. 92 – 66. 33 min and friability 0. 06 – 12. 56 %. Out of twenty formulation trials, eight formulations had all parameters in proven acceptable range. On optimization, one formulation with independent variables, PVP-CL 5. 67 %, PVP-K 30 1. 00 %, Starch- 1500 5. 76 % was selected. The optimized formulation was comparable to the reference product on the market with similarity factor (f 2) and difference factor (f 1) within the acceptable range for both Lamivudine and TDF...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{range of}} meat {{products}} with food fibers can be rather wide. The {{choice of the}} corresponding type of fibers or creation of a mixed product according to specific objectives allows to develop the products enriched with fibers, or products with the high content of fibers which possess pleasant taste. The right choice of fibers also gives technological and economic advantages. Concrete functional properties of polysaccharides, obviously, are connected with their spatial structure. Experience of food technologies with all evidence testifies to it. Ability to thicken water solutions are among such properties, to form jellies, to create emulsions, foams, to act as their stabilizers, to connect heavy metals, etc. Beet and wheat celluloses promote preservation of juiciness and decrease in losses at heat treatment, stabilize a good trade dress of finished products from chopped meat. Their introduction in minced products – chopped semi-finished products, pastes, canned food is most expedient. The amount of food fibers brought in compounding of products, is caused by touch properties of products and can differ for different types of food fibers. For the purpose of improvement of quality and expansion {{of the range of}} meat products studied properties of food fibers of a domestic production of ECOLIGHT native (JSC EFKO-NT). For an assessment of possibility of use of preparations in technology of meat products investigated the microbiological status and the maintenance of ions of heavy metals in objects according to requirements the SanPiN 2. 3. 2. 1078 - 01. An inspection of harmlessness of cellulose of food fibers "ECOLIGHT native" was carried out on the Paramecium caudatum biotest culture. For definition of conditions of application of a preparation of food fibers of beet cellulose "ECOLIGHT native" investigated functional and technological and commodity properties of granules of food fibers "ECOLIGHT native", developed with their application of a compounding and technical documentation on production of <b>ready-made</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
