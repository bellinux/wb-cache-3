40|$|Aims To {{determine}} the cost savings of pharmacist initiated changes to hospitalized patients 2 ̆ 7 drug therapy or management in eight major acute care government funded teaching hospitals in Australia. Methods This was a prospective study performed in eight hospitals examining resource implications of pharmacists 2 ̆ 7 interventions assessed {{by an independent}} clinical panel. Pharmacists providing clinical services to inpatients recorded details of interventions, defined as any action that directly resulted in a change to patient management or therapy. An independent clinical review panel, convened at each participating centre, confirmed or rejected the clinical pharmacist 2 ̆ 7 s assessment of the impact on length of stay (LOS), <b>readmission</b> probability, medical <b>procedures</b> and laboratory monitoring and quantified the resultant changes, which were then costed. Results A total of 1399 interventions were documented. Eight hundred and thirty-five interventions impacted on drug costs alone. Five hundred and eleven interventions were evaluated by the independent panels with three quarters of these confirmed as {{having an impact on}} one or more of: length of stay, <b>readmission</b> probability, medical <b>procedures</b> or laboratory monitoring. There were 96 interventions deemed by the independent panels to have reduced LOS and 156 reduced the potential for readmission. The calculated savings was 263 221 for the eight hospitals during the period of the study. This included 150 307 for length of stay reduction, 111 848 for readmission reduction. Conclusions The annualized cost savings relating to length of stay, <b>readmission,</b> drugs, medical <b>procedures</b> and laboratory monitoring as a result of clinical pharmacist initiated changes to hospitalized patient management or therapy was 4 444 794 for eight major acute care government funded teaching hospitals in Australia...|$|R
40|$|The {{escalating}} cost {{burden of}} hospital readmission has prompted recent nationwide efforts {{aimed at reducing}} the incidence of this important quality measure. Because patients undergoing vascular surgery account for {{a significant proportion of}} readmissions, vascular surgeons may face reduced reimbursements in the near future if these trends continue. However, risk factors associated with readmission remain poorly defined, and {{further research is needed to}} identify interventions that will prevent <b>readmission</b> following vascular <b>procedures.</b> Accordingly, this manuscript will (1) propose a conceptual model to explain the driving forces behind readmissions in vascular surgery, (2) review current evidence directed at identifying risk factors and evaluating interventions to reduce readmissions across different medical and surgical specialties, and (3) identify key areas in patient care where targeted research or interventions may be implemented in vascular surgery...|$|R
40|$|Background: Routinely {{collected}} electronic patient {{records are}} already {{widely used in}} epidemiological research. In this work we investigated the potential for using them to identify endpoints in clinical trials. Methods: The events recorded in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), a large clinical trial of pravastatin in middle-aged hypercholesterolaemic men in the 1990 s, were compared {{with those in the}} record-linked deaths and hospitalisations records routinely collected in Scotland. Results: We matched 99 % of fatal study events by date. We showed excellent matching (97 %) of the causes of fatal endpoint events and good matching (. 80 % for first events) of the causes of nonfatal endpoint events with a slightly lower rate of mismatching of record linkage than study events (19 % of first study myocardial infarctions (MI) and 4 % of first record linkage MIs not matched as MI). We also investigated the matching of non-endpoint events and showed a good level of matching, with. 78 % of first stroke/TIA events being matched as stroke/TIA. The primary reasons for mismatches were record linkage data recording <b>readmissions</b> for <b>procedures</b> or previous events, differences between the diagnoses in the routinely collected data and the conclusions of the clinical trial expert adjudication committee, events occurring outside Scotland and therefore being missed by record linkage data, miscoding of cardiac events in hospitalisations data as ‘unspecified chest pain’, some general miscoding in the record linkage data and some record linkage errors...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveVascular surgery {{patients}} have high readmission rates, and identification of high-risk groups {{that may be}} amenable to targeted interventions is an important strategy for readmission prevention. This study aimed to determine predictors of unplanned readmission and develop a risk score for predicting readmissions after vascular surgery. MethodsThe National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for 2011 was queried for major vascular surgical procedures. The primary end point was unplanned 30 -day readmissions. The data were randomly split into two-thirds for development and one-third for validation. Multivariable logistic regression was used to create and validate a point score system to predict unplanned readmissions. ResultsOverall, 24, 929 patients were included, with 2507 readmissions (10. 1 %). A point-based scoring system was developed {{with the use of}} factors predictive for <b>readmission,</b> including <b>procedure</b> type; discharge destination; race; non-elective presentation; pulmonary, renal, and cardiac comorbidities; diabetes; steroid use; hypoalbuminemia; anemia; venothromboembolism before discharge; graft failure before discharge; and bleeding disorder. The point score stratified patients into 3 groups: low risk (0 - 3 points) with a readmission rate of 5. 4 %, moderate risk (4 - 7 points) with a readmission rate of 8. 6 %, and high risk (≥ 8 points) with a readmission rate of 16. 4 %. The model had a C-statistic = 0. 67. ConclusionsThrough the use of patient, operative, and predischarge events, this novel vascular surgery-specific readmission score accurately identified patients at high risk for 30 -day unplanned readmission. This model could help direct discharge and home health care resources to patients at high risk, ultimately reducing readmissions and improving efficiency...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} outcome of laparoscopic urinary tract {{reconstruction}} (LUTR) in children weighing 10 kg or less with a weight-matched cohort undergoing open urinary tract reconstruction surgery (OUTR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients weighing 10 kg or less {{at the time of}} surgery who underwent open or laparoscopic pyeloplasty, transuretero-ureterostomy and ipsilateral uretero-ureterostomy between January 2000 and May 2007. The following information was recorded: body weight, age, sex, diagnosis, type of procedure, operative time, estimated blood loss, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin levels, length of hospitalization, length of follow up, use of drains and stents, intraoperative and postoperative analgesic requirement, need for <b>readmission,</b> subsequent <b>procedures,</b> costs, complications and reoperations. RESULTS: There were 52 patients divided into two groups: LUTR (n= 23) and OUTR (n= 29). Median weight (range) and follow up was 6. 2 kg (3. 9 - 10) and 9 months and 6. 5 kg (4. 7 - 9. 6) and 31 months for LUTR and OUTR, respectively. Mean operative time for LUTR (including cystoscopy and stent placement) was 237 min and for OUTR 128 min (P< 0. 01). There were no differences in blood loss, intra- or postoperative analgesic requirement, results or complications. Mean hospitalization time was shorter for LUTR than OUTR (2 and 3 days, respectively). There were no differences in hospital costs between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic reconstructive surgery for congenital urological anomalies is safe and effective in small infants and can be performed with outcomes comparable to that of open surgery...|$|R
40|$|We {{used the}} Health Services Commission data from Manitoba, Canada to {{identify}} complications resulting from hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and prostatectomy {{which led to}} hospital <b>readmissions.</b> For each <b>procedure,</b> two specialists independently judged whether the readmissions were for surgery-related complications {{on the basis of}} liberally interpreted literature guidelines. Then, each pair of physicians met to resolve differences; only complications agreed upon by physicians were retained in our computer-based analysis. The analysis was done in three steps: algorithms were developed using guidelines from the literature, physician input, and 1974 hospital claims; these were then modified using 1975 data; finally, the algorithms were tested with 1976 data. The computerized algorithms developed were compared with the clinical decisions of physician panels. The results showed high specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value. Given the increasing availability of routinely collected data bases, the possibilities for inexpensively monitoring the outcomes of different providers and institutions are appealing. More extensive validation and application of the methodology to a greater number of procedures are necessary to implement such a program...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIndividuals with {{congenital}} heart defects (CHDs) {{have high}} hospital resource use. We sought to identify {{factors associated with}} hospital costs and multiple hospitalizations among individuals with CHDs. MethodsData from the 2006 to 2011 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Arkansas State Inpatient Databases were linked across encrypted patient identifiers to develop a cohort of Arkansas residents aged 1 to 64 years who were hospitalized at least once with a CHD during this time period. Infants were excluded because patient identifiers were missing for 18 to 52 % each year. CHDs were identified using principal and secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses codes. All hospitalizations of individuals ever admitted with a CHD were included. Mean and median patient-level costs were estimated; the association of hospital costs and patient readmissions were examined with linear and logistic regression. ResultsThere were 1, 185, 868 inpatient hospitalizations of Arkansas residents aged 1 to 64 years between 2006 and 2011; these were accrued by 603, 925 patients. Of those, 2542 patients (0. 42 %) {{had at least one}} hospitalization with a CHD diagnosis. Total costs for these 2542 patients were $ 126, 999, 837 and they accumulated 7898 hospitalizations. Factors associated with increased costs included patient age, CHD type, cardiac procedures, and comorbidities. Factors associated with hospital readmission within 1 year included age, CHD type, expected payer, and comorbidities. ConclusionIndividuals with CHDs in Arkansas experience variation in hospital use and costs by patient characteristics. Future research should investigate factors associated with <b>readmissions,</b> cardiac <b>procedures,</b> and comorbidities, as these are strongly associated with hospital costs.

40|$|BackgroundNon-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS) after {{orthotopic}} liver transplantation (OLT) have {{a negative}} influence on graft survival. Expert opinion suggests a negative effect of NAS on other important aspects of post-transplant care, although its impact is largely unknown as data are scarce. MethodsThis retrospective single center study analyzed data on healthcare consumption, use of ionizing radiation, infectious complications and development of highly resistant microorganisms (HRMO) in adult patients with NAS. A comparison with a matched control group was made. ResultsForty-three liver recipients with NAS and 43 controls were included. Hospital admissions were higher in patients with NAS. Most common reason for admission was bacterial cholangitis (BC), with 70 % of the patients having at least one episode compared to 9 % {{in the control group}}. In patients with NAS, 67 % received at least one ERCP compared to 21 % in the control group (p = 0. 001). This resulted in a larger yearly received radiation dose for patients with NAS (p = 0. 001). Frequency of intravenous antibiotic therapy was higher (p = 0. 001) for patients with NAS, consistently resulting in a higher number of cultures found with HRMO (p = 0. 012).

Conclusions The current literature on preventable readmissions in the US contains evidence from a variety of patient populations, geographical locations, healthcare settings, study designs, clinical and theoretical perspectives, and conditions. However, definitional variations, clear gaps, and methodological challenges limit translation of this literature into guidance for the operation and management of healthcare organizations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{financial}} implications of antitachycardia pacing {{in patients with}} frequent supraventricular tachycardia. PATIENTS [...] Intertach pacemakers were implanted in 25 patients (mean age 47 years, five men) : 22 had atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia. The patients had failed a mean of 4. 9 (range zero to eight) drugs and had been admitted to hospital 3. 7 (zero to 31) times over a symptomatic period of 13. 9 years (two months to 54 years). RESULTS [...] The mean admission time for implantation was 2. 8 (two to seven) days. One patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome subsequently underwent surgery. Infection occurred in two patients, and pain over the pacemaker required its resiting in two. Two patients have had one admission each for tachycardia. Six patients remain on anti-arrhythmic drugs. Costs were calculated including value added tax, capital charges, and allocated overheads. The cost a year before pacing was 1174 pounds including drug costs, clinic visits, and hospital admissions. The mean cost of pacemaker implantation was 3364. 22 pounds, including the pacemaker and lead, admission and <b>procedure,</b> <b>readmissions</b> and first pacing check. Subsequent annual follow up cost was 73. 72 pounds including annual clinic visits and drug costs. The cost of pacing is 4241 pounds whereas medical management costs 7044 pounds assuming pacemaker life of six years: with a 10 year life the cost is 4537 pounds compared with 11, 740 pounds: with a 12 year life the cost is 4685 pounds compared with 14, 088 pounds. CONCLUSION [...] The excess cost of implantation of an antitachycardia pacemaker is minimal in patients with frequent supraventricular tachycardia despite drug treatment and is justified by excellent control of symptoms and reduction of drug use and hospital admissions...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} examine trends in mortality, readmission, and costs among Medicare {{beneficiaries}} receiving ventricular assist devices (VADs) and associations between hospital-level procedure volume and outcomes. BackgroundVADs are an option for patients with advanced heart failure, but temporal changes in outcomes and associations between facility-level volume and outcomes are poorly understood. MethodsThis is a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure who received an implantable VAD between 2006 and 2011. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine temporal changes in mortality, <b>readmission,</b> and hospital-level <b>procedure</b> volume. ResultsAmong 2, 507 patients who received a VAD at 103 centers during the study period, the in-hospital mortality decreased from 30 % to 10 % (p < 0. 001), the 1 -year mortality decreased from 42 % to 26 % (p < 0. 001), and the all-cause readmission was frequent (82 % and 81 %; p = 0. 70). After covariate adjustment, in-hospital and 1 -year mortality decreased (p < 0. 001 for both), but the all-cause readmission did not change (p = 0. 82). Hospitals with a low procedure volume had higher risks of in-hospital mortality (risk ratio: 1. 72; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 28 to 2. 33) and 1 -year mortality (risk ratio: 1. 55; 95 % CI: 1. 24 to 1. 93) than high-volume hospitals. Procedure volume {{was not associated with}} risk of readmission. The greatest cost was from the index hospitalization and remained unchanged ($ 204, 020 in 2006 and $ 201, 026 in 2011; p = 0. 21). ConclusionsShort- and long-term mortality after VAD implantation among Medicare beneficiaries improved, but readmission remained similar over time. A higher volume of VAD implants was associated with lower risk of mortality but not readmission. Costs to Medicare have not changed in recent years...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInvasive {{procedures}} {{for treatment of}} trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) include percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation (PRT), partial sensory rhizotomy (PSR), and microvascular decompression (MVD). Using a nationwide discharge registry from The Netherlands, we assessed the frequency of use and patient characteristics, and evaluated treatment failure for each patient undergoing PRT, PSR, or MVD from January 2002 through December 2004. Only patients without a procedure in the year prior were included. Primary outcome was <b>readmission</b> for repeat <b>procedures</b> for TGN or known complications within 1 year. Comparability of patient populations was assessed through propensity scores based on hospital, age, sex, and comorbidity. Conditional logistic regression matched on propensity score was used to calculate relative risks (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for repeat procedures or complications. During the study period, 672 patients with TGN underwent PRT, 39 underwent PSR, and 87 underwent MVD. Hospital type was the predominant determinant of procedure type; age, sex, and comorbidity were weak predictors. The RR for repeat {{procedures for}} PSR was 0. 21 (95 % CI: 0. 07 to 0. 65) and for MVD was 0. 13 (95 % CI: 0. 05 to 0. 35) compared with PRT (RR 1). For complications, the RR of PSR was 5. 36 (95 % CI: 1. 46 to 19. 64) and of MVD was 4. 40 (95 % CI: 1. 44 to 13. 42). Sex, urbanization, and comorbidity did not influence prognosis, but hospital and surgical volume did. In conclusion, although PSR and MVD {{are associated with a}} lower risk of repeat procedure than PRT, they seem to be more prone to complications requiring hospital readmission. Microvascular decompression and partial sensory rhizotomy are associated with a lower risk of undergoing a repeat procedure compared with percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation but are more prone to complications requiring readmission to hospital...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Current {{approaches}} to quantifying total posthospital complications and <b>readmissions</b> following surgical <b>procedures</b> are limited because the United States {{does not have}} a single health care payer. Patients seek posthospital care in varied locations, yet hospitals can only quantify those returning to the same facility. Seeking information directly from patients about health care utilization following hospital discharge holds promise to provide data that is missing for surgeons and health care systems. BACKGROUND: Because total joint replacement (TJR) is the most common and costly elective surgical hospitalization, we examined the concordance between patients 2 ̆ 7 self-report of potential short-term complications and their readmissions and our review of medical records in the initial hospital and surrounding facilities. METHODS: Patients undergoing primary total hip or knee replacement from July 1, 2011, through December 3, 2012, at a large site participating in a national cohort of TJR patients were identified. Patients completed a six-month postoperative survey regarding emergency department (ED), day surgery (DS), or inpatient care for possible medical or mechanical post-TJR complications. We reviewed inpatient and outpatient medical records from all regional facilities and examined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive- and negative predictive values for patient self-report and medical records. FINDINGS: There were 413 patients who had 431 surgeries and completed the six-month questionnaire. Patients reported 40 medical encounters (9 percent) including ED, DS or inpatient care, of which 20 percent occurred at hospitals different from the initial surgery. Review of medical records revealed 9 additional medical encounters that patients had not mentioned including five hospitalizations following surgery and four ED visits. Overall patient self-report of ED, DS, and inpatient care for possible complications was both sensitive (82 percent) and specific (100 percent). The positive predictive value was 100 percent and negative predictive value 98 percent. DISCUSSION: Patient self-report of posthospital events was accurate. Substantial numbers of patients required care at outlying hospitals (not where the TJR occurred). CONCLUSION: Methods that directly engage patients can augment current posthospital utilization surveillance to assure complete data...|$|R
40|$|Patient {{satisfaction}} and 30 -day hospital readmission rates are metrics {{used to assess}} quality of patient care. Dissatisfied patients pose {{a high risk of}} readmission (Boulding, Glickman, Manary, Schulman, Staelin, 2011) and during the vulnerable discharge period, 1 in 7 patients may experience an unavoidable readmission within 30 -days post-procedure (Jencks, Williams, 2 ̆ 6 Coleman, 2009). Successful patient education programs have been linked to improved patient {{satisfaction and}} subsequently reduced unnecessary readmissions (Murdock 2 ̆ 6 Griffin, 2013; Hansen et al., 2011). In an effort to increase satisfaction and reduce readmissions much of the healthcare community’s attention has turned to interventions that have these primary aims. Increased patient satisfaction and 30 -day hospital <b>readmission</b> reduction post <b>procedure</b> have not been excessively studied in the cardiac arrhythmia ablation population, however these patients often present to their follow up appointments reporting that the procedure was not what was expected and report readmissions that could have been avoided (Ezzat, Chew, McCready, Lambiase, Chow, Lowe, Rowland, 2 ̆ 6 Segal, 2013). Utilizing a framework of the Health Belief Model (Janz 2 ̆ 6 Becker, 1984), an enhanced post cardiac arrhythmia ablation education intervention based on the Project Red framework for re-engineering the discharge process, was delivered to patients in one practice who underwent cardiac arrhythmia ablation procedure with the aim of increasing patient awareness of their disease, clarifying post procedural expectations with the aim of increasing patient satisfaction, and reducing 30 -day readmission rate in this population by providing the patient with education necessary to make an informed medical decision on when to seek care. Results of this study support the implementation of enhanced patient education intervention during the vulnerable 24 - 72 hour post discharge period by showing a higher total patient satisfaction score in the group receiving the intervention (M= 633, SD= 78) compared to (M= 508, SD= 137) in the control group with a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups (p=. 005).

40|$|AbstractObjective: Early {{hospital}} <b>readmissions</b> after cardiac <b>procedures</b> {{are both}} costly and harmful to patients. We investigated {{the factors that}} predispose to readmission to develop strategies to minimize this problem. Methods: As part of a prospective data collection, patients having cardiac procedures at our institution are routinely tracked for 30 days after their discharge from the hospital. We reviewed 2650 patients in our cardiac database who underwent operations over the past 5 years. We used univariate and multivariate statistical techniques to identify risks for readmission. Results: Of 2574 discharged patients, 252 (9. 8 %) required readmission. The most common causes of readmission are cardiac (42 %), pulmonary (19 %), gastrointestinal (10 %), extremity complications (6. 7 %; deep vein thrombophlebitis, peripheral arterial vascular disease, and saphenous vein harvest site problems), sternal wound problems (7. 5 %), and metabolic problems (4 %). Of more than 70 variables studied, only 6 are significant multivariate predictors of readmission: female sex (P =. 002); diabetes (P =. 001); chronic lung problems (P =. 011); increased distance between home and hospital (P >. 001); preoperative atrial fibrillation (P =. 002); and preoperative chronic renal insufficiency (P =. 002). Type of operation, redo procedures, and other intraoperative and postoperative variables are not important multivariate predictors of readmission. Prolonged hospital length of stay for the initial procedure did not cause more frequent readmission. The costs of initial hospitalization (operating room costs combined with postoperative in-hospital costs) were not significantly increased in those patients who required readmission. Conclusions: The high-risk patient for readmission is a woman with diabetes, chronic lung disease, renal insufficiency, and preoperative atrial fibrillation who lives {{at a distance from}} the hospital. Readmission does not depend on periprocedural variables (eg, cardiopulmonary bypass time) or on postoperative complications. High procedural costs from the initial hospitalization do not predispose to readmission. These results suggest interventions that may reduce readmission.

40|$|ObjectiveManagement {{of lower}} {{extremity}} arterial disease with endovascular intervention {{is on the}} rise. Current practice patterns vary widely across and within specialty practices that perform endovascular intervention. This study evaluated reimbursement and costs of different approaches for offering endovascular intervention and identified strategies to improve cost-efficiency. MethodsThe medical records of all patients admitted to a university health system during 2005 for an endovascular intervention were retrospectively reviewed. Procedure type, setting, admission status, and financial data were recorded. Groups were compared using analysis of variance, Student t test for independent samples, and χ 2. ResultsA total of 296 endovascular interventions were completed, and 184 (62 %) met inclusion criteria. Atherectomy and stenting were significantly more costly when performed {{in the operating room}} than in the radiology suite: atherectomy, $ 6596 vs $ 4867 (P =. 002); stent, $ 5884 vs $ 3292, (P <. 001); angioplasty, $ 2251 vs $ 1881 (P =. 46). Reimbursement was significantly higher for inpatient vs ambulatory admissions (P <. 001). Costs were lowest when the endovascular intervention was done in the radiology suite on an ambulatory basis and highest when done as an inpatient in the operating room ($ 5714 vs $ 12, 278; P <. 001). Contribution margins were significantly higher for inpatients. Net profit was appreciated only for interventions done as an inpatient in the radiology suite. Reimbursement, contribution margins, and net profit were significantly lower among private pay patients in both the ambulatory and inpatient setting. The 30 -day hospital <b>readmission</b> after ambulatory <b>procedures</b> was seven patients (6 %). ConclusionsPractice patterns for endovascular interventions differ considerably. Costs vary by procedure and setting, and reimbursement depends on admission status and accurate documentation; these dynamics affect affordability. Organizing vascular services within a hub will ensure that care is delivered in the most cost-efficient manner. Guidelines may include designating the radiology suite as the primary venue for endovascular interventions because it is less costly than the operating room. Selective stenting policies should be considered. Contracts with private insurers must include carve-outs for stent costs and commensurate reimbursement for ambulatory procedures, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT; American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) coding must be proficient to make ambulatory endovascular interventions fiscally acceptable...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS) are a {{frequent}} complication seen after liver transplantation {{for which the}} exact pathogenesis is still unknown. NAS can be classified as a heterogeneous group of biliary strictures varying in anatomical location and severity. NAS can manifest itself in the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts and can comprise a single or multiple strictures. Development of NAS after liver transplantation often results in cholestasis, jaundice, recurrent cholangitis and billiary cirrhosis. Objective: Non-anastomotic biliary strictures after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have a negative influence on graft survival. Impact of NAS on other important aspects of post-transplant care is largely unknown. Aim {{of this study was}} to determine the impact of NAS on healthcare consumption, radiation exposure, infectious events and antibiotic use. Patients and methods: Data was retrospectively collected from medical records of patients undergoing OLT at the University Medical Center Groningen between 1999 and 2009. Patients with NAS were included. Children and patients with NAS due to hepatic artery thrombosis were excluded. Factors associated with health care consumption, use of ionizing radiation, antibiotic therapy, infectious complications and development of multiresistant microorganisms were studied. NAS patients were compared with a control group matched for age, indication for and year of transplantation. Results: 86 patients were reviewed, 43 liver recipients with NAS and 43 control liver recipients. Both total admissions and frequency per patient were significantly higher in the group with NAS. For interventional procedures both percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography were significantly increased in the NAS group in comparison to the control group. With the exception of computed tomography, radiological studies were increased in the NAS group resulting in a significantly higher amount of ionizing radiation received. The amount of positive bacterial blood and bile cultures was higher in the group with NAS and results showed more development of multiresistant microorganisms. Patients with non-anastomotic strictures experienced more episodes of bacterial cholangitis and were more often treated with antibiotics, both therapeutically and prophylactically. Conclusions: Development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures after liver transplantation has a negative effect on several important post-transplant care aspects that were not previously studied. We found an increase in <b>readmission</b> rates, interventional <b>procedures,</b> exposure to ionizing radiation, use of antibiotics and development of multiresistant microorganisms, contributing to patient morbidity, burden and additional healthcare costs. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: {{significant}} {{advances in}} medical therapy for Crohn's disease (CD) {{occurred in the}} last 12 years, mainly due {{to the introduction of}} anti-TNF therapy. Laparoscopic colorectal surgery represented the most important advance on surgical treatment in the management of CD, as it also had developed in the treatment of other conditions. There is a tendency for lower complication rates after laparoscopic bowel resections as compared to open surgery. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze and compare the complication rates after bowel resections for CD between the two approaches in a Brazilian case series. METHODS: this was a retrospective longitudinal study, including CD patients submitted to bowel resections from a single Brazilian Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) referral center, treated between January 2008 and June 2012 with laparoscopic approach (LA) or conventional approach (CA). VARIABLES ANALYZED: age at surgery, gender, Montreal classification, smoking, concomitant medication, type of surgery, surgical approach, presence and type of complication up to 30 days after the <b>procedures.</b> <b>Readmission</b> and reoperation rates, as well as mortality, were also analyzed. Patients were allocated in two groups regarding the type of procedure (LA or CA), and complication rates and characteristics were compared. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney test (quantitative variables) and chi-square test (qualitative variables), with p < 0. 05 considered significant. RESULTS: a total of 46 patients (25 men) were included (16 submitted to LA), with mean age of 38. 1 (&# 177; 12. 7) years. The groups were considered homogeneous according to age, gender, CD location, perianal disease and concomitant medications. There were more patients with fistulizing CD on the CA group (p = 0. 029). The most common procedure performed was ileocolic resection on both groups (56. 7 % of the CA and 75 % of the LA patients - p = 0. 566). Overall, total complications (surgical and medical, including minor and major issues) occurred in 60 % (18 / 30) of the CA group and 12. 5 % (2 / 16) of the LA group (p = 0. 002). Wound infection was the most frequent complication (10 / 30 on CA and 1 / 16 on the LA groups). There were 3 deaths in the CA group. Specific analysis of each complication did not demonstrate any difference between the groups regarding abdominal sepsis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, readmission, reoperations and deaths (p = 0. 074). CONCLUSIONS: there was a higher complication rate in patients operated with CA as compared to LA. This was probably due to patient selection for the laparoscopic approach, with severe cases, mostly due to fistulizing abdominal CD, being operated mainly by open surgery. LA tends to be the recommended approach in most cases of non-complicated CD...|$|R
