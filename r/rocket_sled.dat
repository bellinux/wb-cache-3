5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E

25|$|Test and {{evaluation}} began in February 1957 with <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> tests at Holloman Air Force Base. A B-57 Canberra was modified {{and used as}} a flying engine testbed for the Fairchild J83. Testing of the SM-73 then transitioned to Patrick Air Force Base in June 1957. At Patrick Air Force Base, launch complexes 21 and 22 were constructed near the Cape Canaveral Light to support SM-73 testing. Five dummy booster launches and fifteen test flights were flown between March 1957 and December 1958.|$|E
25|$|Pye Wacket {{was planned}} to be tested using a <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> launcher, with a Mach 5 booster rocket being used later in the test program. There are {{unconfirmed}} reports that some tests were conducted in 1960. However the high cost and perceived vulnerability of the B-70 against the projected performance of Soviet air defenses, combined with the 1960 U-2 incident in which a high-flying spyplane had been shot down, led to the decision that intercontinental ballistic missiles would, in the future, be the primary nuclear delivery force of the United States, and therefore the B-70 project was cancelled in early 1961. Pye Wacket, its delivery vehicle no longer available, {{is believed to have}} been cancelled soon after, although the ultimate fate of the program remains classified.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{companies}} bid {{to build}} the Mercury spacecraft on a $20 million ($ adjusted for inflation) contract. In January 1959, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation was chosen to be prime contractor for the spacecraft. Two weeks earlier, North American Aviation, based in Los Angeles, was awarded a contract for Little Joe, a small rocket {{to be used for}} development of the launch escape system. The World Wide Tracking Network for communication between the ground and spacecraft during a flight was awarded to the Western Electric Company. Redstone rockets for suborbital launches were manufactured in Huntsville, Alabama by the Chrysler Corporation and Atlas rockets by Convair in San Diego, California. For manned launches, the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was made available by the USAF. This was also the site of the Mercury Control Center while the computing center of the communication network was in Goddard Space Center, Maryland. Little Joe rockets were launched from Wallops Island, Virginia. Astronaut training took place at Langley Research Center in Virginia, Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio, and Naval Air Development Center Johnsville in Warminster, PA. Langley wind tunnels together with a <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> track at Holloman Air Force Base at Alamogordo, New Mexico were used for aerodynamic studies. Both Navy and Air Force aircraft were made available {{for the development of the}} spacecraft's landing system, and Navy ships and Navy and Marine Corps helicopters were made available for recovery. South of Cape Canaveral the town of Cocoa Beach boomed. From here, 75,000 people watched the first American orbital flight being launched in 1962.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>sleds</b> {{were used}} {{extensively}} {{early in the}} Cold War to accelerate equipment considered too experimental (hazardous) for testing directly in piloted aircraft. The equipment to be tested under high acceleration or high airspeed conditions was installed along with appropriate instrumentation, data recording and telemetry equipment on the sled. The sled was then accelerated according to the experiment's design requirements for data collection along a length of isolated, precisely level and straight test track.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>sleds</b> at China Lake {{testing ground}} have reached Mach 4 while {{carrying}} 60,000 kg masses. A sled track that gave a Mach {{2 or greater}} launch assist could reduce the fuel to orbit by 40% or more, while helping counter the weight penalty when aiming to make a fully reusable launch vehicle. Angled at 55 degrees to vertical, a track on a tall mountain could allow a single stage to orbit reusable vehicle with no new technology.|$|R
40|$|Several {{possible}} noise simulation {{techniques were}} evaluated, including closed circuit wind tunnels, free jets, <b>rocket</b> <b>sleds</b> and high speed trains.

The first paper describes the selection {{and development of the}} technique and presents results for simulation and in-flight tests of the Learjet, F 106, and Bertin Aerotrain. The second presents a theoretical study relating the two sets of noise signatures. It is concluded that the free jet simulation technique provides a satisfactory assessment of in-flight noise...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{researchers}} took it {{upon themselves}} to serve as crash test dummies. Colonel John Paul Stapp USAF propelled himself over 1000km/h on a <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> and stopped in 1.4 seconds. Lawrence Patrick, then a professor at Wayne State University, endured some 400 rides on a <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> in order to test the effects of rapid deceleration on the human body. He and his students allowed themselves to be smashed in the chest with heavy metal pendulums, impacted in the face by pneumatically driven rotary hammers, and sprayed with shattered glass to simulate window implosion. While admitting that it made him [...] "a little sore", Patrick has said that the research he and his students conducted was seminal in developing mathematical models against which further research could be compared. But while data from live testing was valuable, human subjects could not withstand tests which went past a certain degree of physical injury. To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of subject.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first run}} on the <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> took place [...] on 30 April 1947 with ballast. The sled ran off the tracks. The first human run took place the {{following}} December. Instrumentation on all the early runs was in the developmental stage, {{and it was not}} until August 1948 that it was adequate to begin recording. By August 1948, sixteen human runs had completed, all in the backward-facing position. Forward-facing runs started in August 1949. Most of the earlier tests ran to compare the standard Air Force harnesses with a series of modified harnesses. This was to determine which type gave the best protection to the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|Extensive {{aviation}} {{research was}} also {{conducted on the}} ground at Edwards. Two <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> tracks pioneered important developments and research for the Air Force. The first [...] track was built by Northrop in 1944 near what is currently the North Base. Originally intended to help develop a V-1 flying-bomb-style weapon that never left the drawing board, the track found use after the war as a test area for V-2 rockets captured from Nazi Germany in Operation Paperclip. Later, Lt. Col. John Stapp appropriated the track for his MX981 project and installed what was believed {{to be one of the}} most powerful mechanical braking systems ever constructed. His deceleration tests led the press to nickname him the [...] "fastest man on earth" [...] and the [...] "bravest man in the Air Force".|$|E

2500|$|John Paul Stapp, in 1954, {{sat in a}} <b>rocket</b> <b>sled</b> fired along rails in {{a series}} of {{steadily}} more violent tests. [...] Speeds reached 631mph, almost the speed of sound. [...] This is a speed record for a manned rail vehicle that still stands today. [...] At the end of the track the sled hit a trough of water that brought it to a rapid stop in around 1.4 seconds. [...] In the most severe test, Stapp underwent an acceleration of 20 g as the rocket engine accelerated the vehicle up to speed and 46 g of deceleration (also a record) as the vehicle was brought to a stop. [...] Stapp suffered numerous injuries in these tests (previous animal tests had shown that limbs could be broken merely by being pulled into the air stream), and several concussions. [...] In the last test his eyes were bloodied as blood vessels burst in his eyes.|$|E

It was also necessary to collect data on accident survivability, research for which cadavers were woefully inadequate. In concert with the shortage of cadavers, this need forced researchers to seek other models. A description by Mary Roach of the Eighth Stapp Car Crash and Field Demonstration Conference shows the direction in which research had begun to move. [...] "We saw chimpanzees riding <b>rocket</b> <b>sleds,</b> a bear on an impact swing...We observed a pig, anesthetized and placed in a sitting position on the swing in the harness, crashed into a deep-dish steering wheel at about 10 mph." ...|$|R

Methods for ground testing are described and evaluated, noting that wind tunnel testing is best performed with a symmetry model {{in the absence of a}} moving ground; sled or rail testing is ultimately preferable, though considerably more expensive. Findings are reported on shock-related ground influence on aerodynamic forces and moments in and accelerating through the transonic regime – where force reversals and the early onset of local supersonic flow is prevalent – as well as more predictable behaviours in fully supersonic to hypersonic ground effect flows...|$|R
5000|$|Rocket {{engines are}} {{primarily}} used on <b>rockets,</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>sleds</b> and experimental aircraft. Rocket engines are extremely powerful. The heaviest vehicle ever {{to leave the}} ground, the Saturn V rocket, was powered by five F-1 rocket engines generating a combined 180 million horsepower (134.2 gigawatt). Rocket engines also have no need to [...] "push off" [...] anything, {{a fact that the}} New York Times denied in error. Rocket engines can be particularly simple, sometimes consisting of nothing more than a catalyst, {{as in the case of}} a hydrogen peroxide rocket. This makes them an attractive option for vehicles such as jet packs. Despite their simplicity, rocket engines are often dangerous and susceptible to explosions. The fuel they run off may be flammable, poisonous, corrosive or cryogenic. They also suffer from poor efficiency. For these reasons, rocket engines are only used when absolutely necessary.|$|R
50|$|The rockets first {{available}} to the player have only minor differences, but sleds unlocked later in the game have major stat advantages, i.e. acceleration, top speed, boost, and maneuverability. A new rocket is generally not unlocked by beating levels: it is unlocked when the player steals it from an opponent. Therefore, in order to unlock a certain rocket {{that has not been}} acquired yet, the player must find a level in which a computer-controlled adversary is riding it, knock them off it, jump off their existing rocket, climb onto the target sled, and successfully complete the level. Existing unlocked rockets are not lost when ditched for a newer model. Most of the sleds will also unlock if all of the levels of a certain tier of competition are successfully beaten. The tier that the rocket will be unlocked on is generally one or two tiers after the first level the rocket was introduced. Most of the end-game <b>rockets</b> <b>sleds</b> cannot be unlocked in this way.|$|R
