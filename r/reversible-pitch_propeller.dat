25|$|His first project, {{undertaken}} at McCook Field, in Dayton, Ohio, was for {{the creation}} of a heavily armored attack plane for supporting ground forces. Although the designs that resulted were not practical and did not meet Mitchell's specifications for aircraft that could land troops behind enemy lines, the project led Mitchell to closely supervise aircraft development, not only at McCook but in Europe as well. On October 30, 1919, the McCook Field engineers tested the first <b>reversible-pitch</b> <b>propeller.</b>|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} {{as possible to}} speed up construction, but the first flight was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing <b>reversible-pitch</b> <b>propellers</b> and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. It eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|R
500|$|The 509th {{transferred}} {{four of its}} 14 training Silverplate B-29s to the 216th AAF Base Unit in February 1945. In April {{the third}} modification increment of Silverplates, which would be their combat aircraft, began coming off the Martin-Omaha assembly line. These [...] "fly-away" [...] aircraft were equipped with fuel-injected engines, Curtiss Electric <b>reversible-pitch</b> <b>propellers,</b> pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements. The remaining 17 Silverplate B-29s were placed in storage. Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert pumpkin bombs before Tibbets declared his group combat-ready.|$|R
5000|$|The On Mark Engineering Company was {{involved}} in the maintenance and conversion of Douglas A-26 Invaders for both civil and military customers from 1954 to mid-1970s, The first conversions mainly involved the removal of military equipment and replacement with fairings and civil avionics, sealing of the bomb bay doors, soundproofing, and additional cabin windows. The original [...] "gunner's hatch" [...] was replaced with a larger retractable entrance door, and room for baggage was provided in the nose section. They had improved brake systems and fuel systems and uprated engines with <b>reversible-pitch</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Exmouth {{became the}} first major British warship to be powered by gas turbine engines alone when, in 1966, she was taken in hand and was {{refitted}} with a combined gas or gas (COGOG) arrangement. The main reason behind the conversion of Exmouth was to trial the (then) new Marine Olympus which had been selected as the turbine for the Type 82 destroyer and the Type 19 high-speed anti-submarine frigate. Therefore, she was fitted with a Bristol Siddeley Olympus TM1 of 24,000 shp (limited to [...] due to gearbox and shaft limitations) for full power and two Bristol Siddeley Proteus 10M (3,500 shp each) for fuel-efficient cruising. These engines drove the single shaft through a common gearbox. The Proteus engines could work alone or together, but could not be run together with the Olympus. As the engines could not run in reverse, a <b>reversible-pitch</b> <b>propeller</b> was installed. As the engines could be controlled directly from throttles on the bridge, bridge steering was fitted. The requisite air intakes and filters were grouped amidships and the turbine uptakes exhausted into a common, streamlined funnel, completely changing Exmouths appearance. The exhaust and intake trunking was also utilised to allow the removal of complete engines, giving a rapid 24-hour exchange time.|$|E
5|$|The 509th Composite Group had an {{authorized}} strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, {{almost all of}} whom eventually deployed to Tinian. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from Project Alberta, known as the 1st Technical Detachment. The 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron was equipped with 15 Silverplate B-29s. These aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons, and were equipped with fuel-injected engines, Curtiss Electric <b>reversible-pitch</b> <b>propellers,</b> pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements.|$|R
5|$|The final wartime Silverplates {{incorporated}} all technical {{improvements to}} B-29 aircraft, {{as well as}} the final series of Silverplate modifications that included Curtiss Electric <b>reversible-pitch</b> <b>propellers,</b> and pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors. The British F-type bomb release and G-type attachment were installed, along with dual electrical and mechanical bomb release mechanisms. Early model B-29s were plagued by a host of engine problems, and the early Silverplate bombers were no exception. One was written off after being badly damaged {{as a result of an}} engine fire in February 1945. The fuel-injected Wright R-3350-41 engines in the later model bombers delivered in July and August 1945 were greatly improved and far more reliable. This was an important factor in the success of the 509th Composite Group's operations.|$|R

50|$|The test {{crews were}} {{impressed}} with its unique <b>reversible-pitch</b> inboard <b>propellers</b> and the Davis wing which gave it excellent landing performance. However, they found a number of faults: the cockpit had an extremely high noise level and a poor instrument layout, the bombardier's vision was impaired, it was overweight and the nacelle design resulted in frequent engine fires (a deficiency shared with the B-29 Superfortress). However, the testing missions were mostly successful.|$|R
