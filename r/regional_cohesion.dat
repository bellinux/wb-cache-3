40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine the Italian {{regional}} policies {{launched in the}} second half of the 1990 s. In evaluating the discrepancy between targets and results I argue that the failure of regional policies is a facet of the more general failure of Italian economic policies in the last fifteen years. Two main aspects are highlighted: the effectiveness of regional policies has been affected by national legal rules that have had different effects across regions; the effectiveness of regional policies has been diminished also by attributing importance to regional governments as control centres of public intervention.

40|$|The article {{reviews the}} main {{theories}} {{of development in}} order to provide a solid background to discuss {{one of the most important}} EU policies – the <b>Regional</b> and <b>Cohesion</b> Policy. Firstly, its weight is given by the fact it represents EU’s major development policy, by means of which the EU decision-makers have tried to maintain a balanced growth. Secondly, its special relevance is due to the fact that it represents „a spatial combination of a variety of sectoral policies“ (Hooghe, 1996, 10), a genuine crossroads where these sectoral policies meet. EU regions – the focus of <b>Regional</b> and <b>Cohesion</b> Policy – are testing grounds where sector-driven initiatives are tested, confirmed, invalidated, or improved. The new design of the policy is discussed in the context created by the global economic crisis that puts cohesion to a severe test. Just like other phenomena that we can witness today, the crisis only has enforced and strengthened pre-existing trends, among which the shift from convergence and cohesion towards competitiveness as such appears to be the most prominent one...|$|R

5000|$|Its {{permanent}} collection covers {{the history of}} the state and is divided into two halls: one for archeology and the other for history starting from the Spanish conquest [...] The exhibits are labeled in Spanish although many also have English labels as well. The archeology hall is dedicated to the state’s pre Hispanic history from the prehistoric to just before the arrival of the Spanish, focusing on the Zoque and Maya cultures native to the state. [...] The items on display are divided into three periods of time. The first is the Preclassic, which begins with the establishment of agricultural settlements from between 2000 and 1000 BCE to about 300 BCE. This era is dominated by the Olmec expansion as well as the height of native cities such as Izapa and Chiapa de Corzo. The Classic Period (300 BCE to 900 CE) is distinguished by the rise of the Maya civilization, with some notable Zoque settlements. The Post Classic is marked by the fall of the great Mayan cities around 900 CE and extends to the arrival of the Spanish. In this area of Mesoamerica, the native peoples dispersed into small isolated communities without <b>regional</b> <b>cohesion.</b> In the latter part of this period, the Aztecs from the Mexican Plateau began to make incursions here, conquering the Central Valley and Soconusco regions. The pieces on display are accompanied by diagrams, maps and reproductions of pre Hispanic murals to give context.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent of <b>regional</b> <b>cohesion</b> amongst European regions; an issue of {{emerging}} importance in the fast growing literature on regional economics. <b>Regional</b> <b>cohesion</b> is a complex phenomenon, based upon {{a number of factors}} and determined to a considerable extent by regional policies. This paper aims to shed some further light on the question of <b>regional</b> <b>cohesion</b> by taking into account the impact of the existing technological gaps across regions. <b>Regional</b> <b>cohesion</b> is examined in terms of labour productivity for the NUTS- 2 regions of the EU- 27 during the time period 1995 - 2006. The results suggest the existence of two separate groups or clubs. The first includes regions from advanced northern European countries, while the members in the second club are mainly found in the new member-states and in southern European countries, putting the issue of European regional policy into a fresh premise. From the perspective of <b>regional</b> <b>cohesion</b> (or equity), the distinct regional groupings can be deemed as ‘Macro-Regions’.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} a scientific and practical {{problem of how}} the regional characteristics referred to as competitiveness can be employed in enhancing the efficiency of planning its economic and social develop­ment. The aim of the paper is to substantiate the relevance of regional competitiveness concept as the ob­jective of strategic development of the region. The {{first part of the}} paper presents statistical data of regional development in Lithuania. They illustrate that the current principles of organizing regional development fail to produce desirable results. The conclusion is that the paradigm of regional development focused on <b>regional</b> <b>cohesion</b> should be changed into the paradigm of developing regional competitiveness. The second part analyses the role of the regional competitiveness concept in the development process as well as its interrelation with <b>regional</b> <b>cohesion.</b> It was found that the functional approach to <b>regional</b> <b>cohesion</b> provides the possibility to declare competitiveness as one of the main objectives of regional development. The third part discusses such features of competitiveness concept as abstractness, relativity and probabilistic nature, which are to be considered in strategic planning by identifying competitiveness as an objective of regional development. Besides, the abstract nature of competitiveness concept enables creating operational defini­tions of competitiveness which can be practically used as guidelines (partial goals) of regional development...|$|E
