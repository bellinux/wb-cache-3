40|$|Abstract: Section 82 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 (the Companies Act 2008), makes {{provision}} for <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> of companies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>register</b> of <b>the</b> Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC). Companies may be deregistered {{for failure to}} file annual returns for two consecutive years, if it appears they have been inactive for at least seven years, or if the company requests a deregistration if {{it is no longer}} carrying on business or after winding up. The effect of deregistration is that the company will cease to exist from date of its <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> company <b>register.</b> It loses its corporate existence and capacity. The property it held before deregistration will vest in the state automatically without a need for its delivery. This position will affect various stakeholders of the company. For instance, company creditors will {{no longer be able to}} claim their debts, as they cannot even litigate against a deregistered company. For creditors to recover their debts, they have to apply for reinstatement of the company in terms of section 83 (4) of the Companies Act 2008. The legislation can mitigate the effects of deregistration by, for instance, making it possible for all stakeholders to file objection to the intended deregistration and/or requiring the CIPC to follow a liquidation process when companies are deregistered, unless there are no assets to be liquidated. This research will also analyse the effect of deregistration in terms of Australian Corporations Act of 2001. Even though deregistration leads to companies ceasing to exist and property vesting in the state, the Australian Corporations Act makes further provision relating to the state taking responsibility to settle certain claims despite the company debtor being deregistered. This reduces the burden on the creditors, as they do not always have to apply for reinstatement in order to claim their debts. LL. M. (Corporate Law...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{demonstrate}} {{that it will be}} rarely the case that charities can be removed from the register and it will be even rarer for both the governing instrument ofa charity and its property to be removed. The research methods employed included a review of literature, case law and experience drawn from working as a lawyer at the Charity Commission from 1988 - 1993 and subsequently in private practice to the present day. In Chapter 6 documentary analysis was undertaken when examining the issue of <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>register</b> in the context of Charity Commission inquiries through an examination of inquiry reports over a two-year period between 2003 - 2004. The research methods used have been followed with a view to securing an upto- date objective analysis ofthe law {{as it relates to the}} removal of charities from the register and then an analysis of the Charity Commission's approach to the removal of charities from the register. The thesis is written on the basis that the Charities and Companies Acts 2006 have been implemented. Otherwise the law is stated as it exists on 1 st October 2007.

50|$|Constellation’s repairs cost $277,116 in 1853-54, {{for which}} funds were {{included}} in the nation’s 1853 annual budget. The amount was significantly less than the cost of the frigate Congress, which was $421,592 in 1841. It is also factual that USS Germantown, which was built in 1846, was the last wooden all-sail warship built for the United States Navy. A Constellation built of all new materials and equipment to John Lenthall’s plan would have cost $600,000 in the mid 1850s, due to the fast-climbing labor costs at the navy-owned shipyards. Constellation retained its razee frigate rate, as did Macedonian, until Congress passed legislation in 1858, which allowed the Navy to rerate the sail-powered frigates. Only President Fillmore had the power to approve the destruction of Constellation and authorize its <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Navy Vessel <b>Register,</b> which he did not exercise.|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers of Rigvir have {{a history}} of {{receiving}} fines for off-label marketing this anti-cancer drug directly to general public and cancer patients. [...] Oncologists and other medical experts in Latvia have repeatedly expressed the concern for the lack of clinical trials and evidence of efficacy, as well as unethical advertising. In February 2017, Association of Oncologists, Association of Chemotherapists, Association of Rare Diseases of Latvia, and the Head of Pharmacology Department of Stradini University submitted a request to the Ministry of Health of Latvia, State Agency of Medicines, and National Health Service. They requested <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> of Rigvir <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Register</b> of Medicines of Latvia and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> list of state-compensated medicines. A revision of clinical treatment guidelines for melanoma was also requested. The request was based on the analysis of available research and suggests that there is no conclusive evidence for the efficacy of Rigvir as a cancer treatment.|$|R
40|$|Initiation of {{bankruptcy}} proceedings that represents an enforced liquidation {{of the enterprise}} and its <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Court <b>Register</b> is very common and inevitable event nowadays. Bankruptcy is usually seen as the ultimate end of the enterprise, but also {{as an opportunity for}} creditors, who are the most damaged by the insolvency of the enterprise, to reimburse at least a part of their receivables through bankruptcy proceedings. The legal and accounting aspects of the bankruptcy proceedings are elaborated in this paper. Bankruptcy Law of the Republic of Srpska establishes two bankruptcy reasons: insolvency and imminent risk of insolvency. Illustration of a hypothetical example shows how, after {{the decision was made to}} initiate bankruptcy proceedings, not only the initial but also the final bankruptcy balance sheets are made, bankruptcy quota is determined and how to settle creditors according to the relevant payment line. Finally, an overview of the financial aspects of the implementation of the bankruptcy proceedings is given, i. e. consequences {{of bankruptcy}}, not only for a specific enterprise where such proceedings is conducted, but also on the economy as a whole, especially in the case of bankruptcy of a number of enterprises. However, some questions and dilemmas are left open because Bankruptcy Law does not always contain clear provisions in respect of certain accounting procedures, and there is a problem of lack of financial discipline in our economy, because the bankruptcy proceedings is not always proposed when the conditions are created...|$|R
