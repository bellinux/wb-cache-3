40|$|The {{scientific}} base of {{this research}} has been established at a cross roads. It justifies the view according to which justice can be found outside of the judiciary - at grass roots level of law enforcement justice is moulded and crucial questions of the interests, rights and obligations of legal subjects are deliberated and settled. Justice can thus also be studied and interpreted in light of individual experiences of injustice. Furthermore, the research justifies the opinion {{that there is an}} uninterrupted opportunity for the test of the undecidable, which actively strives to reach a state in which change is possible. In other words, if justice is not at home and visiting somewhere else, there is an opportunity for justice to arrive. Broadening the scope of jurisprudence, without actually naming it sociology of law, is apparent in the research, among others, in its inclination towards sociology, cultural research and criminology. The research outlines the police habitat which, {{in addition to being a}} certain type of environment, a place or a state of mind in which activities are carried out, it is also a product of those same activities. The objective is additionally to describe how much power the police has acquired. The research reveals that the reasons for police misconduct are not simple, neither are they easily controllable. Furthermore, the police has an expanding opportunity for symbolic use of force, which implies a power to construct problems and solutions to such problems. The police is evolving into, if not already become, an expert in processing information. In view of police misconduct, this is a new source of danger as the possibilities for illegal or otherwise inappropriate use of information expand simultaneously. In an attempt to change policing it is necessary at the same time to change police culture and to reinforce its desirable aspects. Despite the dark nature of policing and the culture of policing there is always a possibility for better policing. This is based on the ever evolving culture of the afore mentioned. A change of culture requires the support provided by police officers responsible decision making. Identifying this moment of decision making is in effect an active search for the test of the undecidable which can be the foundation for a change of culture. The principle of conformity to law drives the decision making process towards this end. Change is ever easier if the decision is made by a significant other police officer. In other words, changing policing requires the support of specific important figures in a work community. Police misconduct manifests itself in the research material largely as mundane and bound to the scope of work of police officers. However, due to the amount and breadth of criticism towards information processing conducted by the police, critical police research should be focused more on crime investigation. An absence of traces of the economic dimension of corruption in the research material has been gratifying. There appears to be no connection between police work and the pursuit of financial gain in the research material. However, it must be kept in mind that this dimension of corruption is hidden i. e. unreported criminality and as such difficult to reveal. The police is hardly ever criticized for racist and sexist conduct nor for the use of covert coercive measures. This, however, should not be seen as grounds for oversimplified conclusions. The research has raised the dilemma of the oversight of the overseers. In light of the research material, questioning policing rests to the most part on the complainant and injured parties and on those who claim this status. Police officers seldom question their own conduct except for in matters relating to traffic. The same applies to other authorities and to bystanders (witnesses). Judging by the research material, it can be stated that both minor and serious cases are reported by police officers themselves. Furthermore, there is significance in the nature of the misconduct as well as in the status or standing in society of the person who has questioned the conduct and of the officer responsible for the conduct. Most importantly it is significant if another police officer has obstructed carrying out police duties or questioned the authority of the police. Also, it can be stated that the views of the police and of those questioning police conduct are far and apart. This interpretation is supported by the fact that there has not been a single instance in which a police officer would have been suspected of an attempt of a criminal offence. This situation has been interpreted in light of the findings of the Norwegian scholar Liv Finstad. It may simply be a question of differing lines of sight of the police, other authorities, bystanders and of injured parties. Each examines events from their own perspective. Questioning policing on a wider front would most probably not have the desired effect. On the contrary, it may high light certain aspect of police culture, namely solidarity and seclusion. Keeping in mind the afore mentioned meaning, the low visibility of policing can be understood in a wider context. It is not merely a question of the difficulties that senior police officer face in supervising police conduct, but also of police conduct perhaps being beyond the reach of an other wise all encompassing web of the guarantee of due process. The basis for investigations into police misconduct utilised in law drafting has been proven, at least to some extent, to be liquid. Whether an investigation is internal or external is perhaps no longer as relevant as one would assume. Each method of investigation faces specific obstacles especially when dealing with police misconduct. It is in these instances that overseeing the overseer is most challenging. Therefore, the aspect high lighted earlier in the research of the altruistic commitment to duty and of the strong moral fibre of police officers is pivotal. In the struggle to mould the Finnish police into a particularly efficient crime fighting organisation, change may be noticed in a lack of ethical sensitivity in police officers. Opening a pre-trial investigation is the first decision in the pre-trial process and as such an important one for those party to such a process. Consequently, the research focused on an analysis of the evidence as it relates to the development of the investigation at hand as well as on the scope of discretion vis-à-vis the statutory definition of the offence. In relation to the first mentioned, utilising mathematical models for practical decision making was discarded. In stead, the solution has been to recommend applying the evidentiary value method supplemented with the hypothesis method due to the inbuilt principle of caution i. e. the inapplicability of the rule of negation. This is unavoidable because in early stages of the investigation one has to operate with incomplete information. Hence, uncertainty is not transformed into support for the theme, nor its negation. This facilitates the search for alternative meanings for chains of events which in turn facilitates a more just solution. Discretion in relation to the statutory definition of the offence is especially challenging in police misconduct. The illegality and to the most part also guilt has been excluded from this discretion in order to give room for a just hearing of the criticism directed at the police. Furthermore, in ascertaining the grounds for a decision to open an investigation, when operating with incomplete information, it is not possible to determine questions of illegality or guilt, which is possible, to the most part, only with more complete evidence. The current method of investigation for police misconduct gives room for a danger of experiences of injustice both from the stand point of police officers and of those questioning police conduct. The afore mentioned method of investigation may be applied only when there is reason to suspect an offence and there are objective grounds to suspect a police officer of conducting such a criminal offence. In striving to maintain a low threshold for opening an investigation into misconduct, it is necessary to compromise the legal protection of police officers i. e. the threshold of presenting evidence in relation to police misconduct. Respectively, singling out a police officer may result in liability for reporting such police conduct. How should we evaluate the police? Numerous studies seem to support the understanding that policing has little to no impact on criminality on the whole and assessing the efficiency of policing is virtually impossible. This is considered to result from the fact that several factors impacting on criminality are beyond the reach of the police. Instead, there is ample indication that bad policing may i. a. jeopardise security and increase crime. It has been suggested that policing should be evaluated on the level of consideration, reliability, receptivity, capability, manners and on how just the police is. This is not contrary to ethical policing as described in the research. Internal legality control of the police should be arranged so as to facilitate producing as reliable and usable information on criticism targeting the police, on suspected criminal offences and misconduct as well as on investigations and consequences thereof as possible. Also claims for damages against the police and damages paid by the police should be recorded. The afore mentioned practice should be consistent and all encompassing and the collection of information should be systematic. Acquired information should be refined and analysed and the procedure should be included in <b>result</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>management</b> of the police or alternatively the reaction and conclusions based on such information should be arranged in some other efficient manner. Consequently, conclusions based on such information should not be limited to merely acknowledging the existence of an unwanted state of affairs. This would high light the responsibility of police chiefs. The police organisation should also consistently publicize information on the darker side of policing and on the remedies to such misconduct. On the other hand it may be considered that an active publicity may result in a loss in legitimacy of the police. However, in the long run this practise would undoubtedly indicate that the police is transparent and willing to be subject to scrutiny which in turn may result in a steady or even raised level of trust towards the police. The police should also be prepared for criticism towards the police being assessed by an external and (even more than currently) independent body. Globally development seems to be geared towards such a trend albeit this does not seem to be a more effective investigation method than any other. The web of oversight can be reinforced with concrete solutions (if required) i. a. by repeatedly measuring the ethical temperature e. g. in conjunction with a personnel barometer. Incorruptibility and integrity testing as well as other kinds of technical solutions are becoming commonplace. Integrity training throughout basic police training, and in a wider context than in mere individual training courses of modules, is also applied. It must be remembered that modern sophisticated investigation methods are available. Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge the use of current know-how in criminal investigations also in relation to police misconduct. Mechanisms for the reporting of police misconduct can be developed and supported etc. It can be discerned from the above that there are ample methods for securing better policing. Some of them may function as desired at least with certain preconditions and in favourable circumstances. Success is possible even if at times and at in certain circumstances there may have been failures. Naturally, recruitment has an important function. However, in the end it should be remembered that the police and society cannot be separated. In other words, society has such a police as it deserves. Ei korppi toista silmään noki. Vai nokkiiko? Pitäisikö sen nokkia? Onko yhteiskunnalla sellainen poliisi kuin se ansaitsee? Poliisitoiminnan ja poliisikoulutuksen kehittäminen edellyttää poliisin kohdistettua kriittistä tutkimusta ja seurantaa. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaankin Suomessa vähän tutkittua aihetta poliisin tekemäksi väitettyjä ja epäiltyjä rikoksia. Suomalaisen poliisirikoksen kuvaa valotetaan noin 500 tapauksen avulla. Tarkastelun kohteena ovat myös oikeuden ja poliisin suhde, poliisitoiminnan erilaiset ulottuvuudet, poliisikulttuuri ja poliisirikoksen määritteleminen eri näkökulmista. Oikeustieteellisen tutkimuksen painopisteenä on kuitenkin poliisirikosten esitutkinta erityisesti suomalaisen tutkintajärjestelmän perusteiden ja esitutkinnan aloittamisen edellytysten osalta. Poliisirikoksen kuva näyttäytyy tutkimusaineiston valossa pääosin varsin arkipäiväisenä ja poliisin työnkuvan mukaisena. Kuitenkin poliisin informaation käsittelyyn kohdistetun arvostelun määrän ja laaja-alaisuuden vuoksi tulevaisuudessa kriittistä poliisitutkimusta tulisi suunnata yhä vahvemmin muun muassa rikostutkintaan. Tutkimusaineistossa ei näyttäisi olevan jälkiä korruption taloudellisesta ulottuvuudesta. Poliisin työllä ja taloudellisen edun tavoittelulla ei näyttäisi siten olevan tutkimusaineistossa yhteyttä. Samalla on kuitenkin muistettava, että kyseinen korruption ulottuvuus on vaikeasti paljastettavaa piilorikollisuutta. Poliisia ei juurikaan arvostella rasistisesta tai seksistisestä käyttäytymisestä eikä salaisten pakkokeinojen käytöstä. Tästäkään tiedosta ei voida vetää suoraviivaisia johtopäätöksiä, kuten tutkimuksesta tarkemmin ilmenee. Tutkimuksessa on herätetty kysymystä valvojien valvonnan vaikeudesta. Tutkimusaineiston valossa poliisitoiminnan kyseenalaistaminen on pääosin asianomistajien tai sellaiseksi ilmoittautuvien henkilöiden varassa. Poliisimiehet eivät liikenteeseen liittyviä asioita lukuun ottamatta kyseenalaista juurikaan omaa toimintaansa. Sama koskee myös muita viranomaisia ja sivullisia (todistajia). Tutkimusaineiston perusteella voidaan sanoa, että hyvin lievät ja vakavat tapaukset tulevat kuitenkin ilmoitetuksi poliisin toimesta. Myös arvosteltavan toiminnan luonne, kyseenalaistajan ja kyseenalaistettavan asema ja erityisesti onko poliisimies haitannut poliisin tehtävien hoitamista tai kyseenalaistanut poliisin auktoriteettia näyttäisivät olevan merkityksellisiä seikkoja. Poliisin ja poliisitoiminnan kyseenalaistajien näkemyksien voidaan myös sanoa olevan varsin kaukana toisistaan. Sillä, että poliisitoiminta kyseenalaistettaisiin laajemmalla rintamalla, ei kuitenkaan ole välttämättä toivottua vaikutusta, vaan se voi korostaa poliisikulttuurin piirteistä solidaarisuutta ja eristäytyneisyyttä. Lainvalmistelussa käytetyt poliisirikosten tutkintajärjestelmän perusteet osoittautuivat osittain pettäviksi. Kysymys sisä- tai ulkopuolisesta tutkinnasta ei olekaan ehkä niin keskeinen, kuin saattaisi olettaa, vaan jokainen tutkintamuoto kohtaa ongelmia erityisesti poliisirikoksissa. Juuri tällöin valvojien valvominen näyttäytyy vaikeana. Tämän vuoksi tutkimuksessa esiin nostettu poliisimiesten pyyteetön vastuullisuus ja vahva eettinen selkäranka muodostuvat tärkeiksi. Poliisirikosten tutkintajärjestelmä näyttäsi myös sisältävän nykymuodossaan vaaran lähteen epäoikeudenmukaisuuden kokemuksille sekä poliisimiesten että poliisitoiminnan kyseenalaistajien kannalta tarkasteltuna. Tutkintajärjestelmää voidaan soveltaa vain silloin, kun on syytä epäillä rikosta ja objektiivisia perusteita epäillä poliisimiestä rikoksentekijäksi. Haluttaessa pitää tutkittavaksiottamisen edellytykset matalana joudutaan tinkimään poliisimiesten oikeusturvasta. Vastaavasti rikoksesta epäillyn poliisimiehen yksilöiminen kyseenalaistajan taholta saattaa ilmoituksentekijän vaaraan joutua vastuuseen poliisitoiminnan arvostelusta. Miten meidän tulisi arvioida poliisia? Eri tutkimukset näyttävät tukevan käsitystä, että poliisin toimilla on vain vähän jos ollenkaan merkitystä rikollisuudelle kokonaisuudessaan ja poliisin tehokkuuden arvioiminen on likimain mahdotonta. Tämän on katsottu juontuvan siitä, että monet rikollisuuteen vaikuttavat tekijät ovat poliisin ulottumattomissa. Sen sijaan on viitteitä siitä, että "huono poliisitoiminta" voi vaarantaa muun muassa turvallisuutta ja lisätä rikollisuutta. On ehdotettu, että poliisitoimintaa arvioitaisiin huomaavaisuuden, luotettavuuden, vastaanottavuuden, pystyvyyden, käytöstapojen, oikeudenmukaisuuden perusteella. Tämä puolestaan ei ole ristiriidassa tutkimuksessa esitetyn eettisen poliisitoiminnan kanssa. Tutkimuksessa ehdotetaan, että poliisin laillisuusvalvonta poliisiorganisaation sisäisesti toteutettuna olisi järjestettävä siten, että sen avulla kyetään tuottamaan mahdollisimman luotettavaa, hyödynnettävissä olevaa informaatiota poliisiin kohdistetuista arvostelusta, rikosepäilyistä ja väärinkäytöksistä sekä niiden käsittelystä ja mahdollisista seuraamuksista. Myös poliisin poliisia kohtaan esitettyjä vahingonkorvausvaatimuksia ja maksettuja korvauksia tulisi seurata. Järjestelyn tulisi olla jatkuva ja kattava sekä informaation kerääminen systemaattista. Saatua informaatiota olisi jalostettava ja analysoitava sekä menettely tulisi sitoa poliisin tulosohjaukseen tai reagointi informaation perusteella tehtäviin johtopäätöksiin tulisi järjestää jollakin muulla tehokkaalla tavalla. Poliisiorganisaation tulisi myös saattaa julkisuuteen säännöllisesti tietoa poliisitoiminnan "pimeästä puolesta" ja havaittujen epäkohtien vuoksi suoritetuista toimenpiteistä. Voidaan tosin ajatella, että aktiivisesta julkistamisesta aiheutuisi poliisin legitimiteetin menetystä, mutta pidemmällä aikavälillä menettely osoittanee poliisin avoimuutta ja halua tulla kontrolloiduksi, mikä voi puolestaan johtaa poliisia kohtaan tunnettavan luottamuksen vahvistumiseen tai ylläpitämiseen. Poliisiorganisaation tulisi myös varautua siihen, että poliisin kohdistettua arvostelua tutkitaan tulevaisuudessa poliisista ulkopuolisen nykyistä riippumattomamman elimen toimesta. Globaalisti tarkasteltuna "kehitys" näyttäisi kulkevan vahvasti tähän suuntaan, vaikka se ei näyttäisi olevan välttämättä tehokkaampi vaihtoehto kuin muut tutkintamuodot. Konkreettisten keinojen osalta valvonnan verkostoa voidaan täydentää (mikäli siihen ilmenee tarvetta) muun muassa säännöllisellä eettisen lämpötilan mittauksella esimerkiksi henkilöstöbarometrin yhteydessä. Lahjomattomuus- ja rehellisyystestit sekä erilaiset tekniset menetelmät ovat yleistymässä. "Rehellisyyskoulutus" koko poliisin perustutkinnon läpäisevänä, yksittäisiä kursseja tai moduuleita laajempana, on myös käytössä. On myös muistettava, että modernit sofistikoituneet tutkintamenetelmät ovat käytettävissä, joten olemassa olevan rikostutkintatiedon ja taidon käyttö on tiedostettava myös poliisirikosten osalta. Poliisin rikoksista ilmoittamista koskevia mekanismeja voidaan kehittää ja tukea jne...|$|E

Theoretical and empirical findings point to evidence that efforts to inculcate ROM in Uganda are being made. There are, however, a number of critical issues that affect its implementation. These issues sustain a vicious circle of underperformance and undermine the implementation of ROM. Of primary importance are: (i) the commitment of leadership and transformational capacity to drive a <b>result</b> <b>oriented</b> performance <b>management</b> reform; (ii) the efficient generation and use of scarce resources; (iii) clarifying the results and services that institutions are expected to provide and enabling them to perform; (iv) placing human resources at the forefront of performance management reform; and (v) meaningfully engaging citizens in co-production of public services. To address these critical factors, it is necessary that a common vision for performance and service delivery is built, and that performance information is used in decision making, learning, and improvement. Aside from the critical challenges above, ROM is expected to consistently and systematically enhance the development of individual, institutional, and state capacity, and subsequently the sustainability of improvements in service delivery.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} three complementary {{themes in}} bringing about responsive and accountable public governance in developing countries—namely globalisation, localisation and a <b>results</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>management</b> and evaluation (ROME). The first theme recognises interdependencies in an interconnected world and discusses how these influences would shape partnership within and across nations. The second theme is concerned with public sector realignments within nations {{to meet the challenges}} associated with heightened expectations from an informed citizenry. The third theme relates to creating a new culture of public governance that is responsive and accountable to citizens. The paper argues that a road to ROME holds significant promise of overcoming the ills of a dysfunctional, command and control, overbearing and rent seeking public sector in many developing countries. ROME de-emphasises traditional input controls and instead is concerned with creating an authorising environment in which the public officials are given the flexibility to manage for results but are held accountable for delivering public services consistent with citizen preferences. Further under ROME incentive mechanisms induce public and non-public (private and nongovernment) sectors to compete in the delivery of public services and match public services with citizen preferences at lower tax cost to society per unit of output. ...|$|R

New regulations both in Flanders (i. e. the Order regarding the implementation of the Policy and Management Cycle issued in 2010) and Italy (i. e. the Decree on productivity, efficiency and transparency in the public sector, issued in 2009, and the New Budget Regulation, issued in 2011) try to push forward <b>results</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>management</b> in local governments and to install some sort of performance based budgeting. To understand the implementation of performance based budgeting in these local governments and to simultaneously take into account the diversified concept this could represent, a diversified measurement instrument is necessary. To this end, an adapted version of the OECD Performance Budgeting Survey (OECD, 2011) is utilized. After explaining the adaptations made to the original OECD Survey and building on the framework of “Managing Performance” of Bouckaert and Halligan (2008), this paper elaborates on the results from eight interviews performed in both Flemish and Italian municipalities. The scores shed light on the state of affairs of performance based budgeting in the municipalities examined. The paper concludes with reflecting on the survey that should continue the examination made, albeit informed by the results of the interviews done. Ideally, this survey allows for an international examination and comparison of performance based budgeting practices in other local governments too.

Key findings of the study The study established that the restructuring exercise streamlined the structures of local governments, aligned mandates to the structures, and graded jobs in line with responsibilities. These reforms have improved the performance of the local governments. Despite notable improvements, the study established that there were still gaps in the local government system that needed to be addressed. These included: i. There is a big skills gap in most local governments. Some positions in local government are not filled due to inadequate resources. ii. Some local governments are finding it difficult to attract qualified and competent personnel to take up jobs at technical and managerial levels. iii. Local government lack attractive working environments. iv. There are limited career growth opportunities in local government service. xiv v. There is low local revenue. This has imposed limitations to accountability, supervision and monitoring of local government programmes. vi. Professional staff in local government is not adequately facilitated to do their work efficiently and effectively. vii. The existing capacity building programmes contribute marginally to career growth of individual staff members. viii.

40|$|Local {{governments in}} Flanders have been {{following}} the trend towards <b>results</b> <b>oriented</b> financial <b>management</b> since the nineties. In 2005, a new decree on municipal government and financial management, named Municipal Decree (Gemeentedecreet), was approved. Meanwhile, on the 25 th of June 2010, the Flemish government approved the order regarding {{the implementation of the}} Policy and Management Cycle (Beleids- en BeheersCyclus) (PMC) in Flemish municipalities, Public Centres for Social Welfare (PCSW) and provinces. This order was made in pursuance of the Municipal Decree of 15 July 2005. It contains the stipulations with respect to the set-up of the multi-year planning, the budget and the accounting system of these organizations. By means of the enactment of the PMC order, the Flemish government aims at moving <b>results</b> <b>oriented</b> planning and <b>management</b> high up on local governments agendas. Within this broader context, this research studies the introduction of  what we have called  elements of performance budgeting in Flemish municipal organizations. Firstly, we examine to what extent Flemish municipal organizations have introduced elements of performance budgeting. Secondly, we explore to what extent the conceptual model presented by ter Bogt & van Helden (2000) as operationalized by us, can account for the state of affairs regarding the introduction of elements of performance budgeting in individual Flemish municipal organizations. Finally, taking the adapted and refined conceptual model as our starting point, we make policy recommendations to managers within Flemish municipal organizations who want to introduce elements of performance budgeting in their organization. In order to realize these goals, we collect data during several research phases. At first, preceding the actual research, we carry out a literature review. Based on this review, we delineate the research, we conceptualize the response variable and we elaborate on the theoretical framework. During the second phase, we organize a large scale survey research to map current municipal budgeting and planning practices. The results of this survey research also provide the basis for the third research phase, that comprises a case study. The four cases that are studied in depth, are {{selected on the basis of}} the data we gathered by conducting the survey research. In particular, we select two bigger and two smaller municipal organizations of which one in each case has a high value on the scale extent of introduction of elements of performance budgeting and the other one holds a low value on this scale. Hence, a diverse case design, which is a specific type of cross-case comparative case study design, is applied. Two factors are held constant as far as possible across the cases: the size of the municipality and the software which is used to draw up the budget documents. The two municipal organizations within the same size category, that as such have different values on the response variable, are compared with one another. We explore which factors explain that these cases differ with regard to the extent to which they have introduced elements of performance budgeting. Within the cases we gather empirical data through document analysis and through semi-structured interviews with different respondents. These data provide the basis for the deductive testing of the model of ter Bogt & van Helden (2000) as operationalized by us. In addition, we add a number of factors to the existing model based on our inductive findings. Amongst other things, the research shows that the model of ter Bogt & van Helden (2000) underestimates the importance of agents and their profile. Besides, we find that, contrary to the impression that the model of ter Bogt & van Helden (2000) gives, environmental factors influence the course of the change process throughout all phases of the change trajectory. Finally, the research suggests a number of adjustments and refinements to the operationalization of the concepts in the existing model. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|On the 25 th of June 2010, the Flemish {{government}} {{approved the}} order regarding the implementa-tion of the Policy and Management Cycle (PMC) in Flemish municipalities, Public Centres for Social Welfare (PCSW) and provinces. The order contains the stipulations {{with respect to}} the set-up of the multi-year planning, the budget and the accounting systems of these organizations. Different phases of both the policy and management cycle and the underlying financial cycle are seriously altered. By means of the enactment of the PMC order, the Flemish government aims at moving results-oriented planning and management sharply up local governments’ agendas. As such, an attempt is made to join in with an international trend that can be labelled as New Public Financial Management (Guthrie et al. 1999). The key to a successful information-supplying and decision supporting policy and management cycle, is an adequate integration of financial and non-financial information. In an attempt {{to find out if the}} implementation of the policy and management cycle actually leads to this blending of both types of information, this research will especially focus on the two first phases of the financial cycle, namely the ex ante (the budget) and the ex nunc (accounting) phases. Ideally, these correspond and are integrated with the first two phases of the policy and management cycle, which are the policy planning and policy monitoring phases. This research will gather data through a document analysis, case studies and a survey to enable a clarifying picture regarding the (un) successful introduction of results-oriented financial management in local governments. Whether Flemish local governments have actually integrated financial and non-financial information is an important question. Ultimately, the methods used should enable testing the influence of micro- and meso-variables on the implementation of <b>results</b> <b>oriented</b> financial <b>management.</b> More specifically, hypotheses will be derived from the conceptual model developed by ter Bogt and van Helden (2000) that combines three theoretical approaches, namely (1) the old institutionalist approach as described in Burns & Scapens (2000), (2) the ‘Seven C’s’ model of Shields & Young (1989) and (3) the ‘behavioural theory of the firm’ developed by Cyert & March (1963). The operationalization and refinements made in earlier research concerning Flemish local governments (Weets, 2012) will inform testing these hypotheses. status: publishe...|$|R
