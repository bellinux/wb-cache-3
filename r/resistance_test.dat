500|$|The pulling, or tensile <b>resistance,</b> <b>test</b> {{is also a}} test {{only for}} the draught type horses, and it {{measures}} pulling capacity in relation to size. The test is performed in several progressive stages, called [...] "steps", with the load increased each time. The horse tested will pull a weighed sled on semi-rough sand. The friction between the sled and the sand is taken into account and is measured before the test. The sled is loaded according to the horse's weight; on the first attempt, the load equals 36percent of the estimated weight of the horse; with each subsequent stage of the test, the load is increased by 6percent of the horse's weight. The horse must pull the sled for [...] at each weight. If the horse stops during a test and does not resume within one minute, or stops four times before reaching the required distance, the test is discontinued. Two points are awarded for every testing stage completed successfully, with a maximum total score of 20. The pulling style is also evaluated, and given 4 to 10 points. To pass the test, the horse must successfully complete pulls {{for at least five}} [...] "steps". This corresponds to a pulling capacity of 60percent of the horse's weight. An award of 20 points corresponds to 90percent of the horse's weight being pulled.|$|E

The evaluation of different concentrations of phosphine, of their effectiveness against resistant strains of Lasioderma serricorne shows that at usual fumigation conditions resistant beetles can not be controlled with phosphine whereas at higher concentration 100 %-mortality of all development stages is achieved. Furthermore, longer exposure times have also a positive effect on the mortality of all development stages.

Slippery flooring produces readings close to zero, and flooring which show higher resistance to slipping give results further from zero—high numbers (such as those 36 and above) indicating suitable slip resistant flooring.|$|E

Phenotypic assays measure the drug susceptibility {{of the virus}} by determining the concentration of drug that inhibits viral replication in tissue culture.

40|$|HIV {{resistance}} to antiretroviral agents {{is a major}} contributory cause of treatment failure. The dynamics of HIV replication, together with patient-, physician-, and drug-related factors, lead to emergence of HIV resistant strains {{in most of the}} patients.

Genotypic <b>tests</b> detect <b>resistance</b> mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes by comparing the gene sequences of a resistant virus to those of a wildtype strain that has previously been described. The efficacy of each ARV class and each individual ARV is threatened by specific mutations and resistance mechanisms.
