50|$|Returning to MMA, Condit {{continued}} his impressive run of {{form in the}} sport with a further three first round stoppage wins to go 8-0 before he was submitted with a Carlo Prater triangle choke inside the opening round in Albuquerque on September 11, 2004. He rebounded from the loss with a four fight win streak and returned to Japan to fight in Pancrase, losing to Satoru Kitaoka via first <b>round</b> <b>heel</b> hook submission at Pancrase: Spiral 8 in Yokohama on October 2, 2005. Following this, he had {{a stint in the}} Hawaii-based Rumble on the Rock promotion and defeated Ross Ebañez via TKO in his promotional debut before going on to compete in the ROTR Welterweight Tournament. The tournament's quarter-finals were held on January 20, 2006, at Rumble on the Rock 8 where Condit recorded a seventeen-second TKO stoppage of Renato Verissimo. The semis and the final both took place on the same night, April 21, 2006, at Rumble on the Rock 9 and Condit submitted Frank Trigg with a triangle choke/armbar hybrid to book his place in the final against Jake Shields. Going the distance {{for the first time in}} his career, Condit lost by unanimous decision.|$|E

40|$|A new ichnospecies {{of a large}} {{theropod}} dinosaur, Megalosauripus transjuranicus, {{is described}} from the Reuchenette Formation (Early-Late Kimmeridgian, Late Jurassic) of NW Switzerland. It is based on very well-preserved and morphologically-distinct tracks (impressions) and several trackways, including different preservational types from different tracksites and horizons. All trackways were excavated along federal Highway A 16 near Courtedoux (Canton Jura) and systematically documented in the field including orthophotos and laserscans. The best-preserved tracks were recovered and additional tracks were casted. Megalosauripus transjuranicus is characterized by tridactyl tracks with clear claw and digital pad impressions, and notably an exceptionally large and round first phalangeal pad on the fourth digit (PIV 1) that is connected to digit IV and forms the <b>round</b> <b>heel</b> area. Due to this combination of features, M. transjuranicus clearly is of theropod (and not ornithopod) origin. M. transjuranicus is compared to other Megalosauripus tracks and similar ichnotaxa and other unassigned tracks from the Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. It is clearly different from other ichnogenera assigned to large theropods such as Eubrontes-Grallator from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic or Megalosauripus-Megalosauropus-Bueckeburgichnus and Therangospodus tracks from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. A second tridactyl morphotype (called Morphotype II) is different from Megalosauripus transjuranicus in being subsymmetric, longer than wide (sometimes almost as wide as long), with blunt toe impressions and no evidence for discrete phalangeal pad and claw marks. Some Morphotype II tracks are found in trackways that are assigned to M. transjuranicus, to M. ? transjuranicus or M. cf. transjuranicus indicating that some Morphotype II tracks are intra-trackway preservational variants of a morphological continuum of Megalosauripus transjuranicus. On the other hand, several up to 40 steps long trackways very consistently present Morphotype II features (notably blunt digits) and do not exhibit any of the features that are typical for Megalosauripus (notably phalangeal pads). Therefore, it is not very likely that these tracks are preservational variants of Megalosauripus transjuranicus or Megalosauripus isp. These trackways are interpreted to have been left by an ornithopod dinosaur. The high frequency of large theropod tracks in tidal-flat deposits of the Jura carbonate platform, associated on single ichnoassemblages with minute to medium-sized tridactyl and tiny to large sauropod tracks {{has important implications for}} the dinosaur community and for paleoenvironmental and paleogeographical reconstructions. As with most other known occurrences of Megalosauripus tracks, M. transjuranicus is found in coastal settings, which may reflect the preference of their theropod trackmakers for expanded carbonate flats where food was abundant...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) on carcass cutability and tenderness of calf-fed Holstein steers, calf-fed Holstein carcasses (n = 102) were selected {{from a pool of}} 2, 300 steers that were fed 0 or 8. 3 mg/kg (DM basis) of ZH. Zilpaterol hydrochloride was supplemented the last 20 d of the finishing period and withdrawn for 3 d before slaughter. Carcasses were selected based on carcass weight as well as predetermined USDA Yield grade categories. For tenderness evaluation, steaks from the strip loin, bottom round, and top round (n = 54 per subprimal) were aged for 14 or 21 d postmortem. Carcasses from ZH-fed steers had more (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) saleable yield than carcasses from control-fed steers. Additionally, ZH-fed steers had greater (P ≤ 0. 01) subprimal yield from the shoulder clod, strip loin, peeled tenderloin, top sirloin butt, bottom sirloin tri-tip, peeled knuckle, inside round, bottom round flat, eye of <b>round,</b> <b>heel,</b> and shank. Furthermore, ZH decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) the total amount and percentage of bone and fat trim from the carcass. Moisture loss was not affected by ZH in LM or inside round steaks (P 3 ̆e 0. 05); however, ZH increased thawing loss (P = 0. 05) but reduced cooking loss (P = 0. 05) in bottom round steaks. Shear force values of LM and inside round steaks increased with ZH inclusion (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), but {{there was no difference in}} bottom round steaks (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Steaks aged for 21 d had smaller (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) values than 14 -d steaks from all 3 subprimals. Trained sensory panelists did not detect any differences (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) in sensory juiciness, tenderness, or flavor variables of LM or inside round steaks, except ZH steaks from the LM received smaller scores for sustained juiciness (P = 0. 01) and overall tenderness (P = 0. 04) than control steaks. Although LM steaks from ZH cattle were tougher than control steaks, the ZH-treated steaks had an average WBS value of 4. 10 kg, which would be classified as intermediate in tenderness, with trained panelists rating ZH steaks slightly to moderately tender. Feeding ZH improved carcass cutability of calf-fed Holstein steers; however, tenderness was reduced in LM and inside round steaks. The interaction of postmortem tenderization techniques should be investigated to {{evaluate the}}ir impact on palatability in cattle supplemented with β-agonists to allow the beef industry to take full advantage of the enhancement in performance and carcass yield...|$|E

50|$|The pilot's single, open cockpit was {{immediately}} {{in front of}} the wing-mounting pillar in an oval section forward fuselage {{similar to those of the}} motorless gliders. The position of the propeller disc just behind the wing required the rear fuselage to be rather shallow, so it was formed by four longerons with plywood covering, resulting in a rectangular section. The empennege was conventional, with a triangular tailplane sitting on a low, raised step with a curved leading edge and carrying straight tapered, square tipped, unbalanced elevators. The rear of the step mounted the rudder hinge bearing a tall, straight tapered and flat topped balanced rudder. The rudder extended to a <b>rounded</b> <b>heel</b> at the keel via cut-aways in the inner edges of the elevators.|$|R

40|$|Large ornithopod {{tracks are}} {{known from the}} Upper Jurassic to the {{uppermost}} Cretaceous rocks of all continents but Antarctica. They include the tracks historically called Iguanodon footprints, iguanodontid footprints, hadrosaur/hadrosaurid footprints, and other large ornithopod tracks {{that have been used}} to define ichnotaxa. More than 40 ichnospecies based on large ornithopod tracks have been defined, but the validity of many of them is questionable. 34 ichnogenera and 44 ichnospecies have been analysed in this work. Many of them are considered to be invalid because they have been defined on the basis of poorly preserved tracks without diagnostic features, have an inadequate diagnosis, or are based on temporal and/or geographical criteria. Only eight ichnospecies belonging to the ichnogenera Caririchnium, Iguanodontipus and Hadrosauropodus are here regarded as valid. The monospecific ichnogenus Iguanodontipus (I. burreyi) is characterized by a small, <b>rounded</b> <b>heel</b> and elongate, narrow digit impressions. Its distribution is limited to the Berriasian-Valanginian of Europe. Caririchnium consists of four ichnospecies (C. magnificum [type ichnospecies], C. kortmeyeri, C. billsarjeanti and C. lotus) with a large, <b>rounded</b> <b>heel</b> and short, wide digit impressions. This ichnogenus ranges from the Berriasian-Hauterivian to the Aptian-Albian of South America, North America, Asia and Europe. Finally, Hadrosauropodus (three ichnospecies: H. langstoni [type ichnospecies], H. leonardii and H. kyoungsookimi) shows a large, bilobed heel and short, wide digit impressions. It is known from the Aptian-Albian to the Maastrichtian of North America, Asia and Europe. The ichnofamily Iguanodontipodidae includes large iguanodontian tracks characterized mainly by mesaxonic, tridactyl and subsymmetrical pes tracks that are as wide as (or wider than) long and have one pad impression in each digit and one in the heel. Its distribution is confidently limited to the Cretaceous of Europe, Asia, North America and South America...|$|R
