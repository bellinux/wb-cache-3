40|$|Many {{public school}} districts rely on revenue from local taxes {{approved}} via popular referendum. The dynamics of these referendum elections therefore {{could have a}} significant impact on school district administration and student learning. We estimated these effects using data on more than 4, 200 referenda held in Ohio districts between 2003 and 2013. The results indicate that referendum failure (instead of passage) had a negative impact on district expenditures and student achievement in the years immediately following the election. The negative achievement effects correspond to approximately 0. 05 - 0. 10 standard deviations in district educational quality. However, these initial impacts generally dissipate after 4 - 6 years, as districts eventually secure voter approval for tax levies and <b>revenues</b> <b>rebound.</b> The analysis employs multiple identification strategies and examines potential mechanisms to support the causal interpretation of these results, providing insights about district responses to fiscal stress and the transaction cost...|$|R
