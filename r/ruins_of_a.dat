5|$|In 1976, a fire {{destroyed}} the acrylic outer skin of Buckminster Fuller's dome, {{and the previous}} year the Ontario pavilion was lost due to a major fire. With the site falling into disrepair, and several pavilions left abandoned and vandalized, it began to resemble <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> futuristic city.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small {{satellite}} pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. Both have been heavily affected by stone robbing, which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached a climax during the Saite (664–525 BCE) and Persian (525–402 BCE) periods, making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known Chinese {{piece of}} hard, hempen {{wrapping}} paper {{dates to the}} 2nd century BC. The standard papermaking process was invented by Cai Lun (50–121 AD) in 105 AD. The oldest known surviving {{piece of paper with}} writing on it was found in the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Han watchtower that had been abandoned in 110 AD, in Inner Mongolia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|Basin rests {{above the}} Boulder Batholith, the host rock for many {{valuable}} mineral ores {{found in this}} part of Montana. After the town became a hub of gold and silver mining, Basin's population peaked at about 1,500 in first decade of the 20th century but gradually declined as the mines were depleted. Abandoned mining equipment, closed or barricaded mine portals, and the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smelter and ore concentrator remain in Basin in the 21stcentury.|$|E
5|$|It {{is certain}} {{that most of the}} Christian {{residents}} of Jifna in the 12th century were local inhabitants. Apart from local Christians there was also a Frankish settlement, as is attested by the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maison forte (manor) built in {{the lower part of the}} village. In Jifna, like in many other sites in Palestine, the Crusaders built their settlement in the heart of the local Christian settlement.|$|E

5|$|Skopje {{has some}} remains of Prehistorical {{architecture}} {{which can be}} seen on the Tumba Madžari Neolithic site. On {{the other side of the}} city lie the remains of the ancient Scupi, with <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theatre, thermae and a basilica. The Skopje Aqueduct, located between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown. It seems to have been built by the Byzantines or the Turks, but it was already out of use in the 16th century. It consists of 50 arches, worked in cloisonné masonry.|$|E
5|$|Ten more {{missions}} {{were founded}} in the Chiquitania by the Jesuits in three periods: the 1690s, the 1720s, and after 1748. In the 1690s, five missions were established: San Rafael de Velasco (1696), San José de Chiquitos (1698), Concepción (1699) and San Juan Bautista (1699). San Juan Bautista {{is not part of}} the World Heritage Site, and only the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stone tower survive near the present village of (San Juan de) Taperas.|$|E

As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka walks outside and finds Gorca and his family surrounding her. Vladimir awakens and searches for Sdenka, finding her lying motionless in her bed at home. Sdenka awakens and upon receiving Vladimir's embrace, she bites into his neck.|$|E
5|$|The current archaeological {{situation}} allows {{no closer}} evaluation of Khaba's reign. The seal impressions from Elephantine only prove that this island {{seems to have}} been an important place to visit in Khaba's time. The inscriptions reveal that the seals and their belonging vessels originated from Thinis and that they were registered by the governor of Elephantine. Other seals show the depiction of the goddess Bastet. The Hierakonpolis seal was found in early dynastic <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local Horus temple. It shows traces of the image of a god, possibly Ash.|$|E

The game follows the main characters Crash and Coco Bandicoot as they travel through time and prevent the villains from gathering the Crystals by collecting them themselves.|$|E

5|$|Badajoz is the see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida-Badajoz. Prior to {{the merger}} of the Diocese of Mérida and the Diocese of Badajoz, Badajoz was the see of the Diocese of Badajoz from the bishopric's {{inception}} in 1255. The city has a degree of eminence, crowned as it is by the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Moorish castle and overlooking the Guadiana river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal. The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history; even the Badajoz Cathedral, built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with its massive walls. Badajoz {{is home to the}} CD Badajoz and AD Cerro de Reyes football clubs and the AB Pacense basketball club. It is served by Badajoz Railway Station and Badajoz Airport.|$|E
5|$|Jarlshof lies {{near the}} {{southern}} tip of the Shetland Mainland, close to the settlements of Sumburgh and Grutness and to the south end of Sumburgh Airport. The site overlooks an arm of the sea called the West Voe of Sumburgh and the nearby freshwater springs and building materials available on the beach will have added to the location's attraction as a settlement. The south Mainland also provides a favourable location for arable cultivation in a Shetland context and there is a high density of prehistoric settlement in the surrounding area. Jarlshof is only one mile from Scatness where the remains of another broch and other <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar longevity were discovered in 1975. There is a small visitor centre at Jarlshof with displays and a collection of artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Later vestiges {{date from}} the Roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns {{bordering}} the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The Romans also built a monumental staircase adorned with mosaic patterns {{that leads to the}} top of the podium. To the right of the Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a nymphaeum with niches where statues of the nymphs once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the Maenads. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Roman villa; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the four seasons. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic altar, also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{settlement}} on St. Charles Bay was Lamar, founded in 1839 by James W. Byrne. The town {{was named for}} Mirabeau B. Lamar, who was elected as President of Texas the previous year. The settlers aimed to compete with Aransas City on the adjacent Live Oak Peninsula. After a customhouse was moved from Aransas City, {{at the behest of}} President Lamar, Aransas City declined and Lamar grew into a prosperous port and salt producer. It was bombarded and destroyed by the Union during the American Civil War, leaving only the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Catholic chapel and a few homes. Shortly thereafter, the town was rebuilt. By 1915, a post office, school, hotel, ranches and twenty-five homes had been constructed at the site. By 1970, 150 people lived in the town and by 2000, it had 1,600 residents. It remains an unincorporated community of Aransas County.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{two other}} castles in the city, Kanō Castle and Kawate Castle, only have ruins marking their former presence, they have both had {{important}} roles in the city's past. Kanō Castle was built shortly after the Battle of Sekigahara when Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered the Toyotomi family to build it upon the <b>ruins</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former medieval castle. Okudaira Nobumasa {{was the first person}} to live in the castle and he was followed by his descendants until the Meiji period. The castle's citadel ruins are designated a National Historic Site. Kawate Castle was used by the Toki clan while they were guarding Owari, Ise and Mino provinces as the Chief Retainer of the Shogunate during the Muromachi period. It was also used as a meeting place for the cultural and social elite from Kyoto. A stone monument near Seibi High School marks the castle's location.|$|E
