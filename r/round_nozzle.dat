40|$|Acoustic {{and flow}} {{visualization}} data from nozzles {{mounted on the}} same facility were acquired, {{and a total of}} 10 different concepts of jet noise suppression were evaluated relative to one another and also a <b>round</b> <b>nozzle.</b> All nozzles had the same exit area. The suppressors included noncircular shapes; nozzles fitted with notches, tabs, and ejectors; and coaxial rectangular nozzles. Narrow-band noise data were acquired by a microphone located in the plane of the jet exit. In general, it is found that, for a constant exit area, the <b>round</b> <b>nozzle</b> is the noisiest. Just about any modification of this <b>round</b> <b>nozzle</b> around its periphery reduces the broadband shock-associated noise and, in most instances, modifies the screech frequency and levels. Coaxial rectangular nozzles, nozzles fitted with two tabs and operated with ejectors, and a rectangular C-D nozzles with perforated walls are identified to be the most promising concepts worthy of further investigation...|$|E

40|$|A {{physical}} {{understanding of}} noise reduction mechanisms in supersonic, single, and coaxial rectangular jets is quantified and obtained, {{with emphasis on}} shock noise reduction. For all conditions, corresponding acoustic measurements for an equivalent round jet are also obtained so that the noise characteristics of {{the two types of}} jets can be compared directly to quantify the noise reductions. Comparisons are thus provided for a single rectangular nozzle vs a single equivalent <b>round</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and a coaxial rectangular nozzle vs an equivalent <b>round</b> <b>nozzle.</b> It is shown that different operating conditions and nozzle arrangements for the same thrust, total exit area, and mass flow rate can produce different noise levels. With at least one stream operated supersonically, the coaxial rectangular nozzle operated in the inverted-velocity profile is always quieter than in the normal velocity profile mode for the same thrust, exit area, and mass flow rate. In general, the coaxial rectangular nozzle is shown to be quieter than an equivalent circular nozzle only for those conditions for which both nozzles are operated supersonically...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to validate the jet noise reduction potential of a concept associated with distributed exhaust nozzles. Under this concept the propulsive thrust is generated by a larger number of discrete plumes issuing from an array of small or mini-nozzles. The potential of noise reduction of this concept stems from the fact that a large number of small jets will produce very high frequency noise and also, if spaced suitably, they will coalesce at a smaller velocity to produce low amplitude, low frequency noise. This is accomplished through detailed acoustic and fluid measurements along with a Computational Fluidic Dynamic (CFD) solution of the mean (DE) Distributed Exhaust nozzle flowfield performed by Northrop-Grumman. The acoustic performance is quantified in an anechoic chamber. Farfield acoustic data is acquired for a DE nozzle as well as a <b>round</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the same area. Both these types of nozzles are assessed numerically using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques. The CFD analysis ensures that both nozzles issued the same amount of airflow for a given nozzle pressure ratio. Data at a variety of nozzle pressure ratios are acquired at a range of polar and azimuthal angles. Flow visualization of the DE nozzle is used to assess the fluid dynamics of the small jet interactions. Results show that at high subsonic jet velocities, the DE nozzle shifts its frequency of peak amplitude to a higher frequency relative to a <b>round</b> <b>nozzle</b> of equivalent area (from a S(sub tD) = 0. 24 to 1. 3). Furthermore, the DE nozzle shows reduced sound pressure levels (as much as 4 - 8 dB) in the low frequency part of the spectrum (less than S(sub tD) = 0. 24) compared to the <b>round</b> <b>nozzle.</b> At supersonic jet velocities, the DE nozzle does not exhibit the jet screech and the shock-associated broadband noise is reduced by as much as 12 dB...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present simple {{deterministic}} process {{models for the}} prediction {{of the evolution of}} the cross-sectional profile of glass channels generated by erosive wear in micro air abrasive jet machining using a <b>round</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The present work was motivated by a need to understand the sensitivity of the geometry of the generated cross-sectional profile to the degree of offset between the centre of the nozzle and the centre of the mask defining the channel. Experiments were carried out on soda lime and borosilicate glass to verify the process models. Predicted results show fairly good agreement with experimental results. We conclude that, without proper alignment, the cross-sectional profile is easily skewed, as the micro abrasive jet machining process quickly acts on any initial geometrical skewness and compounds it over time...|$|E

40|$|Computational {{simulation}} and prediction {{tools were}} used to understand the jet-pylon interaction effect {{in a set of}} bypass-ratio five core/fan nozzles. Results suggest that the pylon acts as a large scale mixing vane that perturbs the jet flow and jump starts the jet mixing process. The enhanced mixing and associated secondary flows from the pylon result in a net increase of noise in the first 10 diameters of the jet s development, but there is a sustained reduction in noise from that point downstream. This is likely the reason the pylon nozzle is quieter overall than the baseline <b>round</b> <b>nozzle</b> in this case.

40|$|The {{link between}} {{azimuthal}} modes in jet turbulence {{and in the}} acoustic sound field has been examined in cold, <b>round</b> jets. Chevron <b>nozzles,</b> however, impart an azimuthal structure on the jet with a shape dependent on the number, length and penetration angle of the chevrons. Two particular chevron nozzles, with 3 and 4 primary chevrons respectively, and a <b>round</b> baseline <b>nozzle</b> are compared at both cold and hot jet conditions to determine how chevrons impact the modal structure of the flow and how that change relates to the sound field.

This is supported by results in the azimuthal structure of the sound field, which also shows little difference in between the two chevron nozzles and the baseline nozzle {{in the distribution of}} energy across the azimuthal modes measured...|$|R

Of the Bildlampen, several lamps with angular voluted nozzles (Loeschcke type I) and one fragment of a circular lamp with a <b>rounded</b> <b>nozzle</b> (Loeschcke type VIII) are represented.

The production, transport and copying of Firmalampen is described; resulting endeavors to locate their point of origin are determined to be often unreliable without chemical analysis. Both the relationship of lamps to other grave goods as well as their purpose in graves are assessed; lamps are found to have been an available luxury, as appropriate in a Romanized society.

We consider four cases: an isothermal jet, a hot air jet, a cold air jet {{interacting with the}} wall and a cold air jet falling down without reaching the wall. The jet expansion rates show two categories. These are (1) an isothermal jet and cold jet not adhering to the wall, with a vertical expansion rate higher than the lateral rate and (2) a non isothermal jet adhering to the wall, with a lateral expansion rate higher than the vertical one. The turbulence structure analysis confirms two categories: {{the first is a}} highly anisotropic structure which is mainly cigar axisymmetric and the second one is subject to instabilities linked to lateral air ejections. This is confirmed by a spectral analysis of the turbulent component of the flow. A scenario of coherent structures evolution is proposed...|$|E
