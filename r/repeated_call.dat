500|$|McClellan was {{reunited with}} his army at Harrison's Landing on the James. Debates were held {{as to whether the}} army should be {{evacuated}} or attempt to resume an offensive toward Richmond. McClellan maintained his estrangement from Abraham Lincoln with his <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> for reinforcements and by writing a lengthy letter in which he proposed strategic and political guidance for the war, continuing his opposition to abolition or seizure of slaves as a tactic. He concluded by implying he should be restored as general-in-chief, but Lincoln [...] responded by naming Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck to the post without consulting, or even informing, McClellan. Lincoln and Stanton also offered command of the Army of the Potomac to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who refused the appointment.|$|E

By this time the knot was disentangled without any other help than the neat and nimble fingers of Janet, a simply-attired pretty maiden, the {{daughter}} of Anthony Foster, who came running at the <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> of her mistress. A necklace of orient pearl, the companion of a perfumed billet, was now hastily produced from the packet. The lady gave the one, after a slight glance, {{to the charge of}} her attendant, while she read, or rather devoured, the contents of the other.|$|E

60|$|The white man, {{turning his}} back upon the setting sun, looked along the empty and broad expanse of the sea-reach. For the last three miles of its course the wandering, hesitating river, as if enticed irresistibly by the freedom of an open horizon, flows {{straight}} into the sea, flows straight to the east--to the east that harbours both light and darkness. Astern of the boat the <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> of some bird, a cry discordant and feeble, skipped along over the smooth water and lost itself, before it could reach the other shore, in the breathless silence of the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tiga stengah," [...] {{he cried}} after each splash and pause, {{gathering}} the line busily for another cast. [...] "Tiga stengah," [...] which means three fathom and a half. For {{a mile or}} so from seaward there was a uniform depth of water right up to the bar. [...] "Half-three. Half-three. Half-three,"--and his modulated cry, returned leisurely and monotonous, like the <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> of a bird, seemed to float away in sunshine and disappear in the spacious silence of the empty sea and of a lifeless shore lying open, north and south, east and west, without the stir of a single cloud-shadow or the whisper of any other voice.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile two new {{customers}} entered, and the <b>repeated</b> <b>call,</b> [...] "Addy!" [...] {{brought from the}} back of the shop a group that Deronda turned frankly to stare at, feeling sure that the stare would be held complimentary. The group consisted of a black-eyed young woman who carried a black-eyed little one, its head already covered with black curls, and deposited it on the counter, from which station it looked round with even more than the usual intelligence of babies: also a robust boy of six and a younger girl, both with black eyes and black-ringed hair--looking more Semitic than their parents, as the puppy lions show the spots of far-off progenitors. The young woman answering to [...] "Addy"--a sort of paroquet in a bright blue dress, with coral necklace and earrings, her hair set up in a huge bush--looked as complacently lively and unrefined as her husband; and by a certain difference from the mother deepened in Deronda the unwelcome impression that the latter was not so utterly common a Jewess as to exclude her being the mother of Mirah. While that thought was glancing through his mind, the boy had run forward into the shop with an energetic stamp, and setting himself about four feet from Deronda, with his hands in the pockets of his miniature knickerbockers, looked at him with a precocious air of survey. Perhaps it was chiefly with a diplomatic design to linger and ingratiate himself that Deronda patted the boy's head, saying-- ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract⎯We {{consider}} a single server retrial queue with batch arrivals, two phases of heterogeneous service and multiple vacations with N- policy. The primary arrivals find the server busy or doing secondary job (vacation) will join orbit (group of <b>repeated</b> <b>calls).</b> If {{the number of}} <b>repeated</b> <b>calls</b> in orbit is less than N, the server does the secondary job repeatedly until the retrial group size reaches N. At the secondary job completion epoch, if the orbit size is at least N, then server remains in the system to render service either for primary <b>calls</b> or for <b>repeated</b> <b>calls.</b> For the proposed model, we carry out steady state system size distribution of number of customers in retrial group. We discuss its application of the proposed model {{to the analysis of}} a communication protocol like SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and etc. Keywords⎯N-Policy multiple vacations, Retrial queue, TCP/IP protocol, SMTP protocol. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Thompson {{could make}} little {{traction}} {{in the race}} against Busbee, who refused the Republican's <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> for debates. He alleged that Busbee was tied to the Georgia Power Company, milk interests, and International Telephone and Telegraph and {{that the bulk of}} Busbee's funding was from [...] "special interests". Busbee was so far ahead in public opinion polls that he could ignore Thompson. And it was a heavily Democratic year nationally in the aftermath of Watergate.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of step-by-step and other early systems {{is that the}} preference for choosing trunks or selector links is fixed, and the most preferred links are used more often, {{with the result that}} the same faulty hardware blocks <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> attempts until it is removed from service. 5XB markers were designed to rotate preferences {{in such a way that}} it is highly unlikely that the same circuit elements will be used in the next call. Thus, if a call encounters an equipment problem, a second try will probably succeed.|$|E

The mating behavior {{begins with a}} <b>repeated</b> <b>call,</b> usually by the male but sometimes by a female if kept singly. The male will display his tail feathers by dipping his head low and raising his tail, spreading the long feathers like a fan towards a desired female while uttering a two-note coo. The pair will stay together for long periods, greeting each other with low coos and vibrating their wings, or symbolically preening each other with rapid light pecks.|$|E

As the bombs continue to fall, destroying the plantation buildings, Lucky states in no uncertain terms that General MacArthur will make good on his pledge to return and free the Philippines and its people. He concludes with [...] "America, send us the tanks and the guns, and we'll finish the job. Manila calling, Manila calling".|$|E
50|$|In Bismarck, not for {{the first}} time, Lockhart made a name for herself for her habit of {{constantly}} projecting her infectiously quirky worldview onto what was happening on the ice. She initially baffled spectators, but fortunately not her team-mates, with her <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> for stones to be delivered at boob weight - which began to make sense when she pointed out that a call for barrier weight is normally signalled by an arm across the chest. In the latter stages of the competition, despite what was at stake, she and her team-mates Sheila Swan, Katriona Fairweather and Anne Laird jumped into an immediate frenzy of dancing every time a burst of pop music was played between ends. None of this distracted from the task in hand, however, and the team won Scotland's first ever women's world title.|$|E
