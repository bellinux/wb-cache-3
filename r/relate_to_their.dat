5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E

5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E

25|$|Items {{from the}} shanty and sea song {{repertoire}} {{have been brought}} into the repertoires of performers of folk music, rock, and Western classical music. Sources for these renditions include books by folklorists and commercial recordings by shanty revival performers. The forms these performers produce tend to be quite standardized and <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> source material {{similar to the way}} a cover song does. This can be contrasted with the method of performers focusing on maritime music, who tend {{to think of themselves as}} operating within that genre or a tradition, and who develop their repertoire from multiple sources and through various experiences.|$|E
25|$|DZ-manga {{has come}} to {{encompass}} a variety of artworks that differ widely in how they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> Japanese predecessors. These disparate works are united by their use of references to and techniques from Japanese manga: they frequently use drawing styles derived from it, often incorporate the stylized aesthetics and facial portrayals that popularly characterize the medium, and occasionally even refer directly to characters or plotlines from famous works. Within this loose commonality, however, lies {{a broad spectrum of}} stylistic variations. Books produced by Algerian manga publisher Z-Link are carefully modeled after the Japanese format, in stark contrast to those produced by young-adult literature publisher Kaza, which are colorized and read left-to-right.|$|E

25|$|Activities and {{functions}} of R are highly confidential and declassification of past operations are uncommon unlike agencies like CIA, MI6 and Mossad who have many of their activities declassified. The Secretary (R) reported to the Vohra Committee that R offices abroad have limited strength and are largely geared to the collection of military, economic, scientific and political intelligence. R monitors the activities of certain organisations abroad only insofar as they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> involvement with narco terrorist elements and smuggling arms, ammunition, explosives, etc. into India. It does not monitor the activities of criminal elements abroad, which are mainly confined to normal smuggling without any links to terrorist elements. However, if {{there is evidence to}} suggest that certain organisations have links with Intelligence agencies of other countries, and that they are being used or are likely to be used by such countries for destabilising India's economy, it would become R's responsibility to monitor their activities.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part the femur and tibia are the longest leg {{segments}} but variations in the lengths and robustness of each segment <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> functions. For example, gressorial and cursorial, or walking and running type insects respectively, usually have well-developed femora and tibiae on all legs, whereas jumping (saltatorial) insects such as grasshoppers have disproportionately developed metafemora and metatibiae. In aquatic beetles (Coleoptera) and bugs (Hemiptera), the tibiae and/or tarsi of one or more pairs of legs usually are modified for swimming (natatorial) with fringes of long, slender hairs. Many ground-dwelling insects, such as mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae), nymphal cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae), and scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae), have the tibiae of the forelegs (protibiae) enlarged and modified for digging (fossorial), whereas the forelegs of some predatory insects, such as mantispid lacewings (Neuroptera) and mantids (Mantodea), are specialized for seizing prey, or raptorial. The tibia and basal tarsomere of each hindleg of honey bees are modified for the collection and carriage of pollen.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networks}} {{are beginning to}} be adopted by healthcare professionals {{as a means to}} manage institutional knowledge, disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions. The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners. A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments. For people suffering from life altering diseases, PatientsLikeMe offers its members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and research patient data related to their condition. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> situation. DailyStrength is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by PatientsLikeMe and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. SparkPeople offers community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. Fitocracy and QUENTIQ are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users.|$|E

(For legal reasons, all references to movies and actors were fictional.) In addition, the dog's body transforms based {{on the theme of}} the area that players are in. In the world of Prehistoria, the dog is transformed into a feral wolf, in the Antiqua region he becomes a greyhound, in Gothica he {{takes the form of a}} fancy poodle, and in Omnitopia he becomes a robotic toaster-dog capable of shooting lasers.|$|E
30|$|The {{middle section}} of Table  5 reports the {{distribution}} of educational degree–occupation relatedness by NHRI classes. Again, the correlation between NVRI and NHRI is also obvious here. While 41  % of immigrants {{who are in the}} first NVRIC (those who have an educational degree that is the most observed in their occupation) work in jobs that are most <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> field of study, only 17  % of those in NVRIC- 1 work in jobs that are least <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> field of study. This pattern changes for those in the NVRIC- 5 category: only 13  % of workers with surplus or deficit in schooling in their occupation work in jobs that are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> jobs. One critical observation emerges here when we compare these NVRI and NHRI distributions. While 75  % of internationally educated immigrants work in jobs that are considered by the native-born least <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> field of study, 27  % of those have a degree that is least <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> occupation. From this observation, it seems that the occupational mismatch of foreign-educated immigrants is mainly dominated by field of study–occupation relatedness relative to educational degree–occupation relatedness. Nevertheless, although immigrants are much more smoothly distributed across NVRI classes, there is a clear wage penalty for immigrants in occupations that are regarded as relatively less <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> degrees by native-born workers as shown {{at the bottom of the}} table.|$|R

500|$|In Egyptian belief, names {{express the}} {{fundamental}} {{nature of the}} things to which they refer. In keeping with this belief, the names of deities often <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> roles or origins. The name of the predatory goddess Sekhmet means [...] "powerful one", {{the name of the}} mysterious god Amun means [...] "hidden one", {{and the name of the}} goddess Nekhbet, who was worshipped in the city of Nekheb, means [...] "she of Nekheb". But many other names have no certain meaning, even when the gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role. The names of the sky goddess Nut and the earth god Geb do not resemble the Egyptian terms for sky and earth.|$|E
500|$|Lafayette {{arrived at}} New York on 15 August 1824, {{accompanied}} by his son Georges Washington and his secretary Auguste Levasseur. On arrival, Lafayette was greeted {{by a group of}} Revolutionary War veterans, who had fought alongside him many years before. [...] New York erupted for four continuous days and nights of celebration. When he departed for what he thought would be a restful trip to Boston, he instead found the route lined by cheering citizens, with welcomes organized in every town along the way. According to Unger, [...] "It was a mystical experience they would <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> heirs through generations to come. [...] Lafayette had materialized from a distant age, the last leader and hero at the nation's defining moment. They knew they and the world would never see his kind again." ...|$|E
500|$|The early {{thinking}} of the object relations school of psychoanalysis, particularly Melanie Klein, influenced Bowlby. However, he profoundly disagreed with the prevalent psychoanalytic belief that infants' responses <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> internal fantasy life rather than real-life events. As Bowlby formulated his concepts, he was influenced by case studies on disturbed and delinquent children, {{such as those of}} William Goldfarb published in 1943 and 1945. [...] Bowlby's contemporary René Spitz observed separated children's grief, proposing that [...] "psychotoxic" [...] results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care. A strong influence was the work of social worker and psychoanalyst James Robertson who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital which was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visits by parents.|$|E
