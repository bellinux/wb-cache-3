40|$|The {{first part}} of this two-part thesis {{examines}} the <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation</b> of auto-thermal methane reforming in a microreactor. A theoretical study is undertaken to explain the physical origins of the experimentally observed improvements in the performance of the <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation</b> compared to the unidirectional operation. First, a scaling analysis is presented to understand the effect of various time scales existing within the microreactor, and to obtain guidelines for the optimal <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation.</b> Then, the effect of kinetic parameters, transport properties, reactor design and operating conditions on the reactor operation is parametrically studied through numerical simulations. The <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation</b> is shown to be more robust than the unidirectional operation with respect to both optimal operating conditions as well as variations in hydrogen throughput requirements. A rational scheme for improved catalyst placement in the microreactor, which exploits the spatial temperature profiles in the reactor, is also presented. Finally, a design modification of the microreactor called "opposed-flow" reactor, which retains the performance benefits of the <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation</b> without requiring the input / output port switching, is suggested. In the second part of this thesis, a novel simulation-based Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) framework is presented for optimal control of switching between multiple metabolic states in a microbial bioreactor. The cybernetic modeling framework is used to capture these cellular metabolic switches. Model Predictive Control, {{one of the most popular}} advanced control methods, is able to drive the reactor to the desired steady state. However, the nonlinearity and switching nature of the system cause computational and performance problems with MPC. The proposed ADP has an advantage over MPC, as the closed-loop optimal policy is computed offline in the form of so-called value or cost-to-go function. Through the use of an approximation of the value function, the infinite horizon problem is converted into an equivalent single-stage problem, which can be solved online. Various issues in implementation of ADP are also addressed. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Jay H. Lee; Committee Member: Andrei G.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of a <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation</b> of a fixed-bed catalytic reactor, where the highly exothermal partial oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride is processed, {{is accomplished by}} using a heterogeneous one-dimensional model, which accounts for mass transport by diffusion and convection inside large-pore catalytic particles. The dynamic behaviour of the reactor is analysed by varying the inlet conditions and the switching period. This work points out the benefits that can arise {{from the use of}} the <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation,</b> namely the decrease of the hot-spot temperature and the more favourable temperature distribution along the bed. In spite of the lower temperature profiles, the final conversion, as well as selectivity and yield of phthalic anhydride are not significantly affected. The results predicted by the heterogeneous model with intraparticle convection and diffusion, HTdc model, are compared with those obtained when diffusion is the only transport mechanism inside the catalyst, HTd model. A comparison with the simple pseudo-homogeneous model, PH, is also achieved. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} {{followed by}} fuel synthesis {{is one of}} the alternatives for producing liquid fuels and chemicalsfrom biomass feedstocks. The gas produced by gasification contains CO, H 2, H 2 O, CO 2, light hydrocarbons and tars. Thelight hydrocarbons can account for as much as 50 % of the total energy content of the gas, {{depending on the type of}} gasifier,operating conditions and feedstock. The gas also contains catalyst poisons such as sulphur, in the form of H 2 S and COS. Thispaper presents simulations of a reverse-flow partial-oxidation reformer that converts the light hydrocarbons into more synthesisgas, while achieving efficiencies approaching that of conventional catalytic processes. Variations in parameters such as pressure,amount of oxidant and steam-to-carbon ratio were also investigated. Simulations of the reforming of natural gas were includedfor comparison. The results show the benefits of using <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation</b> with lean gases such as gasifier product gas...|$|E
40|$|Forced {{periodic}} operation {{can lead}} to improved reaction processes. Such operation is studied for {{the example of the}} application of a cascade of connected adiabatic fixed-bed reactors to perform catalytic total oxidation. It is shown that the periodic operation of the configuration considered allows an autothermal operation. The concept can outperform classical <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation</b> concerning the reduction of slips of unconverted feed. A simple model based on the assumption of a hypothetical countercurrent of the solid phase is derived and compared with a standard dynamical model of the reactor cascade. By evaluation of steady state profiles and application of bifurcation theory, it is demonstrated that the reduced model describes the limiting case for an infinitely segmented cascade and allows assessment of important properties of the periodic process. It permits a fast and detailed analysis of limit point bifurcations, which result in curves enclosing the region of desired ignited states of the reactor. Using singularity analysis further helps to understand the influence of secondary parameters and to identify operational limits. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

40|$|The {{application}} of membranes in life sciences, e. g. {{in red and}} white biotechnology, has increased lately with the advanced understanding of membrane processes. Red biotechnology is applied to medical processes for human health care such as the production of antibodies. White or also-called industrial biotechnology deals with industrial processes e. g. the production of chemicals and fuels. Especially downstream processing for product recovery and purication is very cost-intensive. In situ product recovery (ISPR) presents a form of process integration where the formation and {{the separation of the}} product take place in one reactor thereby reducing costs. By combining these two steps, ISPR leads to higher productivities and yields and it enables continuous operation. Using membranes for ISPR is advantageous since a continuous product recovery and cell retention can be ensured at the same time with easy scale-up. This thesis presents a novel ISPR process named reverse-flow diafiltration. This process offers a long-term stable operation characterized by low transmembrane pressures. It features submerged hollow-fiber membranes which are integrated in the fermenter. Two liquid streams are exchanged alternatingly over the same membrane in a <b>reverse-flow</b> <b>operation</b> mode: One supplies the nutrient solution (inside-out filtration), the second one extracts product solution (outside-in filtration). As a result no net flux over the membrane occurs and cake-layer formation by particle accumulation is kept low. In addition no permeate is wasted for backflushing the membrane. A short emptying interval in-between the two steps using air or permeate respectively are applied, for emptying the inside dead volume of the membrane lumen to improve product yield. This concept of reverse-flow diafiltration is tested with different media such as model yeast suspension, fungi fermentation broth and antibody fermentation broth. A scale-up to three parallel membranes is conducted. Also high-flux microfiltration membranes, namely microsieves and micromeshes, are tested. A proof of principle of reverse-flow diafiltration is conducted using model yeast suspension at different cell concentrations. The concept shows much lower transmembrane pressures than conventional dead-end filtration with backflush. To empty the dead volume of the membrane lumen, different emptying modes are assessed. It is shown that emptying with permeate leads to a more effective emptying and stable operation than air emptying. RFD with permeate emptying is adapted to a continuous fermentation process for itaconic acid production using the fungi cells of Ustilago maydis. Also for such complex suspensions, RFD offers much higher fluxes and permeabilities than conventional dead-end filtration. Also for antibody fermentation reverse-flow diafiltration was successfully applied. Here the challenge was to prevent protein adsorption, enable stable fluxes and provide cell retention at the same time. The process was successfully operated for two weeks applying a wide range of dilution rates. The reverse-flow diafiltration process is very promising for future ISPR applications towards continuous fermentation processes. It enables stable filtration performance and product recovery values over longer time periods than conventional submerged processes. It is promising especially for more complex fermentation suspensions such as fungi suspensions, characterized by high viscosity and filamentous organisms. Also for shear-sensitive organisms, such as mammalian cells, RFD offers an advantage eliminating the need for high cross-flow velocities. In terms of capacity, RFD can already compete with state-of-the-art technology such as settlers, tangential-flow filtration or spin filters. During the last years a trend in biotechnology towards single-use systems has evolved providing a higher flexibility to market demand. An integrated single-use recovery device such as a membrane module could enable long-term continuous product recovery. Here submerged membranes using the reverse-flow diafiltration concept offer a great opportunity...|$|E
