The 1988 election saw Jewish voters favor Democrat Michael Dukakis by 64%, while George H. W.

25|$|Former Governor Ronald Reagan of California was the odds-on {{favorite}} to win his party's nomination for president after nearly beating incumbent President Gerald Ford just four years earlier. Reagan dominated the primaries, early driving from the field Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker from Tennessee, former governor John Connally of Texas, Senator <b>Robert</b> <b>Dole</b> from Kansas, Representative Phil Crane from Illinois, and Representative John Anderson from Illinois, {{who dropped out of}} the race to run as an Independent. George Bush from Texas posed the strongest challenge to Reagan with his victories in the Pennsylvania and Michigan primaries, but it was not enough to turn the tide. Reagan won the nomination on the first round at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan, in July, then chose George H. W. Bush, his top rival, as his running mate.|$|E
2500|$|Kirkpatrick briefly {{considered}} {{running for}} President in 1988 against George H. W. Bush, because she {{believed he was}} not tough enough on Communism. Kirkpatrick endorsed Senator <b>Robert</b> <b>Dole</b> of Kansas, who was the runner up to Bush. Despite a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses, Dole's campaign quickly faded after he lost the New Hampshire primary in February 1988. Kirkpatrick was an active surrogate campaigner for Dole even as he was losing, as was her old foe, Alexander Haig, who endorsed Dole after ending his own 1988 campaign several days before the New Hampshire primary.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{about one}} third of Catholics voted for Bush's reelection in 1992, most Catholic defectors {{switched}} to independent Ross Perot, not the successful Democrat Bill Clinton. Unlike previous elections (such as in 1972, when George McGovern's Catholic support was eight percentage points higher than overall) the Catholic vote was not more Democratic than the overall electorate, but split almost identically to it. The trend away from a Democratic dominance of the Catholic vote continued in 1994, when {{for the first time}} in history Democrats did not receive a majority of Catholic votes in elections for the House of Representatives; as with 1992, the Catholic vote split resembled that of the overall electorate. [...] White non-Hispanic Catholics however, remained majority Republican. This trend reversed slightly in 1996, when Clinton's share of Catholics in general was four percentage points ahead of overall, and they comprised about half of the margin between him and the unsuccessful challenger <b>Robert</b> <b>Dole.</b> The 1990s ended, however, with Catholics as [...] "the largest swing vote in American politics" [...] and with white non-Hispanic Catholics continuing to vote consistently Republican.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the nine}} days of Senate {{hearings}} concerning whether {{to amend the}} Act, Section 2 was the primary focus—in particular, whether to amend Section 2 to create a [...] "results" [...] test that prohibited any voting law that had a discriminatory effect, irrespective of whether the law was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose. President Reagan opposed creating a results test because its impact would be uncertain. Furthermore, some members of Congress, such as Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), raised concerns that a results test would fundamentally alter American democracy by requiring courts to impose proportional representation for protected minority groups as a remedy. To assuage this concern, Senator <b>Robert</b> <b>Dole</b> (R-KS) proposed legislative language explicitly disclaiming that a results test would require proportional representation. This compromise won support from the Senate, the House, and the Reagan Administration. The House passed {{this version of the}} bill by a 389-24 vote, and the Senate passed it by an 85-8 vote. President Reagan signed the legislation into law on June 29, 1982. The creation of the Section 2 results test shifted the majority of litigation brought under the Voting Rights Act from claims of Section 5 violations to claims of Section 2 violations.|$|E
