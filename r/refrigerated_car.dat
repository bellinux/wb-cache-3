2500|$|The {{refrigerated}} {{rail car}} (refrigerated van or refrigerator car), {{along with the}} dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before {{the invention of the}} refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots. [...] Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car.

[...] During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war. [...] The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests.

He used modified otter trawl nets to greatly expand the catch and make use of deeper waters. He and his brother-in-law, Salvatore Versaggi, expanded operations to St. Augustine, Florida.

40|$|Numerical {{analyses}} by {{finite element}} method and experimental tests are used to determine static and dynamic behaviour of railway vehicles. Experimental measurements are very time consuming and expensive, so they cannot be used at all stages of design. Numerical simulations {{do not have the}} disadvantages of experimental methods, but it is necessary to verify them by experiments to obtain realistic results. Fullwidth/ full-length, half-width/full-length and half-width/half-length modeling approaches can be used to determine static and vibrational behaviours of railway vehicles depending or not on the symmetry of roof structure and applied load. Different static loading cases defined in standards such as EN 12663, UIC CODE OR 577 and ERRI B 12 /RP 17 have to be considered in FE analyses. Evaluation of stress states, buckling and vibrational behaviours for a roof structure of a railway freight <b>refrigerated</b> <b>car</b> are presented. To highlight the vibrational behaviour of the structure normal mode (free vibration) analyses are performed.

It is also benefit for the citizen, because cold chain could promise the food safety and the demand of the special cold food. Beijing, as the capital, the level of food chain is high, compared to other cities, and analysis of the demand status and forecast of food cold chain in Beijing is necessary, it could direct the scientific and health development of cold chain all over our country. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, in accordance with the investigation, we analysis the demand status of food cold chain from two aspects, then according to the status, we forecast the demand of refrigerated cars and warehouse for food cold chain in Beijing with the multivariate statistics. Findings: From the analysis of the paper, we can see that the need of cold chain logistics grows rapidly, but most consumers are lack of the awareness {{of the importance of the}} cold chain and many companies cannot bear the huge investment, it make the gap of the resources of cold chain logistics large and cannot meet the normal need of cold chain logistics in Beijing.
