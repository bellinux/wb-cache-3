In present study, a F 2 mapping population comprising 325 individuals {{was developed by}} crossing PSMD sus-ceptible genotype (Gullyal white) and PSMD resistant genotype (BSMR 736). We identified a set of 32 out of 300 short decamer random DNA markers that showed polymorphism between Gullyal white and BSMR 736 parents. Among them, eleven DNA markers showed polymorphism including coupling and <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> type of polymorphism across the parents. Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA), revealed that the DNA marker, IABTPPN 7, produced a single coupling phase marker (IABTPPN 7414) and a <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> marker (IABTPPN 7983) co-segregating with PSMD reaction.

40|$|Although most {{high-density}} linkage maps {{have been}} constructed from codominant markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites due to their high linkage information, dominant markers {{can be expected to}} be even more significant as proteomic technique becomes widely applicable to generate protein polymorphism data from large samples. However, for dominant markers, two possible linkage phases between a pair of markers complicate the estimation of recombination fractions between markers and consequently the construction of linkage maps. The low linkage information of the <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> and high linkage information of coupling phase have led geneticists to construct two separate but related linkage maps. To circumvent this problem, we proposed a new method for estimating the recombination fraction between markers, which greatly improves the accuracy of estimation through distinction between the coupling phase and the <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> of the linked loci. The results obtained from both real and simulated F 2 dominant marker data indicate that the recombination fractions estimated by the new method contain a large amount of linkage information for constructing a complete linkage map. In addition, the new method is also applicable to data with mixed types of markers (dominant and codominant) with unknown linkage phase...|$|E

Three sets of rice populations with overlapping segregating regions in isogenic backgrounds were established in the generations of BC 2 F 5, BC 2 F 6 and BC 2 F 7, derived from Zhenshan 97 and Milyang 46, and used for dissection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain weight. Two QTL linked in <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> on the long arm of chromosome 1 were separated. One was located between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers RM 11437 and RM 11615, having a smaller additive effect with the enhancing allele from the maintainer line Zhenshan 97 and a partially dominant effect for increasing grain weight. The other was located between SSR markers RM 11615 and RM 11800, having a larger additive effect with the enhancing allele from the restorer line Milyang 46 and a partially dominant effect for increasing grain weight. When the two QTL segregated simultaneously, a residual additive effect with the enhancing allele from Milyang 46 and an over-dominance effect for increasing grain weight were detected.

A genetic linkage map {{was developed for}} S. officinarum (clone IJ 76 - 514) using a segregating population generated from a cross between Q 165 (a commercial sugarcane cultivar) and IJ 76 - 514. In total, 40 AFLP and 72 SSR primer pairs were screened across the population, revealing 595 polymorphic bands inherited from IJ 76 - 514. These 595 markers displayed a frequency distribution different from all other sugarcane genetic maps produced, with only 40 % being simplex markers (segregated 1 : 1). Of these 240 simplex markers, 178 were distributed on 47 linkage groups (LGs) and 62 remained unlinked.

In this study four genetic maps were constructed for two intergeneric populations. The first population (BC 1) was generated from a cross between an Erianthus/Saccharum hybrid YC 96 - 40 and a commercial sugarcane variety CP 84 - 1198. The second population (BC 2) was generated from a cross between YCE 01 - 116, a progeny of the BC 1 cross and NJ 57 - 416, a commercial sugarcane cultivar. Markers across both populations were generated using 35 AFLP and 23 SSR primer pairs. A total of 756 and 728 polymorphic markers were scored in the BC 1 and BC 2 populations, respectively. In the BC 1 population, a higher proportion of markers was derived from the Erianthus ancestor than those from the Saccharum ancestor Badila. In the BC 2 population, both the number and proportion of markers derived from Erianthus were approximately half of those in the BC 1 population.

40|$|The {{robustness}} of {{the maximum}} likelihood estimates of recombination frequencies has been investigated in double intercrosses with complete dominance at both loci.

In the coupling phase, the recombination frequency estimates are quite robust with respect {{to most of the}} investigated factors. Potentially, the most serious cause of a bias is misclassifications, which tend to increase the recombination frequency estimates. In the <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase,</b> misclassifications are particularly serious, leading to extreme discrepancies between true and observed values.

40|$|Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies often employ segregating generations {{derived from}} a cross between genetically {{divergent}} inbred lines. In the analysis of such data it is customary to fit a single QTL and use a null hypothesis which assumes that the genomic region under study contributes no genetic variance. To explore {{the situation in which}} multiple linked genes contribute to the genetic variance, we simulated an F- 2 -mapping experiment in which the genetic difference between the two original inbred strains was caused by a large number of loci, each having equal effect on the quantitative trait. QTLs were either in coupling, dispersion or <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> in the base population of inbred lines, with the expected F- 2 genetic variance explained by the QTLs being equivalent in the three models. Where QTLs were in coupling phase, one inbred line was fixed for all plus alleles, and the other line was fixed for minus alleles. Where QTLs were in dispersion phase, they were assumed to be randomly fixed for one or other allele (as if the inbred lines had evolved from a common ancestor by random drift). Where QTLs were in <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> alleles within an inbred line were alternating plus and minus at adjacent loci, and alternative alleles were fixed in the two inbred lines. In all these genetic models a standard interval mapping test statistic used to determine whether there is a QTL of large effect segregating in the population was inflated on average. Furthermore, the use of a threshold for QTL detection derived under the assumption that no QTLs were segregating would often lead to spurious conclusions regards the presence of genes of large effects (i. e. type I errors). The employment of an alternative model for the analysis, including linked markers as cofactors in the analysis of a single interval, reduced the problem. of type I error rate, although test statistics were still inflated relative to the case of no QTLs. It is argued that in practice one should take into account the difference between the strains or the genetic variance in the F- 2 population when setting significance thresholds. In addition, tests designed to probe the adequacy of a single-QTL model or of an alternative infinitesimal coupling model are described. Such tests should be applied in QTL mapping studies to help dissect the true nature of genetic variation...|$|E

Sixteen new mutants have been isolated with tan saddle seed coat, Mdh 1 null and yellow foliage phenotypes;All tan saddle seed coat mutants, the 21 Mdh 1 null mutants, the 18 yellow foliage mutants were allelic at the k 2, Mdh 1 -n, and y 20 loci, respectively. k 2, Mdhl-n and y 20 alleles were inherited as a single nuclear recessive alleles, respectively. Approximately 1 ± 1. 36 % recombination rate between the k 2 and the Mdh 1 -n loci was detected in coupling phase in F 2 plants from the crosses of T 261 (k 2 Mdh 1 -n) with wild type plants and approximately 3. 04 ± 0. 48 % recombination rate was estimated between the k 2 and Mdh 1 -n y 20 loci in F 2 : 3 families with tan saddle seed coat from crossing T 317 (Mdh 1 -n y 20) with T 239 (k 2) and L 67 - 3483 (k 2);Approximately 55 - 60 % recombination rates between the k 2 and Mdh 1 -n y 20 loci were detected in <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> in F 2 plants derived from crossing T 323 (Mdh 1 -n y 20), T 324 (Mdh 1 -n y 20) and T 325 (Mdh 1 -n y 20) with T 239 (k 2) and L 67 - 3483 (k 2). The excess of the recombinants in <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> in F 2 plants was suggested to be chromosomal breakage at the k 2 Mdh 1 Y 20 region in T 239 and L 67 - 3483. However, no recombinants were identified in F 2 plants in <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> in the crosses of T 317 (Mdh 1 -n y 20) with T 239 (k 2) and L 67 - 3483 (k 2) and no recombinations among the k 2, Mdh 1 -n and y 20 loci were detected in coupling phase in about 13, 187 F 2 plants;Genetic instability were evident by introducing the w 4 -m and Y 18 -m mutable systems, and by introducing the Mdh 1 -n allele of PI 567. 630 A into T 239 (k 2) and T 261 (k 2 Mdh 1 -n) genetic backgrounds. Sixteen bright yellow mutants with tan saddle seed coat, malate dehydrogenase null phenotypes and 21 greenish yellow mutants with tan saddle seed coat have been isolated. Fifteen bright yellow mutants and 21 greenish yellow mutants were found to be due to the mutations at the Mdh 1 Y 20 loci in T 239. However, no mutants were identified in 945 F 2 families in the control crosses with the T 239 isogenic line, Harosoy, as one cross parent, indicating that the mutations at the Mdh 1 Y 20 loci in T 239 were due to the impact of the k 2 allele in T 239. Finally, the genetic instability at the k 2 Mdh 1 -n y 20 chromosomal region was suggested to be receptor element activities at this chromosomal region which may contain complex chromosomal rearrangements in T 239 and T 261;Finally, a heritable heterozygous female semisterile factor has been isolated in L 67 - 3483 genetic background and four monogenically inherited nuclear recessive male-sterile mutants have been isolated in this dissertation research...|$|E
40|$|Identification of {{resistance}} (R) genes to Phytophthora infestans {{is an essential}} step in molecular breeding of potato. We identified three specific R genes segregating in a diploid mapping population. One of the R genes is located on chromosome 4 and proved phenotypically indistinguishable from the Solanum demissum-derived R 2, although S. demissum is not {{directly involved in the}} pedigree of the population. By bulked segregant analysis combined with a resistance assay, a genetic linkage map of the R 2 -like locus was constructed with 30 coupling and 23 <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> AFLP markers. Two markers flanking the R 2 -like locus were applied to screen an extended population of 1, 586 offspring. About 103 recombinants were selected, and an accurate high-resolution map was constructed. The R 2 -like resistance was localized in a 0. 4 cM interval and was found co-segregating with four AFLP markers, which can be used to isolate the R 2 -like gene by map-based gene cloning. By analyzing race-specificity and R gene-specific molecular markers, we also found that an R 1 -like gene and an additional unknown R gene are segregating in the populatio...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative trait loci (QTL) {{affecting}} {{milk production}} {{and health of}} dairy cattle were mapped in a very large Holstein granddaughter design. The analysis included 1794 sons of 14 sires and 206 genetic markers distributed across all 29 autosomes and flanking an estimated 2497 autosomal cM using Kosambi's mapping function. All families were analyzed jointly with least-squares (LS) and variance components (VC) methods. A total of 6 QTL exceeding approximate experiment-wise significance thresholds, 24 QTL exceeding suggestive thresholds, and 34 QTL exceeding chromosome-wise thresholds were identified. Significance thresholds were determined via data permutation (for LS analysis) and chi-square distribution (for VC analysis). The average bootstrap confidence interval for the experiment-wise significant QTL was 48 cM. Some chromosomes harbored QTL affecting several traits, and these were always in coupling phase, defined by consistency with genetic correlations among traits. Chromosome 17 likely harbors 2 QTL affecting milk yield, and some other chromosomes showed some evidence for 2 linked QTL affecting the same trait. In each of these cases, the 2 QTL were in <b>repulsion</b> <b>phase</b> in those families appearing to be heterozygous for both QTL, a finding which supports the build-up of linkage disequilibrium due to selection...|$|E
40|$|A {{periodic}} potential {{applied to}} a nanotube is shown to lock electrons into incompressible states that can form a devil's staircase. Electron interactions result in spectral gaps when the electron density (relative to a half-filled Carbon pi-band) is a rational number per potential period, {{in contrast to the}} single-particle case where only the integer-density gaps are allowed. When electrons are weakly bound to the potential, incompressible states arise due to Bragg diffraction in the Luttinger liquid. Charge gaps are enhanced due to quantum fluctuations, whereas neutral excitations are governed by an effective SU(4) ~O(6) Gross-Neveu Lagrangian. In the opposite limit of the tightly bound electrons, effects of exchange are unimportant, and the system behaves as a single fermion mode that represents a Wigner crystal pinned by the external potential, with the gaps dominated by the Coulomb <b>repulsion.</b> The <b>phase</b> diagram is drawn using the effective spinless Dirac Hamiltonian derived in this limit. Incompressible states can be detected in the adiabatic transport setup realized by a slowly moving potential wave, with electron interactions providing the possibility of pumping of a fraction of an electron per cycle (equivalently, in pumping {{at a fraction of the}} base frequency).

40|$|We study {{two species}} of (or spin- 1 / 2) fermions with {{short-range}} intra-species repulsion {{in the presence of}} opposite (effective) magnetic field, each at Landau level filling factor 1 / 3. In the absence of inter-species interaction, the ground state is simply two copies of the 1 / 3 Laughlin state, with opposite chirality, representing the fractional topological insulator (FTI) phase. We show this phase is stable against moderate inter-species interactions. However strong enough inter-species <b>repulsion</b> leads to <b>phase</b> separation, while strong enough inter-species attraction drives the system into a superfluid phase. We obtain the phase diagram through exact diagonalization calculations. The FTI-superfluid phase transition is shown to be in the (2 + 1) D XY universality class, using an appropriate Chern-Simons-Ginsburg-Landau effective field theory. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|In charged {{colloidal}} suspensions, {{the competition}} between square-well attraction and long-range Yukawa repulsion leads to various stable domains and Wigner supercrystals. Using a continuum model and symmetry arguments, a phase diagram of spheres, cylinders, and lamellae is obtained {{as a function of}} two control parameters, the volume fraction and the ratio between the surface tension and repulsion. Above a critical value of the ratio, the microphase cannot be supported by the Yukawa <b>repulsion</b> and macroscopic <b>phase</b> separation occurs. This finding quantitatively explains the lack of pattern formation in simple liquids because of the small hard sphere diameter in comparison with the size of macromolecules. The phase diagram also predicts microphase separation at zero value of the ratio, suggesting the possibility of self-assembly in repulsive systems. Comment: 4 pages and 4 figure...|$|R
