5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) <b>radar</b> <b>beacons,</b> now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E
5|$|The first Allied {{action of}} D-Day was Operation Deadstick, a glider assault at 00:16 at Pegasus Bridge over the Caen Canal and the bridge (since renamed Horsa Bridge) over the Orne, {{half a mile}} (800 metres) to the east. Both bridges were quickly {{captured}} intact, with light casualties, {{by members of the}} 5th Parachute Brigade and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The five bridges over the Dives were destroyed with minimal difficulty by the 3rd Parachute Brigade. Meanwhile, the pathfinders tasked with setting up <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> and lights for further paratroopers (scheduled to begin arriving at 00:50 to clear the landing zone north of Ranville) were blown off course, and had to set up the navigation aids too far east. Many paratroopers, also blown too far east, landed far from their intended drop zones; some took hours or even days to be reunited with their units. Major General Richard Gale arrived in the third wave of gliders at 03:30, along with equipment, such as antitank guns and jeeps, and more troops to help secure the area from counter-attacks, which were initially staged only by troops in the immediate vicinity of the landings. At 02:00, the commander of the German 716th Infantry Division ordered Feuchtinger to move his 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation. Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne.|$|E
25|$|One {{of several}} methods the IRA used to counter British body armour {{was the use}} of high {{velocity}} Barrett Light 50 and Belgian FN sniper rifles, several of which the Provisionals imported from the USA. Two snipers teams of the South Armagh Brigade killed nine members of the security forces in this way. To avoid the jamming of wireless-triggered detonators, the organisation began to employ <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> to prime their explosive devices, improving dramatically the effectiveness of the attacks. By 1992, the use of long-range weapons like mortars and heavy machine guns by the IRA had forced the British Army to build its checkpoints one to five miles from the border in order to avoid attacks launched from the Republic.|$|E

25|$|With Giant II cancelled, Operation Giant I was {{reactivated}} to drop two battalions of the 504th PIR at Capua on September 13. However, significant German counterattacks, {{beginning on}} September 12, {{resulted in a}} shrinking of the American perimeter and threatened destruction of the Salerno beachhead. As a result, Giant I was cancelled and the 504th PIR instead dropped into the beachhead {{on the night of}} September 13 using transponding <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> as a guide. The next night the 505th PIR was also dropped into the beachhead as reinforcement. In all, 3,500 paratroopers made the most concentrated mass night drop in history, providing the model for the American airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. An additional drop on the night of September 14–15 of the 509th PIB to destroy a key bridge at Avellino, to disrupt German motorized movements, was badly dispersed and failed to destroy the bridge before the Germans withdrew to the north.|$|E
500|$|The British Tizard Mission to the United States in 1940 {{demonstrated}} to leading American scientists the successful {{application of the}} cavity magnetron to produce short wavelength pulsed radar. The National Defense Research Committee, established only months earlier by President Franklin Roosevelt, created a central national laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) {{for the purpose of}} developing military applications of microwave radar. Lawrence immediately recruited his best [...] "cyclotroneers", among them Alvarez, who joined this new laboratory, known as the Radiation Laboratory, on November 11, 1940.

50|$|The {{low clouds}} and {{extremely}} intense anti-aircraft fire caused the pathfinder sticks {{to be dropped}} off course, with only one stick landing in the correct place (Ambrose, p. 196). Their <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> did work somewhat effectively; even though the pathfinders set up their equipment off course, many of the sticks of follow up paratroopers landed clustered near these beacons.|$|E
50|$|Buoys {{serviced}} by the Papaw ranged from tiny 6 ft nun buoys to the 35 ft tall 18,000 lb Galveston Entrance Channel Buoy. Most buoys {{are equipped with}} electrical lights powered by batteries and solar cells. Some have sound signals, <b>radar</b> <b>beacons,</b> and elaborate power systems. All buoys are pulled from the water {{at least once a}} year for painting, maintenance, and position checks.|$|E
50|$|Their {{characteristics}} are {{defined in the}} ITU-R Recommendation M.824, Technical Parameters of <b>Radar</b> <b>Beacons</b> (RACONS). Racons usually operate on the 9320 MHz to 9500 MHz marine radar band (X-band), and most also operate on the 2920 MHz to 3100 MHz marine radar band (S-band). Modern racons are frequency-agile; they have a wide-band receiver that detects the incoming radar pulse, tunes the transmitter and responds with a 25 microsecond long signal within 700 nanoseconds.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, {{in order}} to help nearby Hualien Harbor become an {{international}} port, a new lighthouse, consisting of a white pentagon concrete building, was built on the original lighthouse base. The newly built Qilaibi Lighthouse used a 4th class white light electric lamp, the light flashing 3 seconds and dimming 3 seconds at a regular 6 second intervals, and the luminous intensity is 28,000 cd. In 1973, a non-directional beacon pole was added, with output power 100 watts and range 100 nms, to function in coordination with the Lyudao Lighthouse, also a non-directional beacon pole, for the ships mutual positioning. In 1985, a <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> pole was set. Then finally, in 1992, the communication systems were comprehensively changed into a dual-frequency <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> pole.|$|R
50|$|The 3rd Order optic was {{replaced}} by a rotating beacon, which possessed a revolving array of 24 lamps-cum-reflectors. An ‘S’ and ‘X’ band <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> was also installed in 1984 which provides additional navigational information to ships by emitting a morse code on the ship’s radar screen.|$|R
50|$|The Phipps couple flew {{together}} to the North Pole in a Twin Otter ski plane to the North Pole, {{to install a}} <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> and to promote northern travel.

5000|$|Underwater {{demolition}} teams (UDT) {{approached the}} beach in small craft to reconnoiter the landing beaches and to plant <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> which would provide reference points to the next day's landing. Tennessee closed to 3,000 yd of Agingan Point and opened up with 14 in, 5 inand [...] batteries. Some smoldering powder grains from the 5 in guns fell {{on the port side}} of the battleship's quarterdeck and burst into flame, but were quickly extinguished.|$|E
50|$|Easton {{was born}} in Craftsbury, Vermont, to Dr. Frank B. Easton, a physician, and Della Donnocker, a school teacher. He {{graduated}} from Middlebury College in 1943. He also attended the University of Michigan for 1 semester before joining the Naval Research Laboratory in 1943. At the Naval Research Laboratory {{he worked in the}} Radio Division on <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> and blind-landing systems. Easton also worked in the laboratory's Rocket-Sonde Branch which was dealing with space related research.|$|E
50|$|Melpar linked {{production}} facilities to its scientific and engineering capabilities. The company won two large contracts for B-58 aircraft electronics and Minuteman missile guidance components, requiring {{a buildup of}} manufacturing plants and an associated technical work force in the Washington area. These facilities enabled scientists to test their laboratory research with prototype hardware. By 1960 the company assembled products such as missile equipment, flight simulators, <b>radar</b> <b>beacons,</b> fuses, data processing equipment, communications, antennas, electronic countermeasure and reconnaissance systems.|$|E

The set is capable of being interrogated by airborne <b>radars</b> operating on <b>beacon</b> function and replying with a coded signal permitting the beacon to be located in range and azimuth. It is capable of transmitting five different codes, it transmits on 3256 Mc. and receives on 3333 Mc. peak power out-put is 50 Watts.|$|R
50|$|SHORAN is {{an acronym}} for SHOrt RAnge Navigation, a type of {{electronic}} navigation and bombing system using a precision <b>radar</b> <b>beacon.</b> It was developed during World War II and the first stations were being set up in Europe when the war ended. It saw its first combat use in the B-26 and B-29 bomber aircraft during the Korean War.|$|R
50|$|The International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea {{requires}} the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with , and all passenger ships regardless of size. Although AIS transmitters/receivers are generally called transponders they generally transmit autonomously, although coast stations can interrogate class B transponders on smaller vessels for additional information. In addition, navigational aids often have transponders called RACON (<b>radar</b> <b>beacons)</b> {{designed to make}} them stand out on a ship's radar screen.|$|E
5000|$|FuG 243 : By 1944 the Germans {{were aware}} of the {{operating}} concept of the British Rebecca/Eureka system via captured examples. From this a series of <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> were designed to respond to different frequencies and waveforms. The FuG243 seems to be the only one that entered service in small numbers in early 1945 in Norway with coastal units. It operated on the low-UHF band frequencies used by the FuG 200 Hohentwiel ASV airborne radar hardware. In modern terms it was a type of Radar beacon (racon) ...|$|E
50|$|Problematically, {{there were}} IFF {{incompatibilities}} {{that threatened to}} label friendly aircraft as foe for want of an IFF signal showing otherwise. The risk of mis-identification of targets and consequent friendly fire casualties rose significantly. Until the squadron was completely re-equipped with new aircraft using only centimetric radar, {{it was necessary to}} ensure that all fighter aircraft in the air at any one time had either VHF or S-Band equipment - never a mixture. The S-Band equipped Beaufighters were unable {{to make use of the}} VHF <b>Radar</b> <b>Beacons.</b> The changeover was not completed until August 1943, just prior to the squadron's departure to Sicily.|$|E
50|$|The {{air traffic}} control <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> system (ATCRBS) is a system used in {{air traffic control}} (ATC) to enhance {{surveillance}} radar monitoring and separation of air traffic. ATCRBS assists ATC surveillance radars by acquiring information about the aircraft being monitored, and providing this information to the radar controllers. The controllers can use the information to identify radar returns from aircraft (known as targets) and to distinguish those returns from ground clutter.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} towers at the site. The tallest {{one is a}} 55-metre high {{civilian}} telecommunication tower, owned by Télédiffusion de France.

5000|$|To obtain {{reliability}} {{in providing}} accurate trajectory data, the Mercury spacecraft {{was equipped with}} C-band and S-band cooperative beacons. The ground radar systems had to be compatible with the spacecraft <b>radar</b> <b>beacons.</b> The FPS-16 radar in use at most national missile ranges was selected to meet the C-band requirement. Although it originally had a range capability of only 250 nmi km, most of the FPS-16 radar units selected for the project had been modified for operation up to 500 nmi km, a NASA requirement, and modification kits were obtained for the remaining systems. In addition to the basic radar system, it was also necessary to provide the required data-handling equipment to allow {{data to be transmitted}} from all sites to the computers.|$|E
