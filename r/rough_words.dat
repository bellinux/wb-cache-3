25|$|While {{those who}} refrain from killing, taking {{anything}} that is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, speaking <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> or nonsense, being greedy, cruel, and practising wrong beliefs (miccha ditthi), will be seen by people as positive and will earn respect from {{the people and the}} wise ones. They would be profiting from their deeds, no matter what their caste might be.|$|E
25|$|The Buddha then elaborates {{that if any}} of the caste {{does the}} {{following}} deeds: killing, taking anything that is not given, take part in sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, speaking <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> or nonsense, greedy, cruel, and practise wrong beliefs (miccha ditthi); people would still see that they do negative deeds and therefore are not worthy of respect. They will even get into trouble from their own deeds, whatever their caste (Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda) might be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hence go the twain of us, lord. The Earl {{will be here}} {{presently}} and <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> {{will fly}} in this rough weather. Is Whitefire sharp, Brighteyes?" ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{few lines}} later, '352087 A/c Ross' treats his readers {{to an even}} <b>rougher</b> <b>word</b> in common R.A.F. usage: ...|$|R
60|$|He frowned a little, and {{bit his lip}} {{to check}} the <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> {{that was on the}} tip of his tongue.|$|R
60|$|There now! You see I am prepared. Therefore do {{not keep}} back one <b>rough</b> <b>word,</b> for friendship's sake, but be as honest as--you {{could not help}} being, without this request.|$|R
6000|$|... "What Kellys?" [...] said Anty, {{blushing}} deeply, {{and half}} beside herself with fear--for Barry's face was very red, {{and full of}} fierce anger, and his <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> frightened her.|$|E
6000|$|Forgive {{me those}} <b>rough</b> <b>words.</b> How could you know [...] That man is held to those {{whom he has}} loved [...] By pain they gave, or pain that he has given, [...] Intricacies of pain.|$|E
6000|$|... 'From {{this night}} {{to the end of}} the year right willingly will I grant thee,' replied Kilweh; but when the end of the year came and the {{messengers}} returned Kilweh was wroth, and spoke <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> to Arthur.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, O Queen," [...] said Charmion, {{who stood}} by with downcast eyes, and I {{thought that there}} was bitter meaning in her soft tones; [...] "may no <b>rougher</b> <b>words</b> ever affront thy ears, and no evil presage tread less closely upon its happy sense." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Griffith, {{under the}} attorney's instructions, was more courteous {{to him than}} she had been when he was her master. She endeavoured to get him things nice to eat, trying to console him by titbits. None of the tenants {{appeared}} before him, nor was there a <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> spoken to him, even by young Cantor.|$|R
60|$|At times a {{group of}} three or four would stand there for awhile, not speaking, only sighing and casting eager {{questioning}} glances at one another, whilst trying vainly to find some hopeful word, some turn of phrase of meaning that would be less direful, in that grim and ferocious proclamation. Then a <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> from the sentinel, a push from the butt-end of a bayonet would disperse the little group and send the men, sullen and silent, back into the crowd.|$|R
60|$|Then King Frost {{sprang to}} and fro in front of her, {{questioning}} her, and getting only rude, <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> in reply, till at last he got very angry, and cracked his fingers, and gnashed his teeth, and froze her to death.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to have given you so much trouble, Mr. Cashel Byron. Thank you for interfering to protect me; but I was in no real danger. I would gladly have borne with a few <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> {{for the sake of}} {{avoiding}} a disturbance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never saw}} {{the person who was}} not my superior,' {{repeated}} Louis, quietly, and in full earnest. 'Not that this would make <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> pleasanter, I suppose. The only cure I could ever see for the ills of the world is, that each should heartily respect his neighbour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Doing those lines;' and {{he pointed}} to the thorny Crown, 'I seem to get ashamed of {{thinking}} this hardness. Only think, Dr. May, from the very first moment the policeman took me in charge, nobody has said a <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> to me. I have never felt otherwise than that they meant justice to have its way as far as they knew, but they were all consideration for me. To think of that, and then go over the scoffs and scourgings!'--there was a bright glistening tear in Leonard's eye now--'it seems like child's play to go through such a trial as mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay,' said Margaret, 'love is {{not mere}} romance. And oh, sister, credit me, a Scots lassie's heart craves better food than crowns and coronets. Hard and unco' cold be they, {{where there is}} no warmth to meet the yearning soul beneath, that would give all and ten times more for one glint of a loving eye, one word from a tender lip.' Again she had one of those hysteric bursts of tears, but she laughed herself back, crying, 'But what is the treason wifie saying of her gudeman--her Louis, that never yet said a <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> to his Meg?' ...|$|R
60|$|At {{dinner that}} day, {{although}} the occasion {{was not foreseen}} and provided for, a brilliant company of such as are not made of the dust of the earth, but of some superior article for the present unknown, shed their lustrous benediction upon Mr Dorrit's daughter's marriage. And Mr Dorrit's daughter that day began, in earnest, her competition with that woman not present; and began it so well that Mr Dorrit could all but have taken his affidavit, if required, that Mrs Sparkler had all her life been lying at full length {{in the lap of}} luxury, and had never heard of such a <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> in the English tongue as Marshalsea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, you cannot vex me," [...] he answered, all warm {{again at}} the very sight of her. [...] "It was my <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> which vexed you; but I have been thrown among men all my life, and indeed, with all the will, I scarce know how to temper my speech to a lady's ear." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> roused {{her from}} her meditations. She had moved forward, quite mechanically, her mind elsewhere, her {{thoughts}} not following the aim of her feet. Thus she must have crossed the bridge {{along with some of}} the crowd, must have landed on the jetty, and reached the front of the tent, without really knowing what she was doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, {{changing}} {{her voice and}} manner, [...] "I do not threaten; {{it is only the}} madness that I have caught from Seti. Would you not be mad if you knew that another woman was to be crowned to-morrow in your place, because--because----" [...] and she began to weep, which frightened me more than all her <b>rough</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} that Straupe name comes from the Livonian language <b>word</b> <b>rough,</b> meaning [...] "running water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, man, {{when you}} were my Lady's minion, men held you proud, and some thought you a Papist, and I wot not what; and so, {{now that you have}} no one to bear you out, you must be companionable and hearty, and wait on the minister's examinations, and put these things out of folk's head; and if he says you are in fault, you must jouk your head to the stream; and if a gentleman, or a gentleman's gentleman, give you a <b>rough</b> <b>word,</b> or a light blow, you must only say, thank you for dusting my doublet, or the like, as I have done by you.--But hark to Woodcock's whistle again. Come, and I will teach you all the trick on't as we go on." ...|$|R
50|$|Upsilon (Υυ) at the {{beginning}} of a <b>word</b> always takes <b>rough</b> breathing. Thus, <b>words</b> from Greek begin with hy-, never with y-.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} one of the nurses at the {{hospital}} to write [...] this letter for me, to put my <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> into good [...] Hungarian and to write down my thoughts in a good, [...] clear hand. That is how it comes to be so well written. [...] You know I was never much of a hand with a pen and [...] paper, but I do love you, my dove! My God, how I love [...] you.|$|E
6000|$|Ibid. Burnet. Milton ... was ... much {{admired by}} all {{at home for}} the poems he writ, though he was then blind; chiefly that of [...] "Paradise Lost," [...] {{in which there is}} a nobleness both of {{contrivance}} and execution, that, though he affected to write in blank verse without rhyme, and made many new and <b>rough</b> <b>words,</b> yet it was esteemed the beautifullest and perfectest poem that ever was writ, at least in our language.--Swift. A mistake, for it is in English.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas was one {{of those}} whose joy is {{incomplete}} unless it is shared by the friends of adverse and less fortunate days. Surrounded by every fascination of love and hope, his warm heart yearned towards plain John Browdie. He remembered their first meeting with a smile, and their second with a tear; saw poor Smike once again with the bundle on his shoulder trudging patiently by his side; and heard the honest Yorkshireman's <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> of encouragement as he left them on their road to London.|$|E
6000|$|... "What now," [...] said he, [...] "Master Roland? do you, who {{are half}} an Englishman, think that I, who am a whole one, would keep up anger against you, and you in distress? That were {{like some of}} the Scots, (my master's reverence always excepted,) who can be fair and false, and wait their time, and keep their mind, as they say, to themselves, and touch pot and flagon with you, and hunt and hawk with you, and, after all, when time serves, pay off some old feud with the point of the dagger. Canny Yorkshire has no memory for such old sores. Why, man, an you had hit me a rough blow, maybe I would rather have taken it from you, than a <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> from another; for you have a good notion of falconry, though you stand up for washing the meat for the eyases. So give us your hand, man, and bear no malice." ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped. The vague, impalpable {{things in}} his mind, cloudy {{emotions}} half shaped towards ideas, vanished before the <b>rough</b> grasp of <b>words.</b> [...] "It is hard to express," [...] he said lamely.|$|R
60|$|RUFIO (in her ear, with <b>rough</b> familiarity). A <b>word</b> first. Tell your executioner that if Pothinus {{had been}} {{properly}} killed--IN THE THROAT--he {{would not have}} called out. Your man bungled his work.|$|R
60|$|The Cæsar {{hung like}} a dead weight on Antinor's left arm, and the right one, lacerated by the panther's claws, burned and ached well-nigh intolerably. But the glorious memory of long ago now preceded him, the Divine Martyr walking on ahead with sacred {{shoulders}} bent to the sacrifice, {{and he seemed to}} hear again the swishing of the tunic, stained with blood and the mud of the road; he seemed to hear the shouts of the jeering crowd, the <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> of the soldiery, the sobs of faithful disciples and women.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Topelius {{accepted}} his defeat with a good grace; but {{the crew of the}} wrecked Leslie, who were in the same employment, and loyal to their firm, took the thing more bitterly. <b>Rough</b> <b>words</b> and ugly looks were common. Once even they hooted Captain Wicks from the saloon verandah; the Currency Lasses drew out on the other side; for some minutes there had like to have been a battle in Butaritari; and though the occasion passed off without blows, it left on either side an increase of ill-feeling.|$|E
60|$|Peregrine again got up, and {{standing}} {{with his back to}} the fire, thought over it all again. His soft heart almost relented towards the woman who had borne his <b>rough</b> <b>words</b> with so much patient kindness. Had Sir Peregrine been there then, and could he have condescended so far, he might have won his grandson's consent without much trouble. Peregrine, like some other generals, had expended his energy in gaining his victory, and was more ready now to come to easy terms than he would have been had he suffered in the combat.|$|E
60|$|So it befell that Grace Harvey governed, {{she knew}} not how or why, all hearts in that wild simple fishing-town. Rough men, {{fighting}} on the quay, shook hands at Grace's bidding. Wives who could not lure their husbands from the beer-shop, sent Grace in to fetch them home, sobered by shame: and woe to the stranger who fancied that her entrance into that noisy den gave him a right to say a <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> to the fair girl! The maidens, instead of envying her beauty, made her the confidant of all their loves; for though many a man would gladly have married her, to woo her was more than any dared; and Gentleman Jan himself, the rightful bully of the quay, as being the handsomest and biggest man for many a mile, beside owning a tidy trawler and two good mackerel-boats, had said openly, that if any man {{had a right to}} her, he supposed he had; but that he should as soon think of asking her to marry him, as of asking the moon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you need}} not imagine that I wouldn't know how you treated her. I would know soon enough. I tell you," [...] he continued, with slow and {{deliberate}} emphasis, [...] "that {{what you do to}} her I shall know. I shall know if you bully her, I shall know if you make her unhappy. I shall know--and God help you in that case!--if you are not kind to her. Just think in future when you speak a <b>rough</b> <b>word</b> to her that Lakatos Andor will hear you and make you pay for every syllable. Think when you browbeat her that Lakatos Andor can see you! For I will see you, I tell you, in spite of your turning me out of your house, in spite of your fences and your walls. So just you ask her pardon now for your roughness, kiss her little hand and take her to vespers. But take this from me, my friend, that if you ever dare raise your hand against your wife I'll pay you out for it, so help me God!" ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Minna, her {{sensitive}} little heart trembled {{within her}} at the <b>rough</b> contemptuous <b>words</b> that the exclusive, refined tone of the family always provoked, and bodily languor and weariness made the walk trying; but {{she was thinking of}} Ave's need, and resolutely took down her cloak and hat. But at that moment the latch was raised, and the bright graceful figure of Cora stood among them, her feathered hat and delicate muslin looking as fresh as at New York.|$|R
