40|$|Background Individuals with a {{unilateral}} severe-to-profound hearing loss, or single-sided deafness, report difficulty with listening in many everyday situations despite {{having access to}} well-preserved acoustic hearing in one ear. The standard of care for single-sided deafness available on the UK National Health Service is a contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> hearing aid which transfers sounds from the impaired ear to the non-impaired ear. This hearing aid {{has been found to}} improve speech understanding in noise when the signal-to-noise ratio is more favourable at the impaired ear than the non-impaired ear. However, the indiscriminate <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> to a single ear can have detrimental effects when interfering sounds are located {{on the side of the}} impaired ear. Recent published evidence has suggested that cochlear implantation in individuals with a single-sided deafness can restore access to the binaural cues which underpin the ability to localise sounds and segregate speech from other interfering sounds. Methods/Design The current trial was designed to assess the efficacy of cochlear implantation compared to a contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> hearing aid in restoring binaural hearing in adults with acquired single-sided deafness. Patients are assessed at baseline and after receiving a contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> hearing aid. A cochlear implant is then provided to those patients who do not receive sufficient benefit from the hearing aid. This within-subject longitudinal design reflects the expected care pathway should cochlear implantation be provided for single-sided deafness on the UK National Health Service. The primary endpoints are measures of binaural hearing at baseline, after provision of a contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> hearing aid, and after cochlear implantation. Binaural hearing is assessed in terms of the accuracy with which sounds are localised and speech is perceived in background noise. The trial is also designed to measure the impact of the interventions on hearing- and health-related quality of life. Discussion This multi-centre trial was designed to provide evidence for the efficacy of cochlear implantation compared to the contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals.</b> A purpose-built sound presentation system and established measurement techniques will provide reliable and precise measures of binaural hearing.

40|$|Two-state voltage {{fluctuations}} {{between a}} hyperpolarized down-state and a depolarized up-state {{have been observed}} experimentally {{in a wide variety}} of neurons across brain regions. Using a biophysical model, we show that synaptic input by NMDA receptors can cause such membrane potential fluctuations. In this model, when a neuron is driven by two input pathways with different AMPA/NMDA receptor content, the NMDA-rich input causes up-state transitions, whereas the AMPA-rich input generates spikes only in the up-state. Therefore the NMDA-rich pathway can gate input from an AMPA pathway in an all-or-none fashion by switching between different membrane potential states. Furthermore, once in the up-state, the NMDA-rich pathway multiplicatively increases the gain of a neuron responding to AMPA-rich input. This proposed mechanism for two-state fluctuations directly suggests specific computations, such as gating and gain modulation based on the distinct receptor composition of different neuronal pathways. The dynamic gating of input by up- and down-states may be an elementary operation for the selective <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> in neural circuits, which may explain the ubiquity of two-state fluctuations across brain regions...|$|E
