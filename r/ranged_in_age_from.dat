The archeological {{significance}} of the site is considerable as the majority of slave quarters in the Southern United States were not built with quality materials, and most quarters were destroyed after emancipation. Six graves thought to contain slaves were unearthed in 2011 by archeologists from the University of Florida. The bodies <b>ranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> infants to an elderly woman; three were adults who were probably born in West Africa.|$|E

Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and visual aids. The regimental part of {{the training}} was designed to help cadets adjust to military life, and to acquaint them with their responsibilities as officers.

500|$|This [...] "cross-channel" [...] trade {{accounted}} {{for most of}} Ireland's trade. The ships <b>ranged,</b> <b>in</b> <b>age,</b> <b>from</b> Dundalk built, {{two years before the}} start of the war, in 1937 to Brooklands built in 1859. The most important vessels to Ireland were the ten colliers and to Britain the livestock carriers. Initially Germany respected the neutrality of Irish vessels, apologising for the first attack on the collier Kerry Head and paying compensation. Losses came from mines, rather than direct attacks. Meath suffered such a fate; while she was being inspected by the British Naval Control Service, she was struck by a magnetic mine, drowning seven hundred cattle, and destroying both vessels.|$|E

500|$|... "Cadets" [...] {{underwent}} {{training in}} artillery and engineering {{studies at the}} garrison since 1794. In 1801, shortly after his inauguration as president, Thomas Jefferson directed that plans be set in motion to establish at West Point the United States Military Academy. He selected Jonathan Williams to serve as its first superintendent. Congress formally authorized the establishment and funding of the school with the Military Peace Establishment Act of 1802, which Jefferson signed on 16 March. The academy officially commenced operations on 4 July 1802. The academy graduated Joseph Gardner Swift, its first official graduate, in October 1802. He later returned as Superintendent from 1812 to 1814. In its tumultuous early years, the academy featured few standards for admission or length of study. Cadets <b>ranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> 10 years to 37 years and attended between 6months to 6years. The impending War of 1812 caused the United States Congress to authorize a more formal system {{of education at the}} academy and increased the size of the Corps of Cadets to 250.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, scrolls were {{discovered}} in caves near the Dead Sea that proved to contain writing in Hebrew and Aramaic, {{most of which are}} thought to have been produced by the Essenes, a small Jewish sect. [...] These scrolls are of great significance in the study of Biblical texts because many of them contain the earliest known version of books of the Hebrew bible. A sample of the linen wrapping from one of these scrolls, the Great Isaiah Scroll, was included in a 1955 analysis by Libby, with an estimated age of 1,917 ± 200 years. [...] Based on an analysis of the writing style, palaeographic estimates were made of the age of 21 of the scrolls, and samples from most of these, along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated, were tested by two AMS laboratories in the 1990s. [...] The results <b>ranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> the early 4th century BC to the mid 4th century AD. [...] In many cases the scrolls were determined to be older than the palaeographically determined age. [...] The Isaiah scroll was included in the testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2σ confidence level, because of the shape of the calibration curve at that point: there is a 15% chance that it dates from 355–295 BC, and an 84% chance that it dates from 210–45 BC. [...] Subsequently, these dates were criticized on the grounds that before the scrolls were tested, they had been treated with modern castor oil {{in order to make the}} writing easier to read; it was argued that failure to remove the castor oil sufficiently would have caused the dates to be too young. [...] Multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing the criticism.|$|E
