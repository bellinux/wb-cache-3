40|$|This paper {{considers}} analytically {{the stress}} concentration in an infinite plane loaded by a circular inclusion, which is bonded to a reinforced {{hole in the}} plane. The pulling force of the inclusion is modeled by distributed body force. The infinite plane, the <b>reinforced</b> <b>ring,</b> and the circular inclusion can be of different elastic properties. Airy stress function with body force potential was used {{to solve the problem}} analytically. Numerical results show that the maximum tensile hoop stress at the hole boundary in the plane can be reduced to becoming negligible if an optimum stiffness ratio between the plane and the rivet is chosen (normally a harder material for the <b>reinforced</b> <b>ring</b> comparing to the plane is needed). An optimum thickness of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>ring</b> can also be determined to further reduce the hoop stress concentration.

50|$|Otto III's second gift {{might have}} been the golden crown. Written {{evidence}} for this is lacking, but there were circumstantial arguments for it. Firstly, based on art historical comparisons, the crown was dated {{to the end of the}} tenth century. The existence of the iron <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ring</b> was taken as evidence that the crown had been reworked for the Golden Madonna's head and, therefore, had originally been designed for another purpose, which it was concluded could only have the coronation of a child, since it would still have been too small for an adult. The coronation of Otto III in 983 at Aachen Cathedral is the only coronation of a child which occurred within the right time period. Furthermore, the medieval practice of crowning a statue of Madonna on 2 February during Michaelmas is first attested at Essen. Thus it was suggested that the practice commemorated the gift of the crown to the abbey during his visit to Essen at the beginning of February 993, which would have coincided with the feast day.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1920 and 1947, all professional-grade saxophones {{manufactured}} by C.G. Conn had rolled toneholes. In the early 1930s, Conn developed a unique type of saxophone pad called [...] "Conn Res-o-Pads", which were {{specifically designed for}} use on saxophones with rolled toneholes. Conn Res-O-Pads have an internal metal <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ring</b> which is hidden under the leather covering around the circumference of the pad. Their most notable feature is that {{the diameter of the}} pad extends over the rim of the key-cup, thereby giving a slightly wider surface area for the rolled tone-hole to seal onto. Rim impressions from Res-o-Pads are minimal and unlike standard pads they cannot be [...] "floated" [...] in. Though designed to fix into key-cups purely via friction, most saxophone repairers glue them in place using shellac or hot melt adhesive. Res-o-Pads can be challenging to size correctly because (unlike standard saxophone pads which come in 0.5 mm size steps) they are only available in 1/32nds of an inch sizes which may not always correspond closely to key-cup diameters. Newly produced Conn Res-o-Pads are still available from specialist suppliers and are favored by some saxophone collectors because they give a fully authentic look and feel to vintage saxophones with rolled toneholes e.g. those made by Conn, Kohlert and Keilwerth. However, it is possible to fit standard pads to any saxophone with rolled toneholes (and many people do) without any noticeable disadvantage regarding the quality of sound produced.|$|E
40|$|High-cycle life ring-reinforced {{hemispherical}} type {{positive expulsion}} diaphragm performance was demonstrated by room temperature fluid expulsion tests of 13 " diameter, 8 mil thick stainless steel configurations. A maximum of eleven (11) leak-free, fluid expulsions were achieved by a 25 deg cone angle diaphragm hoop-reinforced with. 110 -inch cross-sectional diameter wires. This represents a 70 % improvement in diaphragm reversal cycle life compared to results previously obtained. The reversal tests confirmed analytic predictions for diaphragm cycle life increases due to increasing values of diaphragm cone angle, radius to thickness ratio and material strain to necking capacity. Practical fabrication techniques were demonstrated for forming close-tolerance, thin corrugated shells and for obtaining closely controlled <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ring</b> stiffness required to maximize diaphragm cycle life.

40|$|Dislocation after primary total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) is {{the most}} commonly encountered complication and is unpleasant for both {{the patient and the}} surgeon. Constrained acetabular components can be used to treat or prevent instability after primary {{total hip arthroplasty}}. We present the case of a 42 -year-old female with a BMI of 41. At 18 months post-primary THA the patient underwent further revision hip surgery after numerous (more than 20) dislocations. She had a tripolar Trident acetabular cup (Stryker-Howmedica-Osteonics, Rutherford, New Jersey) inserted. Shortly afterwards the unusual mode of failure of the constrained acetabular liner was noted from radiographs in that the inner liner had dissociated from the outer. The <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ring</b> remained intact and in place. We believe that the patient's weight, combined with poor abductor musculature caused excessive demand on the device leading to failure at this interface when the patient flexed forward. Constrained acetabular components are useful implants to treat instability but have been shown to have up to 42 % long-term failure rates with problems such as dissociated inserts, dissociated constraining rings and dissociated femoral rings being sited. Sometimes they may be the only option left in difficult cases such as illustrated here, but still unfortunately have the capacity to fail in unusual ways...|$|E

The case in point involved a 47 year old firefighter who was killed when the neck portion of the cylinder separated and struck him in the upper chest and neck. Several other incidents were on record reporting the explosion of DOT-E 7235 4500 PSI cylinders. In October of 1985, NIOSH and the US Department of Transportation began requiring that these cylinders be retrofitted with a steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ring.</b> The cylinder involved in this specific fatal accident had not been retrofitted and was in service beyond its maximum 15 year service life. It was estimated that as many as 8, 000 of these cylinders may remain in service without the required retrofit. NIOSH urges that all compressed gas cylinders be examined, and that any of this type be removed from service if they have not been retrofitted or if they have exceeded the 15 year period of service. The last hydrostatic retest date stamped on the neck should be identified and the cylinder removed from service if the date is more than 3 years old.

40|$|Carbon fibre/epoxy {{rings are}} used as radial {{reinforcement}} for polymer bearing elements with nominal diameter 250 mm functioning under 150 MPa. Full-scale static and dynamic testing revealed no catastrophic failure for loading to 400 MPa, although there was circumferential splitting of carbon fibres at the machined top edge causing counterface wear under sliding. A combined numerical-experimental analysis was applied for design improvement with a representative small-scale qualification test on the real ring geometry, inducing additional stress concentrations compared to ASTM standards. Full-scale modelling revealed high radial-axial shear stresses (33 MPa) in non-hydrostatically loaded zones, while it increased towards 104 MPa under hydrostatic load conditions. The former is the most critical and should be simulated either on a small-scale unidirectional compression test or on a representative short beam shear test, respectively, measuring the radial-axial or radial-tangential shear strength. A relation between both small-scale states of stress was experimentally and numerically studied, experiencing that the composite ring has lower radial-tangential shear stress compared to radial-axial shear stress as a different hydrostatic stress state is observed in {{the bulk of the}} composite ring. As a compressive test is however more difficult to perform than a short-beam-shear test, a representative design criterion for shear fracture is determined from failure at 27 kN normal load in a short-beam-shear test. Finally, fracture is avoided by optimising the cross-sectional geometry of the composite <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ring</b> and close control of the processing parameters...|$|E

40|$|Titanium matrix {{composites}} (TMC's) {{are commonly}} {{made up of}} a titanium alloy matrix reinforced by silicon carbide fibers that are oriented parallel to the loading axis. These composites can provide high strength at lower densities than monolithic titanium alloys and superalloys in selected gas turbine engine applications.

In service, these TMC <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rings</b> would be subjected to complex service mission loading cycles, including fatigue and dwell excursions.

In this paper, analyses that utilize a simple idealization of compressive yielding are described and calculated results for Kevlar 49 <b>reinforced</b> beams and <b>rings</b> are compared with available data. Fabric reinforced beams are considered first. An existing analysis for unidirectionally reinforced beams is extended to accommodate the bilinear compressive behavior exhibited by a Kevlar 49 fabric reinforced lamina.

This analysis uses beam elements that incorporate linear tensile and elastic-perfectly plastic compressive behavior. Finally, a method used to analyze quasi-isotropic beams tested in four-point bending and rings tested in diametral compression is discussed. This finite element analysis uses a layered shell element with a lamina constitutive model that permits elastic-perfectly plastic response to fiber-directed compression, but otherwise assumes linear elastic behavior.
