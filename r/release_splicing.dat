40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) Rev protein functions to facilitate export of intron-containing HIV mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We have previously shown that splice site recognition {{plays an important role}} in Rev regulation of HIV env expression. Here we have further analyzed the effects of splice sites on HIV env expression and Rev regulation, using a simian virus 40 late replacement vector system. env expression from the vector became completely Rev-independent when an excisable intron was positioned upstream of the env region, provided that env was not recognized as an intron. Complete Rev regulation was restored either by the insertion of a 5 ' splice site between the intron and the env open reading frame or by deletion of the 3 ' splice site of the upstream intron. These results show that 5 ' splice sites can function as cis-acting repressor sequence (CRS) elements to retain RNA in the nucleus in the absence of Rev. They also indicate that Rev regulation of HIV env expression is critically dependent on whether the env region is defined as an intron. This strengthens the hypothesis that Rev interacts with components of the splicing machinery to <b>release</b> <b>splicing</b> factors and enable export of the mRNA before splicing occurs...|$|E

25|$|Deep {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} been used to conduct genome-wide analyses of mRNAs – unprocessed and processed – thus providing insights into alternative splicing. For example, results from use of deep sequencing indicate that, in humans, an estimated 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, with a number of pre-mRNA transcripts spliced in a tissue-specific manner. Functional genomics and computational approaches based on multiple instance learning have also been developed to integrate RNA-seq data to predict functions for alternatively spliced isoforms. Deep sequencing has also aided in the in vivo detection of the transient lariats that are <b>released</b> during <b>splicing,</b> the determination of branch site sequences, and the large-scale mapping of branchpoints in human pre-mRNA transcripts.|$|R

40|$|A {{major portion}} of this thesis work was {{dedicated}} to study the nature and significance of spliced introns. The initial work was focused on studying the IVS 1 Cβ 1 intron from a T-cell receptor (TCR) -β gene. Compared to an intron lariat control from adenovirus pre-mRNA that was spliced in vitro, IVS 1 Cβ 1 was debranched less efficiently by HeLa S 100 extracts, although IVS 1 Cβ 1 also used the consensus branchpoint in vivo. Subcellular-fractionation analysis showed that most IVS 1 Cβ 1 lariats cofractionated with pre-mRNA in the nucleus, consistent with the possibility that intron degradation <b>releases</b> <b>splicing</b> factors which {{will be available for}} further rounds of splicing. The half-life of IVS 1 Cβ 1 from the endogenous TCR-β gene was measured using the general transcription inhibitor actinomycin D to be about ∼ 15 min, which was similar to that of unstable mRNAs such as c-myc mRNA. ^ The general transcription inhibitor DRB was also used for intron stability analysis. Unexpectedly, DRB decreased intron and pre-mRNA levels only initially, it later increased the levels of intron-containing RNAs. Inhibition of transcription initiation appeared to be the major early effect (the reduction phase); whereas enhanced premature transcription termination was dominant later (the induction phase). ^ Having established the procedures for studying in vivo spliced introns, this approach was applied to study the mechanism of nonsense-mediated downregulation (NMD), a phenomena in which premature termination codons (PTCs) decrease the levels of mRNAs. In this study, the novel intron-oriented approach was applied to study the mechanism of NMD. The levels of spliced introns immediately upstream and downstream of a PTC-bearing exon in a TCR-β gene were identified and analyzed along with their pre-mRNA. Although PTC reduced the mRNA levels by 4 to 9 fold, the steady-state levels of spliced introns and the pre-mRNA-to-intron ratios were not significantly altered, indicating that the PTC did not significantly inhibit TCR-β RNA splicing. Consistent with this conclusion, the half-lives of the PTC+ and PTC- pre-mRNA were similar. The protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexmide (CHX) upregulated the levels of the PTC+ mRNA over 10 fold without affecting the levels of the spliced introns, suggesting that the reversal effect of CHX was through stabilization, not production. These results indicated that inhibition of splicing could not be the major mechanism for the NMD pathway of the TCR-β gene, instead, suggesting that mRNA destabilization may be more important.

40|$|After {{the second}} {{transesterification}} step of pre-mRNA splicing, the Prp 22 helicase catalyzes <b>release</b> of <b>spliced</b> mRNA by disrupting {{contacts in the}} spliceosome that likely involve Prp 8. Mutations at Arg 1753 in Prp 8, which suppress helicase-defective prp 22 mutants, elicit temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes, indicating that interactions in the spliceosome involving Prp 8 -R 1753 might be broken prematurely at 37 °C. Here we report that mutations in loop I of the U 5 snRNA or in Prp 18 can suppress the temperature-sensitive prp 8 -R 1753 mutants. The same gain-of-function PRP 18 alleles can also alleviate the growth phenotypes of multiple slu 7 -ts mutants, indicating a functional link between Prp 8 and the second step splicing factors Prp 18 and Slu 7. These findings, together with the demonstration that changes at Arg 1753 in Prp 8 impair step 2 of pre-mRNA splicing in vitro, are consistent with a model in which (1) Arg 1753 {{plays a role in}} stabilizing U 5 /exon interactions prior to exon joining and (2) these contacts persist until they are broken by the helicase Prp 22...|$|R

40|$|In {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{a number of}} PRP genes known to be {{involved}} in pre-mRNA processing have been genetically identified and cloned. Three PRP genes (PRP 2, PRP 16, and PRP 22) were shown to encode putative RNA helicases of the family of proteins with DEAH boxes. However, any such splicing factor containing the helicase motifs in vertebrates has not been identified. To identify human homologs of this family, we designed PCR primers corresponding to the highly conserved region of the DEAH box protein family and successfully amplified five cDNA fragments, using HeLa poly(A) + RNA as a substrate. One fragment, designated HRH 1 (human RNA helicase 1), is highly homologous to Prp 22, which was previously shown {{to be involved in}} the <b>release</b> of <b>spliced</b> mRNAs from the spliceosomes. Expression of HRH 1 in a S. cerevisiae prp 22 mutant can partially rescue its temperature-sensitive phenotype. These results strongly suggest that HRH 1 is a functional human homolog of the yeast Prp 22 protein. Interestingly, HRH 1 but not Prp 22 contains an arginine- and serine-rich domain (RS domain) which is characteristic of some splicing factors, such as members of the SR protein family. We could show that HRH 1 can interact in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system with members of the SR protein family through its RS domain. We speculate that HRH 1 might be targeted to the spliceosome through this interaction...|$|R
40|$|The 20 -kDa {{phosphorylated}} {{rev protein}} from {{human immunodeficiency virus}} 1 {{has been shown to}} transactivate posttranscriptionally the expression of viral structural proteins by selective stabilization and nuclear export of unspliced and incompletely spliced viral mRNA. We could demonstrate in gel-mobility and immunoprecipitation assays that the recombinant rev protein purified from a baculovirus expression system forms a distinct and specific complex with its target RNA (rev-responsive element), a 234 -nucleotide sequence within the envelope coding region of human immunodeficiency virus 1. No complex formation could be observed using RNAs with similar secondary structure nor with other human immunodeficiency virus 1 recombinant proteins. Deletion analysis mapped this specific binding to the first 90 nucleotides of this rev-responsive element, which contains a U 2 small nuclear RNA homologous region. We propose that the specific binding of rev to its target RNA sequence plays an essential part in <b>releasing</b> an incompletely <b>spliced</b> viral mRNA containing this target sequence to the cytoplasm...|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 + release via type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR 2) regulates cardiac function. Molecular cloning {{of human}} RyR 2 {{identified}} 2 alternatively spliced variants, comprising 30 - and 24 -bp sequence insertions; yet {{their role in}} shaping cardiomyocyte Ca 2 + signaling and cell phenotype is unknown. We profiled the developmental regulation and the tissue and species specificity of these variants and showed that their recombinant expression in HL- 1 cardiomyocytes profoundly modulated nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca 2 + <b>release.</b> All <b>splice</b> variants localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, perinuclear Golgi apparatus, and to finger-like invaginations of the nuclear envelope (nucleoplasmic reticulum). Strikingly, the 24 -bp splice insertion that was present at low levels in embryonic and adult hearts was essential for targeting RyR 2 to an intranuclear Golgi apparatus and promoted the intracellular segregation of this variant. The amplitude variability of nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca 2 + fluxes were reduced in nonstimulated cardiomyocytes expressing both 30 - and 24 -bp splice variants and were associated with lower basal levels of apoptosis. Expression of RyR 2 containing the 24 -bp insertion also suppressed intracellular Ca 2 + fluxes following prolonged caffeine exposure (1 mmol/L, 16 hours) that protected cells from apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effects of this variant were linked to increased levels of Bcl- 2 phosphorylation. In contrast, RyR 2 containing the 30 -bp insertion, which was abundant in human embryonic heart but was decreased during cardiac development, did not protect cardiomyocytes from caffeine-evoked apoptosis. Thus, we provide the first evidence that RyR 2 splice variants exquisitely modulate intracellular Ca 2 + signaling and are key determinants of cardiomyocyte apoptotic susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{quantitative}} information regarding how much splicing occurs co-transcriptionally in higher eukaryotes, {{and it remains}} unclear where precisely splicing occurs in the nucleus. Here we determine the global extent of co- and post-transcriptional splicing in mammalian cells, and their respective subnuclear locations, using antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated sF 3 b 155 (P-sF 3 b 155) found only in catalytically activated/active spliceosomes. Quantification of chromatin- and nucleoplasm-associated P-sF 3 b 155 after fractionation of HeLa cell nuclei, reveals that ~ 80 % of pre-mRnA splicing occurs co-transcriptionally. Active spliceosomes localize in situ to regions of decompacted chromatin, at the periphery of or within nuclear speckles. Immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-P-sF 3 b 155 antibodies, coupled with transcription inhibition and a block in splicing after sF 3 b 155 phosphorylation, indicates that post-transcriptional splicing occurs in nuclear speckles and that <b>release</b> of post-transcriptionally <b>spliced</b> mRnA from speckles is coupled to the nuclear mRnA export pathway. our data provide new insights into when and where splicing occurs in cells...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} goal of contemporary HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) {{research is to}} identify cellular cofactors required for viral replication. The HIV- 1 Rev protein facilitates the cytoplasmic accumulation of the intron-containing viral gag-pol and env mRNAs and is required for viral replication. We have previously shown that a cellular protein, human Rev-interacting protein (hRIP), is an essential Rev cofactor that promotes the <b>release</b> of incompletely <b>spliced</b> HIV- 1 RNAs from the perinuclear region. Here, we use complementary genetic approaches to ablate hRIP activity and analyze HIV- 1 replication and viral RNA localization. We find that ablation of hRIP activity by a dominant-negative mutant or RNA interference inhibits virus production by mislocalizing Rev-directed RNAs to the nuclear periphery. We further show that depletion of endogenous hRIP by RNA interference results {{in the loss of}} viral replication in human cell lines and primary macrophages; virus production was restored to wild-type levels after reintroduction of hRIP protein. Taken together, our results indicate that hRIP is an essential cellular cofactor for Rev function and HIV- 1 replication. Because hRIP is not required for cell viability, it may be an attractive target for the development of new antiviral strategies...|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes, the {{spliceosome}} is a macromolecular ribonucleoprotein {{machine that}} excises introns from pre-mRNAs through two sequential transesterification reactions. The chemistry and fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing are dependent upon {{a series of}} spliceosomal rearrangements, which are mediated by trans-acting splicing factors. One key class of these factors is the DEAH-box ATPase subfamily of proteins, whose members couple ATP hydrolysis to promote RNP structural rearrangements within the spliceosome. This is typified by Prp 22, which promotes <b>release</b> of the <b>spliced</b> mRNA from the spliceosome and ensures fidelity of the second step of splicing. This role is well documented through classical biochemical and yeast genetics methods. Yet very little is known regarding {{the comings and goings}} of Prp 22 relative to the spliceosome. My thesis research investigated the dynamics of Prp 22 during splicing by using single-molecule fluorescence methods that allowed direct observation of these events. To do this, I helped construct a toolkit that combined yeast genetics, chemical biology and Colocalization Single Molecule Spectroscopy (CoSMoS) with in vitro splicing assays. Specifically, my thesis research consisted of CoSMoS splicing experiments in which fluorescently labeled pre-mRNA, spliceosome components and Prp 22 were directly visualized and analyzed. Using these methods, I found that Prp 22 ’s interactions with the spliceosome are highly dynamic and reversible. By simultaneously monitoring Prp 22 and individual spliceosome subcomplexes, I was able to frame these Prp 22 binding events in context relative to specific steps in spliceosome assembly and splicing. These experiments provide insight into how Prp 22 promotes mRNA release from the spliceosome and maintains splicing fidelity...|$|R
40|$|Precast {{prestressed}} concrete piles {{are widely used}} in deep foundation construction. Due to unexpected site soil conditions and difficulties associated with transportation and handling long precast piles, splicing is sometimes necessary at the construction site. Available splicing methods utilize steel type connections that {{are more suitable for}} reinforced concrete construction and result in limited tensile capacity at the splice. This dissertation describes studies associated with {{the development of a new}} post-tensioned splicing system using staggered, embedded anchorages. The new system has the potential to provide the same tensile capacity as a one piece prestressed pile. To develop the post-tensioned splicing system it was necessary to conduct varied numerical analyses to solve immediate technical problems associated with the design, fabrication and testing of a prototype. This included the design of a self-stressing prestressing bed, optimization of the shape of the embedded anchorages and their layout within the piles being spliced. The focus of the dissertation is on non-linear finite element studies conducted to model the flexure behavior of prototype laboratory and full-sized spliced piles in comparison to their identical non-spliced counterpart. Though finite element analysis of prestressed elements is not new, issues relating to modeling post-tensioned, spliced elements with embedded, staggered anchorages have not been the subject of any previous investigation and constitute the principal contribution of this study. Nonlinear finite element analysis was conducted using ANSYS. The William-Warnke failure criterion used to establish concrete failure. A three-dimensional analysis was conducted in which SOLID 65 element was used for modeling concrete and LINK 8 for the prestressing strands. The post-tensioning ducts were modeled using PIPE 20 elements. Perfect bond was assumed between the concrete and the ducts. Embedded anchorages were modeled as fixed locations within the concrete. Epoxy used to join the two splicing surfaces was modeled using contact elements. Since the layout of the post-tensioning ducts was staggered, a full model was required. In contrast, advantage was taken of symmetry for the analysis of the one piece controls. The finite element model was able to accurately capture the flexural behavior of both the control and the spliced piles. The results suggested that tensile separation at the splice interface acted as a pivot about which the section rotated. As a result, the compression failure zone in the spliced pile was confined to a smaller region compared to the control. The stress distribution in the spliced pile indicated that the concrete in the cover above the splice was crushed at the ultimate stage before the steel had yielded. As a result, the ultimate capacity of the spliced pile was controlled by concrete failure. The results also indicated that, among the multiple layers of post-tensioning strands, only one approached yield while others remained in the elastic range. As a result, when the applied load was <b>released,</b> the <b>spliced</b> pile rebounded back to a large degree, which resulted in a much smaller residual permanent deformation. This behavior of a spliced pile can be beneficial for structures in a seismic zone because it will induce smaller secondary moments. This study helped to refine and improve the new post-tensioned splicing system. Its availability makes it possible to extend and further improve the concept without the need for costly prototype fabrication and testing...|$|R
