40|$|Traffic noise {{generated}} by tire–pavement interaction {{is a matter}} of major concern for the Cali-fornia Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Research is underway in California and other States to evaluate tire–pavement noise characteristics of both concrete and asphalt pavements using the on-board sound intensity (OBSI) method, which allows for detailed characterization of noise levels at the source. In California, both concrete and asphalt pavement research studies are being conducted by the University of California Pavement Research Center (UCPRC) in collaboration with and funding from Caltrans. The concrete pavements and bridge decks study involves a total of 144 sections in different regions throughout the State. The surface textures evaluated in the study comprise of longitudinal tining, diamond grinding, diamond grooving, and burlap drag. Preliminary results indicate that diamond-ground surfaces can be the quietest of the concrete pavement surface textures. With only part of the test sections analyzed, OBSI levels from California concrete pavements range between 101. 2 and 107. 3 dB(A). The asphalt pavement research evaluates tire–pavement noise characteristics and performance properties of about 70 sections from throughout the State. This study considers acoustic and structural per-formance of four main asphalt surface types: open-graded <b>asphalt</b> concrete (OGAC), <b>rubberized</b> open-graded <b>asphalt</b> concrete (RAC-O), <b>rubberized</b> gap-graded <b>asphalt</b> concrete (RAC-G) and dense-graded asphalt concrete (DGAC). OBSI measurements indicate that average noise levels increased by 1. 3 dB(A) from 100. 8 dB(A) to 102. 1 dB(A) over the 2 -year period. Overall, a noise level of around 100. 0 dB(A) measured at 60 mi/h (96 km/h) using the OBSI method ap-pears to be a reasonable goal for both concrete and asphalt quieter pavements, based on the UCPRC data and other studies. Further analysis on the data being collected will answer ques-tions about acoustic durability of different types of concrete and asphalt pavements...|$|R

40|$|This {{study focused}} on safety {{performance}} of new pavement surface types. Open graded or coarse-textured roadway surfaces are advisable for high-speed, wet-weather traffic conditions. They provide drainage relief at the tire-pavement interface, reduce the steepness of the speed gradient, decrease the likelihood of hydroplaning, minimize splash and spray, reduce the glare from wet pavements, and improve high-speed skid resistance. Before-and-after comparisons using historical collision data from California Traffic Accident Surveillance and Analysis System (TASAS) were conducted to assess the safety performance of three types of experimental pavement: open-graded asphalt concrete (OGAC), groove pavement (GP), and <b>rubberized</b> open-graded <b>asphalt</b> concrete (R-OGAC) projects implemented in recent years. Because these new types of pavement surfaces are expected to improve drainage, wet pavement related collisions were considered target collisions and analyzed in the before-and-after study. Our findings indicate that resurfacing with OGAC significantly decreased the number of wet-related collisions. However, no significant conclusions were drawn {{from the results of}} resurfacing with GP and R-OGAC, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient data.

40|$|Wet pavement-related {{collisions}} {{represent a}} significant traffic safety concern, {{due in part}} to the lack of adequate friction between tire and pavement, known as skid resistance. State agencies employ a skid number (SN) system, based on a standard test procedure in which a locked wheel is towed at 40 mph and the skid number (SN 40) is calculated from the measured resistance. SN 40 is used as a reference value for speeds both greater than and less than 40 mph. For most Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the nation, excluding California, pavements for which the SN 40 is below 30 are deemed unacceptable and corrective actions are required. The main objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate and analyze skid test results from the test data inventory, and (2) to identify and analyze before-and-after collision data at sites where three experimental types of pavements (Open Graded Asphalt Concrete [OGAC], Groove Pavement [GP], and <b>Rubberized</b> Open Graded <b>Asphalt</b> Concrete [R-OGAC]) have been implemented.

40|$|Abstract:The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) {{has been}} using scrap tire rubber in asphalt {{pavements}} since the 1970 s in chip seals and the 1980 s in rubberized hot mix asphalt(RHMA). Both the wet (field blend) and dry processes were used in early trials. Caltrans has also used rubber modified binders containing both crumb rubber modifier and polymer modifier that could be manufactured at a refinery facility, a terminal blend wet process. Since {{the beginning of this}} century, Caltrans increased the use of scrap tire rubber in paving projects and invested considerable resources in developing technically sound, cost effective, and environmentally friendly strategies for using scrap tire rubber in roadway applications. By the end of year 2010, approximately 31 %of all hot mix asphalt (HMA) placed by Caltrans was rubberized HMA, roughly 1. 2 million tons. Caltrans efforts in using asphalt rubber products were also demonstrated in its research and technology development. These included the construction of two full-scale field experiments, five warranty projects, and an accelerated pavement study using a heavy vehicle simulator. Additionally, terminal blend <b>asphalt</b> rubber and <b>rubberized</b> warm mix <b>asphalts</b> began to be experimented on trial basis.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the fatigue performance of <b>rubberized</b> stone matrix <b>asphalt</b> (SMA) in the dry process and compared its fatigue characterization with SMAs with other typical binders. Five SMA mixtures were used with the following asphalt binders: (1) virgin asphalt of PG 67 - 22, (2) crumb rubber modifier (CRM) modified in wet process, (3) CRM modified in dry process, (4) terminal-blend binder, and (5) styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) modified binder. Dynamic modulus and direct-tension fatigue tests were performed using the asphalt mixture performance tester (AMPT) system. In addition, improved linear amplitude sweep (LAS) tests were performed on the binders by a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). The fatigue test data were analyzed by the simplified viscoelastic continuum damage (S-VECD) theory. The results showed that (1) dynamic modulus of the rubberized SMA in the dry process {{was similar to that}} of the wet process and higher than that of SMAwith virgin asphalt, although a little lower than those of SMAs with terminal-blend binder or SBS binder at high temperatures; (2) the damage resistance and fatigue life of the rubberized SMA in the dry process are higher than those of SMAwith virgin asphalt and similar or slightly higher than with the wet process, but lower than SMAs with terminal-blend binder or SBS binder; and (3) the virgin binder had lower damage resistance and fatigue life, followed by the CRM binder in the wet process, the terminal-blend binder and SBS binder had higher damage resistance and fatigue life.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{the use of}} new methodologies for {{prediction}} of performances of asphalt mixtures. Recent improvements in technology {{make it possible to}} adopt new methods of investigation with the dual objective of improving the performance in the survey of the parameters and investigate new properties so far not analyzed. In particular, the image analysis and the tyre/surface interaction belong to an innovative framework, which is next to flank, if not replace, the classic measurements so far employed. The thesis deals with the use of these technologies for the analysis of three <b>rubberized</b> stone mastic <b>asphalts,</b> which were laid on a stretch of road close to Bologna, Italy. Three different surveys were carried out on site {{during the first year of}} service. The surveys included the change in texture and skid resistance due to the traffic, along with the acoustic properties of the pavement. Local as well as dynamic continuous measurements were carried out, involving the use of a profilometer and a skiddometer. A second phase involved the {{prediction of}} the surface parameters with different stages of simulated trafficking on Road Test Machine. At each stage change in macrotexture, skid resistance, adhesion between bitumen and aggregates, contact pressures and areas were assessed. The image analysis is used for the assessment of the adhesion between the bitumen and the aggregate. The images are then processed in order to create 3 D models of the asphalt specimens and investigate the surface and volume properties. The tyre/pavement interaction is another fundamental phenomena that received little considerations from the research, given its importance. A final discussion summarizes these investigations by separately review three different simulated periods, i. e. the early life, the in-service equilibrium and the end of life. In order to accelerate the distress, one slab was subjected to Immersion Wheel Track test. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} reported herein {{deals with}} evaluation of rutting susceptibility of different asphalt binders thorough various parameters and correlating them with parameters resulted from tests {{carried out on}} their corresponding mixtures. Several factors influence the occurrence of rutting in asphalt mixtures including aggregate properties, composition (aggregate gradation and binder content), and volumetric. However Asphalt binders {{play a major role}} in affecting rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures used in road pavements. In the first phase of research four different types of asphalt binders were analyzed by subjecting them to a new protocol combining Single Creep-Recovery (SCR) tests with Multiple Stress Creep (MSC) tests on DSR. Low shear viscosity (LSV) and Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) tests were also performed for comparison purposes. LSV and MSCR tests are currently known as standard procedure for the evaluation of rutting susceptibility of binders. However, recent studies have shown the existence of significant drawbacks for LSV and MSCR method when applied to highly modified polymers products. Three shear stress levels (20, 100 and 500 kPa) were applied in case of MSC tests. In case of SCR test 100 kPa shear stress was applied. Two neat binders having same penetration grade 50 / 70 but different sources were tested at four temperatures (46 °C, 52 °C, 58 °C and 64 °C). Asphalt rubber and SBS modified binder were tested at 58 °C, 64 °C, 70 °C and 76 °C. The higher range of temperature was used because the aim of testing protocol was to reach steady state flow during creep phase at all temperatures. In case of MSCR tests on AR and PMB tests were started at 64 °C and for NA and NB same temperature range selected for SCR and MSC was also applied. In case of SCR-MSC creep compliance rate from creep phase and permanent compliance from recovery phase were calculated in order to rank binders for their rutting susceptibility. In case of LSV and MSCR tests EVT (Equi-viscous temperature) and non-recoverable compliances were calculated respectively. Single creep-recovery tests combined with multiple stress creep were found to be more accurate in ranking binders for their rutting susceptibility. In the 2 nd phase of research the rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures containing above mentioned binders was evaluated. In particular three dense -graded and three gap-graded rubberized mixtures were investigated. Two rubberized gap graded mixtures were prepared in laboratory, one with 2 % filler and the second one with 5 % filler. The third gap graded rubberized mixture was supplied by a plant located in the center of Italy. Amount of binders in all gap graded asphalt mixture was 8 %. The first Dense-graded asphalt mixture was prepared in laboratory with neat binder NA. The second one was collected from local plant which employed neat binder NB, having same penetration grade as the first one but different source and slightly lower maximum design temperature. The third mixture was also prepared in laboratory with SBS polymer modified binder. The binder contents in dense graded asphalt mixtures were 5. 5 %. All the three mixtures were analyzed by subjecting cylindrical specimen to Flow number tests on APMT. Flow number has been recognized as newly anti-rutting indicator of asphalt mixtures. Flow numbers for all the mixtures were measured at 3 different temperatures (46 °C, 52 °C and 58 °C). These testing temperatures were selected keeping in mind diversity of pavement temperature across the country. The 2 nd purpose of selecting different testing temperature was to study how Flow number varies with change in temperature. The results obtained from mixtures were compared with those obtained from binders. Considering three binders NA, NB and SBS and their corresponding mixtures, it was observed that strong correlation exists between binder parameters and Flow number, so parameters from binder testing can be used to predict rutting susceptibility of their corresponding mixtures. Rectangular specimens were prepared from all <b>rubberized</b> gap graded <b>asphalt</b> mixtures and one traditional mixture.

5000|$|Two {{types of}} base {{materials}} {{are used to}} make asphalt shingles: A formerly-living organic base and fiberglass base. Both types are made {{in a similar manner}} with asphalt or modified-asphalt applied to one or both sides of the asphalt-saturated base, covered with slate, schist, quartz, vitrified brick, stone, or ceramic granules and the back side treated with sand, talc or mica to prevent the shingles from sticking to each other before use. The top surface granules block ultra-violet light which causes the shingles to deteriorate, provides some physical protection of the asphalt and gives the shingles their color. Some shingles have copper or other materials added to the surface to help prevent algae growth. Self-sealing strips are standard on shingles to help prevent the shingles from being blown off by high winds. This material is typically limestone or fly-ash-modified resins, or polymer-modified bitumen. American Society of Civil Engineers ASTM D7158 is the standard most United States residential building codes use as their wind resistance standard for most discontinuous, steep-slope roof coverings (including asphalt shingles) with the following class ratings: Class D - Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 90 mph; Class G - Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 120 mph; and Class H - Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 150 mph. An additive known as styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), sometimes called modified or <b>rubberized</b> <b>asphalt,</b> is sometimes added to the asphalt mixture to make shingles more resistant to thermal cracking, as well as more resistant to damage from hail impacts.
