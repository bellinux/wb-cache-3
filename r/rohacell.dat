Testing utilized a custom specimen design which consists of a long tensile specimen with eccentric loading to induce curvature similar to the curvature expected due to 'pillowing' of the tank when pressurized. A finite element model was constructed to predict the specific element strains in the test article, and to assist with design of the test specimen to meet the specific goals of curvature and laminate strain. The results indicate that the heat treated 3. 25 -pcf density <b>Rohacell</b> foam does not provide sufficient strength for the induced stresses due to curvature and stress concentration at the RTV bondline to the TUFI tile. The test was repeated using higher density non-heat treated <b>Rohacell</b> foam (6. 9 pcf) without foam failure.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a {{numerical}} model {{dedicated to the}} simulation of the mechanical behaviour of polymeric <b>Rohacell</b> foams is presented.

Observations made on micrographs of <b>Rohacell</b> lead to mesh this representative unit cell as a lattice of beam elements. Each beam is assigned a brittle linear elastic mechanical behaviour in tension and an elasto-plastic behaviour in compression. The plasticity in compression is introduced as a way to mimic the buckling of the edges of the cells observed in experimental crushing tests. A contact law introduced between the beams stands for densification. A change in scale is then realized by increasing the length of the edges of the unit cell.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{generate}} {{a deeper understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of cellular materials, specifically for their use in aerospace applications. A closed-cell polymer foam material (<b>Rohacell)</b> of various foam densities was chosen for this investigation, and a comprehensive experimental study was conducted which generated significant findings that hitherto have not been reported in the literature. The research presented in this study revealed the following: The quasistatic response of <b>Rohacell</b> foam displays a compression/tension asymmetry in moduli and strength. In-situ experiments revealed that different macroscopic collapse mechanisms at different foam densities drove this behaviour. Improved experimental methods were developed to characterise the material response at various loading rates. Under compressive loading, as the relative density and loading rate increased, a transition in material behaviour from a ductile to brittle response at very high rates (~ 5 x 10 ^ 3 s^- 1) was found, and tests conducted at different temperatures were used to validate and provide a better understanding of the causes for the observed rate dependency. The compression and tension properties of pre-crushed <b>Rohacell</b> foam loaded in different directions were measured, and with the use of three-point-bend tests it was shown that when the foams’ tension/compression asymmetry, or the changes in stiffness and strength due to pre-crushing (i. e. strain-induced anisotropy), are neglected, this leads to incorrect predictions of the foams’ structural response. Finally, a review of some existing Finite Element foam material models was conducted, and their ability to predict the foam response under complex loading was identified. The new data and understanding generated from this thesis will allow engineers and researchers, who are developing constitutive models for predicting the response of foam materials, specifically in aerospace applications, to account for more aspects of the mechanical behaviours in their Finite Element models.

40|$|Sandwich {{composites}} are lightweight structures with widespread {{applications in}} aerospace, offshore and marine industries. The sandwich construction {{is based on}} strong, stiff skins, for instance Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRPs), bonded {{to either side of}} a low density core material, such as polymeric foams. However, sandwich structures are susceptible to damage caused by impact. Several researchers have tried to improve the impact resistance of sandwich composites by various methods including toughening the matrix. However toughening the epoxy matrix with micro-rubber particles compromised other favourable properties. Recently, nano-reinforcements such as Carbon Nanotubes, nanoclay and SiO 2 nanoparticles have been used to toughen the resin. However, one of the challenges with these nanoparticles is obtaining uniform dispersion. Current research has shown that acrylate triblock copolymers which self-assemble in the nanoscale do not agglomerate and are therefore a promising candidate for improving the impact performance of composites. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the effectiveness of these block copolymers in improving the impact resistance of sandwich structures with FRP facesheets. Normal impact tests are conducted using drop tower impact of sandwich composites made of Kevlar and Glass fibre reinforced epoxy facesheets and <b>Rohacell</b> foam core. The macroscopic behaviour and the microscopic phenomena involved in dissipating impact energy are identified and compared for sandwich plates with and without the nanoparticles. The results from drop tower impact tests show that the addition of 10 % M 52 N Nanostrength substantially improves the impact resistance of the Kevlar- <b>Rohacell</b> sandwich plates. Numerical simulation of the low velocity impact of sandwich plate is conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software LS-Dyna.
