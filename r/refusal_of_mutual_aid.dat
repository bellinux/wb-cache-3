40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>Aid</b> in the Welfare State {{is divided}} into four parts. The first part {{outlines}} the idea of organizational form as {{the way that the}} people in an organization are organized, and distinguishes three types of voluntary organization: the third of these is identified as voluntary organizational form. After a discussion of the role of values in Social Science, the organizational tradition of Anarchism is explained, as being the most suitable way <b>of</b> looking at <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups and voluntary organizational form. As well as an exposition of the classic anarchist theorists, the development of anarchist organizational forms in Spain before the Civil War is used as a practical illustration of how anarchist organization theory has developed and works. The second part of the thesis turns to sociology. It was observed in the first part that although anarchist theory was comprehensive enough in its dealings with federalism, the mutualist elements of the theory were under-developed. This gap in mutualist theory is filled by a consideration of community and organizational sociology, which are both criticized for the rationalist bias that intrudes in the way they have developed. The main sources used are Tonnies and Weber. A theory <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is then developed from a consideration <b>of</b> what <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups are not. This is then linked in with the theories of Habermas and writings from modern feminism. The second part concludes with a criticism of the oligarchical theories of Michels, which have up till now been the main sociological paradigm for voluntary organizing. The third part of the thesis introduces cases from the literature on voluntary groups in an expansion of the ideas <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> which were developed theoretically. In the course of this, distinctions between different types <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> group are drawn, together with an analysis of different problems faced by each type. Distinctions between <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups and some commonly overlapping categories of organization are drawn also. The third part concludes with an examination of the relationships between the state and <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups. The fourth and last section of the thesis is devoted to a more detailed examination of the Scottish Pre-School Playgroups Association. SPPA has the classic organizational form laid out in anarchist organization theory, illustrates many of the points made about <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups {{in other parts of the}} thesis, and manages to co-exist with the state.

40|$|Purpose – Much of the {{contemporary}} literature surrounding the barriers to community self-help in the advanced economies has placed great emphasis on capital-orientated barriers, such as a household's access to financial capital, time capital, human capital and social capital. Focusing explicitly on one-to-one <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> and drawing on rich qualitative data from two urban communities in the UK, this paper aims to re-visit the barriers to participation that prevent households from doing more for others in their community. In particular, the paper explores a range of entrenched social taboos that underpin the contested spaces <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>aid.</b> These include: “being aburden to others”, “false expectations/ inappropriate gestures”, “being taken advantage of” and “being unable to say no”. Furthermore, the paper also addresses the potentially problematic implications {{that the nature of}} work undertaken through <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> has for the social relationships that are involved. Despite finding previous UK-based research findings focused on capital barriers to be highly appropriate when considering <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> the paper argues that the current emphasis placed on these barriers in policy and practice is disproportionate. To address this imbalance, the paper concludes that a greater awareness of socially-orientated barriers must be forthcoming if a more nuanced and accurate reading <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is to be achieved. Design/methodology/approach – The research that is used to inform the findings of the paper is drawn from 100 in-depth semi-structured questionnaires conducted within households in the urban wards of West Knighton and Saffron in the city of Leicester, UK. The methods are designed to generate both quantitative and qualitative findings that engage explicitly with the informal work practices of households. Findings – The paper explores a range of entrenched social taboos that underpin the contested spaces <b>of</b> <b>mutual.</b> These include: “being a burden to others”, “false expectations/inappropriate gestures”, “being taken advantage of” and “being unable to say no”. The main conclusions argue that both social barriers and capital-based barriers to participation in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> must be given more equal consideration in future academic and policy-making discourse. Research limitations/implications – The qualitative nature of the research makes it difficult to meaningfully extrapolate the findings beyond the case studies used. Practical implications – The research focused on the informal coping strategy <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> offers a deeper insight into this coping strategy. In exploring the various capital and social barriers to participation, the findings offer ways for popular, academic and political communities to reflect on their own approaches to informal volunteerism, and if appropriate these can inform future approaches tasked with tackling these barriers and harnessing <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> in society. Social implications – In discussing the barriers to participation, the paper gives new insight into the contested geographies <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> at the household and community level. To successfully overcome these barriers and further promote mutualism and community self-help is seen to be both desirable and necessary particularly following the formal economic crisis that has raised serious questions for the economy and society in recent years. Originality/value – The research not only adds robustness to previous emerging findings related to the resource-based barriers to participation in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> but it also constructively asserts the relevance and centrality of social taboos. The paper argues that these social taboos must form a core point of analyses whenever barriers to greater levels <b>of</b> participation in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> are discussed. </p...|$|R
