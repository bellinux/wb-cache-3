The in situ generated <b>radical</b> <b>catalyst</b> was shown to catalytically and selectively promote the electrooxidation of methanol to form methoxyl radical, in which the formation potential was drastically decreased with the existence of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide radical. The electrochemically generated <b>radical</b> <b>catalyst</b> not only facilitates the oxidation of methanol but also provides good selectivity. The unique double layer structure of the 1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([Bmpy][NTf 2]) likely excludes the diffusion of larger molar mass molecules onto the electrode surface and enables the highly selective methanol oxidation at this IL-electrode interface. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were used to systematically characterize {{the details of the}} electrochemical processes with and without methanol in several other ILs, and a mechanism of the chemical and redox processes was proposed.

We {{have explored}} the possibility that myeloperoxidase might also convert L-tyrosine to a <b>radical</b> <b>catalyst</b> that cross-links proteins. Protein-bound tyrosyl residues exposed to myeloperoxidase, H 2 O 2, and L-tyrosine were oxidized to o,o'-dityrosine, a stable product of the tyrosyl radical. The cross-linking reaction required L-tyrosine but was independent of halide and free transition metal ions; the heme poisons azide and aminotriazole were inhibitory. Activated neutrophils likewise converted polypeptide tyrosines to dityrosine. The pathway for oxidation of peptide tyrosyl residues was dependent upon L-tyrosine and was inhibited by heme poisons and catalase. Dityrosine synthesis was little affected by plasma concentrations of Cl- and amino acids, suggesting that the reaction pathway might be physiologically relevant. The requirement for free L-tyrosine and H 2 O 2 for dityrosine formation and the inhibition by heme poisons {{support the hypothesis that}} myeloperoxidase catalyzes the cross-linking of proteins by a peroxidative mechanism involving tyrosyl radical. In striking contrast to the pathways generally used to study protein oxidation in vitro, the reaction does not require free metal ions. We speculate that protein dityrosine cross-linking by myeloperoxidase {{may play a role in}} bacterial killing or injuring normal tissue.

PCL is a polymer obtained through the ring-opening polymerization of the cyclic monomer Ɛ-caprolactone utilizing cationic or anionic, coordination, or the <b>radical</b> <b>catalysts</b> mechanism. This polymer is semicrystalline, and its crystallinity is directly associated with its molecular weight. It is soluble in inorganic solvents and has a good blend compatibility that provides a transformation of chemical properties, such as solubility and porosity, and it presents a low melting point (59 – 64  °C). Furthermore, PCL is a synthetic, biocompatible, and fully biodegradable polymer that has a semi crystalline nature (glass transition temperature of 213  K). It is approved for drug delivery by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Due to its slow degradation, PCL is ideally suited for long-term delivery or when a targeted delivery to the intestinal tract is intended.

Measurements of their static dielectric permittivity and electro-optical birefringence (Kerr effect) in solution in 1, 4 -dioxane were carried out over a range of temperatures. The magnitudes of the dipole moments and Kerr constants were found to vary with changes in the tacticity of poly(N-vinylcarbazole). The results of these measurements {{support the view that}} the stereostructure of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) is sensitive to the mechanism of polymerisation. These results, together with proton and carbon- 13 N. M.

The dielectric and molecular Kerr effect studies have also been carried out on complexes formed between 2, 4, 7 -trinitro- 9 -fluorenone (TNF) and different stereoregular forms of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) in solution in 1, 4 -dioxane. The differences in the molar Kerr constants between pure (uncomplexed) and complexed poly(N-vinylcarbazole) samples were attributed to changes in optical anisotropy and dipole moments.

The Enlightenment was far more complicated than this caricature. Yet {{it is not always}} the accuracy of the picture but the supposed image which matters. In that sense, Keble, Froude and Newman shared the reaction of the Romantic Movement to what was seen as the prevailing Rationalist and Utilitarian spirit witnessed inside the Church by her powerful alliance with governments and political economists and outside by the united attacks from Roman Catholics, Radicals, Nonconformists and philosophers. Chapter 1 studies the political and social implications of The Christian Year, Keble's abhorrence of the 1832 Reform Bill and his sermon "National Apostasy". His views about Poor Law reform and the importance of Tradition are also considered. Froude's articles on "State Interference in Matters Spiritual", his influence upon the political and social outlook of Keble and Newman and the political significance of the posthumously published Remains are the themes of Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, Newman's opposition to Peel and Roman Catholic Emancipation in 1829, his attitude to the 1832 Reform Bill, his views on history in The Arians and the relationship of the Church to society are studied. His criticism of Peel in 1841, his views on change, development and progress between 1841 and 1845 and his final view as an Anglican of the Church as an imperial power are also considered.

40|$|Electrochemical {{processes}} {{suffer from}} a number of challenges that needs to be overcome for widespread industrial adaptation. The need for an excess amount of inert supporting electrolyte in conventional three electrode set-ups with a single electrolyte medium makes synthetic applications uneconomical in both resource and sustainability aspects, and adds further complexities when the resulting product needs to be purified from the mixture which may also include the electro-catalyst. From an electro-analytical stand-point, altering the sample with the addition of high concentrations of electrolyte salt can have unpredictable chemical effects which may be difficult to account for in the analysis. The following results of the thesis addresses these issues by i) utilising triple-phase boundary systems where the electro-active species are kept in a separate phase from the source of electrons and ions, ii) introducing methods of heterogenising the electro-catalyst from the reaction mixture by immobilising in immiscible oils or polymers of intrinsic microporosity, and iii) offer practical application of such systems through the use of economical and technically unsophisticated methodologies. In the introduction the concept of an Integrated Chemical System is introduced where components with different functions can be synergistically combined and arranged to achieve a more complex output. In the context of electrochemistry, modifying electrodes with materials to add or improve activity, stabilise performance and to substitute more expensive materials, is desirable for enhanced control over the activity of an electrode. The first chapter begins with a general overview of various electrode modification strategies pioneered throughout the last few decades as an introductory narrative for the approach taken in the thesis. Integrated Chemical Systems synthesized and investigated in the thesis are as follows. In chapter 3, electrospun carbon nanofiber based triple-phase boundary systems are utilised for ion-transfer voltammetry across the liquid-liquid interface. Chapter 4 introduces a more conveniently prepared carbon microsphere-polystyrene composite, where the carbon is mechanically held together into a porous structure by an electrically insulating polymer binder. The porous carbon structure is demonstrated to be an effective host for organic oil analysis, under a triple-phase boundary set-up. Chapter 5 is also a study of a carbon-polymer of intrinsic microporosity composite, the polymer functions as a binder as well as a porous host for electrocatalytic guest molecules. Chapters 6 and 7 presents a novel hydrodynamic technique and its use in modulating mass transport in solution, which {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool to study electrode processes at both modified and unmodified electrodes.

A range of linear 'linker-less' catalysts {{was obtained by}} direct tethering of the TEMPO moiety. onto 'the PEG chain end. A series of 'branched' catalysts were obtained by attachment of two TEMPO units on to the PEG chain end via a 5 -hydroxy-isophthalic acid linker. Recovery of the dissolved polymer-supported catalysts {{was carried out by}} precipitation with a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether. The high catalyst activities and selectivities associated traditionally with nitroxyl-mediated hypochlorite oxidations of alcohols were retained by the 'linker-less' PEG-TEMPO catalysts. Although the selectivity remained unaltered, upon recycling, the 'linker-less' polymer-supported catalysts required extended reaction times in order to maintain high yields of the desired carbonyl compounds. Under identical conditions, the 'branched' catalysts exhibited catalytic activities up to ten times greater than the 'linker-less' system Ã‚Â·and remarkably were five times more active than 4 -methoxy-TEMPO. In addition, minimal decreases in catalytic activity observed upon recycling of these 'branched' macromolecular catalysts via solvent-induced precipitation. The high catalytic activities and preservation of activity upon recycling of these branched systems was attributed to enhanced regeneration of the nitroxyl species as a result of intramolecular syn-proportionation.

40|$|Magnetic cobalt-doped Fe 3 O 4 (FeCo) was {{prepared}} using a co-precipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The catalyst showed high, stable catalytic activity for the degradation and mineralization of toxic persistent organic pollutants, as demonstrated with the herbicides 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol and pharmaceutical phenazone {{in aqueous solution}} with ozone. FeCo was very effective at the mineralization of refractory oxalic acid produced in the degradation of organic compounds. The ozone was adsorbed {{on the surface of}} FeCo competing with water molecules in the aqueous phase, and converted into hydroxyl <b>radical,</b> meanwhile the <b>catalyst</b> surface underwent oxidation and reduction as demonstrated by in situ ATR-FTIR, CV and other experimental data obtained. Furthermore, the characterization studies indicated that the introduction of Co increased the rate of FeCo oxidation and reduction during the decomposition of ozone, enhancing the activity and stability of Fe 3 O 4.

40|$|Mg, Sm, Mn and La oxide and alkali-promoted oxide {{catalysts}} {{have been}} prepared and tested for the oxidative coupling of methane. The results show for the alkali-promoted oxides that at steady state the selectivity {{for the formation of}} C 2 products increases in the order La<Sm<Mg<Mn. A similar order is observed for the selectivity to C 2 H 4. As the temperature is increased the selectivity to ethene increases at the expense of ethane. However, the relative amounts of these two products varies significantly from one catalysts to another and in some cases ethene becomes the major product. The initial selectivities of the catalysts show high selectivities to ethene, the highest being 63 % over an alkali-promoted Mn oxide catalyst. The role of the alkali metal in promoting the La, Sm and Mn oxides is believed to be to poison total oxidation sites. In this respect these oxides may differ from MgO where, from the existing literature, the role of the alkali appears to be to increase the rate of formation of methyl <b>radicals.</b> The optimum <b>catalyst</b> for the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We discuss herein {{selected}} {{examples of}} metal complexes of polyhedral oligosilses-quioxanes (POSSs) as models of single-site heterogeneous surface catalysts. The utility of these compounds as such models is illustrated when employed as analogues of single-site titanium species supported on a silica surface. Deep insights into structure–functionality relationships can be gained. In particular, {{it was possible}} to probe the relationship between accessibility of the reactive centre and turnover frequencies {{in a manner that is}} impossible for a purely heterogeneous catalyst. We also report that the partially dehydroxylated SiO 2 surface alone is an effective <b>radical</b> polymerization initiation <b>catalyst.</b> This surface reactivity is modelled by the solution reactions between the olefin substrate and two POSSs, the completely condensed triganol prism, Si 6 Cy 6 O 9 (a 6 b 0, Cy=Cyclohexyl, C 6 H 11), and the incompletely condensed partial cube, Si 7 Cy 7 O 9 (OH) 3 (a 7 b 3). The former, with six-membered Si 3 O 3 rings, is a catalyst. The latter, without this feature, is not. Similar reactivity discrimination is observed in the gas phase reactions of these POSSs with the olefin substrate, examined using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization- and collision-induced decomposition spectroscopies. Silsesquioxane a 6 b 0, containing Si 3 O 3 rings, reacts with the olefin, forming grafted olefin monomers and dimers, while this reactivity is not observed with silsesquioxane a 7 b 3...|$|R
40|$|Marcu, Loan-Cezar Sandulescu, Loan Schuurman, Yves Millet, Jean-Marc M. The {{reaction}} {{mechanism of the}} oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane has been studied over titanium and zirconium pyrophosphates between 683 and 843 K, at atmospheric pressure. The catalytic results obtained in both stationary and transient conditions clearly showed that two {{reaction mechanism}}s occur on these pyrophosphates. The first mechanism is common to both ZrP 2 O 7 and TiP 2 O 7 at low temperature whereas the second mechanism is specific to TiP 2 O 7 at high temperature. Catalyst characterization by techniques like ESR and electrical conductivity measurements together with TAP experiments allow proposing different elementary steps for these mechanisms. The initial step of activation of n-butane would correspond to the attack of the alkane molecules by O- species giving <b>radicals</b> on both <b>catalysts.</b> On ZrP 2 O 7, the radical formed should rapidly undergo a second hydrogen abstraction according to a similar mechanism leading to butene. On TiP 2 O 7, it should transfer an electron to a reducible Ti-IV or to an anionic vacancy, transforming to an alkoxide intermediate before a subsequent dehydrogenation. In the first case the rate-limiting step would be the attack of the alkane by the O- species whereas in the second one {{it would be the}} re-oxidation of the catalytic site by diffusion of the lattice oxygen or directly by gas phase oxygen. These hypotheses are discussed in relation with all the catalytic data obtained and the physicochemical properties of the solids. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
