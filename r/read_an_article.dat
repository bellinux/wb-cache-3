5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Shedden wrote a paper {{putting the}} case for the Singapore {{strategy}} as a means of defending Australia. He argued that since Australia was also an island nation, it followed that it would also be vulnerable to a naval blockade. If Australia could be defeated without an invasion, the defence of Australia had to be a naval one. Colonel John Lavarack, who had attended the Imperial Defence College class of 1928 with Shedden, disagreed. Lavarack responded that the vast coastline of Australia would make a naval blockade very difficult, and its considerable internal resources meant that it could resist economic pressure. When Richmond attacked the Labor Party's position in an article in British Army Quarterly in 1933, Lavarack wrote a rebuttal. In 1936, the leader of the opposition John Curtin <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> by Wynter in the House of Representatives. Wynter's outspoken criticism of the Singapore strategy led to his transfer to a junior post. Soon after the outbreak of war with Germany on 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies appointed a British officer, Lieutenant General Ernest Squires, to replace Lavarack as Chief of the General Staff. Within months, the Chief of the Air Staff was replaced with a British officer as well.|$|E

25|$|The first dissent {{against the}} Tuskegee study was Irwin Schatz, a young Chicago doctor {{only four years}} out of medical school.

25|$|After {{researchers}} provoked {{volunteers to}} disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs {{has found that}} those whose belief in free will had been eroded {{were more likely to}} cheat. In a study conducted by Roy Baumeister, after participants <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> arguing against free will, {{they were more likely to}} lie about their performance on a test where they would be rewarded with cash. Provoking a rejection of free will has also been associated with increased aggression and less helpful behaviour as well as mindless conformity. Disbelief in free will can even cause people to feel less guilt about transgressions against others.|$|E
25|$|As Etheredge-Ouzts {{and music}} {{supervisor}} John Norris began planning {{the music for}} the film, Etheredge-Ouzts <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> about the queercore (gay punk music) scene in Los Angeles.

Working with Name helped Etheredge-Ouzts to further define the motion picture's aesthetics, characters, and themes. At some point, Name, who had been an Abercrombie & Fitch model, was asked to play the serial killer in the film, and he agreed. Through Name, Etheredge-Ouzts came to know Texas Terri, whom he cast as the tattoo artist. Only later did Etheredge-Ouzts discover that Texas Terri was a punk rock musician and singer, after which he asked her to contribute to the soundtrack as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, George Gordon McCrae wrote {{two letters}} {{to a local}} {{schoolmaster}} at Dromana, Mr G.H. Rogers. His subject was his earliest recollections of an idyllic boyhood spent at Arthur's Seat Run, location of the historic McCrae Homestead on the southern shore of the bay, part of the Mornington Peninsula. In the letters he described in detail {{the natural history of}} the area in the 1840s, and the species he particularly remembered 60 years later. In 1939, Charles Daley <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> before the Victorian Historical Society based on these letters, which was published in their magazine in 1940 the year after a large bushfire in January 1939 hastened the disappearance of much of the original surviving wildlife from the area.

25|$|Rashid Rida popularized {{the term}} 'Salafī' to {{describe}} a particular movement (i.e., Islamic modernism) that he spearheaded. That movement sought to reject the ossification of the madhhabs, and rethink through the standard issues of fiqh and modernity, at times in very liberal ways. A young scholar {{by the name of}} Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> by Rida, and then took this term and used it {{to describe a}}nother, completely different movement. Ironically, the movement that Rida spearheaded eventually became Modernist Islam and dropped the 'Salafī' label, and the legal methodology that al-Albānī championed – with a very minimal overlap with Rida's vision of Islam – retained the appellation Salafī'. Eventually, al-Albānī's label was adopted by the Najdī daʿwah as well, until it spread in all trends of the movement. Otherwise, before this century, the term 'Salafī' was not used as a common label and proper noun. Therefore, the term 'Salafī' has attached itself to an age-old school of theology, the Atharī school.|$|E

As a boy, he became a ward of his grandfather when his father died. Eytel was well educated in the German gymnasium and became enamored of the American West while reading the works of Prussian natural science writer and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, which he found in the Stuttgart Royal Library. From 1880 to 1884 he studied forestry in Tübingen and then was drafted into the German Army. He first traveled to the United States in 1885 aboard the Suevia {{and worked as a}} ranch hand in Kansas.

500|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} had {{its origin}} in a printing machine designed in 1866 by Christopher Latham Sholes {{to assist in}} printing page numbers in books, and serial numbers on tickets and other items. Sholes, a Wisconsin printer, formed a partnership with Samuel W. Soule, also a printer, and together they began development work in Charles F. Kleinsteuber's machine shop, a converted mill in northern Milwaukee. Carlos S.

To that point, several dozen patents for printing devices had been issued in the United States and abroad. None of the machines, however, had been successful or effective products.|$|E
500|$|Dennis Feldman had {{the idea}} for Species in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, Real Men. Having <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> by Arthur C.

[...] Thus in turn he considered that the possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information. Then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men. Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined wetware. The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions [...] "giving out directions" [...] such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space. He pointed out that [...] "in nature, one species would not want a predator to know where it hides." ...|$|E
