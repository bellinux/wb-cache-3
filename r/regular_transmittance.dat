25|$|In optical radiometry, {{sheets of}} PTFE {{are used as}} {{measuring}} heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., illuminance meters and UV radiometers) due to PTFE's capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths, from UV down to near infrared. In this region, the relation of its <b>regular</b> <b>transmittance</b> to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a diffuser (PTFE sheet) radiates like Lambert's cosine law. Thus PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of optical radiation at a surface, e.g. in solar irradiance measurements.|$|E
40|$|The <b>regular</b> <b>transmittance</b> {{of light}} or similar {{radiation}} through a flowing suspension of particles fluctuates {{because of the}} random occurrence of particles in the beam. In the work presented here, a theory for this fluctuating behaviour with the emphasison dispersions of mm-length slender cylindrical particles having circular crosssections is given. The particles in question are wood pulp fibres, which as a first approximation are considered to have a cylinder shape. Four possible measurementprinciples are described theoretically and experimentally. The four principles are for the measurement of concentration, length distribution characterized as lengthclasses, mean length, and mean width. The usefulness in industrial process monitoring of two of these principles is exemplified with pulp measurements. In order to estimate model errors, numerical simulations were used. Although other techniques such as image analysis may compete, the technique presented here is attractive because of {{the simplicity of the}} measurement device used. QC 2010080...|$|E
40|$|It is {{advisable}} to clarify {{what is meant}} by several terms describing the types of reflectance and transmittance from a surface as illustrated in Fig. 2. 20. A polished glass surface would have specular reflectance and <b>regular</b> <b>transmittance</b> (if it is not opaque). A ground glass surface would have diffuse reflectance and diffuse transmittance. Chalk would have diffuse reflectance. Varnished wood, polished stone, and glazed tile would have some specular component or gloss and some diffuse reflectance; it would have mixed specular and diffuse reflectance. Fig. 2. 20. Three types of reflecting surfaces. A special “ideal ” case of diffuse reflectance is when the reflected light intensity follows the cosine or Lambert’s Law as seen in Fig. 2. 21. The integrating sphere is discussed elsewhere, which would ideally have a very highly reflecting and totally diffuse surface which is “Lambertian ” in its reflectance. Fig. 2. 21. Diffuse reflecting surfaces satisfying Lambert’s Cosine Law. 2. 2. 6. Measuring Transmittance There are occasional papers in the journals and sections in texts on the fine points of the measurement of optical coatings such as Arndt et al. 59, but seldom a review of "common " practice for a person new to the field. We will here attempt to help with that problem of "how to measure " before embarking on what to do with those measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{national}} standard spectrophotometric system {{developed in the}} Laboratory for photometry and radiometry of the Bureau of Measures and Precious Metals (ZMDM) is used for realization of <b>regular</b> spectral <b>transmittance</b> scale in spectral region 360 nm to 1000 nm. Evaluation of the performances of the system shows that the measurements on neutral density filters can be performed with the uncertainties in range from 0. 1 % to 2 % (k = 2), depending on transmittance level and wavelength. System verification was performed according to NIST SRM reference standards. The validation of the method is expected {{with the results of}} EUROMET key comparison of <b>regular</b> spectral <b>transmittance,</b> in which, the Laboratory for photometry of ZMDM was included through the- bilateral comparison of <b>regular</b> spectral <b>transmittance</b> measurements with INM (EUROMET project No 766). Realization of the system and the method used in that bilateral comparison, together with its metrological characterization and measurement uncertainty evaluation, are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This chapter will {{describe}} {{some of the}} theoretical concepts of obtaining optical properties from spectrophotometric measurements. The optical properties of interest can be the spectrophotometric quantities themselves or the calculated optical constants (complex refractive index, absorption, and scattering coefficients). At first, the different radiometric quantities, describing radiance, irradiance, and radiometric intensity will be introduced. The relationships between these quantities and the electromagnetic fields will then be described. Then, the spectrophotometric quantities, such as spectral <b>regular</b> reflectance and <b>transmittance,</b> radiance, irradiance, emittance, diffuse reflectance, diffuse transmittance, and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function will be defined. The Kirchhoff relationship between the reflectance and emittance will be derived. A review of the Fresnel relations will be given, including expressions appropriate for thin films and thick films. Finally, three models for light scattering will be reviewed, including the theory of Kubelka and Munk, important for measuring highly diffuse, volume scattering materials for color formulation applications, scattering from rough surfaces in the facet approximation, useful for very rough surfaces, and vector first-order perturbation theory, useful for smooth surfaces. 9 2014 Elsevier Inc.
