30|$|The {{costs are}} rather {{predictable}} because normally the paper mills make {{long term agreements}} with logistics operators. The products are usually transported further to customers from a port that is located closest to the mill. The <b>ro-ro</b> <b>vessels</b> normally visit the port of export weekly or even more often, and carriers transport the products to an agreed port of export. From the port of import, the packages are transported either directly to customers or stored to service warehouses and from there, delivered later to the destinations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inherent}} {{safety of}} <b>Ro-Ro</b> <b>vessels</b> {{has been called}} into question {{in a number of}} Maritime Inquiries, especially in Europe, over the last 10 years or more. If there was a possibility of a design flaw in SuperFerry9, or any subsequent alteration to the vessel which could have compromised the inherent safety of the vessel, the wreck will need to be physically examined by experts. If the wreck is not thoroughly examined and comprehensive reports provided on it to any inquiry into the sinking, then any such Maritime Inquiry will be fundamentally flawed.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} a {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} cost structure a shipping company has {{to take into account}} when starting and running a regular Ro-Ro cargo line (a Short Sea Shipping line, for instance) is carried out. The object {{of this paper is to}} study Ro-Ro industry. However, Ro-Pax vessels cannot be excluded. Their behaviour when analysing the exploitation costs is very similar to <b>Ro-Ro</b> <b>vessel’s,</b> and it cannot be forgotten that nowadays most of the <b>Ro-Ro</b> <b>vessels</b> carry passengers as well. The empirical data used to formulate this paper are based on the Spanish market and the current Mediterranean lines. The aim of this paper is to find an expression for the total costs depending on the parameters of the analyzed route, bearing in mind that the vessel’s capacity will be an important factor. This model will be applied to rolled cargo vessels, especially trucks or platforms. Once the costs function is obtained the long run marginal costs will also be obtained, depending on the line capacity, aiming to obtain the optimum pricing, according to microeconomic theory. Frequency and regularity reflected upon the amount of scales will also be considered to be important because the long run marginal costs will depend on the amount of scales and the amount of transported platforms/trucks.

40|$|Recent {{research}} at the University of Strathclyde culminated {{in the development of}} a numerical procedure for assessing the damage survivability of damaged Ro-Ro vessels. Using this as a basis, new survival criteria have been proposed and submitted to IMO for consideration by the international shipping community. This paper presents the results of a fundamental study aimed at enhancing insight into one of the most dominant parameters affecting the survival of a <b>Ro-Ro</b> <b>vessel,</b> the water accumulation on the vehicle deck. The investigation represents an attempt to identify the most important contributing factors to the flooding process by performing a series of experiments using a scaled model of a typical <b>Ro-Ro</b> <b>vessel.</b> The matrix considered involves a range of ship design and environmental parameters in a number of simplified damage scenarios, building up to the more realistic damages in a way that allows for isolation of individual contributions to the water accumulation on the Ro-Ro deck. The results of the experiments, supplemented by and contrasted with results of numerical simulations, are presented and discussed, leading to recommendations for characterising the flooding process for general assessment of damage survivability...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods of}} added {{resistance}} calculation are briefl y presented, one developed by Faltinsen, {{and the other}} by Salvesen. Both {{are based on the}} Salvesen, Tuck and Faltinsen linear strip theory, as they use it to defi ne the wave induced motions. The fi rst one obtains the added resistance by direct pressure integration, while the second one involves the potential fl ow solution. Also, as a third method, an empirical approximation of the Salvesen method for the short wave lengths region is included. The calculations of added resistance due to waves were performed according to the chosen methods for four different ships: two containerships, a bulk carrier and a <b>ro-ro</b> <b>vessel.</b> The results are presented graphically, with the comparison to experimental results for the available cases...|$|E
