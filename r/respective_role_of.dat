Although the debate tended toward a condemnation of Molinism's insistence on free will {{to the detriment of}} efficacious grace, the important influence of the Jesuit Order — among other considerations — which, beside important political and theological power in Europe, had also various missions abroad (Misiones Jesuiticas in South America, missions in China, etc.), led the Pope to abstain from an official condemnation of the Jesuits. In 1611 and again in 1625 a decree prohibited any discussion of the matter, although it was often informally avoided by the publication of commentaries on Thomas Aquinas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. - To {{characterize}} the <b>respective</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> oxidation stresses, thermal stresses and re-laxation phenomena in the oxide scales, two high temperature chambers for X-ray diffraction {{have been designed}} allowing to determine residual stresses in situ, during oxidation of Ni, with the sin 2 $ technique. At room temperature, the scales are subjected to compressive stresses and compressive stresses are also analyzed in the substrate. During heating-cooling sequences, a reversible variation of the stresses is observed, without relaxation. The stresses determined at room temperature are thermal stresses and theoretical calculation fits well with experimental determination. In situ stress determinations at 900 OC show that slight tensile stresses are then generated in the scale. All these {{results show that the}} stresses found at room temperature are mainly generated during cooling, and that the role of Pilling and Bedworth ratio, often consid-ered as the main factor for stress generation in Ni-NiO system, has little effect. 1. Introduction. Many review articles [l- 71 have provided information on the origins and the development of the residual stresses in the metauoxide systems.
