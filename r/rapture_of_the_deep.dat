25|$|Deep Purple are {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} hardest touring bands in the world. From 1968 until today (with the exception of their 1976–1984 split) they continue to tour around the world. In 2007, the band received a special award for selling more than 150,000 tickets in France, with 40 dates in the country in 2007 alone. Also in 2007, Deep Purple's <b>Rapture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> Tour was voted number 6 concert tour of the year (in all music genres) by Planet Rock listeners. The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour was voted number 5 and beat Purple's tour by only 1%. Deep Purple released a new live compilation DVD box, Around the World Live, in May 2008. In February 2008, the band made their first ever appearance at the Kremlin Palace in Moscow, Russia at the personal request of Dmitry Medvedev who at the time was considered a shoo-in for the seat of the Presidency of Russia. Prior to that, Deep Purple has toured Russia several times starting as early as 1996, but has not been considered to have played such a significant venue previously. The band was part of the entertainment for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec, Czech Republic.|$|E

500|$|Narcosis while diving (also {{known as}} {{nitrogen}} narcosis, inert gas narcosis, <b>raptures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep,</b> Martini effect) is a reversible alteration in consciousness that occurs while diving at depth. It {{is caused by}} <b>the</b> anesthetic effect <b>of</b> certain gases at high pressure. The Greek word ναρκωσις (narcosis) is derived from narke, [...] "temporary decline or loss of senses and movement, numbness", a term used by Homer and Hippocrates. Narcosis produces a state similar to drunkenness (alcohol intoxication), or nitrous oxide inhalation. It can occur during shallow dives, but does not usually become noticeable at depths less than [...]|$|R

2500|$|Much of {{the next}} few years was spent on the road touring. Most of the songs played in their live concerts {{consisted}} of classic 1970s material. The group continued forward until 2002, when founding member Lord (who, along with Paice, was the only member to be in all incarnations of the band) announced his amicable retirement from the band to pursue personal projects (especially orchestral work). Lord left his Hammond organ to his replacement, rock keyboard veteran Don Airey (Colosseum II, Rainbow, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Whitesnake), who had helped Deep Purple out when Lord's knee was injured in 2001. [...] In 2003, Deep Purple released their first studio album in five years (Bananas) and began touring in support of the album. EMI Records refused a contract extension with Deep Purple, possibly because of lower than expected sales. Actually In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra sold more than Bananas. In July 2005, the band played at the Live 8 concert in Park Place (Barrie, Ontario) and, in October released their next album, <b>Rapture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep,</b> which was followed by the <b>Rapture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> tour. This Mark VIII line-up's two studio albums were produced by Michael Bradford.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{some fans}} called the 2010 leg simply [...] "World Tour" [...] (since {{at that time}} only one song from <b>Rapture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> - the title track - {{remained}} in the set list), Don Airey, the band's keyboardist, said it's still the <b>Rapture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> tour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{report a}} rare case of open {{dislocation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, associated with simultaneous avulsion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central band and distal insertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extensor mechanism, <b>rapture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal volar plate, and <b>rapture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ulnar collateral ligament <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PIP joint. Although isolated IP joint injuries are common, they rarely occur simultaneously {{in a single}} finger. Even more rarely are they accompanied by a complete avulsion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extensor mechanism. Operative restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injured structures is a necessity {{in order to achieve}} a good functional outcome. An initial forceful flexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finger resulting to <b>rapture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extensor apparatus and then followed by finger hyperextension and PIP joint dislocation is our perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible mechanism <b>of</b> this extremely rare injury...|$|R
