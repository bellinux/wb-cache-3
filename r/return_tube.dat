50|$|The boiler {{consists}} of one long horizontal transverse drum, {{with a central}} locomotive-style firebox mounted in an extension beneath. The first boilers had a square firebox, but this was later changed to a circular section. Firing with coke is carried out through a firedoor {{in the side of}} the shell, to the rear of the boiler when installed. Fire-tubes lead to a shallow smokebox at each side, from which <b>return</b> <b>tubes</b> pass to a central chamber beneath the chimney. The chimney is wrapped with an extension of the boiler shell, acting as a steam collecting dome. There are 32 tubes in total from the firebox, of 1¾ inch diameter, and 28 more to the chimney chamber. Longitudinal stays support the flat tubeplates at each side. An unusual feature is that rather than the usual single blastpipe beneath the chimney, there are 14 of them on each side inside each smokebox, pointing into the <b>return</b> <b>tubes.</b> Exhaust steam from the engine reaches these blastpipes through a prominent copper pipe on the outside of each smokebox door.|$|R
50|$|The New Huber Traction engine {{company of}} Marion, Ohio, built engines from 1885 to 1903. In several respects the engines were {{different}} from their competitors in that the boilers had <b>return</b> <b>tubes,</b> (a two pass system, much like a marine boiler) and engines were reversed {{on top of the}} boiler (contrary to conventional practice with engine forward and crank at rear). The boilers were economical as they captured more heat from the stack gases.|$|R
50|$|Countercurrent {{multiplication}} is {{a similar}} but different concept where liquid moves in a loop followed by a long length of movement in opposite directions with an intermediate zone. The tube leading to the loop passively building up a gradient of heat (or cooling) or solvent concentration while the <b>returning</b> <b>tube</b> has a constant small pumping action all along it, so that a gradual intensification of the heat or concentration is created towards the loop. Countercurrent multiplication {{has been found in}} the kidneys as well as in many other biological organs.|$|R
50|$|The See {{designed}} quadruple expansion {{steam engine}} had cylinders of 9.75 in, 13.5 in, 18.75 in and 26 in with 22 in stroke connected to two opposed cranks each driven by two cylinders arranged in tandem and driving a 7 ft propeller. Steam at 180 lb pressure {{was provided by}} a two furnace steel <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> type boiler 9.5 ft in diameter by 10.5 ft in length. Two Worthington fire and bilge pumps provided water for fire fighting or bilge pumping.|$|E
50|$|Trains were {{to require}} no couplers, each car being {{directly}} welded, bolted, or otherwise firmly {{connected to the}} next, the route calling for no more bending than the flexibility of steel could easily handle. At {{the end of the}} line the train would be moved sideways into the end chamber of the <b>return</b> <b>tube.</b> The railway would have both an inner evacuated tube and an outer tunnel. At cruise depth, the space between would have enough water to float the vacuum tube, softening the ride.|$|E
50|$|Extensively used by Britain, {{before and}} {{in the early days of}} ironclads, the only {{protected}} place was below the waterline, sometimes under an armoured deck, so to fit below short decks, the tubes were not led back above the furnace but continued straight from it with keeping the combustion chamber in between the two. Hence the name, and considerably reduced diameter, compared to the ubiquituous Scotch or <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> boiler. It was not a great success and its use was being abandoned after the introduction of stronger side armouring - “the furnace crowns, being very near the water-level, are much more liable to over-heating. Further, on account of the length of the boiler, for an equal angle of inclination, the effect on the water-level is much greater. Finally, the unequal expansion of the various parts of the boiler is more pronounced, especially at the top and bottom, due to the increased ratio between the length and the diameter of the boiler; the local strains are also more severe on account of the comparatively feeble circulation in long and low boilers.” All these also resulted in a shorter life. Also, the same length of a combustion chamber was much less effective on a direct tube than on a <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> boiler, at least without baffling.|$|E
50|$|The tip of {{the loop}} has the highest {{concentration}} of salt (NaCl) in the incoming tube—in the example 1199 mg/L, and in the buffer 1200 mg/L. The <b>returning</b> <b>tube</b> has active transport pumps, pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 mg/L {{more than in the}} tube. Thus when opposite the 1000 mg/L in the buffer liquid, the concentration in the tube is 800 and only 200 mg/L are needed to be pumped out. But the same is true anywhere along the line, so that at exit of the loop also only 200 mg/L need to be pumped.|$|R
50|$|In {{the example}} {{shown in the}} image, water enters at 299 mg/L (NaCl / H2O). Water passes because of a small osmotic {{pressure}} to the buffer liquid in this example at 300 mg/L (NaCl / H2O). Further up the loop there is a continued flow of {{water out of the}} tube and into the buffer, gradually raising the concentration of NaCl in the tube until it reaches 1199 mg/L at the tip. The buffer liquid between the two tubes is at a gradually rising concentration, always a bit over the incoming fluid, in this example reaching 1200 mg/L. This is regulated by the pumping action on the <b>returning</b> <b>tube</b> as will be explained immediately.|$|R

50|$|On {{the frame}} structure, the lower side pipes and the width-wise lower pipe behind the cockpit were {{rectangle}} tubes, {{with most of}} the other frame pipes being round steel tubes in various diameter. The upper left round pipe was used as the water (the use of anti-freeze chemicals was prohibited by most of the race organisers at the time for the danger of making the Tarmac slippery) feed pipe for the radiator up front, and the lower right side pipe and a half of the width-wise lower rear cockpit pipe was the <b>return</b> <b>tube.</b> Likewise, the upper right side pipe was the oil feed to the oil cooler, and the lower left tube was the return. This frame was mostly made by Arch Motors, carrying 'AM' serial number.|$|E
50|$|The riverboat was {{described}} on the builders certificate as having three decks, and one mast, and was cutter rigged. She was clincher built with an elliptical stern and straight stem. Her length was 115.5 feet, main breadth 23.1 feet, with depth in hold from tonnage deck to ceiling amidships, 4.45 feet. Her gross tonnage was 178.29 tons and net register tonnage 121.24 tons. She had two decks, the main deck was of steel and the promenade deck of teak which did not run the whole length of the vessel. The third deck or sun deck was to be laid on her arrival in Brazil. The space between these decks was boarded up for the voyage. The vessel had vertical surface condensing twin screw engines of 350 estimated horse power, designed {{to give her a}} speed of 11 or 11 1/2 knots. She had one single-ended <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> boiler fired from the foremost end, loaded to 150 lbs. pressure. She was fitted with both hand and steam steering gear worked from the fore end of the promenade deck by means of chains and rods to the rudder head which was carried up to that level.|$|E
5000|$|By 1908 {{the ship}} was noted in the journal The American Marine Engineer as being the oldest metal hulled vessel then {{existing}} and of interest to engineers because of the ship's age. The two engines were inclined simple steam engines of 36 in with a 96 in stroke that were original and running well in 1908. The first of three sets of boilers were return flue type that lasted fifty years before finally being replaced by bricked in <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> types. The operating pressure was low, 25 lbs kg sufficient to drive the engines at 20 rpm, with engine room piping of [...]125 in thick copper connecting with brass flange joints. When, about 1905, the ship finally changed from kerosene lights to electric a special engine for the dynamo had to be constructed to operate on the low pressure steam. The steam was also used in a peculiar system for repelling boarders with hot water direct from the boiler. Coal consumption before the latest modifications was two tons per hour and after the modifications was as low as one half ton per hour. The ship carried two steam launches. The ship had never made even ten knots until dispatched from the harbor at Cleveland to Buffalo to prevent riots on the assassination of President William McKinley 6 September 1901 and, with the safeties weighted, she made almost fourteen knots at 30 rpm at one point.|$|E

50|$|The whole high {{pressure}} {{part of the system}} is manufactured from steel tubing of small diameter, connected to valve control units by Lockheed type pipe unions with special seals made from desmopan rubber, a type of rubber compatible with the LHM fluid. The moving parts of the system (e.g., suspension strut or steering ram) are sealed by contact seals between the cylinder and piston for tightness under pressure. The other plastic/rubber parts are <b>return</b> <b>tubes</b> from valves such as the brake control or height corrector valves, also catching seeping fluid around the suspension push-rods. Height corrector, brake master valve and steering valve spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1-3 micrometres) with their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate. The metal and alloy parts of the system rarely fail even after excessively high mileages but the rubber components (especially those exposed to the air) can harden and leak, typical failure points for the system.|$|R

50|$|Existing {{photographs}} of the engine bay of the final pre-production version of this system clearly show the liquid coolant from both separators was piped along the bottom {{left side of the}} engine compartment and into the right wing. The header tanks were located in the outer wing panels ahead of the main spar and immediately outboard of the main landing gear bays. The tanks extended over the same portion of the outer panel's span as the outer flaps. Coolant from the right wing header tank was pumped by a separate, electrical pump to the left wing header tank. Along the way from the right to left wing, the coolant passed through a conventional radiator mounted {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. That radiator was retractable and intended for use only during ground-running or low-speed flight. Nevertheless, coolant passed through it whenever the engine was running and regardless of whether it was extended or retracted. In the retracted position, the radiator offered little cooling, but some heat was exchanged into the aft fuselage. Finally, a <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> connected the left wing's header tank to that on the right. This allowed the coolant to equalize between the two header tanks and circulate through the retractable radiator. The engine drew coolant directly from both header tanks through two separate pipes that ran through the main landing gear bays, up the firewall at the back of the engine compartment, and into the usual coolant intakes located at the top rear of the engine.|$|E
40|$|A {{ball screw}} driven {{mechanism}} {{is a major}} component in high-speed/high-precision transmitting systems. In such a mechanism, the <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> {{has been designed to}} provide the path for a steel ball rolling in screw grooves. As the driven shaft in the mechanism operates at high rotating speed, forces caused by the impact activity between the steel ball and <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> may generate high stresses and cause damage to the <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> after some significant service times. In order to understand the fracture conditions in the <b>return</b> <b>tube,</b> an impact-contact formula is developed and the transient behavior is investigated based on the finite element method in this paper. From results obtained here, it is shown that the rotational speed of the ball screw may affect the service life of the <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> significantly. Factors that affect the service life of the re-circulating mechanism are then described in detail. Further suggestions for the improvement of the <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> in the design/fabrication processes are also proposed in the final part of this paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The annular-return {{flow and}} {{the utility of}} small-scale, combustion-based {{actuators}} for its control are investigated experimentally. The annular return flow is generated by an axial primary round jet, which impinges normally on a bounded end wall of a concentric tube, subsequently reverses direction, and exits the tube in a countercurrent flow to the primary jet. The combustion-based actuator generates a momentary (pulsed) jet that is produced by the ignition of a mixture of gaseous fuel and oxidizer in a small (cubic centimeter scale) combustion chamber. The operating frequency and the phase can be continuously varied by independently controlling the flow rate of the fuel/oxidizer and the ignition frequency. Two radially-opposing actuators are mounted {{on the wall of}} the annular <b>return</b> <b>tube</b> and are used to trigger flow transients that alter the global flow through strong feedback. The characteristics of the baseline flow and the effects of actuation are investigated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) as well as static and unsteady pressure measurements. The baseline flow is highly unstable, exhibiting very high rates of flow recirculation. The actuator jet acts as an azimuthal obstruction deflecting the primary jet and causing it to flow around the actuator jet. Furthermore, the interaction of the primary jet with the actuator jets generates large-scale circulation domains. M. S. Committee Chair: Ari Gleze...|$|E
