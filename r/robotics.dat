Roz Kaveney, in her analysis of Ash in From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, draws parallels to Bishop as a representation of the Three Laws of <b>Robotics.</b> Although Ash's programming allows (and encourages) harming humans, Bishop puts human life above all else in accordance with the First Law of <b>Robotics.</b> Bishop was studied by LeiLani Nishime of the University of Texas Press in 2005 as a theoretical dramatization of how humans would deal with the presence of an Other, concerning Ripley's initial apprehension about being near a synthetic after her life-threatening encounter with Ash. According to an article by Anton Karl Kozlovic of the University of Nebraska Omaha, Bishop's altruistic actions (which include rescuing Newt and Ripley) contradict a trend towards technophobia in pre-1990 films.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhile <b>robotic</b> surgery {{has shown}} clear utility and {{advantages}} {{in the adult}} population, its role in pediatrics remains controversial. Pediatric-sized <b>robotic</b> instruments and equipment are not readily available yet, so certain modifications {{can be made in}} order to make <b>robotic</b> surgery successful in children. While the cost of <b>robotic</b> surgery remains high compared to open procedures, patients experience greater satisfaction and quality of life with <b>robotic</b> surgery. <b>Robotic</b> pyeloplasty is a standard of care in older children, and has even been performed in infants and re-do surgery. Other <b>robotic</b> procedures performed in children include heminephroureterectomy, ureteroureterostomy, ureteral reimplantation, urachal cyst excision, bladder diverticulectomy, and bladder reconstructive procedures such as augmentation, appendicovesicostomy, antegrade continence enema, bladder neck reconstruction and sling, as well as other procedures. <b>Robotic</b> surgery has also been used in oncologic cases such as partial nephrectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Future improvements in technology with production of pediatric-sized <b>robotic</b> instruments, along with increases in robotic-trained pediatric urologists and surgeon experience along each's learning curve, will help to further advance the field of <b>robotic</b> surgery in pediatric urology...|$|R

Laparoscopic experience is a plus but not “a must”, even if it helps the surgeon in performing difficult procedures. We feel that laparoscopic technique will be replaced by <b>robotic</b> technique in UPJ reconstructive procedures as laparoscopy faded in favour of <b>robotic</b> technique in most institutions where <b>robotic</b> surgery is available for radical prostatectomy.|$|R
