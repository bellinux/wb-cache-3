25|$|The maximum rpm of a {{propeller}} (at about 2800 {{depending on}} its diameter) {{is about half}} that at the maximum torque/power rpm of about 5500rpm for a car engine and these engines therefore need to be fitted with a drive <b>reduction</b> <b>unit.</b> Such units absorb about 20% of the engine power and therefore the normally aspirated Isuzu unit delivers the same maximum power as the Jabiru 5100. Recent developments of the Jabiru engine range by Rotec have produced replacement water-cooled cylinder heads for the 5100. This has removed the overheating problems and also allowed the nose cowling of the Mk26 to be reshaped to remove the air intake and considerably reduce the frontal area to be {{in keeping with the}} original sleek design of the Spitfire. First flights of a Mk26 with the redeveloped water-cooled Jabiru 5100 are expected in 2016.|$|E
500|$|The {{machine was}} a simple, cross-shaped frame, with the pilot {{standing}} on a platform, secured by a safety harness. The harness also secured the aircraft's engine, which was an outboard motor manufactured by Mercury Marine. The engine was controlled by a twist-grip motorcycle-style throttle and transferred power to the [...] diameter, contra-rotating rotors via belt drive with a chain <b>reduction</b> <b>unit.</b> The aircraft's landing gear consisted of airbags {{at the end of}} each arm of the frame along with a large rubber float in the middle, allowing for amphibious capability, although this arrangement was later replaced by a pair of conventional helicopter-type skids.|$|E

2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller speed <b>reduction</b> <b>unit</b> to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox. [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs. Only the eccentric shaft spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower 2,500 rpm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experience}} of driving an EV1 was unlike a conventional gasoline or diesel vehicle. The EV1's [...] {{was the lowest}} of any production automobile in history, while typical contemporary production cars had a drag coefficient in the range [...] The EV1's clean shape meant it produced less wind noise at highway speeds, providing a more comfortable driving experience for its occupants. At lower speeds, and when stationary, the car produced little to no noise at all, save for a slight whine from the single-speed gear <b>reduction</b> <b>unit.</b> The car's smooth shape, waterfall tail and rear fender skirts gave it a distinctive appearance. The EV1 had no analog dials, and all instrumentation readouts were displayed in a single thin curved strip mounted high on the dashboard, just underneath the windshield.|$|E
2500|$|The DA36 E-Star, an {{aircraft}} designed by Siemens, Diamond Aircraft and EADS, employs a series hybrid powertrain with the propeller being turned by a Siemens [...] electric motor. The {{aim is to}} reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 25 percent. An onboard [...] Austro Engines Wankel rotary engine and generator provides the electricity. A propeller speed <b>reduction</b> <b>unit</b> is eliminated. The electric motor uses electricity stored in batteries, with the generator engine off, to take off and climb reducing sound emissions. The series-hybrid powertrain using the Wankel engine reduces the weight of the plane by 100kg compared with its predecessor. The DA36 E-Star first flew in June 2013, making this the first ever flight of a series-hybrid powertrain. Diamond Aircraft state that the technology using Wankel engines is scalable to a 100-seat aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Coal mine methane {{resources}} of Kuznetsk coal basin in Russia amounts to over 13 trillion cubic meters. Presently 47 coal mines {{operate in the}} region and emit 216 million cubic meters of methane per year but unfortunately none of them attempt to utilize drained methane. Development of coal mine methane recovery and utilization is of great technological, economical and ecological importance for Kuzbass. One of the main challenges in monitoring methane recovery and utilization projects and generated Emission <b>Reduction</b> <b>Units</b> trading under the framework of Kyoto Protocol mechanisms becomes a selection of successful methane utilization options. Each separate coal enterprise features certain peculiarities that impact the decision adoption. Dominating role here is played by the existing thermal and electrical power market and emission <b>reduction</b> <b>units</b> market price. Application of a mathematical tools based on game theory may serve as one of the means in addressing this issue. The method implies a financial-economic model plotting, where the main players are the “coal mine ” and the “emission <b>reduction</b> <b>units</b> market”. A practical magnitude of results analysis of shaped models implies the development and the definition of the best effective scenario for economic system development with regard of regional and business peculiarities and the elaboration of recommendations for specific coal mining entities of Kuzbass region...|$|R
