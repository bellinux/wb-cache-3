40|$|AbstractThis article {{uses the}} data of the 2002 {{national}} census and a comprehensive dataset of the December 2003 –March 2008 <b>regional</b> <b>legislative</b> elections in Russia to assess the levels of the representation of ethnic Muslims in the <b>regional</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The study reveals that the overall pattern of the representation of ethnic Muslims in Russia's <b>regional</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>assemblies</b> is not monotonous. Ethnic Muslims are significantly overrepresented in those republics where they are ‘titular’ nationalities; {{they tend to be}} underrepresented in a group of regions with significant ethnic Muslim minorities; but as their share in the overall population goes down, the picture becomes more balanced, so that it would {{be fair to say that}} small Muslim minorities are quite well represented. The article explains the observed patterns with reference to the logic of non-politicization of cleavages shared by all types of regions. For the ruling elites of Muslim-majority republics, the preferred mode of operation is to keep the overrepresentation of Muslims as a characteristic of all political groups who can realistically claim access to power. For the predominantly Russian elites of regions with significant ethnic Muslim minorities, the non-politicization of cleavages is a way to make electoral appeals to wider general population. In the regions with small ethnic Muslim minorities, their entry into political arenas is conditional on individual or group alliances with locally dominant elite groups, without any articulation of ethnicity/religion cleavages whatsoever...|$|R

5000|$|Körting also {{stood for}} election, successfully, to the Landtag of Saxony-Anhalt. By October 1949, when the Soviet {{occupation}} zone was re-founded as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, considerable progress {{had been made}} in moving the territory's constitutional arrangements towards a model closely based on those of the Soviet Union itself. One aspect of this was insistence on the leading role of the ruling party, which effectively, and later expressly, meant that the national <b>assembly</b> and any <b>regional</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>assemblies,</b> along with government ministers, all operated according to the strictures of the SED Central Committee. Opposition parties were not banned, but they were reinvented as [...] "Bloc parties", grouped into a controlling structure called the National Front. Their representation in the national legislature was based not on election results but on predetermined quotas of seats. Another feature that Lenin had incorporated into the Soviet Constitution was the introduction of various officially established [...] "mass organizations", entitled to a quota of seats in national and <b>regional</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>assemblies</b> as a way to assert the broadest possible support for party policy. A constitutional structure incorporating Mass movements had not yet been created even in the Soviet occupation zone as early as 1946, but in the Regional elections in Saxony, the Peasants Mutual Aid Association(VdgB / Vereinigung der gegenseitigen Bauernhilfe) participated {{as though it were a}} political party. It received 2.5% of the vote and Otto Körting, despite being a known member of the SED (party) was one of two assembly members who would sit as representative members of the VdgB. The next year, in November 1947, the Association held its first [...] "Bauerntag" [...] in Berlin, which in effect was a quasi-party congress by another name. Körting was elected first president of the VdgB. He had already, in 1946, been elected one of several vice-presidents of the Landtag of Saxony-Anhalt (regional legislature).|$|R

He returned to national politics between 1987 and 1989, as a representative in the Assembly of the Republic, in the António Guterres government. Once again returning to the Azores, he became a member of the Municipal Assembly of Ponta Delgada, as well as the President of the Civil Parish of Fajã de Baixo. On 30 October 1994 (his 38th birthday) he was made the Presidente of the PS Azores, with 92% of the votes.|$|R

50|$|Accordingly, {{with the}} Portuguese Constitution, the {{legislative}} function is shared between the Assembly of the Republic (parliament), the Government and the self-government {{bodies of the}} Portuguese autonomous regions (only for specific regional matters).

All other matters must be legislated by the Assembly, including some reserved matters regarding which no legislative authorization can be given to the Government. The legislative function reserved for the bodies of self-government of the autonomous regions is assured by their respective <b>regional</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>assemblies,</b> in the conditions defined by the Constitution and the political and administrative statute of each region.|$|R
