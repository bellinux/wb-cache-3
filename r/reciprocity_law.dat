25|$|Throughout the 19th century {{mathematics}} {{became increasingly}} abstract. Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on functions of complex variables, in geometry, {{and on the}} convergence of series, leaving aside his many contributions to science.

25|$|He {{first used}} the {{pigeonhole}} principle, a basic counting argument, in {{the proof of}} a theorem in diophantine approximation, later named after him Dirichlet's approximation theorem. He published important contributions to Fermat's last theorem, for which he proved the cases n=5 and n=14, and to the biquadratic <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law.</b> The Dirichlet divisor problem, for which he found the first results, is still an unsolved problem in number theory despite later contributions by other researchers.|$|E
25|$|The year 1796 {{was most}} {{productive}} for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a {{construction of the}} heptadecagon on 30 March. He further advanced modular arithmetic, greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. On 8 April {{he became the first}} to prove the quadratic <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law.</b> This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The prime number theorem, conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the prime numbers are distributed among the integers.|$|E
25|$|Euler {{made the}} first conjectures about {{biquadratic}} reciprocity. Gauss published two monographs on biquadratic reciprocity. In the first one (1828) he proved Euler's conjecture about the biquadratic character of 2. In the second one (1832) he stated the biquadratic <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> for the Gaussian integers and proved the supplementary formulas. He said that a third monograph would be forthcoming with the proof of the general theorem, but it never appeared. Jacobi presented proofs in his Königsberg lectures of 1836–37. The first published proofs were by Eisenstein.|$|E

500|$|Noether's colleagues celebrated her fiftieth {{birthday}} in 1932, in typical mathematicians' style. Helmut Hasse dedicated an article {{to her in}} the Mathematische Annalen, wherein he confirmed her suspicion that some aspects of noncommutative algebra are simpler than those of commutative algebra, by proving a noncommutative <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law.</b> This pleased her immensely. He also sent her a mathematical riddle, the [...] "mμν-riddle of syllables", which she solved immediately; the riddle has been lost.|$|E
2500|$|Emil Artin {{established}} the Artin <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> {{in a series}} of papers (1924; 1927; 1930). This law is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory. The term [...] "reciprocity law" [...] refers to a long line of more concrete number theoretic statements which it generalized, from the quadratic <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> and the reciprocity laws of Eisenstein and Kummer to Hilbert's product formula for the norm symbol. Artin's result provided a partial solution to Hilbert's ninth problem.|$|E
2500|$|Just as the {{quadratic}} <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> for the Legendre symbol is {{also true}} for the Jacobi symbol, the requirement that the numbers be prime is not needed; it suffices that they be odd relatively prime nonunits. Probably the most well-known statement is: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{quadratic}} <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> can be {{formulated in}} terms of the Hilbert symbol [...] where a and b are any [...] two nonzero rational numbers and v runs over all the non-trivial absolute values of the rationals (the archimedean one and [...] the p-adic absolute values for primes p). The Hilbert symbol [...] is 1 or −1. It is defined to be 1 if and only if the equation [...] has a solution in the completion of the rationals at v other than [...] The Hilbert <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> states that , for fixed a and b and varying v, is 1 for [...] all but finitely many v and the product of [...] over all v is 1.

2500|$|... "Proof of {{the most}} general <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> or an {{arbitrary}} number field". In 1923 Emil Artin, building upon work by Philipp Furtwängler, Teiji Takagi, Helmut Hasse and others, discovered a general theorem for which all known reciprocity laws are special cases; he proved it in 1927.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} ways to express reciprocity laws. The early reciprocity laws found in the 19th century were usually {{expressed in terms of}} a power residue symbol (p/q) generalizing the quadratic reciprocity symbol, [...] that describes when a prime number is an nth power residue modulo another prime, and gave a relation between (p/q) and (q/p). [...] Hilbert reformulated the reciprocity laws as saying that a product over p of Hilbert symbols (a,b/p), taking values in roots of unity, is equal to 1. Artin's reformulated <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> states that the Artin symbol from ideals (or ideles) to elements of a Galois group is trivial on a certain subgroup. Several more recent generalizations express reciprocity laws using cohomology of groups or representations of adelic groups or algebraic K-groups, and their relationship with the original quadratic <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> can be hard to see.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proof of}} Hilbert {{reciprocity}} reduces to checking a few special cases, and the non-trivial cases [...] {{turn out to}} be equivalent to the main law and the two supplementary laws of quadratic reciprocity for the Legendre symbol. There is no kind of reciprocity in the Hilbert reciprocity law; its name [...] simply indicates the historical source of the result in quadratic reciprocity. Unlike quadratic reciprocity, [...] which requires sign conditions (namely positivity of the primes involved) and a special treatment of the prime 2, the Hilbert <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> treats all absolute values of the rationals on an equal footing. Therefore, it is a more natural way of expressing quadratic reciprocity with a view towards generalization: the Hilbert <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> extends with very few changes to all global fields and this extension can rightly be considered a generalization of quadratic reciprocity to all global fields.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} include all {{possible}} extensions having certain properties, the Galois group concept is commonly applied to the (infinite) field extension [...] / F of the algebraic closure, leading to the absolute Galois group G := Gal( [...] / F) or just Gal(F), and to the extension F / Q. The fundamental theorem of Galois theory links fields in between F and its algebraic closure and closed subgroups of Gal (F). For example, the abelianization (the biggest abelian quotient) Gab of G corresponds to a field {{referred to as the}} maximal abelian extension Fab (called so since any further extension is not abelian, i.e., does not have an abelian Galois group). By the Kronecker–Weber theorem, the maximal abelian extension of Q is the extension generated by all roots of unity. For more general number fields, class field theory, specifically the Artin <b>reciprocity</b> <b>law</b> gives an answer by describing Gab in terms of the idele class group. Also notable is the Hilbert class field, the maximal abelian unramified field extension of F. It can be shown to be finite over F, its Galois group over F is isomorphic to the class group of F, in particular its degree equals the class number h of F (see above).|$|E
