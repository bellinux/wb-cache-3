5|$|The type of <b>RNA</b> <b>editing</b> {{that is most}} {{prevalent}} in higher eukaryotes converts adenosine nucleotides into inosine in dsRNAs via the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADAR). It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A→I <b>RNA</b> <b>editing</b> pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate. Some pre-miRNAs do undergo A→I <b>RNA</b> <b>editing</b> and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, at least one mammalian ADAR can sequester siRNAs from RNAi pathway components. Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR-null C. elegans strains indicating that A→I <b>RNA</b> <b>editing</b> may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{and other}} coleoid {{cephalopods}} {{are capable of}} greater <b>RNA</b> <b>editing</b> (which involves changes to the nucleic acid sequence of the primary transcript of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for <b>RNA</b> <b>editing,</b> which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come {{as the cost of}} slower genome evolution. High levels of <b>RNA</b> <b>editing</b> {{do not appear to be}} present in more basal cephalopods or other molluscs.|$|E

Of note, the arthropod mitochondrial genetic code has undergone parallel evolution within a phylum, with some organisms uniquely translating AGG to lysine.|$|E

40|$|Adenosine deaminases {{that act}} on RNA (ADARs) are RNA-editing enzymes that convert {{adenosine}} to inosine within double-stranded RNA. In the 12 {{years since the}} discovery of ADARs only a few natural substrates have been identified. These substrates were found by chance, when genomically encoded adenosines were identified as guanosines in cDNAs. To advance {{our understanding of the}} biological roles of ADARs, we developed a method for systematically identifying ADAR substrates. In our first application of the method, we identified five additional substrates in Caenorhabditis elegans. Four of those substrates are mRNAs edited in untranslated regions, and one is a noncoding <b>RNA</b> <b>edited</b> throughout its length.

We show, through reporter RNA constructs, that RNA splice sites suppress <b>editing</b> of precursor <b>RNAs</b> when placed proximal or distal to the <b>editing</b> site. Processed <b>RNAs</b> were <b>edited</b> more efficiently than precursor RNAs. Mutation of both the splice donor and acceptor sites was necessary for <b>RNAs</b> to be <b>edited</b> efficiently.

The HIV- 1 Rev-Rev response element ('RRE') interaction was utilized to uncouple the commitment of precursor RNAs to the spliceosome assembly pathway and associated nuclear-export pathway.

40|$|CaV 1. 3 ion {{channels}} are dominant Ca 2 + portals into pacemaking neurons, residing at {{the epicenter of}} brain rhythmicity and neurodegeneration. Negative Ca 2 + feedback regulation of CaV 1. 3 channels (CDI) is therefore critical for Ca 2 + homeostasis. Intriguingly, nearly half the CaV 1. 3 transcripts in the brain are <b>RNA</b> <b>edited</b> to reduce CDI and influence oscillatory activity. It is then mechanistically remarkable that this editing occurs precisely within an IQ domain, whose interaction with Ca 2 +-bound calmodulin (Ca 2 +/CaM) is believed to induce CDI. Here, we sought the mechanism underlying the altered CDI of edited channels. Unexpectedly, editing failed to attenuate Ca 2 +/CaM binding. Instead, editing weakened the prebinding of Ca 2 +-free CaM (apoCaM) to channels, which proves essential for CDI. Thus, editing might render CDI continuously tunable by fluctuations in ambient CaM, a prominent effect we substantiate in substantia nigral neurons. This adjustability of Ca 2 + regulation by CaM now looms as {{a key element of}} CNS Ca 2 + homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{optically}} manipulate specific neuronal signaling proteins with genetic precision {{paves the way}} for the dissection of their roles in brain function, behavior, and disease. Chemical optogenetic control with photoswitchable tethered ligands (PTLs) enables rapid, reversible and reproducible activation or block of specific neurotransmitter-gated receptors and ion channels in specific cells. In this study, we further engineered and characterized the light-activated GluK 2 kainate receptor, LiGluR, to develop a toolbox of LiGluR variants. Low-affinity LiGluRs allow for efficient optical control of GluK 2 while removing activation by native glutamate, whereas variant <b>RNA</b> <b>edited</b> versions enable the synaptic role of receptors with high and low Ca 2 + permeability to be assessed and spectral variant photoswitches provide flexibility in illumination. Importantly, we establish that LiGluR works efficiently in the cortex of awake, adult mice using standard optogenetic techniques, thus opening the door to probing the role of specific synaptic receptors and cellular signals in the neural circuit operations of the mammalian brain in normal conditions and in disease.

5000|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} the implications of the Zheng et al data has been submitted as formal paper to a refereed journal by Steele and Lindley. The Zheng et al data strongly imply that the RNA moiety would need to be first A-to-I <b>RNA</b> <b>edited</b> then reverse transcribed and integrated to generate the strong A>>>T strand biased mutation signatures at A:T base pairs observed in all SHM and cancer hypermutation data sets. Editing (A-to-I) of the DNA moiety at RNA:DNA hybrids in vivo cannot explain the A>>T strand bias because such direct DNA modifications would result in T>>>A strand bias which is not observed in any SHM or cancer data set in vivo. In this regard Robyn Lindley has also recently discovered that the Ig-SHM-like strand-biased mutations in cancer genome protein-coding genes are also in [...] "codon-context". Lindley has termed this process targeted somatic mutation (TSM) to highlight that somatic mutations are far more targeted than previously thought in somatic tissues associated with disease. The TSM process implies an [...] "in-frame DNA reader" [...] whereby DNA and RNA deaminases at transcribed regions are guided in their mutagenic action, by the codon reading frame of the DNA.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{mitochondrial}} genomes {{of plants}} generally encode 30 - 40 identified protein-coding genes {{and a large}} number of lineage-specific ORFs. The lack of wide conservation for most ORFs suggests they are unlikely to be functional. However, an ORF, termed orf-bryo 1, was recently found to be conserved among bryophytes suggesting that it might indeed encode a functional mitochondrial protein. Results From a broad survey of land plants, we have found that the orf-bryo 1 gene is also conserved in the mitochondria of vascular plants and charophycean green algae. This gene is actively transcribed and <b>RNA</b> <b>edited</b> in many flowering plants. Comparative sequence analysis and distribution of editing suggests that it encodes ribosomal protein L 10 of the large subunit of the ribosome. In several lineages, such as crucifers and grasses, where the rpl 10 gene has been lost from the mitochondrion, we suggest that a copy of the nucleus-encoded chloroplast-derived rpl 10 gene may serve as a functional replacement. Conclusion Despite {{the fact that there are}} now over 20 mitochondrial genome sequences for land plants and green algae, this gene has remained unidentified and largely undetected until now because of the unlikely coincidence that most of the earlier sequences were from the few lineages that lack the intact gene. These results illustrate the power of comparative sequencing to identify novel genomic features. </p...|$|R
40|$|Activation-induced {{cytidine}} deaminase (AID) {{is essential}} for the somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) of Ig genes. The mechanism by which AID triggers SHM and CSR has been explained by two distinct models. In the DNA deamination model, AID converts cytidine bases in DNA into uridine. The uridine is recognized by the DNA repair system, which produces DNA strand breakages and point mutations. In the alternative model, <b>RNA</b> <b>edited</b> by AID is responsible for triggering CSR and SHM. However, RNA deamination by AID has not been demonstrated. Here we found that C-to-T and G-to-A mutations accumulated in hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleocapsid DNA when AID was expressed in HBV-replicating hepatic cell lines. AID expression caused C-to-T mutations in the nucleocapsid DNA of RNase H-defective HBV, which does not produce plus-strand viral DNA. Furthermore, the RT-PCR products of nucleocapsid viral RNA from AID-expressing cells exhibited significant C-to-T mutations, whereas viral RNAs outside the nucleocapsid did not accumulate C-to-U mutations. Moreover, AID was packaged within the nucleocapsid by forming a ribonucleoprotein complex with HBV RNA and the HBV polymerase protein. The encapsidation of the AID protein with viral RNA and DNA provides an efficient environment for evaluating AID's RNA and DNA deamination activities. A bona fide RNA-editing enzyme, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide 1, induced a similar level of C-to-U mutations in nucleocapsid RNA as AID. Taken together, the results indicate that AID can deaminate the nucleocapsid RNA of HBV...|$|R
2500|$|The 5-HT2C receptors are G protein–coupled receptors {{that are}} coupled to {{phospholipase}} C (PLC) via Gαq, phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and possibly Gα13.

In addition, the activation of PLA2 also results in recruitment of a RhoA/PLD pathway through RhoA, an enzyme that regulates {{a wide spectrum of}} cellular functions through PLD (phospholipase D) target protein. The 5-HT2C receptors can also stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway which is activated by neurotrophins and other neuroactive chemicals. Production of these chemicals effects neuronal differentiation, survival, regeneration, and structural and functional plasticity. Early studies of the ERK pathway showed that mood stabilizers for the treatment of manic-depressive illness stimulated the pathway.

Even though mitochondrial genomes, which characterize eukaryotic cells, were first discovered more than 50 years ago, mitochon-drial genomics remains an important topic in molecular biology and genome sciences. The Phylum Alveolata comprises three major groups (ciliates, apicomplexans, and dinoflagellates), the mitochondrial genomes {{of which have}} diverged widely. Even though the genecontentofdinoflagellatemitochondrialgenomes is reportedly comparable to thatofapicomplexans, thehighly fragmentedand rearranged genome structures of dinoflagellates have frustrated whole genomic analysis. Consequently, noncoding sequences and gene arrangements of dinoflagellate mitochondrial genomes have not been well characterized. Here we report that the continuous assembled genome (~ 326 kb) of the dinoflagellate, Symbiodiniumminutum, is AT-rich (~ 64. 3 %) and that it contains three protein-coding genes. Based upon in silico analysis, the remaining 99 % of the genome comprises transcriptomic noncoding sequences. <b>RNA</b> <b>edited</b> sites and unique, possible start and stop codons clarify conserved regions among dinoflagellates.

No specific antivirals are currently available to treat HDV infection and antivirals against HBV do not ameliorate hepatitis D. Liver sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) was recently identified as a common entry receptor for HDV and HBV in cell cultures. Here we show HDV can infect mice expressing human NTCP (hNTCP-Tg). Antibodies against critical regions of HBV envelope proteins blocked HDV infection in the hNTCP-Tg mice.
