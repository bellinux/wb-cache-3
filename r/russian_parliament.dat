5|$|After {{the events}} of Bloody Sunday in January 1905 sparked a {{revolution}} in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to make concessions. In April 1905 a decree guaranteed complete freedom of religion, and even allowed religious studies to be conducted in native languages. The most important decree, the October Manifesto, was announced on October 30 (October 17 O.S.), 1905. It guaranteed many political rights, {{including the right to}} form political parties and organize convocations. This decree formed the legal basis for the assembly in Vilnius. The October Manifesto also announced the intent to hold elections to the <b>Russian</b> <b>Parliament</b> (Duma), and the Lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for the Seimas: they claimed that the Lithuanians needed to prepare themselves for this election.|$|E
5|$|The second {{operation}} provoked further anger {{from the}} Armenian government, which saw the operation as an encroachment against its sovereignty. Armenia's president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan {{claimed that the}} Soviet government was exacting retribution against his country for not {{taking part in the}} All-Union referendum by depopulating the towns. Reacting to media reports of unprovoked atrocities by the OMON, four members of the <b>Russian</b> <b>parliament</b> intervened on behalf of the Armenians, arriving in Voskepar on 15 May. Anatoly Shabad, the leading parliamentary member, secured the return of the captured Armenian policemen as the Soviet forces desisted from continuing {{out the rest of the}} operation.

25|$|At {{the crucial}} {{moments of the}} August Coup, arguably the last attempt by the Soviet hardliners to prevent {{the breakup of the}} state, some {{military}} units did enter Moscow to act against Boris Yeltsin but ultimately refused to crush the protesters surrounding the <b>Russian</b> <b>parliament</b> building.

25|$|Yeltsin {{claimed that}} by {{dissolving}} the <b>Russian</b> <b>parliament</b> in September 1993 he was clearing the tracks for a rapid {{transition to a}} functioning market economy. With this pledge, he received strong backing from the leading powers of the West. Yeltsin enjoyed a strong relationship with the Western powers, particularly the United States, but the relationship made him unpopular with some Russians. In Russia, the Yeltsin side had control over television, where hardly any pro-parliament views were expressed during the September–October crisis.|$|E

25|$|On July 9, 2000, while {{speaking}} to the <b>Russian</b> <b>Parliament,</b> Putin advocated an economy policy which would have introduced a flat tax rate of 13% {{and a reduction in}} the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 24 percent. Putin also intended for small businesses to get better treatment under this economic reform package. Under Putin, the old system which included high tax rates has been replaced with a new system where companies can choose either a 6 percent tax on gross revenue or a 15 percent tax on profits.|$|E
25|$|However, {{later that}} month, {{due to the}} world {{financial}} crisis, the <b>Russian</b> <b>Parliament's</b> Defence Committee stated that the Russian defence budget would instead be slashed by 15 percent, from $40 billion to $34 billion, with further cuts to come. On 5 May 2009, First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said that the defence budget for 2009 will be 1.3 trillion rubles (US$39.4 billion). 322 billion rubles are allocated to purchase weapons, {{and the rest of}} the fund will be spent on construction, fuel storage and food supply.|$|R

25|$|Further {{embarrassing}} {{facts about}} Soviet history were revealed in April, {{when the government}} admitted that the NKVD had carried out the infamous Katyn massacre of Polish army officers during World WarII; previously, the USSR had blamed Nazi Germany. More significantly for Gorbachev's position, Boris Yeltsin reached {{a new level of}} prominence, as he was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR in May, effectively making him the de jure leader of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Problems for Gorbachev once again came from the <b>Russian</b> <b>parliament</b> in June, when it declared the precedence of Russian laws over All-Union-level legislation.|$|E

The {{constitutional crisis}} reached a tipping point on September21, 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the Congress of People's Deputies and its Supreme Soviet), although the president did not have the power to dissolve the parliament according to the constitution.
