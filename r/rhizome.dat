5|$|The unusual {{characteristics}} that set it {{apart from other}} species in the genus include the woody <b>rhizome,</b> undivided styles, and the operculate pollen. Droseraregia shares other features with the robust Tasmanian form of D.arcturi, including the lack of stipules and petioles and the non-circinate growth of the scape.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the <b>rhizome</b> is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by <b>rhizome</b> division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E
25|$|Lily-of-the-valley (Convallaria majalis) has <b>rhizomes</b> {{that grow}} stolon-like stems called stoloniferous <b>rhizomes</b> or leptomorph <b>rhizomes.</b> A {{number of plants}} have stoloniferous <b>rhizomes</b> {{including}} Asters. These stolon-like <b>rhizomes</b> are long and thin, with long internodes and indeterminate growth with lateral buds at the node, which mostly remain dormant.|$|R

5|$|Togusa tracks {{down one}} of the missing children, now {{assigned}} to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a <b>rhizome</b> formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E

50|$|This {{competitive}} {{species is}} {{often found in}} large monotypic stands. It is mainly vegetative, spreading via systems of cordlike <b>rhizomes.</b> Shorter <b>rhizomes</b> produce tufts, clumps, and mats, and longer <b>rhizomes</b> form wide, matted colonies.|$|R
50|$|It has slender <b>rhizomes,</b> {{which are}} up to 1 cm in diameter. They do not have stolons, and new growths of <b>rhizomes,</b> are {{on the sides of}} the old <b>rhizomes.</b> They form tufts, and {{spreading}} plants.|$|R
50|$|The {{root system}} {{of a young}} plant {{initially}} forms white, fleshy <b>rhizomes,</b> up to 25 mm in dimension, in chains. Some <b>rhizomes</b> grow upward in the soil, then form a bulb-like structure from which new shoots and roots grow, and from the new roots, new <b>rhizomes</b> grow. Other <b>rhizomes</b> grow horizontally or downward, and form dark reddish-brown tubers or chains of tubers.|$|R

40|$|Leymus chinensis is a {{dominant}} {{species in the}} Inner Mongolia steppe, northern China. Plant growth in northern China grassland is often limited by low soil nitrogen availability. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate whether <b>rhizomes</b> of Leymus chinensis are involved in the contribution of N uptake. The N concentration, (15) N concentration and (15) N proportion in roots, <b>rhizomes</b> and shoots after 48 h exposure of roots (L(root)) and <b>rhizomes</b> (L(rhizo)) separately and roots and <b>rhizomes</b> together (L(r+r)) to 0. 1 mM (15) NH(4) (15) NO(3) solution were measured using root-splitting equipment and stable isotope ((15) N) techniques, respectively. The N content and dry mass were not affected by the labeling treatment. In contrast, the (15) N concentration in shoots, <b>rhizomes</b> and roots was significantly increased by the labeling in <b>rhizomes,</b> indicating that the inorganic nitrogen was absorbed via <b>rhizomes</b> from the solution and can be transported to other tissues, with preference to shoots rather than roots. Meanwhile, the absolute N absorption and translocation among compartments were also calculated. The N absorption via <b>rhizomes</b> was much smaller than via roots; however, the uptake efficiency per surface unit via <b>rhizomes</b> was greater than via roots. The capacity and high efficiency to absorb N nutrient via <b>rhizomes</b> enable plants to use transient nutrient supplies in the top soil surface. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
50|$|The {{cultivation}} {{and harvest}} practices {{are similar to}} that of common turmeric which is used in recipes. In the fields, the <b>rhizomes</b> are washed thoroughly and are placed in a wide mouthed cauldron. The water is poured in the cauldron such that the <b>rhizomes</b> are completely covered. The cauldron is covered with a lid, and the <b>rhizomes</b> are boiled for about 30 minutes until foam oozes out with a strong odour. The <b>rhizomes</b> are taken out when the water is reduced to one-third of the original and they are soft and their inner portion has turned from blue to dark or pale brown. The <b>rhizomes</b> are then dried in hot sun for10 to 15 days until hardened. These dried <b>rhizomes</b> are then packed for marketing.|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of active constituents (curcuminoids and volatile oil) in turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn.) <b>rhizomes</b> and zedoary [Curcuma zedoaria (Berg.) Roscoe] bulb and finger <b>rhizomes</b> during storage have been investigated. They were prepared as sliced and powdered and separately packed, either in black polyethylene bags or in paper bags, and stored {{at room temperature}} (28 - 31 oC). Samples at initial and three monthly intervals were examined over 12 - 15 months storage to determine the contents of curcuminoids, volatile oil and moisture. The results showed that storage of <b>rhizomes</b> in black polyethylene bags could prevent samples from taking up moisture better than those stored in paper bags. The sliced and powderedturmeric <b>rhizomes</b> exhibited no decrease in curcuminoids content after 15 months of storage irrespective {{of the nature of}} the packing material. However, the slices of zedoary (bulb and finger) <b>rhizomes</b> lost curcuminoids to a lesser extent than powdered <b>rhizomes</b> during storage period. Volatile oil content of turmeric <b>rhizomes,</b> zedoary (bulb and finger) <b>rhizomes</b> decreased slower when stored as slices rather than as powders. The result from the present study suggested that in order to maintain the quality of turmeric and zedoary <b>rhizomes</b> as raw material for food and medicinal uses, they should be prepared in sliced form and stored in black polyethylene bags in order to maintain their content of active constituents during storage period...|$|R
40|$|Wild ginger, Siphonochilus aethiopicus, is a {{traditional}} remedy {{for the treatment of}} allergic asthma and other conditions. Preparations include hot infusions of <b>rhizomes</b> and steaming of the <b>rhizomes</b> and inhalation of the vapour. Volatile compounds in the vapour phase (representing the fraction that is inhaled) of both (1) a hot water infusion of fresh and air dried <b>rhizomes</b> and of (2) <b>rhizomes</b> were concentrated by head space solid phase microextraction (H/S-SPME) and analysed by gas chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS). Eucalyptol (1, 8 -cineole) was the major compound present in the vapour phase of a hot water infusion of fresh and dried <b>rhizomes,</b> and was also present as one of three major compounds in the vapour phase of fresh <b>rhizomes.</b> The drying of <b>rhizomes</b> caused a significant loss of eucalyptol and other compounds. Eucalyptol reportedly controls airway mucus hypersecretion and asthma. As such the presence of eucalyptol in the vapour phase of hot preparations may contribute to the anecdotal effectiveness of S. aethiopicus as a decongestant and traditional remedy for the treatment of allergic asthma.
