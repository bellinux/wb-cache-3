Kerrang! editor James Mcmahon gave the album {{five out of}} five [...] "K"s, classing The Blackest Beautiful as a [...] "classic", praising the inclusion of producers Kit Walters and Stephen George.

(Reagan's football was still with the officer at the hospital, and Bush also had a card and football.) The participants discussed whether to raise the military's alert status, {{and the importance of}} doing so without changing the DEFCON level, although the number of Soviet submarines proved to be normal. Upon learning that Reagan was in surgery, Haig declared, the [...] "helm is <b>right</b> <b>here.</b> <b>And</b> that means right in this chair for now, constitutionally, until the vice president gets here." [...] However, Haig made an inaccurate statement. As the sitting Secretary of State, he was fourth behind Vice President [...] Bush, [...] Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and President pro tempore of the Senate Strom Thurmond in the line of succession and, under , O'Neill and Thurmond would have had to resign their positions to become acting president. Although others in the room knew that Haig's statement was constitutionally incorrect, they did not object at the time to avoid a confrontation.|$|E

2500|$|Meyer {{decided to}} include the {{pregnancy}} in her story while she was researching vampires, early in 2003, and came across {{the legend of the}} incubus, a demon who could father children. Bella's insistence to not let her child die was inspired by Meyer's reaction when asked if she would let one of her children die so she could live, which was to deliver the child no matter what the consequences were. Meyer {{said in an interview with}} Shannon Hale, published in , that the birth scene published is a little less grotesque than the one she wrote before editing due to her editor, agent and publisher's requests to [...] "tone down the violence a little". She stated that Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, for her, were [...] "a way to kind of explore that concept of what childbirth used to be" [...] in the past and acknowledged that they were [...] "taking Bella in a new direction that wasn't [...] relatable for a lot of people." [...] Concerning the subject of the relatability of Bella, Meyer admitted that she lost some of her relatability to the character when she became a vampire and said, [...] "every point up until that point in the story [...] I would say I could step into this story <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> I could do everything she could do which made it really fun." [...] Meyer wanted to experience Bella's vampiric experiences and [...] "enjoyed very much" [...] writing about them and wanted to end the book from her perspective, but still thought it was [...] "a little bit harder" [...] as she couldn't step in into the story anymore.|$|E
