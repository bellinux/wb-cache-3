The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Establishment</b> of the United Kingdom in relation to its EU membership, and as a consequence the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004.

2500|$|In {{regard to}} companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could {{restrict}} a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax {{bills in the}} UK. The UK {{did not need to}} justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in legal standards, like the US state of Delaware, which is argued to attract companies with the worst standards of accountability, and unreasonably low corporate tax. Appearing to meet the concern, in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany, simply because it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes. But in this case denial of capacity went too far: it was an [...] "outright negation" [...] of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment.</b> Setting a further limit, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice held that because corporations are created by law, they must be subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy, while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.|$|E

50|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} TEC {{articles}} 43 and 48 precluded German courts denying legal capacity to companies like Überseering BV, {{because it was}} fundamental that states recognised companies incorporated abroad, regardless of whether member states had conventions on mutual recognition of companies under article 293. Despite change in ownership, Überseering BV was still a valid company in the Netherlands. There was no countervailing justification by any overriding requirements relating to the general interest to not uphold the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Because limited {{liability}} generally prevents shareholders, directors or employees being sued, the Companies Acts {{have sought to}} regulate the company's use of its capital in at least four ways. [...] "Capital" [...] refers to the economic value of a company's assets, such as money, buildings, or equipment. First, and most controversially, the Companies Act 2006 section 761, following the EU's Second Company Law Directive, requires that when a public company begins to trade it has a minimum of £50,000 promised to be paid up by the shareholders. After that, the capital can be spent. This is a largely irrelevant sum for almost any public company, and although the first Companies Acts required it, since 1862 {{there has been no}} similar provision for a private company. Nevertheless, a number of EU member states kept minimum capital rules for their private companies, until recently. In 1999, in Centros Ltd v Erhvervs- og Selskabsstyrelsen the European Court of Justice held that a Danish minimum capital rule for private companies was a disproportionate infringement of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> for businesses in the EU. A UK private limited company was refused registration by the Danish authorities, but it was held that the refusal was unlawful because the minimum capital rules did not proportionately achieve the aim of protecting creditors. Less restrictive means could achieve the same goal, such as allowing creditors to contract for guarantees. This led a large number of businesses in countries with minimum capital rules, like France and Germany, to begin incorporating as a UK [...] "Ltd". France abolished its minimum capital requirement for the SARL in 2003, and Germany created a form of GmbH without minimum capital in 2008. However, while the Second Company Law Directive is not amended, the rules remain in place for public companies.|$|E

He was soon thereafter deported to Dublin, where his wife was working, where he remained for six months.

5000|$|The art company [...] "Inspire Art Ltd" [...] {{claimed that}} the Dutch law {{requirement}} for a minimum capital {{to operate in the}} Netherlands was an unjustified restriction on its <b>right</b> to freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> (now under TFEU article 49).

It wished to carry out business in the Netherlands, running an Amsterdam art studio.

50|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} without any {{applicable}} EU legislation, {{the question of}} whether a company formed under one member state's law could transfer its registered office to another without losing legal personality was a question of national law. The question of whether the company's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> was restricted only arose under article 43 if it could be established that the company actually had a right to that freedom. This was determined by normal law. On the one hand a company seat change may result in changing applicable national law, and there a barrier to conversion was prohibited under TEC article 43 unless it is shown that the restriction is in the public interest. On the other hand, a company could wish, as here, to change its seat without changing national law, but that would be within the discretion of the national law in question.|$|R

5000|$|Myrie v State of Barbados 2013 CCJ 3 (OJ): The Court {{held that}} CARICOM {{nationals}} {{had a right}} to free movement within the Caribbean Community, specifically a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> entry without any form of harassment or impediment, based on the combined effect of Article 45 of the Revised Treaty and a Decision of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community taken at their Twenty-Eighth Meeting in 2007 (“the 2007 Conference Decision”). The Court noted that the 2007 Conference Decision was another step in furthering the fundamental goal of granting Community nationals the right to unrestricted access to, and movement within, the jurisdiction of Member States, subject to public interest considerations. The 2007 Conference Decision entitled every Community national to a “definite entry” of six months upon arrival in another Member State. The Court further noted that both the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> and <b>of</b> the provision of services, including services in the tourism sector, presume <b>of</b> necessity the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> movement of Community nationals without being obstructed by unreasonable restrictions. The Court further held that where a Community national is refused entry into a Member State on a legitimate ground, that national should {{be given the opportunity to}} consult an attorney or a consular official of his or her country or to contact a family member; and that Member States are required to give, promptly and in writing, the reasons for refusing entry to the Community national and to inform the refused national of his or her right to challenge the decision.
