40|$|Intact human {{erythrocytes}} were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA) or dimethyladipimidate (DMA) {{and tested}} {{for their ability}} to bind [125 I]-IgG anti-Rh 0 (D) and to undergo antibody-mediated hemagglutination. There was no decrease in antibody binding after treatment with GA concentrations up to 1. 25 % and DMA concentrations up to 1 %. Red cells treated with these concentrations of GA and DMA did not agglutinate. The techniques employed to induce agglutination of the cross-linked red cells involved "incomplete" IgG anti-Rho (D) in albumin, "complete" IgM anti-D <b>Rho</b> (<b>D)</b> in saline, and the antiglobulin (Coombs) reaction. The agglutinability of the chemically modified red cells was inversely correlated with the extent of fixation. The dissociation of antibody binding from agglutinability in cross-linked erythrocytes suggests that <b>Rho</b> (<b>D)</b> antigen mobility is required for red cell agglutination. Antigen mobility was manifested by the transition from a relatively monodisperse distribution pattern of <b>Rho</b> (<b>D)</b> antigen sites to one of large aggregates or clusters when agglutination was induced by IgM anti-Rho (D), IgG anti-Rho (D) agglutination of protease modified red cells, and by anti-IgG agglutination of IgG anti-Rho (D) -coated red cells. Antigen clustering was not as prominent in red cells agglutinated by IgG anti-Rho (D) in the presence of albumin. Even though antigen mobility is a prerequisite for antibody-mediated hemagglutination, clustering {{does not appear to be}} an absolute requirement. The degree of antigen clustering differs with varying types of agglutination...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of simple regression relationships, based on finite element (FEM) analyses of cutting a sandy loam soil by medium-deep subsoiler will provide confidential and quick tools {{to predict the}} subsoiler draught requirement for any combination of moisture content (w), wet bulk density (rho (w)) and tillage depth (d). Large number of FEM analyses were performed to assess the effect of w, d and rho (w) on subsoiler draught. This draught was calculated from the output of 126 FEM modelling analyses. The model variations were selected based on the interaction among the studied variables, namely, six moisture contents ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 22 m(3) m(- 3), five wet bulk densities ranging from 1. 3 to 2. 0 Mg/m(3) and six tillage depths ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 37 m. The interaction among these three variables was also taken into consideration, and a multiple linear regression analysis was performed aiming at establishing a mathematical relationship for simulating the draught variation {{as a function of}} these variables. Further relationship was developed for relating the variation in draught with iv, d and dry bulk density (<b>rho</b> (<b>d))</b> The FEM showed that subsoiler draught increased with d, rho (w) and <b>rho</b> (<b>d),</b> whereas it decreased with w. The decrease in draught with w did not extend beyond a w of 0. 17 m(3) m(- 3), since the draught calculated for 0. 22 m(3) m(- 3) w was very close to that calculated for a w of 0. 17 m(3) m(- 3). Regression equations developed to relate the subsoiler draught with w, d, rho (w) and <b>rho</b> (<b>d)</b> were of quite simple forms, and had high determination coefficients (R- 2) close to 0. 95. These equations indicated that the horizontal force varied linearly with w and non-linearly with d, rho (w) and <b>rho</b> (<b>d).</b> This non-linear variation of draught was found to be a quadratic function of d and rho (w) and a cubic function of <b>rho</b> (<b>d).</b> A comparison of the calculated and measured draught for cutting a similar sandy loam soil with a similarly designed subsoiler, showed a good approximation. The small divergence between the calculated and measured draught was attributed to the difference in soil texture and subsoiler chisel length. Thus, the regression equation developed proved to be a capable tool of predicting the draught requirements of the selected tillage tool design, when cutting sandy loam soils under any combination of w, d and rho (w).

Assuming the molten salt system to be a quasi-harmonic oscillator, the authors have found that the integrated intensity of the spectra increases with temperature at rates that exceed those anticipated for first-order scattering. The spectral variation of the intensity shows that the excess scattering, due mainly to second-order summation or difference bands, occurs in the low-frequency region (up to 80 cm- 1) and the high-frequency tail (above 150 cm- 1).

When hematopoietic cell lines are induced to differentiate, the expression of D 4 is modulated. Thus, D 4 appears to be a developmentally regulated gene. Its preferential expression in hematopoietic cells indicates that D 4 likely plays some significant role in the growth and differentiation processes of hematopoietic cells.

40|$|Abstract. Embedding {{an element}} of a finite field into {{auxiliary}} groups such as elliptic curve groups or extension fields of finite fields has been useful tool for analysis of cryptographic problems such as establishing the equivalence between the discrete logarithm problem and Diffie-Hellman problem or solving the discrete logarithm problem with auxiliary inputs (DLPwAI).

40|$|The {{spectral}} functor of an ergodic {{action of}} a compact quantum group G on a unital C*-algebra is quasitensor, {{in the sense}} that the tensor product of two spectral subspaces is isometrically contained in the spectral subspace of the tensor product representation, and the inclusion maps satisfy natural properties. We show that any quasitensor *-functor from Rep(G) to the category of Hilbert spaces is the spectral functor of an ergodic action of G on a unital C*-algebra. As an application, we associate an ergodic G-action on a unital C*-algebra to an inclusion of Rep(G) into an abstract tensor C*-category J. If the inclusion arises from a quantum subgroup K of G, the associated G-system is just the quotient space K. If G is a group and J has permutation symmetry, the associated G-system is commutative, and therefore isomorphic to the classical quotient space by a subgroup of G. If a tensor C*-category has a Hecke symmetry making an object <b>rho</b> of dimension <b>d</b> and mu-determinant 1, then there is an ergodic action of S mu U(d) on a unital C*-algebra having the (i, rho(r)) as its spectral subspaces.

To determine if a alpha-MD IgG binds to the D-antigen receptor, D-positive red cells were sensitized with alpha-MD and [125 I]anti-D IgG spearately and with both IgG preparations. The cell-bound radioactivity served to identify what proportion of the total ferritin-labeled IgG sites were due to anti-D. With nonsaturating concentrations of anti-D the number of IgG sites observed was equal to the sum of the sites found when the red cell was sensitized separately with alpha-MD and anti-D IgG. With saturating concentrations of anti-D there was a reduction in the expected number of IgG sites, indicating that alpha-MD IgG was excluded from binding. There was no comparable interaction of alpha-MD IgG and anti-D IgG when D-negative red cells were used. The results obtained indicate that alpha-MD IgG does not bind to the D antigen. The interaction between alpha-MD IgG and anti-D IgG for binding sites on the red cell membrane {{may be due to the}} close physical proximity of the two receptors, so as to produce steric hindrance in binding of the two IgG preparations when both are present.

Symmetry about an axis parallel to the initial magnetic field direction has been assumed, so that the calculations could be performed on a two-dimensional grid.

We tested 25 workers (20 males) and 25 controls with no history of chronic exposure to solvents (10 males). All participants had normal ophthalmologic exams. Subjects had worked in gas stations on an average of 9. 6 +/- 6. 2 years. Color vision was evaluated with the Lanthony D 15 d and Cambridge Colour Test (CCT). Visual field assessment consisted of white-on-white 24 - 2 automatic perimetry (Humphrey II- 750 i). Contrast sensitivity was measured for sinusoidal gratings of 0. 2, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 5. 0, 10. 0 and 20. 0 cycles per degree (cpd). Results from both groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The number of errors in the D 15 d was higher for workers relative to controls (p< 0. 01). Their CCT color discrimination thresholds were elevated compared to the control group along the protan, deutan and tritan confusion axes (p< 0. 01), and their ellipse area and ellipticity were higher (p< 0. 01). Genetic analysis of subjects with very elevated color discrimination thresholds excluded congenital causes for the visual losses. Automated perimetry thresholds showed elevation in the 9 degrees, 15 degrees and 21 degrees of eccentricity (p< 0. 01) and in MD and PSD indexes (p< 0. 01). Contrast sensitivity losses were found for all spatial frequencies measured (p< 0. 01) except for 0. 5 cpd. Significant correlation was found between previous working years and deutan axis thresholds (rho = 0. 59; p< 0. 05), indexes of the Lanthony D 15 <b>d</b> (<b>rho</b> = 0. 52; p< 0. 05), perimetry results in the fovea (rho = - 0. 51; p< 0. 05) and at 3, 9 and 15 degrees of eccentricity (rho = - 0. 46; p< 0. 05).

40|$|Simplified {{equations}} {{are derived}} for a granular {{flow in the}} `dense' limit where the volume fraction is close to that for dynamical arrest, and the `shallow' limit where the stream-wise length for flow development (L) is large compared with the cross-stream height (h). The mass and diameter of the particles are set equal to 1 in the analysis without loss of generality. In the dense limit, the equations are simplified {{by taking advantage of}} the power-law divergence of the pair distribution function chi proportional to (phi(ad) - phi) (-alpha), and a faster divergence of the derivativ rho(d chi/d <b>rho)</b> similar to (<b>d</b> chi/d phi), where rho and phi are the density and volume fraction, and phi(ad) is the volume fraction for arrested dynamics. When the height h is much larger than the conduction length, the energy equation reduces to an algebraic balance between the rates of production and dissipation of energy, and the stress is proportional to the square of the strain rate (Bagnold law). In the shallow limit, the stress reduces to a simplified Bagnold stress, where all components of the stress are proportional to (partial derivative u(x) /partial derivative y) (2), which is the cross-stream (y) derivative of the stream-wise (x) velocity. In the simplified equations for dense shallow flows, the inertial terms are neglected in the y momentum equation in the shallow limit because the are O(h/L) smaller than the divergence of the stress. The resulting model contains two equations, a mass conservation equations which reduces to a solenoidal condition on the velocity in the incompressible limit, and a stream-wise momentum equation which contains just one parameter B which is a combination of the Bagnold coefficients and their derivatives with respect to volume fraction. The leading-order dense shallow flow equations, as well as the first correction due to density variations, are analysed for two representative flows. The first is the development from a plug flow to a fully developed Bagnold profile for the flow down an inclined plane. The analysis shows that the flow development length is ((rho) over barh(3) /B), where (rho) over bar is the mean density, and this length is numerically estimated from previous simulation results. The second example is the development of the boundary layer {{at the base of the}} flow when a plug flow (with a slip condition at the base) encounters a rough base, in the limit where the momentum boundary layer thickness is small compared with the flow height. Analytical solutions can be found only when the stream-wise velocity far from the surface varies as x(F), where x is the stream-wise distance from the start of the rough base and F is an exponent. The boundary layer thickness increases as (l(2) x) (1 / 3) for all values of F, where the length scale l = root 2 B/(rho) over bar. The analysis reveals important differences between granular flows and the flows of Newtonian fluids. The Reynolds number (ratio of inertial and viscous terms) turns out to depend only on the layer height and Bagnold coefficients, and is independent of the flow velocity, because both the inertial terms in the conservation equations and the divergence of the stress depend on the square of the velocity/velocity gradients. The compressibility number (ratio of the variation in volume fraction and mean volume fraction) is independent of the flow velocity and layer height, and depends only on the volume fraction and Bagnold coefficients...|$|R
