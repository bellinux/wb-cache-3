40|$|Owing to {{noticeable}} differences {{of the characters}} between the electrical and the conventional gasoline-powered motorcycles, such as heavier in weight, lower in mass center position and slower in forward speed, the control and design considerations of the electrical motorcycles {{are not the same}} as conventional motorcycles. In this paper, the rider upper body lean control system is considered as the only control action to analyze and simulate the stability and the perception of <b>riding</b> <b>comfort</b> of the rider-motorcycle system in different riding conditions and parameter designs. The equations of lateral motion of an electrical motorcycle, which includes the rider upper body leaning motion, are derived first from Newton mechanics. Via this dynamics model and its associated transfer functions at various speeds, perception of <b>riding</b> <b>comfort</b> is defined as the damping ratio of frequency domain Bode plots in classical control theory. By the analysis, we find that the tendency of the stability is the same under the straight-line and the cornering motions, but shows significant differences for different parameter designs of the electrical motorcycle. We discuss the effect on the perception of <b>riding</b> <b>comfort</b> issue for changing mass center position, total weight of the motorcycle, the wheelbase, the front fork rake angle and the front wheel trail distance of the motorcycle. On the premise of the stability, we use the maximum damping ratio to represent the riding response of the motorcycle to find the best perception of <b>riding</b> <b>comfort.</b> By the analysis results, if we move the mass center forward, shorten the wheelbase, steepen the front fork rake angle and shorten the front wheel trail distance of the current design of electrical motorcycles in the market, a better perception of <b>riding</b> <b>comfort</b> is achieved. From the user's point of view, our analysis method of perception of <b>riding</b> <b>comfort</b> can be a supplement to the analysis of the stability of motorcycles...|$|R

2500|$|In 1956, the Rover Company held {{talks with}} Spanish {{engineering}} company 'Metalúrgica de Santa Ana S.A.'

2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was <b>ride</b> <b>comfort,</b> especially with the Z51 performance and handling package. The C4 did not use separate body-on-frame construction like its predecessors. [...] Instead, it used what GM termed a [...] "uniframe", which consisted of a traditional perimeter frame, with the door posts, windshield frame, halo, and the rear portion of the floor pan integrated into one welded assembly. [...] This was not a [...] unibody assembly, as none of the exterior body panels were structural members. [...] Due to a styling decision to use a targa top instead of T-tops, there was no structural member tying the windshield frame to the halo as on the C3. [...] This required extremely tall side rails on the frame to maintain chassis rigidity, and as a result, the door sills were quite deep, with entry and exit likened by contemporary auto journals to a [...] "fall in and climb out" [...] experience. [...] The targa top bolted into place, becoming a structural component, rather than simply latching on like T-tops. [...] Despite the tall frame rails, the C4 was prone to rattles and squeaks, especially with the targa top removed. [...] The emergency brake, located between the door sill and the drivers seat, was moved lower and toward the rear of the car in 1988 for easier entry and exit.|$|E
