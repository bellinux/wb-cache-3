The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the role of inhibition capacities (prepotent response inhibition and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference),</b> negative affect, and gender in this self-regulatory failure. One hundred thirteen partici- pants completed two tasks assessing prepotent response inhibition and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference,</b> as well as questionnaires measuring procrastination and trait negative affect. Three profiles of inhibitors were iden- tified through cluster analysis: the first had good capacities in both prepotent response inhibition and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference,</b> the second had good capacities in resisting proactive interference but lower capacities in inhibiting prepotent response, and the third had good capacities in inhibiting prepotent response but lower capacities in resisting proactive interference.

40|$|A four {{experiment}} {{investigation was}} carried out into two types of inhibitory control {{and whether or not}} they were involved in mental arithmetic division. Previous research had either focussed on the central executive component of working memory as a single entity or split this component into response selection, memory updating, input monitoring and inhibition and has examined how these components relate to addition, subtraction and multiplication. The first two experiments reported here represent an attempt to split inhibition into two separate abilities, namely prepotent response inhibition and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> distracter <b>interference</b> and investigate how they might relate to complex division. The Two experiments were loosely based on the Stop-Signal Task and the Eriksen Flanker Task, respectively. Experiment One followed a 3 x 3 x 3 factorial design whereas Experiment Two was a 3 x 2 design. All factors were varied entirely within-subjects. The results suggested a major rôle in mental division for both types of inhibition and some results were unexpected. The results of Experiment Two suggested a speed-accuracy trade-off as an effect of the flanker digits. Experiment Three was designed to extract the short division procedure from the division process. Experiment Four was created to extract the carrying procedure. The results suggested a rôle for both prepotent response inhibition and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> distracter <b>interference</b> in monitoring the procedural aspects of complex division. Only <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> distracter <b>interference</b> had a rôle in monitoring magnitudes of short-division and carry-values. The speed-accuracy trade-off apparent in Experiment Two may, at least in part, be as a result of the involvement of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> distracter <b>interference</b> in preventing <b>interference</b> with regard <b>to</b> carry procedures and the value of the carry.

40|$|Inhibition {{is often}} {{conceptualized}} as a unitary construct reflecting {{the ability to}} ignore and suppress irrelevant information. At the same time, it has been subdivided into inhibition of prepotent responses (i. e., the ability to stop dominant responses) and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> distracter <b>interference</b> (i. e., the ability to ignore distracting information). The present study investigated the unity and diversity of inhibition as a psychometric construct, and tested the hypothesis of an inhibition deficit in older age.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{depressed}} patients have difficulties to retrieve specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words (see Williams et al., 2007, for a review). Compared to controls, depressed patients tend to retrieve relatively more memories that summarize categories of events (e. g., when I go for a hike) rather than memories that refer to a single episode (e. g., when I stood on top of mount Kilimanjaro, in response to happy). This memory phenomenon is called reduced autobiographical memory specificity (rAMS) or overgeneral memory (OGM). Other research has shown that depressed individuals may experience intrusive memories (e. g., Patel et al., 2007). These are very specific, involuntary, disturbing memories. Up to now, it is unclear how this paradoxical co-occurrence of rAMS (during voluntary memory retrieval) and very specific intrusive memories (during spontaneous, involuntary memory retrieval) in depressed patients can be understood. The starting point of the current dissertation was the exploration of the role of rumination as a potential explanation for this paradox. Rumination refers to repetitively thinking about the causes, meanings, and consequences of certain feelings or cognitions. It seems a likely candidate for explaining the paradox because several studies have indicated that rumination leads to rAMS (see Sumner, 2012, for a recent review), and other {{studies have shown}} that rumination also triggers intrusive memories (e. g., Watkins, 2004). Twelve studies were conducted. A recurrent finding across several of these studies was that rumination and intrusive memories are clearly associated. Furthermore, I consistently found that rumination and intrusive memories were associated with depressive symptoms. The first three chapters focus on these robust findings. In Chapter 1 and 2, three studies in non-clinical samples are presented. Chapter 3 contains a review paper. In this review paper, the concepts of rumination and intrusive memories are clarified, an overview of studies investigating rumination and intrusive memories is presented, and a theoretical account for how rumination may lead to intrusive memories is proposed. In contrast to the repeated observation that rumination and intrusive memories are associated, I failed to observe a reliable relationship between (trait-) rumination and rAMS in any of my studies (Chapter 4). I additionally aimed to examine the role of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference</b> in relation <b>to</b> rumination, overgeneral memories, and intrusive memories. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference</b> refers <b>to</b> the executive ability <b>to</b> ignore <b>interference</b> of previously relevant but currently irrelevant cognitions (Friedman & Miyake, 2004). Research shows that impaired executive functioning is related to rAMS (see Sumner, 2012, for a recent review), and that weak <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference</b> is associated with more intrusive memories of a laboratory stressor (e. g., Verwoerd, Wessel, de Jong, Nieuwenhuis, & Huntjens, 2011). These combined findings suggest that weak <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference</b> may be another important player in the paradoxical co-occurrence of rAMS and intrusive memories. In Chapter 5, I present evidence that weak <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference</b> is related <b>to</b> rAMS in students as well as in depressed patients. Weak <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference</b> was, however, not related to rumination, intrusive memories, and depressive symptoms. Chapter 6 presents a study in pregnant women on the role of rumination, intrusive memories, rAMS, and weak <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference</b> in predicting prospective levels of depressive symptoms. Results showed that rumination during pregnancy could reliably predict postpartum depressive symptoms. In addition, my findings suggested that experiencing intrusive memories might be a risk factor for developing depressive symptoms. Somewhat counter to predictions, rAMS during pregnancy was related to lower levels of postpartum depressive symptoms, which may suggest a protective role of rAMS. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> proactive <b>interference</b> during pregnancy could not predict postpartum depressive symptoms, but may render women vulnerable for developing delivery-related intrusive memories. To test the causal hypothesis that rumination underlies both rAMS and intrusive memories, four experiments were conducted in which a ruminative versus non-ruminative thinking style were induced (Chapter 7). However, these experiments yielded mixed and inconclusive results. These seven chapters are preceded by a general introduction and followed by a general discussion. The general introduction contains a brief background with respect to the research questions and aims. In the general discussion, the associations between all key variables are discussed one by one in the light of their theoretical and clinical implications. status: publishe...|$|R
