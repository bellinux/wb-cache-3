25|$|The Outlaw (1943) was {{completed}} in 1941 and featured Jane Russell. It also received considerable attention from industry censors, this time owing to Russell's revealing costumes. Hughes designed a special bra for his leading lady, although <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> it was uncomfortable and decided against wearing it.|$|E
25|$|Russell next {{appeared}} in August Rush, released in November 2007. She also {{appeared on the}} cover of the New York Posts Page Six magazine on November 11, 2007. Russell later {{appeared in}} Bedtime Stories. In an appearance on The View on December 15, 2008, <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> she got the part because Adam Sandler's wife Jackie had seen her in Waitress and suggested her for the movie. Russell voiced Wonder Woman in a direct-to-video animated feature released March 3, 2009.|$|E

500|$|Marshall's {{performance}} {{received a}} positive response from Passions cast members, while her exit {{was the subject of}} criticism. Ross felt that Marshall had the most demanding role on the soap opera, and commended her ability to make [...] "Liz want to have sex {{in the middle of the}} tsunami" [...] look believable. During the filming of the show, Ross said she used to watch Marshall and take notes on how to improve her own acting. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ross criticized the decision to remove Marshall, and said, [...] "When you're an actress of her caliber and kind to everyone and plan Christmas parties and celebrate everyone's birthday and know your lines and are the most darling girl that ever breathed, of course you're going to be fired!" [...] Rodney Van Johnson, who portrayed T. C. <b>Russell,</b> <b>said</b> that he was disappointed when the show began removing its racially diverse actors, feeling that it was a sign of its imminent cancellation.|$|E
500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus <b>Russell,</b> <b>said</b> in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1992, MC Serch, whose group 3rd Bass had dissolved, {{began working}} on a solo project and {{approached}} Nas. At the suggestion of producer T-Ray, Serch collaborated with Nas for [...] "Back to the Grill", the lead single for Serch's 1992 solo debut album Return of the Product. At the recording session for the song, Serch discovered that Nas {{did not have a}} recording contract and subsequently contacted Faith Newman, an A executive at Sony Music Entertainment. As Serch recounted, [...] "Nas was in a position where his demo had been sittin' around, 'Live at the Barbeque' was already a classic, and he was just tryin' to find a decent deal ... So when he gave me his demo, I shopped it around. I took it to Russell first, <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> it sounded like G Rap, he wasn't wit' it. So I took it to Faith. Faith loved it, she said she'd been looking for Nas {{for a year and a}} half. They wouldn't let me leave the office without a deal on the table." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{members of}} the online Star Trek {{community}} complained about the addition of Seven of Nine (Seven) to the show before the season premiere, referring to Voyager as [...] "Melrose Space". The nickname amused Ryan, who hoped the fans would be won over {{during the course of}} the season. Once the episodes started to air for the first time, Ryan's [...] character increased in popularity amongst the fan base. Two months after the start of the season, Ryan attended her first science fiction convention; she was overwhelmed by the fan response. The critics credited Seven's presence on Voyager as a significant [...] improvement, with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluding that Voyager had [...] "finally...found its groove". Writing for Dreamwatch, Gary <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> that Ryan's character worked well on the season from her first appearance. However, the Boston Herald argued that the show had swapped [...] "sci-fi for sex appeal" [...] during the fourth season, but acknowledged Ryan was a good actress. It gave the season three out of five stars at the time of the DVD release.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, Beiderbecke {{enrolled at}} the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. His stint in academia was even briefer than his time in Detroit, however. When he attempted to pack his course schedule with music, his guidance counselor forced him instead to take religion, ethics, physical education, and military training. It was an institutional blunder that Benny Green described as being, in retrospect, [...] "comical," [...] "fatuous," [...] and [...] "a parody." [...] Beiderbecke promptly began to skip classes, and after he participated in a drunken bar fight, he was expelled. That summer he played with his friends Don Murray and Howdy Quicksell at a lake resort in Michigan. The band was run by Goldkette, and it put Beiderbecke in touch with another musician he had met before: the C-melody saxophone player Frankie Trumbauer. The two hit it off, both personally and musically, despite Trumbauer having been warned by other musicians: [...] "Look out, he's trouble. He drinks and you'll {{have a hard time}} handling him." [...] They were inseparable for {{much of the rest of}} Beiderbecke's career, with Trumbauer acting as a father figure to Beiderbecke. When Trumbauer organized a band for an extended run at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, Beiderbecke joined him. There he also played alongside the clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, who praised Beiderbecke's ability to drive the band. [...] "He more or less made you play whether you wanted to or not," [...] <b>Russell</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "If you had any talent at all he made you play better." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Howard Hughes's RKO {{production}} The French Line (1954), the movie's penultimate moment showed Russell in a form-fitting one-piece {{bathing suit}} with strategic cutouts, performing a then-provocative musical number titled [...] "Lookin' for Trouble". In her autobiography, <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> that the revealing outfit was {{an alternative to}} Hughes' original suggestion of a bikini, a very racy choice for a movie costume in 1954. <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> that she initially wore the bikini {{in front of her}} [...] "horrified" [...] movie crew while [...] "feeling very naked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stage three: trust-building – Trust-building is {{for couples}} who decided {{they wanted to}} stay {{together}} and make their marriage work. [...] In this stage, [...] "showing commitment to the relationship was most important for injured parties to begin forgiving and building trust," [...] <b>Russell</b> <b>said.</b> Couples in this stage need to take responsibility and participate in forgiveness.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about her}} sex appeal, <b>Russell</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Sex appeal is good - {{but not in}} bad taste. Then it's ugly. I don't think a star has any {{business}} posing in a vulgar way. I've seen plenty of pin-up pictures that have sex appeal, interest, and allure, but they're not vulgar. They have a little art to them. Marilyn's calendar was artistic." ...|$|E

5000|$|Around that time, amid {{a review}} of the four local {{newspaper}} companies competing in the Framingham area, The Boston Globe gave the paper credit for wide-ranging coverage of foreign, national, local, sports, arts and lifestyle news, but Tab Communications publisher <b>Russell</b> Pergament <b>said</b> his daily competition left a niche for his community papers: ...|$|R
2500|$|Three Kings {{was filmed}} in {{the deserts of}} Casa Grande, Arizona, California and Mexico, {{with many of the}} extras played by actual Iraqi refugees. According to Russell, two of the cast members had [...] "personally defaced 300 murals of Saddam." [...] After one of the {{military}} advisers to the film died during production, <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> the death was [...] "perhaps due to chemicals he was exposed to in the Gulf." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, it is {{in foreign}} affairs that Palmerston is chiefly remembered. Palmerston's {{principal}} aim in foreign policy was to advance the national interests of England. Palmerston is famous for his patriotism. Lord John <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "his heart always beat for the honour of England". Palmerston believed it was in Britain's interests that liberal governments be established on the Continent. He also practised brinkmanship and bluff in that {{he was prepared to}} threaten war to achieve Britain's interests.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Warner Bros., {{feeling the}} film had become {{relevant}} again {{due to the}} Iraq War, decided to re-release it in theaters and on DVD. Having no additional footage to add, Russell instead shot Soldiers Pay, a short documentary about the Iraq War, to accompany the film. Taking its name from William Faulkner's first novel {{of the same name}} about an airman's return home in World War I's aftermath, <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> the documentary examined [...] "both sides of the war, people who feel good about the war, who believe in the mission, people who feel bad." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Bob Cousy {{is often}} {{considered}} the originator of the behind-the-back dribble, Davies actually deserves the credit.

2500|$|Russell penned {{the script}} with several actors in mind. Although Spike Jonze had never {{acted in a}} film before, Russell wrote the part of Conrad Vig {{specifically}} for him, and the two practised Conrad's Southern accent over the phone while Jonze directed his first feature film, Being John Malkovich. Although Russell had to convince a wary Warner Bros. to cast an inexperienced actor in such a large role, he eventually won out. <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> Jonze's lack of previous acting work was beneficial to the film, citing the [...] "chaos that a nonactor brings to the set...he really shakes things up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent to}} which The Gospel in Brief {{influenced}} Wittgenstein {{can be seen in}} the Tractatus, in the unique way both books number their sentences. 1916 Wittgenstein read Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov so often that he knew whole passages of it by heart, particularly the speeches of the elder Zosima, who represented for him a powerful Christian ideal, a holy man [...] "who could see directly into the souls of other people." [...] Iain King has suggested his writing changed substantially in 1916, when he started confronting much greater dangers. [...] <b>Russell</b> <b>said</b> he returned from the war a changed man, one with a deeply mystical and ascetic attitude.|$|E
2500|$|In March of the 2010 offseason, NBC Sports {{described}} Russell as [...] "annually {{and incredibly}} overweight", saying Russell, often criticized for a perceived lack of conditioning, arrived at mini-camp weighing 290 pounds, {{up from his}} initially reported weight of 271. By April, National Football Post reported him at 300 pounds. However, Cam Inman of the Oakland Tribune said that Russell had [...] "a good first minicamp" [...] and [...] "is in great shape" [...] in the team's first training camp in late April.
