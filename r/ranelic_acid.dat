5000|$|Strontium ranelate, a strontium(II) salt of <b>ranelic</b> <b>acid,</b> is a {{medication}} for osteoporosis marketed as Protelos or Protos by Servier. Studies indicate {{it can also}} slow the course of osteoarthritis of the knee. The drug is unusual in that it both increases deposition of new bone by osteoblasts and reduces the resorption of bone by osteoclasts. It is therefore promoted as a [...] "dual action bone agent" [...] (DABA).|$|E
30|$|Strontium {{ranelate}} is {{a molecule}} that contains two atoms of strontium linked to <b>ranelic</b> <b>acid.</b> Treatment with strontium ranelate is effective at {{reducing the risk}} of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Strontium ranelate has been evaluated in two clinical trials with durations of 5  years—with the main analysis carried out after 3  years—involving more than 7000 women. The results at 3  years showed that the drug reduced the risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures (in a high-risk subgroup) by 41, 16, and 36 %, respectively. The results at 5  years confirmed the results observed in the first 3  years. The drug modestly increases bone formation markers (ca. 15 %) while simultaneously reducing those of bone resorption (10 – 15 %) [145, 146].|$|E
30|$|Another type of drug {{recently}} developed for osteoporosis treatment is strontium (Sr) ranelate (SRAN) [14 – 16]. This drug is a salt {{consisting of two}} atoms of stable strontium (Sr 2 +) and an organic acid (<b>Ranelic</b> <b>acid),</b> and it is usually administrated orally [17, 18]. Sr ions possess a high affinity to hydroxyapatite (HA) [19], and in contrast to bisphosphonates that decrease bone resorption, Sr exerts a dual action, i.e., {{it is able to}} simultaneously stimulate bone formation and suppress bone resorption [17, 20, 21]. This has been demonstrated in both animal- (by means of bone mineral content analysis [22], dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [23], and histomorphometric assessment [24]), and clinical studies (by means of microtomography and histomorphometric assessment) [25]. Further, relatively recent reports from animal studies suggest that the systemic administration of Sr would enhance the osseointegration of implants.|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{is growing}} that {{strontium}} (Sr) influences bone cells and bone metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Many {{studies have shown}} that Sr 2 + can stimulate bone formation and inhibit bone resorption both in vitro and in vivo. Recently strontium ranelate (SrR), a compound containing two ions of stable bivalent strontium combined with <b>ranelic</b> <b>acid,</b> which acts as a carrier, is registered as drug in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. SrR is hypothesized to be a dual-acting agent with both anti-resorptive and anabolic skeletal benefits. The precise molecular mechanism responsible for SrR effects is not clear and needs to be investigated. Functional analyses that have been performed suggest that different signaling pathways may be involved in the osteoblastic and osteoclastic responses to SrR. Although, SrR is approved in several countries for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, it is a relatively new drug and its long-term safety still needs to be documented for the ideal management of osteopenic diseases. Although, SrR is now being administered to women for osteoporosis, it could have potentially therapeutic value in different osteopenic disorders, including Paget’s disease and cancer with bone metastases. To avoid possible adverse reactions in the greater population, it may be important to design analogous compounds that are better tolerated. Since it is evident that the therapeutic action of SrR is due exclusively to Sr 2 +, we reasoned that the performance of strontium-based drugs could be improved by modification of the carrier anion. Ranelate bears four carboxylic groups and allows the transport of a large amount of Sr 2 + metal (two cations per tetra-charged anion, 34. 1...|$|E
40|$|Not {{one of the}} {{currently}} available medications has, so far, unequivocally demonstrated its ability to fully prevent the occurrence of new vertebral or peripheral osteoporotic fractures once osteoporosis is established. Therefore, several new therapies are currently under development to optimize the risk/benefit ratio of osteoporosis treatment. Strontium ranelate is composed of an organic moiety (<b>ranelic</b> <b>acid)</b> and of two atoms of stable nonradioactive strontium. In vitro, strontium ranelate increases Collagen and noncollagenic proteins synthesis by mature osteoblast enriched cells. The effects of strontium ranelate on bone formation were confirmed as strontium ranelate enhanced pre-osteoblastic cell replication. The stimulation by strontium ranelate of the replication of osteoprogenitor cell and collagen, as well as noncollagenic protein synthesis in osteoblasts, provides substantial evidence to categorize strontium ranelate as a bone-forming agent. In the isolated rat osteoclast assay, a pre-incubation of bone slices with strontium ranelate induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the bone resorbing activity of treated rat osteoclast. Strontium ranelate also dose-dependently inhibited, in a chicken bone marrow culture, the expression of both carbonic anhydrase 11 and the (x-subunit of the vitronectin receptor. These effects showing that strontium ranelate significantly affects bone resorption due to a direct and/or matrix-mediated inhibition of osteoclast activity and also inhibits osteoclasts differentiation, are compatible with the profile of an anti-resorptive drug. In normal rats, administration of strontium ranelate induces an improvement in the mechanical properties of the humerus and/or the lumbar vertebra associated with a commensurate increase in bone dimension, shaft and volume. Strontium ranelate was administered in 160 early postmenopausal women, in a 24 -month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective randomized study. Daily oral dose of 125 mg, 500 mg and 1 g of strontium ranelate were compared with a placebo. At {{the conclusion of the}} study, the percent variation of lumbar-adjusted bone mineral density from baseline was significantly different in the group receiving 1 g/day of strontium ranelate compared with placebo (+ 1. 41 % vs. - 0. 98 %, respectively). Increase in total hip and neck bone mineral density averages, respectively, 3. 2 % and 2. 5 %. Strontium ranelate does not induce any significant adverse reaction compared with those observed in women receiving a placebo for the same duration. In a phase 11 study, the effect of strontium ranelate in postmenopausal women with vertebral osteoporotic fractures was assessed during a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Doses of 500 mg, 1 g and 2 g daily of strontium ranelate or placebo were given to 353 Caucasian women with prevalent osteoporosis. At the conclusion of this 2 -year study, the annual increase in lumbar-adjusted bone mineral density of the group receiving 2 g of strontium ranelate was + 2. 97 %. This result was significantly different compared with placebo. A significant increase in bone alkaline phosphatase and, over a 6 -month period, a significant decrease in urinary-pyridium crosslinks (NTX) were evidenced. During the second year of treatment, the dose of 2 g was associated with a 44 % {{reduction in the number of}} patients experiencing a new vertebral deformity. Bone histomorphometry showed no mineralization defects. The same percentage of withdrawals following an adverse effect was observed for patients receiving placebo and for those receiving 2 g of strontium ranelate. The compound was further investigated in a large phase III program that included two extensive trials for the treatment of severe osteoporosis, one assessing the effects of strontium ranelate on the risk of vertebral fractures (SOTI) and one evaluating its effects on peripheral (nonspinal) fractures (TROPOS). The primary analysis of the SOTI study, evaluating the effect of 2 g of strontium ranelate on vertebral fracture rates, revealed a 41 % reduction in the relative risk of experiencing a first new vertebral fracture with strontium ranelate, throughout the 3 -year study, compared with placebo. The TROPOS study, showed a significant (p = 0. 05) reduction in the relative risk of experiencing a first non-vertebral fracture in the group treated with strontium ranelate throughout the 3 -year study compared with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. A 41 % reduction in the relative risk of experiencing a hip fracture was demonstrated in the per protocol population. All these results imply that strontium ranelate is a new, effective and safe treatment for vertebral and nonvertebral osteoporosis, with a unique mode of action. (C) 2003 Prous Science.
