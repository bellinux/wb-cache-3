40|$|International audienceAllergy to {{the short}} ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) pollen is a major health problem. The ragweed {{allergen}} repertoire has been recently expanded with the identification of Amb a 11, a new major allergen belonging to the cysteine protease family. To better characterize Amb a 11, a recombinant proform of the molecule with a preserved active site was produced in Escherichia coli, refolded, and processed in vitro into a mature enzyme. The enzymatic activity is revealed by maturation following an autocatalytic processing resulting in the cleavage of both N- and C-terminal propeptides. The 2. 05 -A resolution crystal structure of pro-Amb a 11 shows an overall typical C 1 A cysteine protease fold with a network of molecular interactions between the N-terminal propeptide and the catalytic triad of the enzyme. The allergenicity of Amb a 11 was confirmed in a murine sensitization model, resulting in airway inflammation, production of serum IgEs, and induction of Th 2 immune responses. Of note, inflammatory responses were higher with the mature form, demonstrating that the cysteine protease activity critically contributes to the allergenicity of the molecule. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that Amb a 11 is a bona fide cysteine protease exhibiting a strong allergenicity. As such, it {{should be considered as}} an important molecule for diagnosis and immunotherapy of <b>ragweed</b> pollen <b>allergy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{allergenic}} {{plant species}} may have severe health-related impacts. In {{this study we}} aim to predict the {{effects of climate change}} on the distribution of three allergenic ragweed species (Ambrosia spp.) in Europe and discuss the potential associated health impact. We built species distribution models based on presence-only data for three ragweed species, using MAXENT software. Future climatic habitat suitability was modeled under two IPCC climate change scenarios (RCP 6. 0 and RCP 8. 5). We quantify the extent of the increase in ‘high allergy risk’ (HAR) areas, i. e., parts of Europe with climatic conditions corresponding to the highest quartile (25 %) of present day habitat suitability {{for each of the three}} species. We estimate that by year 2100, the distribution range of all three ragweed species increases towards Northern and Eastern Europe under all climate scenarios. HAR areas will expand in Europe by 27 – 100 %, depending on species and climate scenario. Novel HAR areas will occur mostly in Denmark, France, Germany, Russia and the Baltic countries, and overlap with densely populated cities such as Paris and St. Petersburg. We conclude that areas in Europe affected by severe <b>ragweed</b> associated <b>allergy</b> problems are likely to increase substantially by year 2100, affecting millions of people. To avoid this, management strategies must be developed that restrict ragweed dispersal and establishment of new populations. Precautionary efforts should limit the spread of ragweed seeds and reduce existing populations. Only by applying cross-countries management plans can managers mitigate future health risks and economical consequences of a ragweed expansion in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Globally pollen allergy is a {{major public}} health problem, but a {{fundamental}} unknown is the likely impact of climate change. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study to quantify the consequences of climate change upon pollen allergy in humans. Objectives: To produce quantitative estimates of the potential impact of climate change upon pollen allergy in humans, focusing upon common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) in Europe. Methods: A process-based model estimated the change in ragweed’s range under climate change. A second model simulated current and future ragweed pollen levels. These were translated into health burdens using a dose-response curve generated from a systematic review and current and future population data. Models considered two different suites of regional climate/pollen models, two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (RCP 4. 5 and 8. 5), and three different plant invasion scenarios. Results: Our primary estimates indicate that sensitization to ragweed will more than double in Europe, from 33 to 77 million people, by 2041 - 2060. According to our projections, while sensitization will increase in countries with an existing ragweed problem (e. g. Hungary, the Balkans), the greatest proportional increases will occur where sensitization is uncommon (e. g. Germany, Poland, France). Higher pollen concentrations and a longer pollen season may also increase the severity of symptoms. Our model projections are driven predominantly by changes in climate (66 %), but also are influenced by current trends in the spread of this invasive plant species. Assumptions about the rate at which ragweed spreads throughout Europe have a large influence upon the results. Conclusions: Our quantitative estimates indicate that <b>ragweed</b> pollen <b>allergy</b> will become a common health problem across Europe, expanding into areas where it is currently uncommon. Control of ragweed spread may be an important adaptation strategy in response to climate change...|$|R

The number of patients allergic to ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) {{is on the rise}} throughout Europe, having a significant negative impact on the patients’ and their family’s quality of life. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) has disease-modifying effects and can induce immune tolerance to allergens. Both subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy with ragweed extracts/preparations have clear positive clinical efficacy, especially over pharmacological treatment, even years after the treatment has ended. AIT also has very good safety profiles with extremely rare side effects, and the extracts/preparations used in AIT are commonly well tolerated by patients. However, patient adherence to treatment with AIT seems to be quite low, mostly {{due to the fact that}} treatment with AIT is relatively time-demanding and, moreover, due to patients not receiving adequate information and education about the treatment before it starts. AIT is undergoing innovations and improvements in clinical efficacy, safety and patient adherence, especially with new approaches using new adjuvants, recombinant or modified allergens, synthetic peptides, novel routes of administration (epidermal or intralymphatic), and new protocols, which might make AIT more acceptable for a wider range of patients and novel indications. Patient education and support (eg, recall systems) is one of the most important goals for AIT in the future, to further enhance treatment success.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{prevalence}} of <b>ragweed</b> <b>allergy</b> is increasing worldwide. Ragweed distribution and abundance is spreading in Europe {{in a wide}} area ranging from the Rhone valley in France to Hungary and Ukraine, where {{the rate of the}} prevalence can peak at as high as 12 %. Low-grade ragweed colonisation was seen in Geneva and Ticino, less than two decades ago. There were fears that allergies to ragweed would increase Switzerland. The intent {{of this study was to}} assess the rate of {{prevalence of}} sensitisation and allergy to ragweed in the population living in the first rural Swiss setting where ragweed had been identified in 1996, and to evaluate indirectly the efficacy of elimination and containment strategies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2009, 35 adults in a rural village in the Canton of Geneva were recruited. Data were collected by means of questionnaires and skin-prick tests were done on each participant. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. RESULTS: Based on questionnaires, 48. 6 % had rhinitis (95 % confidence interval [CI] 32. 9 - 64. 4; n = 17 / 35) and 17. 1 % asthma (95 % CI 8. 1 - 32. 6; n = 6 / 35). Atopy was diagnosed in 26. 4 % (95 % CI 12. 9 - 44. 4) of the sample (n = 9 / 34). Ragweed sensitisation was found in 2. 9 % (95 % CI 0. 7 - 19. 7; n = 1 / 34), mugwort sensitisation in 2. 9 % (95 % CI 0. 1 - 14. 9; n = 1 / 35), alder sensitisation in 17. 1 % (95 % CI 6. 6 - 33. 6; n = 6 / 35), ash sensitisation in 12. 5 % (95 % CI 3. 5 - 29. 0; n = 4 / 32) and grass sensitisation in 22. 9 % (95 % CI 10. 4 - 40. 1; n = 8 / 35). Ragweed (95 % CI 0. 1 - 14. 9; n = 1 / 34) and mugwort allergies (95 % CI 0. 1 - 14. 9; n = 1 / 35) were both found in 2. 9 % of the population. CONCLUSION: This study showed a surprisingly low incidence of ragweed sensitisation and allergy, of 2. 9 % and 2. 9 %, respectively, 20 years after the first ragweed detection in Geneva. The feared rise in <b>ragweed</b> <b>allergy</b> seems not to have happened in Switzerland, compared with other ragweed colonised countries. These results strongly support early field strategies against ragweed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ragweed</b> <b>allergy</b> {{is one of}} {{the primary}} causes of {{seasonal}} allergies in Europe and its prevalence is expected to rise. The leaf beetle Ophraella communa, recently and accidentally established in N-Italy and S-Switzerland, represents a promising approach to control ragweed, but negative side effects should be excluded before its use. Since biotic and abiotic stresses are known to influence the allergenicity of pollen, we set out to assess the effect of sub-lethal defoliation by O. communa on {{the quantity and quality of}} ragweed pollen. Seventeen sister pairs (including six clones) of ragweed plants were grown in controlled conditions. One of each pair was exposed to O. communa as soon as the plant started to produce reproductive structures. After 10 weeks of exposure, plant traits were measured as a proxy for pollen quantity. Pollen quality was assessed by measuring its viability and allergenicity. Generally, plants produced very few male flowers and little amount of pollen. Damage by the beetle was severe with most of the leaf tissue removed, but no treatment effect was found on any of the quantitative and qualitative traits assessed. In conclusion, O. communa did not increase the amount or allergenicity of ragweed pollen grains in our experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that chitin in the form of microparticles that can be phagocytosed is a potent macrophage stimulator and promotes a Th 1 cytokine response and {{it has been shown that}} oral administration of chitin microparticles is effective in down-regulating serum IgE and lung eosinophilia in a mouse model of <b>ragweed</b> <b>allergy.</b> To date there have been no studies on the effectivness of directly applying chitin microparticles to the respiratory tract as a treatment for allergic symptoms. Objective To test the effectivness of chitin microparticles when given intranasally as a treatment for the symptoms of respiratory allergy and allergic asthma and to compare its effectivness in two different mouse models of allergy, namely to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Aspergillus fumigatus. Results The intranasal application of microgram doses of chitin microparticles is an effective treatment for reducing serum IgE and peripheral blood eosinophilia, airway hyper-responsiveness and lung inflammation in both allergy models results in elevation in Th 1 cytokines IL- 12, IFN-? and TNF-? and reduction in IL- 4 production during allergen challenge. Conclusion Chitin microparticle suspensions have Th 1 immunostimulatory properties and are effective when administered intranasally in mice. The stimulation of the nasal associated lymphoid tissue with chitin microparticles could offer a novel and natural approach to treating allergic disease in humans. <br/...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{undertook}} to provide evidence for local in vivo isotype switching to IgE following nasal challenges. Detection of deleted switch circular DNA (switch circles) by a novel nested polymerase chain reaction-based approach was employed as definitive molecular evidence of Ig isotype switching. Nasal challenge in humans with diesel exhaust particles (DEP) plus ragweed antigen {{has been shown to}} enhance local IgE production, stimulate local cytokine production, and markedly increase mucosal IgE antibody to ragweed. Four days after combined intranasal DEP plus ragweed challenge, we detected and characterized clones of deleted switch circular DNA (S�/S�) representing switching from � to � from nasal lavage cells. No switch circular DNA was detected in nasal lavage cells following challenge with DEP alone nor with ragweed allergen alone. These results indicate that the combination of mucosal stimulation with DEP and ragweed allergen is capable of driving in vivo isotype switching to IgE in humans with <b>ragweed</b> <b>allergy.</b> These results are the first direct demonstration of in vivo IgE isotype switching in humans.

40|$|Background: Sensitization {{to common}} ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is {{associated}} with a variety of risk factors, which are incompletely defined. Our aim was to evaluate the association of a variety of clinical, geographical and demographical variables with ragweed sensitization and also to determine its frequency in southern Bavaria. Methods: In this cross-sectional multicentre study, we enrolled 977 patients with a documented or suspected atopic disease or food allergy. Data were collected on aeroallergen sensitization, age, sex, type and history of allergic disease, place of residence and potential local ragweed exposure. For this last variable, county ragweed cover was taken as a surrogate variable. Relative rates were calculated with multiple additive logistic regression models. Randomly selected patients with ragweed sensitization had a conjunctival provocation test. Results: According to skin prick tests, 190 patients (19. 5 %) were sensitized to ragweed. The frequency of this finding increased significantly with a rising number of additional sensitizations. Other less important predictors for a ragweed sensitization were male gender, mugwort sensitization, food allergy and a maximum of complaints in September or October. County of residence, extent of local ragweed cover or type of residential area were without relevance. Of 48 sensitized patients, 26 (54. 2 %) had a positive conjunctival provocation test. Discussion: Patients with multiple sensitizations may be more readily sensitized to a new aeroallergen. Local geographic or environmental conditions are presumably of minor importance for becoming sensitized to ragweed. The frequency of <b>ragweed</b> <b>allergy</b> among sensitized patients might be high. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E

This study was aimed at evaluating the degree of nasal inflammation, assessed by nasal cytology, in children with allergic rhinitis (AR) from ragweed pollen according to being monosensitized or polysensitized. Methods: The study included 47 children. Of them, 24 suffered from AR caused by sensitization to grass pollen and ragweed pollen (group A) and 23 were sensitized only to ragweed pollen (group B). In all patients, the severity of AR was assessed according to the Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma guidelines, and comorbidities were also evaluated. Results: In group A, 16. 7 % of children had a mild intermittent AR, 4. 2 % a moderate-to-severe intermittent, 33. 3 % a mild persistent, and 45. 8 % a moderate-to-severe persistent; in group B, 26. 1 % of children had a mild intermittent AR, 0 % a moderate-to-severe intermittent, 52. 2 % a mild persistent, and 21. 7 % a moderate-to-severe persistent. No significant difference was detected in the number of the considered comorbidities between the two groups. The cell counts of neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes/plasma cells, and mast cells were high but not significantly different in the two groups.
