5|$|The GAO {{released}} its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation {{determined that the}} USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to <b>report</b> <b>their</b> contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS {{as required by the}} ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May to <b>report</b> <b>their</b> contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.|$|E

Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did not hear from her that evening, they first thought that she had stayed at the church for midnight mass.

5|$|In February 1930, a Towle TA-2 {{amphibian}} was {{a visitor}} to Lympne. In July 1930, it was notified that aircraft fitted with radio may <b>report</b> <b>their</b> position by radio when crossing the Channel. For non-radio aircraft the earlier arrangements remained in effect, although some changes {{were made to the}} methods of acknowledgement of arrival. Search and rescue arrangements now included motorboats permanently available at Boulogne, Calais, Dover and Dunquerque. Lifeboats were also on standby at the French ports and air patrols were in operation during working hours, operated by Air Union. In August 1930, the arrangements for non-radio aircraft flying between Croydon and Lympne in bad weather were amended. Pilots had to notify which route they intended to take and the destination airfield was to be notified of this by telephone once the aircraft had departed. That month 601 (County of London) Squadron held its annual camp a Lympne.|$|E

The Barr campaign filed a lawsuit to prevent John McCain and Barack Obama from appearing on the ballot in Texas, charging that the candidates' parties did not reach the state's August 26 deadline to <b>report</b> <b>their</b> nominations to the Secretary of State. Texas Secretary of State Esperanza Andrade reported that all the correct paperwork was filed, though neither the Democratic nor Republican parties formally nominated their candidates (at their respective conventions) until after the deadline.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 2004 the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board {{conducted}} a study into the risks presented by dust explosions after three fatal accidents in the year before. The West Pharmaceutical Services explosion killed six persons, the CTA Acoustics fiberglass insulation manufacturing plant explosion killed seven, and the Hayes Lemmerz automotive parts plant explosion killed one, prompting the <b>report.</b> <b>Their</b> report showed that between 1980 and 2005, there had been 281 explosions involving combustible dust, resulting in 119 deaths and 718 injuries. The Board found that dust explosions posed a severe risk and {{made a number of}} recommendations to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. These had been partly implemented by 2008.

5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality {{parallel to the}} living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art.

This information was then entered to the Billboard computer system, and points were tabulated for each song. This data are compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 120 music markets across the United States.

5|$|The LRDG {{returned}} to Yugoslavia in February 1945, operating around Istria and Dalmatia, where Germany still held {{portions of the}} mainland and certain strategic islands. The Germans had heavily mined the southern Adriatic and were attempting to cover their shipping by moving only by night, close to shore, and heaving to during the day under camouflage nets.

5|$|Certain areas did not <b>report</b> <b>their</b> {{income to}} the Exchequer, {{so they do}} not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E

5|$|Flying at Benalla was {{hampered}} by bad weather, and the runway was unusable from September to November 1941, necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon, home of No.3 EFTS, {{to continue their}} training. In October 1941, six airmen of No.11 EFTS were court-martialled for mutiny. Their main grievance was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7:15am {{in addition to their}} regular ground support work. One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing to <b>report</b> <b>their</b> knowledge of the matter to the commanding officer. The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the others to between five and six months detention; all were discharged from the Air Force. On 11December 1941, one of the school's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground, killing two and injuring the others; the two pilots were uninjured.

5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to <b>report</b> <b>their</b> finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E
