The {{identification}} of natriuretic peptides as key regulators of natriuresis and vasodilatation, and the appreciation that their secretion {{is under the}} control of cardiac haemody-namic and neurohumoral factors, have boosted a wide interest among scientists and cardiologists in the last 10 years. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, 32 amino acids) is secreted into the circulation mainly by left ventricular (and atrial) myocytes in conditions of overload or wall stress (dilatation and/or abnormal filling pressure). Through its binding to specific membrane receptors (NPR-A), the hor-mone generates the second messenger cGMP and stimulates the nitric oxide system.

25|$|The kidneys secrete {{a variety}} of hormones, {{including}} erythropoietin, and the enzyme renin. Erythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. Calcitriol, the activated form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption of phosphate.

25|$|<b>Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone</b> <b>system</b> {{is a major}} blood {{pressure}} regulating mechanism. Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as hypotension, low distal tubule sodium concentration, decreased blood volume and high sympathetic tone trigger {{the release of the}} enzyme renin from the cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone angiotensinogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten amino acid residues known as angiotensin I. ACE (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II. ACE is found in the pulmonary circulation and in the endothelium of many blood vessels. The system increases {{blood pressure}} by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent vasoconstrictor).|$|E
40|$|Ascites {{formation}} {{in patients with}} cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or both usually results from hyperdynamic circulatory dysfunction, where the retention of sodium and water {{is associated with the}} activation of the sympathetic and <b>renin–angiotensin–aldosterone</b> <b>systems.</b> The presence of ascites indicates the development of liver decompensation. Furthermore, complications seen in conjunction with ascites such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic hydrothorax may result in increased morbidity and mortality. Although nonpharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches have been introduced and clinically practiced, their therapeutic effects are still suboptimal or limited by their potential side effects, such as large-volume paracentesis-induced postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction.

In this review, we examine the current evidence about treatment of HF-PEF, with particular emphasis on reviewing the literature for large-scale randomized clinical studies. The lack of significant benefit with neurohormonal antagonism in HF-PEF suggests that this condition might not involve neurohormonal activation as a critical pathophysiologic mechanism.

25|$|Large colon impactions {{typically}} {{occur at}} the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon, two areas where the lumen of the intestine narrows. Large colon impactions are most frequently seen in horses that have recently had a sudden decrease in exercise, such as after a musculoskeletal injury. They are also associated {{in the practice of}} twice daily feeding of grain meals, which causes a short-lived but significant secretion of fluid into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a 15% decrease in plasma volume (hypovolemia of the circulatory system) and the subsequent activation of the <b>renin–angiotensin–aldosterone</b> <b>system.</b> Aldosterone secretion activates absorption of fluid from the colon, decreasing the water content of the ingesta and increasing risk of impaction. Amitraz has also been associated with large colon impaction, due to alterations in motility and retention of intestinal contents, which causes further absorption of water and dehydration of ingesta. Other possible factors include poor dental care, course roughage, dehydration, and limited exercise.|$|E
25|$|Another system {{maintaining}} the extracellular fluid volume, peripheral resistance, {{and that if}} disturbed may lead to hypertension, is the <b>renin–angiotensin–aldosterone</b> <b>system.</b> Renin is a circulating enzyme that participates in maintaining extracellular volume and arterial vasoconstriction, therefore contributing to regulation of blood pressure. It performs this function by breaking down (hydrolysing) angiotensinogen, secreted from the liver, into the peptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is further cleaved by an enzyme that is located primarily but not exclusively in the pulmonary circulation bound to endothelium; that enzyme is angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). This cleavage produces angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide. Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the musculature of arteries, raising peripheral resistance and thereby elevating blood pressure. Angiotensin II also causes the adrenal glands to release aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of salt and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. So elevated renin levels in the blood (normally 1.98-2.46ng/ml in the upright position) leads to hypertension.|$|E
500|$|The {{underfill}} theory involves {{activation of}} the <b>renin–angiotensin–aldosterone</b> <b>system,</b> which leads {{to an increase in}} absorption of sodium from the kidney tubule (termed renal sodium avidity) mediated by aldosterone, which acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal convoluted tubule. [...] This is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of ascites in cirrhotics as well. It has been hypothesized that the progression from ascites to hepatorenal syndrome is a spectrum where splanchnic vasodilation defines both resistance to diuretic medications in ascites (which is commonly seen in type 2 HRS) and the onset of kidney vasoconstriction (as described above) leading to hepatorenal syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Vasopressin {{caused a}} potent {{vasoconstrictor}} effect in pithed rat preparations, without significantly altering heart rate. The vasopressor/constrictor response to vasopressin was not influenced by bilateral adrenalectomy, reserpine pretreatment or the prior {{administration of the}} alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and yohimbine. The minor impairments of vasopressin-induced vasoconstriction by bilateral nephrectomy, captopril and the calcium entry blockers verapamil and nifedipine could all {{be attributed to the}} vasodilator potency of these various pretreatments. In conclusion, the potent vasoconstrictor response to vasopressin in the pithed rat occurs independently of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system and its associated adrenoceptors and of the <b>renin-angiotensin-aldosterone</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, vasopressin-induced vasoconstriction does not require the influx of extracellular calcium ions and is hence insensitive to calcium entry blockade. These findings for vasopressin reveal an important difference with respect to alpha 1 /alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists and angiotensin II, which are known to cause vasoconstriction largely dependent upon the influx of extracellular calcium ion...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the mechanism of}} enalaprilat, an angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitor, as a promoter of hypertrophy reversionin different types of myocytes, left ventricular hypertrophy is animportant physiological predictive factor that helps preventing heartdiseases, because its inducing mechanism is associated to bodymass index, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, diabetesmellitus and use of medication. These mechanisms are employedin indexes to assess risks. Methods: Left ventricle, diaphragm andgastrocnemius muscle of 80 male Wistar rats were divided into fivedistinct groups: control, isoproterenol, enalaprilat, isoproterenolenalaprilatgroup and isoproterenol-water. The heart, diaphragm andgastrocnemius muscles were submitted to histomorphometry ofmyocytes under light microscopy analysis. Results: The wet weight– dry weight ratio was increased in the control and isoproterenolgroups. Histomorphometric analysis showed ventricular hypertrophy inrats treated with isoproterenol. In addition, no significant statistical ormorphological differences were observed among the other experimentalgroups.

2500|$|Older, small breeds of {{dogs are}} prone to {{congestive}} heart failure due to degeneration of the mitral valve. This condition {{is known to be}} inherited in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. [...] Degenerative valve disease is {{the most common form of}} heart disease in dogs. [...] Mitral insufficiency leads to turbulent blood flow and increased pressure in the left atrium. This causes increased pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and pulmonary edema (a build-up of fluid in the lungs). [...] Decreased output of blood by the left ventricle causes the body to compensate by increasing sympathetic tone and activating the <b>renin–angiotensin–aldosterone</b> <b>system</b> (RAAS). [...] Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased peripheral vascular resistance and increased heart rate and contractility of the heart muscle. [...] Chronic elevation of sympathetic tone damages the heart muscle. [...] Activation of the RAAS results in increased retention of water and sodium by the kidneys, vasoconstriction, and other effects that result in increased blood volume. [...] It also results in an increase in diastolic pressure and leads to pulmonary edema. Treatment for congestive heart failure has historically focussed on two types of drugs that address these concerns: diuretics (especially furosemide), which decrease blood volume, and ACE inhibitors, which interrupt the RAAS. Recently, pimobendan - which increases the force with which the heart muscle contracts, and is also a vasodilator - is being more widely used in the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular disease. A major veterinary study, called the QUEST study (QUality of life and Extension of Survival Time), published in September 2008 found that dogs with congestive heart failure receiving pimobendan plus furosemide had significantly better survival outcomes than those receiving benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) plus furosemide. However, ACE inhibitors and pimobendan have different mechanisms of action, and many veterinary cardiologists recommend they be used concurrently.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The role of ATP as an {{extracellular}} signalling molecule is {{now well}} established and evidence is accumulating that ATP and other nucleotides (ADP, UTP and UDP) play {{important roles in}} cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology, acting via P 2 X (ion channel) and P 2 Y (G proteincoupled) receptors. In this article we consider the dual role of ATP in regulation of vascular tone, released as a cotransmitter from sympathetic nerves or released in the vascular lumen in response to changes in blood flow and hypoxia. Further, purinergic long-term trophic and inflammatory signalling is described in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and death in angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, restenosis and atherosclerosis. The effects on haemostasis and cardiac regulation is reviewed. The involvement of ATP in vascular diseases such as thrombosis, hypertension and diabetes will also be discussed, as well as various heart conditions.

40|$|A {{survey is}} given of the {{currently}} used therapeutics {{in the treatment}} of chronic congestive heart failure. Symptomatic treatment is usually performed along the following lines: rest, sodium and fluid restriction to unload the decompensating heart, loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or other vasodilators; inotropic agents to improve the heart's mechanical performance; attempts to counteract the neuro-endocrine compensatory mechanisms, that is the activated sympathetic nervous and <b>renin-angiotensin-aldosterone</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as the rise in vasopressine levels. New insights have been obtained in the effects of cardiac glycosides, which are probably rather based on counteracting the elevated sympathetic neuronal activity than on their weak and uncertain inotropic action. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are probably more effective than classical vasodilators owing to their additional interaction with the neuro-endocrine compensatory mechanisms. Ibopamine, a prodrug of epinine, appears to be rather a vasodilator and antagonist of the neuro-endocrine compensatory mechanisms than an inotropic agent. The most important clinical trials addressing the efficacy and adverse reactions to the various aforementioned therapeutics are discussed. New, experimental approaches in the drug treatment of chronic congestive heart failure include beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, vasopressin antagonists and inhibitors of atrial natriuretic peptide degradatio...|$|R

40|$|Arterial {{hypertension}} {{is often}} {{part of a}} constellation of anthropometric and metabolic abnormalities that occur simultaneously to a higher degree than would be expected by chance alone, supporting {{the existence of a}} discrete disorder, the so-called metabolic syndrome. It is the result of interactions among a large number of interconnected mechanisms, which eventually lead to both an increase in cardiovascular and renal risk, and the development of diabetes. Mechanisms involved in the metabolic syndrome are obesity, insulin resistance, and a constellation of independent factors, which include molecules of hepatic, vascular, and immunologic origin with pro-inflammatory properties. At each of these key points are interactions of demographics, lifestyle, genetic factors, and environmental fetal programming. Superimposing upon these are infections or chronic exposure or both to certain drugs that can also make their contribution. Skeletal muscle and the liver, not adipose tissue, are the two key insulin-response tissues involved in maintaining glucose balance, although abnormal insulin action in the adipocytes also plays a role in development of the syndrome.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{hyperactivity}} of the sympathetic nervous and <b>renin-angiotensin-aldosterone</b> <b>systems</b> (SNS and RAAS, respectively) has repeatedly {{been related to}} the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and PAH-related right ventricular failure (PAH-RVF), raising {{the question of whether}} neurohormonal inhibition may be indicated for these conditions. Experimental data indicate that the RAAS may be involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is in fact halted by RAAS antagonism. Favorable actions of β-blockers on the pulmonary vasculature have also been described, even if information about β-adrenergic receptors in PAH is lacking. Furthermore, the available evidence suggests that stimulation of the pressure-overloaded RV by the SNS and RAAS is initially compensatory, but becomes maladaptive over time. Consistently, RV reverse remodeling has been shown in PAH animal models treated with either β-blockers or RAAS inhibitors, although important differences with human PAH may limit the translational value of these findings. Only few observational studies of neurohormonal antagonism in PAH and PAH-RVF have been published. Nonetheless, β-blockers on top of specific therapy appear to be safe and possibly also effective. The combination of mineralocorticoid receptor and endothelin-A receptor antagonists may result in an additive effect because of a positive pharmacodynamic interaction. While neurohormonal inhibitors cannot be recommended at present for treatment of PAH and PAH-RVF, they are worth being further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Adriana Bertolami, Carolina Gonzaga, Celso AmodeoSleep Laboratory of Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology, Sao Paulo, BrazilAbstract: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} one of the major causes of death worldwide. Among its risk factors, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common but still underestimated condition. OSA often coexists and interacts with obesity, sharing {{multiple}} pathophysiological mechanisms and subsequent cardiovascular risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, systemic inflammation, and in particular hypertension. There is also evidence suggesting an increased risk of arrhythmia, heart failure, renal failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial (hypopnea) or complete interruption (apnea) of breathing during sleep due to airway collapse in the pharyngeal region. The main mechanisms linking OSA to impaired cardiovascular function are secondary to hypoxemia and reoxygenation, arousals, and negative intrathoracic pressure. Consequently, the sympathetic nervous and the <b>renin-angiotensin-aldosterone</b> <b>systems</b> may be overestimulated, and blood pressure increased. Resistance to treatment for hypertension represents a growing issue, and given that OSA has been recognized as the major secondary cause of resistant hypertension, clinical investigation for apnea is mandatory in this population. Standard diagnosis includes polysomnography, and treatment for OSA should include control of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity. So far, continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice for OSA, impacting positively on blood pressure goals; however, the impact on long-term follow-up and on cardiovascular disease should be better assessed.
