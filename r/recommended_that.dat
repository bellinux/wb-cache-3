Additionally, we <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> the field articulate common STEM categorizations that retain legitimate variation while providing a basis for consistent comparison.|$|R

5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E

The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E

5|$|Following {{reports of}} {{disciplinary}} problems, VI Corps ordered an investigation, {{which took place}} over four days while elements of the battalion were still engaged at Rittershoffen. It <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> the battalion be withdrawn and retrained before returning to combat under a new commander, while Major-General Edward H. Brooks, the corps commander, instead <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> the battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units. General Alexander Patch, commanding Seventh Army, agreed with Brooks, suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed from the men of service units, themselves replaced by {{the men of the}} 827th. This was contentious, however; the number and status of segregated combat units was a matter of intense political debate, and converting a black combat unit to a service one, in favor of white troops, was likely controversial.|$|E
