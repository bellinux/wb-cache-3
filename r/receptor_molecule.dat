25|$|It is {{believed}} that a <b>receptor</b> <b>molecule</b> exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive biophysical states. The binding of ligands to the receptor may shift the equilibrium toward the active receptor states. Three types of ligands exist: Agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of active states; inverse agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of inactive states; and neutral antagonists are ligands that do not affect the equilibrium. It is not yet known how exactly the active and inactive states differ from each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} insulin are {{initiated}} by its binding to a receptor {{present in the}} cell membrane. The <b>receptor</b> <b>molecule</b> contains an α- and β subunits. Two molecules are joined to form {{what is known as}} a homodimer. Insulin binds to the α-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide shows {{involvement}} in HIV-1 infection. gp120-gp41 are {{specific types of}} envelope glycoprotein complexes that are found on HIV-1. These glycoprotein complexes can interact with CD4, a viral <b>receptor</b> <b>molecule,</b> which induces {{a change in the}} conformation of gp120. This change in conformation allows the gp120 complex to interact with the chemokine co-receptor and the insertion of the fusion peptide, gp41, into the membrane of the host cell. This allows the HIV-1 virus to enter into the cell. Gp120 can also bind to glycolipids like sulfatide and galactocerebroside (GalCer). Sulfatide binds strongly to the V3 loop of gp120, which does not interact with CD4. Consequently, sulfatide acts as an alternate virus receptor in CD4- cells, and it participates in transmembrane signaling. However, sulfatide has little function in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ cells.|$|E
40|$|SummaryDynamic force {{microscopy}} (DFM) {{was used}} to image human rhinovirus HRV 2 alone and complexed with single <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> under near physiological conditions. Specific and site-directed immobilization of HRV 2 on a model cell membrane resulted in a crystalline arrangement of virus particles with hexagonal symmetry and 35 nm spacing. High-resolution imaging of the virus capsid revealed about 20 resolvable structural features with 3 nm diameters; this finding is in agreement with protrusions seen by cryo-electron microscopy. Binding of <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> to individual virus particles was observed after injection of soluble receptors into the liquid cell. Virus-receptor complexes with zero, one, two, or three attached <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> were resolved. The number of <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> associated to virions increased over time. Occasionally, dissociation of single <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> from viral particles was also observed...|$|R

2500|$|After a {{neurotransmitter}} molecule binds to a <b>receptor</b> <b>molecule,</b> it must {{be removed}} {{to allow for the}} postsynaptic membrane to continue to relay subsequent EPSPs and/or IPSPs. This removal can happen through one or more processes: ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{of these}} receptors will dimerize after binding with their ligands, {{in order to}} {{activate}} further signal transductions. For example, after the epidermal growth factor (EGF) [...] receptor binds with its ligand EGF, the two receptors dimerize and then undergo phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the enzyme portion of each <b>receptor</b> <b>molecule.</b> [...] This will activate the tyrosine kinase and catalyze further intracellular reactions.|$|E

Major changes in constituent receptors occur in the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tracks, skin or perhaps ocular tissues. Therefore, constituent/innate <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> are capable of maturation or adaptation to gene-environment interactions and interdependent shifts or synergies with induced <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> for maintenance of health or induction of diseases.|$|R

40|$|An {{aggregation}} receptor {{from the}} siliceous sponge Geodia cydonium has been isolated and purified {{in an almost}} pure form. It sediments at about 2 - 6 s, has a buoyant density of 151 g/ml in CsCl and elutes from Sephadex G- 50 at a V,jV 0 value of i- 3 i i. Chemical analysis revealed that the receptor consists of 81 % neutral carbohydrate and 7 - 5 % protein. The activity of the receptor is rapidly destroyed by Na-periodate. The receptor is released from the cell surface after removal of Ca 2 + from the medium or after incubation of the cells with trypsin. The depleted cells can be charged again with isolated <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules.</b> The binding of the <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> on the cell surface is prevented {{in the presence of}} trypsin. For optimal binding, physiological salt concentrations with respect to NaCl (540 mM NaCl) and Ca!+ ions are necessary. The receptor whose isolation is described in this report, is involved in secondary aggre-gation processes, which are initiated by a soluble aggregation factor. The primary aggregation of the cells is not influenced by the receptor. Time-course studies with receptor-depleted cells revealed that new aggregation <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> are formed during the aggregation process. By competition experiments it could be shown that high concentrations of soluble aggre-gation <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> inhibit secondary aggregation. The soluble <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> can compete with surface-bound <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> only if these are not linked with the aggre-gation factor...|$|R
2500|$|A <b>receptor</b> <b>molecule</b> is said {{to exhibit}} {{cooperative}} binding if its binding to ligand scales non-linearly with ligand concentration.

2500|$|The {{cannabinoid}} receptor {{is a typical}} member of the largest known family of receptors called a G protein-coupled receptor. A signature {{of this type of}} receptor is the distinct pattern of how the <b>receptor</b> <b>molecule</b> spans the cell membrane seven times. The location of {{cannabinoid receptor}}s exists on the cell membrane, and both outside (extracellularly) and inside (intracellularly) the cell membrane. CB1 receptors, the bigger of the two, are extraordinarily abundant in the brain: 10 times more plentiful than μ-opioid receptors, the receptors responsible for the effects of morphine. CB2 receptors are structurally different (the sequence similarity [...] between the two subtypes of receptors is 44%), found only on cells of the immune system, and seems to function similarly to its CB1 counterpart. CB2 receptors are most commonly prevalent on B-cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes, but can also be found on polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells, T8 cells, and T4 cells. In the tonsils the CB2 receptors appear to be restricted to B-lymphocyte-enriched areas.|$|E

5000|$|Dimerization is a {{prerequisite}} for the activation of the kinase. Kinase activation is visualized as tyrosine phosphorylation of the <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules,</b> which occurs between the dimerized <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> (transphosphorylation). In conjunction with dimerization and kinase activation, the <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> undergo conformational changes, which allow a basal kinase activity to phosphorylate a critical tyrosine residue, thereby [...] "unlocking" [...] the kinase, leading to full enzymatic activity directed toward other tyrosine residues in the <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> as well as other substrates for the kinase.Expression of both receptors and each of the four PDGFs is under independent control, giving the PDGF/PDGFR system a high flexibility. Different cell types vary greatly in the ratio of PDGF isoforms and PDGFRs expressed. Different external stimuli such as inflammation, embryonic development or differentiation modulate cellular receptor expression allowing binding of some PDGFs but not others. Additionally, some cells display only one of the PDGFR isoforms while other cells express both isoforms, simultaneously or separately.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of the project was}} to extend the field of molecular recognition of anions and cations of biochemical, medical, chemical and environmental importance. This was achieved by the use of a number of novel <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> that are designed to bind anionic and cationic guests. The binding of the guest anions and cations was probed by various electrochemical, spectrochemical and IH NMR spectroscopy techniques. The <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> studied included (i) ruthenium(II) trisbipyridyl complexes of acyclic, calix[4]arene and cyclic 2, 2 '-bipyridine ligands, (ii) the macrocycle Nphenylaza- 15 -crown- 5, and (iii) crown ether derivatives of diquat. These <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> have been shown to sense anions and cations, such as chloride, bromide, dihydrogen phosphate, sodium, lithium and magnesium. Interestingly, one of diquat crown ether derivatives has been shown to complex both anions and cations at the same time. This is an important development, as the simultaneous molecular trapping of anions and cations in such systems is seen as a possible alternative to the use of ion exchange resins. With a view to producing spectrochemical and/or electrochemical sensor systems, work has been completed by the immobilisation of the novel <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules.</b> This has been achieved by the electropolymerisation of vinyl-substituted ruthenium(Il) trisbipyridyl complexes or the immobilisation of <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> in a polyvinylchloride (PVC) matrix.

Cry toxins interact with multiple <b>receptor</b> <b>molecules</b> leading to the formation of membrane pores in membranes of susceptible insects. In lepidopteran insects, Cry toxins interact with a cadherin receptor and with glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) - anchored proteins (aminopeptidase N and alkaline phosphatase) leading to insertion of oligomeric toxin in membrane microdomains (or lipid rafts) and inducing cell swelling. Furthermore, recent data shows that in addition to protein receptors involved in Cry toxin interaction with the membrane of susceptible organisms, certain glycolipids also play a role in toxin action. These glycolipids are specific to invertebrate organisms like insects and nematodes. Recent progress in the characterization of mosquitocidal Cry toxin GPI-anchored protein receptors will also be reviewed.
