5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (<b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

40|$|In {{this note}} we present the {{modification}} {{to bring to}} an atmospheric model to account for <b>relative</b> <b>winds</b> (i. e. {{the difference between the}} near-surface winds and the oceanic currents) instead of absolute winds in the computation of air-sea fluxes. Because of the implicit treatment of the bottom boundary condition in most atmospheric models the use of <b>relative</b> <b>winds</b> involves a modification of both the surface layer parameterization and the tridiagonal matrix for vertical turbulent diffusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of Gribov copies {{is a central}} feature of the field configuration space of confining gauge theories. In particular a transition between two Gribov copies with <b>relative</b> <b>winding</b> number implies a space-time configuration with topological charge. We explicitly demonstrate the proliferation of Gribov copies with <b>relative</b> <b>winding</b> number, where our focus is on localized (finite norm) configurations in Coulomb gauge. We then discuss the likelihood that some pairs of such copies are connected by Minkowski space solutions. We also comment on {{the relative importance of}} instantons and the connection to confinement. ...|$|R
40|$|Use of an {{airborne}} synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) of 3. 1 -cm wavelength for {{the detection}} and mapping of precipitation echoes is described. Difficulties in mapping related to the incoherence of the echoes are discussed; methods of increasing resolution by Doppler filtering are suggested. Observations made with a vertical side-looking SAR system flying above a stratiform storm were found to resemble vertical cross sections obtained with conventional radar showing snow streamers, the bright band and rain. However, the actual section sampled by the SAR after filtering for zero Doppler is shown to depend upon both the relative motion of the particles and the <b>relative</b> <b>winds</b> below the aircraft. Knowledge of the <b>relative</b> <b>winds,</b> deduced from Doppler spectrum variations, and of the particle fall speeds permits the generation of horizontal and vertical cross sections displaced from the aircraft's position...|$|R
25|$|It is however, {{critical}} to diver safety that the compressor {{is suitable for}} breathing air delivery, uses a suitable oil, is adequately filtered, and takes in clean and uncontaminated air. Positioning of the intake opening is important, and {{may have to be}} changed if the <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> direction changes, to ensure that no engine exhaust gas enters the intake. Various national standards for breathing air quality may apply.|$|E
500|$|There {{are four}} main types of thunderstorms: single-cell, {{multi-cell}}, squall line (also called multi-cell line) and supercell. Which type forms {{depends on the}} instability and <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> conditions at different layers of the atmosphere ("wind shear"). Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30 minutes. Organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of sufficient moisture, significant vertical wind shear (normally greater than [...] in the lowest [...] of the troposphere)), which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather. The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms, most commonly associated with large hail, high winds, and tornado formation.|$|E
500|$|The pitot {{pressure}} is {{obtained from the}} pitot tube. [...] The {{pitot pressure}} {{is a measure of}} ram air pressure (the air pressure created by vehicle motion or the air ramming into the tube), which, under ideal conditions, is equal to stagnation pressure, also called total pressure. [...] The pitot tube is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the <b>relative</b> <b>wind.</b> [...] By situating the pitot tube in such a location, the ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by the aircraft's structure. [...] When airspeed increases, the ram air pressure is increased, which can be translated by the airspeed indicator.|$|E

50|$|<b>Relative</b> <b>wind</b> is {{also used}} to {{describe}} the airflow relative to an object in freefall through an atmosphere, such as that of a person's body during the freefall portion of a skydive or BASE jump. In a normal skydive the vertical descent of the skydiver creates an upward <b>relative</b> <b>wind.</b> The <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> strength increases with increased descent rate.|$|E
50|$|The angle {{between the}} chord line of an airfoil and the <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> defines {{the angle of}} attack. The <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> is of great {{importance}} to pilots because exceeding the critical angle of attack {{will result in a}} stall, regardless of airspeed.|$|E
5000|$|Gas {{inflatable}} kytoons. These are variously inflated with air, helium, hydrogen. When {{the kite}} wing is heavier-than-air, then the kytoon needs <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> to fly.

40|$|Using {{the method}} of {{implementable}} one-particle Bogoliubov transformations {{it is possible to}} explicitly define a local covariant net of quantum fields on the (universal covering of the) circle S 1 with braid group statistics. These Anyon fields transform under a representation of Ũ(1) for arbitrary real-valued spin and their commutation relations depend on the <b>relative</b> <b>winding</b> number of localization regions. By taking the tensor product with a local covariant field theory on R 2 one can obtain a non-relativistic cone-localized field net for Anyons in two dimensions. ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{wind turbine}} engineering, a {{polynomial}} variation in wind speed with height {{can be defined}} <b>relative</b> to <b>wind</b> measured at a reference height of 10 meters as: ...|$|R
50|$|To extract power, {{the turbine}} part must {{move in the}} {{direction}} of the net force. In the drag force case, the <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> speed decreases subsequently, and so does the drag force. The <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> aspect dramatically limits the maximum power that can be extracted by a drag-based wind turbine. Lift-based wind turbines typically have lifting surfaces moving perpendicular to the flow. Here, the <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> does not decrease; rather, it increases with rotor speed. Thus, the maximum power limits of these machines are much higher than those of drag-based machines.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, when a skydiver exits a forward-moving {{aircraft}} {{such as an}} aeroplane, the <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> {{emanates from}} the direction the aeroplane is facing due to the skydiver's initial forward ( [...] horizontal [...] ) momentum. As aerodynamic drag gradually overcomes this forward momentum and, simultaneously, gravity attracts the skydiver downward, the <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> alters proportionally into an upward (vertical) direction. This creates an arc of travel for the skydiver similar to water flowing from a low pressure hose held horizontally and creates {{a variation in the}} angle of the <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> from horizontal to vertical.|$|E

40|$|Dual-Doppler radar {{data were}} {{analyzed}} for three different times during {{the life cycle of}} a severe thunderstorm. The thunderstorm developed a double vortex inside as a tornado was generated beneath the cloud. The organized kinematic and precipitation internal structure of the thunderstorm support a theoretical double-vortex thunderstorm model that was developed earlier. The horizontal perturbation and <b>relative</b> <b>winds,</b> vertical winds, horizontal divergence and vorticity are compared for the three different times of measurement.

50|$|It {{is helpful}} to think of these speeds as {{projections}} of the <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> vector on to the three body axes, rather than {{in terms of the}} translational motion of the vehicle relative to the fluid. As the body rotates relative to direction of the <b>relative</b> <b>wind,</b> these components change, even when there is no net change in speed.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to giving a restoring force (which {{on its own}} would cause oscillatory motion) a tailplane gives damping. This {{is caused by the}} <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> seen by the tail as the aircraft rotates around the center of mass. For example, when the aircraft is oscillating, but is momentarily aligned with the overall vehicle's motion, the tailplane still sees a <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> that is opposing the oscillation.|$|E
50|$|The force F is {{generated}} by the wind's interaction with the blade. The magnitude and distribution of this force is {{the primary focus of}} wind-turbine aerodynamics. The most familiar type of aerodynamic force is drag. The direction of the drag force is parallel to the <b>relative</b> <b>wind.</b> Typically, the wind turbine parts are moving, altering the flow around the part. An example of <b>relative</b> <b>wind</b> is the wind one would feel cycling on a calm day.|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{imagery in}} the {{outbreak}} {{region in the}} time prior to and during tornado occurrence was examined in detail to obtain descriptive characteristics of the anvil plume. These characteristics include outflow strength (UMAX), departure of anvil centerline from the storm <b>relative</b> ambient <b>wind</b> (MDA), storm <b>relative</b> ambient <b>wind</b> (SRAW), and maximum surface vorticity (SFCVOR). It is shown that by using satellite derived parameters which characterize the flow field in the anvil region, the occurrence and intensity of tornadoes, which the parent thunderstorm produces, can be identified. Analysis of the censored regression models revealed that the five explanatory variables (UMAX, MDA, SRAW, UMAX- 2, and SFCVOR) were all significant predictors {{in the identification of}} tornadic intensity of a particular thunderstorm...|$|R
