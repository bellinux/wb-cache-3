This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument.

25|$|When an {{inductive}} circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage {{across the open}} circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark {{may not be enough}} to damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>interference</b> (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package.|$|E

Several solutions have been investigated to face the problem. Among them a wide-band digital spectrometer is used together to a RFI monitoring station placed close to the radio-telescope and eventually supported by a RFI mobile laboratory. In this paper a system combining such as approaches is described. The first one is a wide-band FFT spectrometer designed for RFI purposes, then the second consists of a station dedicated to RF environment monitoring.

However, SAR echoes are often contaminated by <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>interferences</b> (RFI) from multiple broadcasting stations. Essentially, RFI suppression problem is one-dimensional stationary time series denoising problem. This article proposed a novel RFI suppression algorithm based on singular spectral analysis (SSA) from a linear invariant systems perspective. It can be seen that SSA algorithm has an equivalence relation with finite impulse response (FIR) filter banks. Besides, this article first introduce two approximated methods which can remarkably speed up spectral decomposition--Nyström method and Column-Sampling approximation--to obtain the coefficients of above SSA-FIR-filter. Simulation results and imaging results of measured data have proved the efficiency and validity of this algorithm.|$|R

However, the above frequency bands are not reserved exclusively for SAR applications. They are also occupied by other services like radio and television stations, as well as telecommunication purposes. When the carrier platform passes over these broadcasting stations, the receiver of SAR picks up the signals from these stations also. These interfere signals are called <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>interferences</b> (RFIs) which will overlay the SAR information and become visible in the SAR image [1]. Sometimes, they will make the SAR receiver saturated because their power goes beyond the receiver's dynamic load.|$|R
