5000|$|Oak wood has a {{density of}} about [...] {{creating}} great strength and hardness. The wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack {{because of its}} high tannin content. It also has very appealing grain markings, particularly when quartersawn. Oak planking was common on high status Viking longships in the 9th and 10th centuries. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the House of Commons in London and {{in the construction of}} fine furniture. Oak wood, from Quercus robur and Quercus petraea, was used in Europe for the construction of ships, especially naval men of war, until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European timber-framed buildings. Today oak wood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and for veneer production. Barrels in which wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy, Irish whiskey, Scotch whisky and Bourbon whiskey are aged are made from European and American oak. The use of oak in wine can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to the colour, taste, and aroma of the contents, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour to these drinks. The great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for the best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in American oak wood. American oak contributes greater texture and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing,</b> but produces more powerful wine bouquets. Oak wood chips are used for smoking fish, meat, cheeses, and other foods.|$|E

The rates of phosphonylation were reduced to as little as one-seventieth, mainly in mutants of the hydrogen-bond network (Glu- 202, Glu- 450, Tyr- 133). These recombinant enzymes as well as the F 338 A, W 86 A, W 86 F and D 74 N mutant HuAChEs varied in their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>aging</b> (15 - 3300 -fold relative to the wild type). The most dramatic <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>aging</b> was observed for the phosphonyl conjugate of the mutant W 86 A enzyme (1850 - 3300 -fold relative to the wild type). It is proposed that Trp- 86 contributes <b>to</b> the <b>aging</b> process by stabilizing the evolving carbonium ion on the 1, 2, 2 -trimethylpropyl moiety, via charge-pi interaction. The rate-enhancing effect of Trp- 86 provides a rationale for the unique facility of aging in soman-inhibited cholinesterases, compared with the corresponding conjugates in other serine hydrolases. Replacements of Glu- 202 by aspartic acid, glutamine or alanine residues resulted in a similar (1 / 130 - 1 / 300) decrease of the rates of aging. A comparable decrease was also observed for the conjugate of the F 338 A mutant. These results, and the similar pH dependence of aging rates for the wild-type and E 202 Q and F 338 A mutant HuAChEs, indicate that Glu- 202 is not involved in proton transfer to the phosphonyl moiety. On the basis of these findings and of molecular modelling we suggest that Glu- 202 and Phe- 338 contribute <b>to</b> the <b>aging</b> process by stabilizing the imidazolium of the catalytic triad His- 447 via charge-charge and charge-pi interactions respectively, thereby facilitating an oxonium formation on the phosphonyl moiety...|$|R

A simple AAAS, aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane (AMDES) was used as a model to better understand previous observations made on these systems (hydrolysis, condensation and possible reactions with the organic substrate). The evaluation of the mechanical properties of papers that were treated with AMDES showed that there was no formation of a polymer network on the fibres' surface.
