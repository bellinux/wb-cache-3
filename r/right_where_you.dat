500|$|After parting {{ways with}} RCA, Smith moved to Columbia Records in 1973. With her new contract, {{she insisted that}} {{she would be able to}} record one gospel album a year. She {{released}} her first gospel album under the label in November 1973, entitled God Is Abundant. In addition, the label also gave her the advantage of being able to incorporate more gospel songs into her regular country studio albums. Because of these factors, most of her singles remained out of the top ten, but she did manage to stay in the top 20 most of the decade. That year Smith recorded her first country album for the label entitled A Lady Named Smith with producer George Richey. Smith and Richey co-wrote the album's lead single, [...] "You've Got Me (<b>Right</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Want Me)", which became a minor hit on the Billboard country chart. However Smith was dissatisfied with Richey's production strategies and replaced him with Ray Baker for her next album, That's the Way Love Goes (1974). Her next single (released on That's the Way Love Goes) was written by Dallas Frazier called [...] "Ain't Love a Good Thing", which peaked at No.10 on the Hot Country Singles Chart in 1974.|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. He described himself as [...] "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" [...] before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly {{a side effect of}} his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: [...] "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't walk, you don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were sitting". He would lie in bed at night thinking [...] "You'll never act again. Why bother? You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: [...] "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity." ...|$|E

[...] His ideas are {{set forth in the}} essay [...] "The RICH Economy" [...] found in The Illuminati Papers. In an article {{critical}} of capitalism Wilson self-identified as a [...] "libertarian socialist", saying that [...] "I ask only one thing of skeptics: don’t bring up Soviet Russia, please. That horrible example of State Capitalism {{has nothing to do with}} what I, and other libertarian socialists, would offer as an alternative to the present system." [...] In his book <b>Right</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Are Sitting Now he praises the German anarchist economist Silvio Gesell.|$|E
