40|$|Background: This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the relation between individual study and group discussion. In a problem-based curriculum, {{it is expected that}} the way students prepare themselves during individual study (i. e., search and prepare the literature) will influence the quality of the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> Purpose: To investigate whether searching for different literature resources and preparing the literature (by making summaries to explain the literature) affects the quality of the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> Method: A 23 -item questionnaire was developed, reflecting 2 factors of the search phase and 1 factor of the preparing phase of the individual study. Two factors (breadth and depth of the discussion) reflected the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> Participants were 1 st-year students (N = 195, 90 %) at the Medical School of the Maastricht University in the Netherlands during the academic year 1997 - 1998. Results: Regression analyses show that the search phase and the preparing phase explained 29 % of the variance of the breadth and 38 % of the depth of the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> Conclusions: Searching different literature resources has a small and negative impact {{on the quality of the}} <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> However, preparing extensively for the next tutorial meeting is very important, especially for the depth of the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> Therefore, when new knowledge must be integrated in the tutorial group, students must be taught to prepare themselves by making summaries that are useful and effective during the discussion...|$|E

Consequently, students {{have a great deal}} of difficulty adapting to this method, particularly regarding self-study before the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase</b> of a tutorial session. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to assess if the application of an assessment test (multiple choice questions) before the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase</b> of a tutorial session would improve the academic achievement of students at the preclinical stage of our medical course. Methods: A test consisting of five multiple choice questions, prepared by tutors of the module at hand and related to the problem-solving process of each tutorial session, was applied following the self-study phase and immediately before the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase</b> of all tutorial sessions. The questions were based on the previously established student learning goals. The assessment was applied to all modules from the fifth to the eighth semesters. The final scores achieved by students in the end-of-module tests were compared. Results: Overall, the mean test score was 65. 2 ± 0. 7 % before and 68. 0 ± 0. 7 % after the introduction of an assessment test before the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase</b> (P 0. 05). Students in the eighth semester scored 71. 8 ± 2. 3 % compared to 70 ± 2 % when they were in the seventh semester (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: In our medical course, the application of an assessment test (a multiple choice test) before the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase</b> of the problem-based learning tutorial process increases the overall academic achievement of students, especially of those in the sixth semester in comparison with when they were in the fifth semester.

40|$|Abstract—Typically, each {{cooperative}} {{spectrum sensing}} process requires two phases: the primary user’s signal detection phase, {{in which all}} cognitive users attempt to detect {{the presence of the}} primary user within a certain observation window (called signal detection overhead); and the initial detection result <b>reporting</b> <b>phase,</b> in which the cognitive users forward their detection results to a fusion center. To avoid interfering with the primary user in the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase,</b> previous research assumed that there is a common control channel (also known as dedicated reporting channel) between the cognitive users and fusion center, which, however, requires extra channel resources and introduces an additional complexity due to the dedicated channel resource management. In this paper, we propose a selective-relay based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme, which is able to control and reduce the interference from cognitive reporting users t...|$|E

In this paper, cooperative spectrum sensing in CRNs is studied as a three-phase process composed of local sensing, reporting, and decision/data fusion. Then, a significant tradeoff in designing the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase,</b> i. e., {{the effect of the}} number of bits used in local sensing quantization on the overall sensing performance is identified and formulated. In addition, a novel approach is proposed to jointly optimize the linear soft-combining scheme at the fusion phase with the number of quantization bits used by each sensing node at the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> The proposed optimization is represented using the conventional false alarm and missed detection probabilities, {{in the form of a}} mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The solution is developed as a branch-and-bound procedure based on convex hull relaxation, and a low-complexity suboptimal approach is also provided. Finally, the performance improvement associated with the proposed joint optimization scheme, which is due to better exploitation of spatial/user diversities in CRNs, is demonstrated by a set of illustrative simulation results...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} provide an account of how {{learning}} takes place in problem-based learning (PBL), and to identify {{the relationships between the}} learning-oriented activities of students with their learning outcomes. First, the verbal interactions and computer resources studied by nine students for an entire PBL cycle were recorded. The relevant concepts articulated and studied individually while working on the problem-at-hand were identified as units of analysis and counted to demonstrate the growth in concepts acquired over the PBL cycle. We identified two distinct phases in the process-an initial concept articulation, and a later concept repetition phase. To overcome the sample-size limitations of the first study, we analyzed the verbal interactions of, and resources studied, by another 35 students in an entire PBL cycle using structural equation modeling. Results show that students' verbal contributions during the problem analysis phase strongly influenced their verbal contributions during self-directed learning and reporting phases. Verbal contributions and individual study influenced similarly the contributions during the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> Increased verbalizations of concepts during the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase</b> also led to higher achievement. We found that collaborative learning is significant in the PBL process, and may be more important than individual study in determining students' achievement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the perceptions of first and third year medical students on self-study and reporting processes of Problem-based Learning (PBL) sessions and their usage of learning resources. Methods The questionnaire applied to the students consisted of; questions about students' perceptions on searching and preparing phases of the self-study process, the breadth and depth of discussion during <b>reporting</b> <b>phase</b> and the usage of learning resources. Results First-year students spent more time for self-study and more highly rated the depth of discussion compared to third-year students. The searching and preparing phases of the self-study process were considered as statistically important factors strongly influencing the breadth and depth of discussion during the <b>reporting</b> <b>phase.</b> The effect of extensiveness of searching on the depth of discussion was negative among the first-year students, and positive among third-year students. Conclusions The relative shortness of third-year students' self-study periods can be related to their mental weariness, decreased motivation or first-year students' slowness in accessing appropriate resources. The third-year students' more frequent use of textbooks may be due to the improvement of their abilities in reaching relevant learning resources. The findings implied that the increase in students' PBL experience paralleled the development of their discussion skills using different learning resources. </p...|$|E
