25|$|The men {{selected}} for Operation Musketoon were two officers and eight men from No. 2 Commando and two Norwegian corporals from the Norwegian Independent Company 1, {{part of the}} Special Operations Executive. The raid was commanded by Captain Graeme Black, from Ontario in Canada. The second in command was Captain Joseph Houghton. The other men from No. 2 Commando were: Company Sergeant Major Miller Smith, Lance Sergeant Richard O'Brien, Lance Bombardier William Chudley and privates John Fairclough, Cyril Abram, Eric Curtis, Reginald Makeham and Fred Trigg. The two Norwegian corporals were Erling Djupdraet and Sverre Granlund. For a fortnight before leaving for Norway, the team had been training on a large country estate in Scotland. During the planning stage the commandos {{were supposed to be}} picked up after the raid, by a Short Sunderland flying boat. This was cancelled before they left, due to risks to the aircraft. Instead they would head for neutral Sweden. To assist in this, each man was issued with special equipment, which included a silk map of Norway and Sweden, a <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> map of Russia and Norwegian Kroner notes. They also carried two compasses (one sewn into each collar tab), a hacksaw blade, a fighting knife and a Colt pistol. The only other small arm taken was a suppressed Sten gun, carried by Captain Houghton.|$|E

500|$|The film {{followed}} McCay's earlier {{successes in}} animation: Little Nemo (1911), How a Mosquito Operates (1912), and Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). [...] McCay drew these earlier films on <b>rice</b> <b>paper,</b> onto which backgrounds {{had to be}} laboriously traced; The Sinking of the Lusitania was the first film McCay made using the new, more efficient cel technology. [...] McCay and his assistants spent twenty-two months making the film. [...] His subsequent animation output suffered setbacks, as the film was not as commercially successful as his earlier efforts, and Hearst put increased pressure on McCay to devote his time to editorial drawings.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{the flip}} books his son brought home, McCay said he [...] "came {{to see the}} {{possibility}} of making moving pictures" [...] of his cartoons. [...] His first animated film, Little Nemo (1911), was composed of four thousand drawings on <b>rice</b> <b>paper.</b> [...] His next film, How a Mosquito Operates (1912), naturalistically shows a giant mosquito draw blood from a sleeping man until it burst. [...] McCay followed this with a film that became an interactive part of his vaudeville shows: in Gertie the Dinosaur (1914), McCay commanded his animated dinosaur with a whip on stage.|$|E
500|$|Gertie was McCay's {{first piece}} of {{animation}} with detailed backgrounds. [...] Main production began in mid-1913. [...] Working in his spare time, McCay drew thousands of frames of Gertie on [...] sheets [...] of <b>rice</b> <b>paper,</b> a medium good for drawing as it did not absorb ink, and as it was translucent it was ideal for the laborious retracing of backgrounds, a job that fell to art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons. [...] The drawings themselves occupied a [...] area of the paper, marked with registration marks in the corners to reduce jittering of the images when filmed.

[...] Most of the film's running time is made up of a live-action sequence in which McCay bets his colleagues that he can make drawings that move.

[...] Live-action sequences were added to {{the beginning and end of}} the film, in which McCay bets his newspaper colleagues that in one month he can make four thousand drawings that move. [...] Among those featured in these sequences were cartoonist George McManus and actor John Bunny. [...] Little Nemo debuted in movie theatres on April 8, 1911, and four days later McCay began using it as part of his vaudeville act.

2500|$|Although Pape used a ruled {{edge and}} a compass {{to create the}} lines in Sem Título [...] (1959), there are slight {{variations}} in {{the width of the}} lines, revealing that a hand rather than a machine made the forms. Additionally, the <b>rice</b> <b>paper's</b> delicacy had absorbed the ink, creating imprecise edges. The black ink of the woodprint's background also reveals the natural wood grain of the block print as one can see the porous marks of the wood between the incised lines on the print.

Also, the specimen surface when increasing NaOH indicates that the paper has improved fiber structure with fine arrangement to each other.

The Tecelares wood prints were originally seen purely as works of Concrete art because of their precise and geometric aesthetic. The woodblock prints are minimalistic; they feature planes of black ink and thin lines that reveal the white <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> underneath. The production of the series seems straightforward: Pape incised the entire surface of the woodblock with thin lines, adding several non-orthogonal lines to create the appearance of distinct planes and the suggestion of movement and space in a work that would be otherwise flat and static.|$|E
2500|$|Many panel {{paintings}} were critically damaged {{as a result}} of water saturating their wood, causing the glue and gesso, which compose the priming layer, to dissolve.

[...] Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. Nystatin, an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing.
