30|$|The {{handover}} process {{requires a}} smooth transfer of a UE’s active connection when {{moving from one}} cell to another, while still maintaining the guaranteed QoS. The objective is to have mobility procedures resulting in low probability of experiencing <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> <b>failures,</b> HOFs, and PP events. Mobility solutions meeting those objectives are often said to be robust. The enhancement for handover robustness in HetNet LTE networks {{have been subject to}} recent interest. In LTE Rel- 11, mobility enhancements in HetNets have been investigated through a dedicated study item [2]. In this study item and cited work items therein, mobility performance enhancement solutions for co-channel HetNets are analyzed taking into account mobility robustness improvement. Proposed solutions are related to optimizing the handover procedure by dynamically adapting handover parameters for different cell sizes and UE velocities.|$|R
30|$|In {{traditional}} mobility management schemes, the handover {{parameters are}} {{set by the}} mobile operator, which is inefficiency and inaccurate. Recently, mobility robustness optimization (MRO) {{as one of the}} usecases in the self-organization networks has been studied to reduce <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> <b>failures</b> (RLFs) and unnecessary handovers due to improper handover parameter settings [2]. However, traditional handover optimization is inappropriate for different characteristics in macrocell-femtocell hybrid deployment compared with those in macrocell due to the dynamic channel conditions and different mobility patterns. On one hand, the large number of femtocells makes it difficult to configure and maintains handover parameter optimization using existing schemes; on the other hand, since femtocell could be frequently turned on/off, channel conditions and neighboring cell list change frequently. To the best of authors’ knowledge, there are few studies focusing on mobility robustness optimization in femtocell networks.|$|R

In particular, the number of reselections per second (nRes/s), the number of HOs per second (nHO/s), the HO ping-pong ratio (HO PP ratio) and the <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> <b>failure</b> ratio (RLF ratio) are shown. The main difference in signaling cost between the proposed settings (AP 1 and AP 2) and the reference case (AP 0) is {{that the number of}} reselections is increased by approximately 20 % and 40 % with 50 % and 100 % LTE penetrations, respectively. Regarding the radio aspect, there is no appreciable difference between settings, only that the RLF ratio is decreased by approximately 1 % when the LTE penetration changes from 50 % to 100 %.|$|E

In addition, {{a significant amount of}} traffic can be transferred from HSPA pico-cells to the LTE pico-layer, thus, reducing the interference that the HSPA pico-layer causes to the macro-layer and increasing the total carried traffic. More specifically, the benefits of this technique are lower dropping ratio (up to 8 % decrease) and lower signaling cost (30 % decrease).

Given the peculiarities of PS communications, the event of handover (HO) is particularly crucial for PS users. It is well understood that a trade-off exists between events of <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> <b>failure</b> (RLF) and HO completion, which is usually achieved by proper tuning of handover parameters.

30|$|To {{cope with}} the {{wireless}} traffic demand within the next decade, operators are underlaying their macro-cellular networks with low-power base stations (BSs) [1]. Such networks are typically referred as heterogeneous networks (HetNets), and their deployment entails a number of challenges in terms of capacity, coverage, mobility management (MM), and mobility load balancing across multiple network tiers [2]. Mobility management, in particular, is essential to ensure a continuous connectivity to mobile user equipment (UE) while maintaining satisfactory quality of service (QoS). Therefore, poor mobility management may lead to handover <b>failures</b> (HOFs), <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> <b>failures,</b> as well as unnecessary handovers, typically referred as ping-pong (PP) events. Such deficiencies result in low resource utilization efficiency and poor user experience. In order to solve such problems, mobility parameters in each cell need to be dynamically optimized according to cell traffic loads, coverage areas of different cells, and velocities of the UE.|$|R

In this paper, we propose a self-optimizing handover hysteresis scheme with dual mobile relay nodes for wireless networks in high-speed mobile environments. The proposed mechanism tunes the hysteresis and cell individual offset handover parameters based on the velocity of the vehicle and the handover performance indicator, which affects the handover triggering decision and performance.

30|$|The MRO is a SON {{function}} {{designed to}} guarantee proper mobility, i.e., proper handover in connected mode and cell re-selection in idle mode. Among the specific goals of this function, {{we have the}} minimization of call drops, the reduction of <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> <b>failure</b> (RLF), the minimization of unnecessary handovers and ping pongs due to poor handover parameters settings, and the minimization of idle problems. Its implementation is commonly distributed. The messages containing useful information are, e.g., the S 1 AP handover request or X 2 AP handover request, the handover report, and the RLF indication/report. MRO operates over connected mode and idle mode parameters. In connected mode, it tunes meaningful handover trigger parameters, such as the event A 3 offset (when referring to intra-RAT, intra-carrier handovers), the time to trigger (TTT), or the layer 1 and layer 3 filter coefficients. In idle mode, it tunes the offset values, such as the Qoffset for the intra-RAT, intra-carrier case. CCO is a SON function, which aims to provide capacity and coverage optimization. The targets that can be optimized may be vendor dependent and include coverage, cell throughout, edge cell throughput, or a weighted combination of the above.|$|E
30|$|Although the TTT window can {{mitigate}} the wasteful ping-pong effect, {{it also can}} cause undesirable <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> <b>failure</b> (RLF) due to delayed HO. For the handover mechanism not employing the TTT window, if a UE handed over to another eNodeB returns to the host shortly, the signaling resources are wasted substantially due to frequent channel connection operations and packet loss and delay are increased due to data forwarding. However, lazy handover mechanism with too large TTT decreases the system throughput since the UE misses perfect timing of handover to the target eNodeB of better quality but keeps the connection with the serving eNodeB of poor quality. The optimal HO timing that produces the lowest ping-pong effect within allowable RLF rate {{vary depending on the}} speed of UE and the configuration of neighboring cells. The magnitude of HOM has a similar effect as TTT window. In the proposed DIHAT scheme, a smoothing factor β is thus used to finely tune the operation. Even though TTT is small and thus β becomes close to 1, Equations  11 and 12 make conspicuous handover decisions considering not only the current quality of the channel but also the previous condition of the channel and the rate of signal change.|$|E

40|$|Inbound {{handover}} (HO) or hand-in {{is accomplished}} when the user equipment (UE) performs HO from macrocell (MC) {{to a small}} cell (SC). When the UE connects to a SC {{with a time of}} stay (ToS) less than a predefined time threshold, this will result in frequent unnecessary HOs and also increase service interruption which in turn will degrade the end user quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we propose an inbound HO method for the purpose of throughput enhancement and load balancing in SC heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The impact of interference from both MC and SC tiers is considered so that the UE is offloaded from congested MC and forced to perform the HO to the SC tier that supplies a sufficient data rate by selecting a proper SC target, which has the highest signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), from a reduced neighbour cell list (NCL). The proposed method uses a modified A 3 HO triggering condition taking into account the interference and cell load. Results show that our proposed method can perform inbound HO while keeping the throughput to the maximum level.

These multi-tier deployments pose challenges to Mobility Management procedures like Handover, since traditional algorithms fail {{to keep up with}} heterogeneity, thus causing degradations in Handover performance. Finding ways to reduce unnecessary Handovers, mainly for fast moving users, and boost offloading of the lower speed ones to small cells, are subjects undergoing intense study. Most studies propose solutions based on the appropriate selection of the key parameters involved in the Handover procedure, such as the Hysteresis Margin and Time-to-Trigger.

40|$|The {{surest way to}} {{increase}} the system capacity of a wireless link is by getting the transmitter and receiver closer to each other, which creates the dual benefits of higher-quality links and more spatial reuse. In a network with nomadic users, this inevitably involves deploying more infrastructure, typically {{in the form of}} microcells, hot spots, distributed antennas, or relays. A less expensive alternative is the recent concept of femtocells also called home base stations which are data access points installed by home users to get better indoor voice and data coverage. In macro/femto hierarchical networks, {{one of the biggest challenges}} is ensuring efficient handoffs. Here in this thesis, we first evaluated received signal strength at mobile user using different path loss models (indoor and outdoor) which is the main criterion for performing handoff.

30|$|In {{high-speed}} environments, the Doppler Effects {{would lead}} to irreducible bit error rate (BER) which is called error floor [12, 13]. However, according to technical specifications (TS) of LTE [14, 15], the procedure of triggering handover contains three phases: the user equipments (UEs) measure the RSSI, RSRP or RSRQ, sent the measurement reports to source eNodeB, and then the radio resource control (RRC) of source eNodeB decides whether handover is triggered or not [16]. The 3 GPP evaluation documents [17] {{also point out that}} the handover measurement and <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> <b>failure</b> (RLF) only depend on the RSSI, RSRP or RSRQ. Though the BER performance would degrade the QoS, if the RSRP remains above a certain threshold for a fixed duration, the wireless link will be re-established and assured to complete the handover. At most of time, the high-speed train travels through the wide plain and viaduct, the line-of-sight (LOS) path experienced free-space loss only between MRS and BSs is available and there are few reflectors or scatterers. The major influence on wireless channel caused by relative motion between transmitter and receiver is Doppler shift instead of Doppler spread. Therefore in high-speed railway scenario, instead of considering Doppler Effects which degrades BER, we only need to consider Doppler shift which would impair handover performance. In [18], Doppler shift in the overlapping region of two neighboring eNodeBs (handover region) is almost unchanged, and can be compensated [19]. In this article we suppose that Train Control Information, such as train's velocity and location, can be shared by the ground eNodeBs, and Doppler shift has been compensated [20, 21].|$|E
30|$|The {{benefits}} of self-organizing networks (SONs) {{have been proven}} by several studies in recent years. Similar studies in this field [3 – 5] usually attempt to minimize {{only one of the}} HO performance indicators (HPIs), such as <b>Radio</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Failures</b> (RLFs), HO ping-pongs (HPPs) or HO failures (HOFs), in an effort of improving network performance. However, since the relationships between these HPIs is a very close one, they should be considered as a whole when trying to optimize HO performance. A control parameter setting that, for example, diminishes the occurrence of ping-pong HOs will also most likely increase the number of RLFs. User mobility history has also to be used to predict future possible HOs and choose the best HO target cell [6]. As expected, the L 3 filtering coefficient of the measurements of the strength of the cells around the user also has an impact on the HO performance [7]. The present study detailed in this article is a continuation of the studies previously presented in [8 – 10]. The aim of the default Weighted Performance based HO Parameter Optimization algorithm (WPHPO) described in these articles is to dynamically modify the settings of the control parameters according to the current network performance situation, as opposed to them being set to fixed values at all times. The main challenges facing this algorithm is finding the perfect balance between deriving the proper parameter settings of the HO process in {{a short amount of time}} and ensuring that the network is in a stable operating point for a long time afterwards. The strength of this algorithm and its enhancement resides in the fact that no new measurements, interfaces, events or signalling need to be added to the already standardized ones, which is to be considered by any operator or vendor that would implement this approach. A drawback of the default algorithm is that it is too sensitive to changes in performance, which determines a slow convergence. This problem is targeted by the enhancement presented in this article.|$|R
