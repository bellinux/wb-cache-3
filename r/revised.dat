It is based on logic programming with explicit negation and integrity constraints and provides a two-valued revision assumptions so as to remove contradictions from the knowledge base. It has been tested on a spate of examples with emphasis on modelbased diagnosis. The first prototype of the system showed that extended logic programming is well suited to solve model-based diagnosis problem [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: When {{writing a}} text, {{students}} are required to do several things simultaneously. They have to plan, translate and review, which involve demanding cognitive processes. In order to handle this complexity, writers need to develop a writing strategy. The two most well-defined writing strategies that have been identified, are those of a planning strategy and a <b>revising</b> strategy. Aims: To establish whether students will be more competent in managing the complexity of writing when writing instruction is adapted to their habitual writing strategy, thus resulting in better texts. Sample: 113 high school students (10 th grade). Method: Students were randomly assigned to either the planning or the <b>revising</b> condition. To identify writing strategies, students completed a questionnaire concerning their planning and <b>revising</b> tendencies. To measure the level of writing skill, students' texts written during pre-test and post-test were analysed. Results: The effect of instruction based on a planning strategy interacted with the level of planning or <b>revising</b> strategy: the greater the use of such a strategy, the larger the effect on writing skill. In contrast, the effect of instruction based on a <b>revising</b> writing strategy did not interact with the level of planning or <b>revising</b> strategy. Results imply that students with strong tendencies to plan or <b>revise</b> profited from writing instruction based on a planning strategy, while students with a low tendency to plan or <b>revise</b> profited more from instruction based on a <b>revising</b> strategy. Conclusion: Adapting writing instruction to students' level of writing strategy, is an effective approach for learning to write...|$|R
