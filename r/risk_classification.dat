40|$|Genomic aberrations are of {{predominant}} {{importance to}} the biology and clinical outcome of patients with acute myelog-enous leukemia (AML), and conventional karyotype-based <b>risk</b> <b>classifications</b> are routinely used in clinical decision making in AML. One of the known limitations of cytogenetic analysis is the inability to detect genomic abnormalities less than 5 Mb in size, and it is currently unclear whether overcoming this limitation with high-resolution genomic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis would be clinically relevant. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of molecular mechanisms/ aberrations that underlie the conventional karyotype-based <b>risk</b> <b>classifications,</b> {{it is likely that}} further refinements in genomic risk prognostication can be achieved. In this study, we analyzed flow cytometer– sorted, AML blast-derived, and paired, buccal DNA from 114 previously untreated prospectively enrolled AML patients for acquired genomic copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity using Af-fymetrix SNP 6. 0 arrays, and we corre-lated genomic lesion load and specific chromosomal abnormalities with patient survival. Using multivariate analyses, we found that having> 2 genomic lesions detected through SNP 6. 0 array profiling approximately doubles the risk of death when controlling for age- and karyotype-based risk. Finally, we identified an inde-pendent negative prognostic impact of p 53 mutations, or p 53 mutations and 17 p-loss of heterozygosity combined on sur-vival in AML. (Blood. 2010; 116 (23) ...|$|R
