40|$|Constraint-based {{approaches}} recently {{brought new}} insight into {{our understanding of}} metabolism. By making very simple assumptions such as {{that the system is}} at steady-state and some reactions are irreversible, and without requiring kinetic parameters, general properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system can be derived. A central concept in this methodology is <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> an elementary mode (EM for short) which represents a minimal functional subsystem. <b>The</b> computation <b>of</b> EMs still forms a limiting step in metabolic studies and several algorithms have been proposed to address this problem leading to increasingly faster methods. However, although a theoretical upper bound on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> elementary modes that a network may possess has been established, surprisingly, <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> this problem has never been systematically studied. In this paper, we give a systematic overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> optimisation problems related to modes. We first establish results regarding network consistency. Most consistency problems are easy, i. e., they can be solved in polynomial time, We then establish <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> finding and counting elementary modes. We show in particular that finding one elementary mode is easy but that this task becomes hard when a specific EM (i. e. an EM containing some specified reactions) is sought. We then show that counting <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> elementary modes is #P-complete. We emphasize that the easy problems can be solved using Currently existing software packages. We then analyse <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> a closely related task which is <b>the</b> computation <b>of</b> so-called minimum <b>reaction</b> cut sets and we show that this problem is hard. We then present two positive results which both allow to avoid computing EMs as a prior to <b>the</b> computation <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>cuts.</b> <b>The</b> first one is a polynomial approximation algorithm for finding a minimum reaction <b>cut</b> set. <b>The</b> second one is a test for verifying whether a set <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> constitutes a reaction Cut; this test can be readily included in existing algorithms to improve their performance. Finally, we discuss <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> other cut-related problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> cutting design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{chain saw}} {{is defined by}} the number, the {{arrangement}} and <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting tools. When using chisel cutting tools, the cross sectional area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> and <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groove are determined by the width and depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut.</b> <b>The</b> laboratory tests analyzed <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross sectional area and <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> on <b>the</b> forces and the specific energy. The testing was performed on a linear cutting machine with tool holders and cutting tools in real-scale size. According to the processed statistical data, increasing the cross sectional area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> reduces <b>the</b> specific energy, whereby <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> has a considerably larger impact. The tests have shown that besides the cross sectional area <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface also affects the forces and specific energy. Through increasing the width to depth ratio upon a constant cross sectional area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific energy and the cutting forces are reduced.

40|$|Laser cutting {{has become}} an {{acceptable}} process in automated sheet metal industry. Efficiency and quality can be maintained with laser cutting.

40|$|We {{consider}} the nilpotent left-invariant sub-Riemannian structure on the Engel group. This structure gives a fundamental local approximation of a generic rank 2 sub-Riemannian structure on a 4 -manifold near a generic point (in particular, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinematic models <b>of</b> {{a car with}} a trailer). On the other hand, this is the simplest sub-Riemannian structure of step three. We describe <b>the</b> global structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus (<b>the</b> set <b>of</b> points where geodesics lose their global optimality), the Maxwell set (<b>the</b> set <b>of</b> points that admit more than one minimizer), and <b>the</b> intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus with <b>the</b> caustic (<b>the</b> set <b>of</b> conjugate points along all geodesics). <b>The</b> group <b>of</b> symmetries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus is described: it is generated by a one-parameter group of dilations R_+ and a discrete group of reflections Z_ 2 ×Z_ 2 ×Z_ 2. <b>The</b> <b>cut</b> locus admits a stratification with 6 three-dimensional strata, 12 two-dimensional strata, and 2 one-dimensional strata. Three-dimen-sional strata <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus are Maxwell strata of multiplicity 2 (for each point there are 2 minimizers). Two-dimensional strata <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus consist <b>of</b> conjugate points. Finally, one-dimensional strata are Maxwell strata of infinite multiplicity, they consist of conjugate points as well. Projections of sub-Riemannian geodesics to the 2 -dimensional plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution are Euler elasticae. For each point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus, we describe the Euler elasticae corresponding to minimizers coming to this point.
