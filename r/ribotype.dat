The isolates divided into six serotypes, 23 EcoRI <b>ribotypes,</b> 54 AscI PFGE types, and 57 final subtypes if all results were combined. The discrimination index of <b>ribotyping</b> was lower (0. 873) than that of PFGE (0. 946). Two final subtypes dominated among human isolates, and identical subtypes were also found among food industry isolates. All PFGE types were serotype-specific, whereas two <b>ribotypes</b> included isolates of two serotypes. Isolates of serotype 3 a, involved in an outbreak in Finland in 1999, matched one of these <b>ribotypes,</b> which also included some food industry isolates of serotype l/ 2 a. <b>Ribotyping</b> with EcoRI {{would not have been}} sufficient to define the outbreak in Finland caused by serotype 3 a isolates.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} any change in PCR ribotypes and to determine the antimicrobial resistance of common PCR ribotypes over a 10 -year period in a tertiary care hospital. We conducted PCR ribotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and DNA gyrase sequencing to identify changes in 1407 Clostridium difficile non-duplicated isolates obtained between 2000 and 2009. A total of 74 different ribotypes were found. The most prevalent <b>ribotype</b> was <b>ribotype</b> 001 (26. 1 %).

40|$|Since 2002, an {{epidemic}} of Clostridium difficile infections has occurred in southern Quebec, Canada. At Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the incidence of C. difficile infections increased from 11 / 1, 000 admissions (1999 to 2002) to 27 / 1, 000 admissions (2003 to 2005). We compared the exposures and outcomes for patients infected with strains with different ribopatterns isolated before (n = 55) and during (n = 175) the epidemic, {{as well as the}} in vitro activities of antibiotics against those isolates. During the preepidemic period, 46 isolates (84 %) were of <b>ribotype</b> 001, 1 was of <b>ribotype</b> 027, and 8 were of other ribopattern types. During the epidemic period, <b>ribotype</b> 027 strains accounted for 140 (80 %) isolates; 26 (15 %) were of <b>ribotype</b> 001, and 7 were of other ribopattern types. <b>Ribotype</b> 027 strains were highly resistant to fluoroquinolones (FQs) but were susceptible to clindamycin. A pattern of prior specific antibiotic exposure that selected for antibiotic-resistant <b>ribotype</b> C. difficile infections was observed for FQs (<b>ribotype</b> 027) and clindamycin (<b>ribotype</b> 001). The rate of mortality was higher among older patients, those with a high Charlson comorbidity index, and those with longer previous hospitalizations. By multivariate analysis, patients infected with <b>ribotype</b> 027 were twice as likely to die within 30 days of diagnosis than patients infected with other ribotypes (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 06; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 00 to 4. 22). The observations from this study support the notion that continued selective antibiotic pressure resulted in the superimposition of the hypertoxigenic <b>ribotype</b> 027 clone on top of the prior dominant <b>ribotype</b> 001 clone in a setting of preexisting high endemicity, thus leading to the high rates of morbidity and mortality seen in the Quebec outbreak.

40|$|Introduction: Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) is {{the major}} bacterial agent causing hospital-acquired diarrhea. The incidence and severity of CDI has increased significantly in recent decades. The distribution of PCR <b>ribotype</b> varies among the countries. PCR <b>ribotype</b> 017 and 002 are the predominant ribotypes in China and Hong Kong respectively. Molecular characterization of C. difficile isolates is useful for outbreak investigation and surveillance. Both PCR ribotyping and Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) are reliable molecular tools for characterization of C. difficile from outbreak and sporadic case. MLVA allows subtyping of genetically related C. difficile isolates of the same <b>ribotype</b> by their distinctive MLVA patterns. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the outbreak and sporadic C. difficile isolates of PCR <b>ribotype</b> 002 and 017 by using capillary gel electrophoresis-based PCR ribotyping and MLVA. Their cytotoxicity, sporulation rate and germination efficiency were also investigated in the study. Results: A total of the 26 C. difficile isolates were identified by PCR ribotyping including fifteen isolates of PCR <b>ribotype</b> 002, eight isolates of <b>ribotype</b> 017, and three isolates of other ribotypes. The isolates of the same ribotypes were further sub-typed into outbreak and sporadic cluster. All isolates showed toxin-producing capability. The sporualtion rates of outbreak isolates of PCR <b>ribotype</b> 002 were significantly higher than that of sporadic isolates of PCR <b>ribotype</b> 002. Statistically higher sporulation rate was also observed in the outbreak isolates of PCR <b>ribotype</b> 017. The germination rate was also statistically higher in the outbreak isolates of PCR <b>ribotype</b> 002 than the sporadic cases. Conclusion: Capillary electrophoresis-based PCR ribotyping identified fifteen C. difficile PCR <b>ribotype</b> 002 and eight PCR <b>ribotype</b> 017 in this study. MLVA then refined these isolates into two corresponding sub-groups of outbreak and sporadic isolates. Higher sporulation and germination rates were observed in the outbreak isolates. Sporadic isolates demonstrated relatively lower sporulation and germination rates. The current evidences correlate the genotypic characterization to sporulation activity and germination efficiency. published_or_final_versionMicrobiologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E

40|$|Clostridium difficile {{infection}} {{is the most}} common cause of severe cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and is a signifi-cant health burden. Recent increases in the rate of C. difficile infection have paralleled the emergence of a specific phylogenetic clade of C. difficile strains (<b>ribotype</b> 027; North American pulsed-field electrophoresis 1 [NAP 1]; restriction endonuclease analy-sis [REA] group BI). Initial reports indicated that <b>ribotype</b> 027 strains were associated with increased morbidity andmortality andmight be hypervirulent. Although subsequent work has raised some doubt as to whether <b>ribotype</b> 027 strains are hyperviru-lent, the strains are considered epidemic isolates that have caused severe outbreaks across the globe. We hypothesized that one factor that could lead to the increased prevalence of <b>ribotype</b> 027 strains would be if these strains had increased competitive fit-ness compared to strains of other ribotypes. We developed a moderate-throughput in vitro model of C. difficile infection and used it to test competition between four <b>ribotype</b> 027 clinical isolates and clinical isolates of four other ribotypes (001, 002, 014, and 053).

Sequencing of strains of different PCR ribotypes (001, 012, 014, 017, 027 and 078) showed that SlpA was conserved among strains belonging to the same PCR <b>ribotype.</b> Comparison of the LMW SLP region among these strains identified ten regions with sequence identity between PCR ribotypes 027 and 001, and low conservation with the other PCR ribotypes. In particular, two of these regions corresponded to areas predicted to be surface exposed. Three specific peptides, including those of the two surface-exposed regions, were recognized by human sera against PCR ribotypes 027 and 001 and by a rabbit polyclonal serum against the SLPs of PCR <b>ribotype</b> 027. In contrast, these peptides were not recognized by a polyclonal serum against the SLPs of PCR <b>ribotype</b> 012 used as a control. These results confirm the antigenic role of the LMW SLP and suggest that it may have a role in evasion of the host immune response...|$|E
40|$|A {{standardized}} {{scheme of}} 27 different BglI ribotypes and subtypes of Vibrio cholerae O 1 strains is proposed {{on the basis}} of data from 214 human and environmental strains isolated in 35 countries and 14 U. S. states over the past 60 years. The <b>ribotype</b> patterns obtained are reproducible and stable over time. Seven different but very similar ribotypes (1 a to 1 g) were observed among 16 strains of the classical biotype. Twenty ribotypes and subtypes were identified among 198 V. cholerae O 1 strains of the El Tor biotype. Six different patterns were found among the strains causing the current seventh pandemic. Strains of <b>ribotype</b> 8 originated only in central African countries, while those of <b>ribotype</b> 3 originated mainly in Asia and the Pacific Islands. The most widely distributed strains were those of <b>ribotype</b> 6, which was subdivided into three very similar but still distinguishable subtypes. The present Latin American epidemic is caused by strains of <b>ribotype</b> 5. Strains of this <b>ribotype</b> were isolated from several other geographic locations but can be differentiated from the Latin American strains by other molecular methods. Strains associated with two documented environmental reservoirs exhibited three distinct <b>ribotype</b> patterns; those isolated from patients who ate food from the U. S. Gulf waters were all of <b>ribotype</b> 2, while the strains related to the northeast Australian rivers were of ribotypes 9 and 10. Nontoxigenic V. cholerae O 1 strains originating in Latin America and the U. S. Gulf Coast did not form a specific cluster of ribotypes. Ribotyping in combination with other well-defined methods can assist in epidemiologic investigations, helping to trace the movement of strains and to identify their geographic origins...|$|E
40|$|Pulsed-field gel {{electrophoresis}} (PFGE) after SmaI restriction of DNA from 239 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates (from 142 patients) produced 26 different fingerprints. The deduced chromosome sizes ranged from 2, 200 to 3, 100 kb (+/- 100 kb). A total of 81 isolates taken from 65 patients were then typed by PFGE and <b>ribotyping</b> with ClaI, EcoRI, and HindIII. <b>Ribotypes</b> were less discriminating than PFGE. <b>Ribotyping</b> did not discriminate isolates from a given PFGE fingerprint into different subsets. PFGE {{may be a}} more effective epidemiological tool than <b>ribotyping</b> for the typing of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo analyze, by primer-specific {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) and <b>ribotyping,</b> coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). MethodsForty-five clinical isolates of CNS were identified by the API ID 32 STAPH system and <b>ribotyping.</b> Additionally, primer-specific PCR was evaluated for identification of clinical strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. ResultsForty-five isolates of CNS from neonates with nosocomial bacteremia were studied. The results of the S. epidermidis-specific PCR were compared with those obtained using <b>ribotyping</b> and the API ID 32 STAPH system. Excellent congruence was found between primer-specific PCR and <b>ribotyping.</b> Primer-specific PCR {{proved to be a}} fast and reliable method for the identification of S. epidermidis strains. According to the primer-specific PCR and <b>ribotyping</b> analysis, a few CNS isolates were found to be incorrectly identified by the API ID 32 STAPH system. ConclusionsPrimer-specific PCR is a fast and reliable method for the identification of S. epidermidis. Primer-specific PCR in combination with <b>ribotyping</b> is a promising approach for studying the epidemiology of S. epidermidis and other CNS species in hospital...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of 143 Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 strains isolated from shrimp farms in Thailand were characterized and grouped by ribotyping. Sixty-four ribotypes were distinguished following digestion of chromosomal DNA with the restriction enzyme BglI, and the reproducibility {{of the method}} was 100 %. There was no correlation between specific <b>ribotype</b> distributions and {{the locations of the}} shrimp farms. <b>Ribotype</b> similarity was examined by cluster analysis, and two main groups with 10 and 54 ribotypes, respectively, were found. Correlation between <b>ribotype</b> and O-antigen expression was shown to exist among those isolates tested. Ribotyping appears to be a suitable method for differentiating environmental V. cholerae non-O 1 strains, and comparison of <b>ribotype</b> patterns showed a high degree of genetic divergence within V. cholerae non-O 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 113 Bordetella bronchiseptica strains, {{isolated}} from 11 different host species worldwide, {{were characterized by}} ribotyping with restriction enzyme PvuII. Sixteen distinct ribotypes were identified, and each <b>ribotype</b> contained five to seven restriction fragments {{ranging in size from}} 1. 8 to 5. 6 kb. Approximately 88 % of the swine isoaltes were identified as <b>ribotype</b> 3 strains. Isolates from dogs also displayed little variation; 74. 1 % were found to be <b>ribotype</b> 4 strains. Strains obtained from the remaining nine host species belonged to 15 different ribotypes. There was no association between geographic location and <b>ribotype.</b> The technique which we used may be useful for epidemiologic studies in which the transmission of B. bronchiseptica, both within and between species, is investigated...|$|E
40|$|Forty-three {{clinical}} {{strains of}} V. cholerae O 1 biotype E 1 Tor were isolated between 3 May and 10 June 1998 during an outbreak {{in the metropolitan}} area of Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs. With the exception of three Inaba strains that were restricted to three members of a family, all the others belonged to the Ogawa serotype. The strains were analysed for clonality using ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Two ribotypes, V/B 21 a and B 27, were identified among 40 Ogawa isolates using BglI restriction endonuclease. <b>Ribotype</b> V/B 21 a has been described previously from Taiwan and Colombia and several Asian countries while B 27 has been reported among isolates from Senegal. The three Inaba strains belonged to one <b>ribotype,</b> designated type A, not previously reported. PFGE analysis using NotI revealed that all isolates within a <b>ribotype</b> had identical profiles demonstrating clonality amongst the strains. Dice coefficient analysis of the two Ogawa genotypes revealed 89 % similarity on <b>ribotype</b> patterns and 91. 3 % on PFGE profiles. <b>Ribotype</b> V/B 21 a isolates were associated with cases from dispersed areas of Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs while <b>ribotype</b> B 27 was restricted to cases from one particular area suggesting a common-source outbreak...|$|E
40|$|Intraspecies {{genotypic}} heterogeneity among Haemophilus ducreyi isolates {{was examined}} by using genomic fingerprints with rRNA from Escherichia coli as a probe. DNA from 44 isolates of H. ducreyi was digested by restriction endonuclease HincII or HindIII, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with 32 P-labeled 16 S and 23 S rRNA. HincII digests yielded four hybridization patterns (<b>ribotypes),</b> whereas HindIII digests yielded eight <b>ribotypes.</b> Four HincII and five HindIII <b>ribotypes</b> were observed among 14 H. ducreyi isolates collected within {{a period of}} 1 month in Kenya, where chancroid is endemic. In contrast, one HincII and two HindIII <b>ribotypes</b> were observed among 28 isolates collected during the Orange County, Calif., chancroid epidemic that occurred in 1981 and 1982. The plasmid content, in conjunction with <b>ribotyping,</b> provided additional differentiation among some isolates of H. ducreyi. This study demonstrates that <b>ribotyping</b> of H. ducreyi {{may be used to}} study the epidemiology of chancroid...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTAs routine {{identification}} of coagulase-negative staphylococci is problematic, {{the performance of}} automated <b>ribotyping</b> was evaluated for {{identification of}} coagulase-negative staphylococci other than Staphylococcus epidermidis. In total, 177 isolates were tested, comprising 149 isolates from blood samples, 15 isolates that were not identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) -PCR in a previous study, and 13 reference strains. The identification results were compared with those obtained by the API 20 Staph system, with standard phenotypic and molecular methods as reference. Most (n = 166; 93. 8 %) isolates were identified correctly by automated <b>ribotyping.</b> For 61 isolates, API 20 Staph and <b>ribotyping</b> were in agreement, but for 105 isolates, <b>ribotyping</b> provided correct identification and API 20 Staph did not. Four isolates not identified by automated <b>ribotyping</b> were recognised correctly by API 20 Staph. The remaining seven isolates could not be identified by {{either of the two}} methods. Automated <b>ribotyping</b> was able to distinguish Staphylococcus capitis reliably from Staphylococcus caprae. The results demonstrate the value of automated <b>ribotyping</b> for identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) isolates from human sources and may help to clarify the clinical relevance of CoNS species. In addition, automated <b>ribotyping</b> was able to detect polymorphisms that may be useful for epidemiological purposes within S. capitis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans, S. caprae, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus schleiferi, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus pasteuri and Staphylococcus xylosus...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{carry out}} an {{epidemiologic}} evaluation of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis outbreaks in households and small communities by means of rRNA gene restriction pattern analysis (<b>ribotyping).</b> MethodsOne hundred Enteritidis isolates dating from 1989 to 1994 which could be allocated epidemiologically to different sources or to small community outbreaks were investigated with <b>ribotyping,</b> a fingerprinting method in which bacterial DNA is hybridized with the biotin-labeled plasmid pKK 3535 containing a ribosomal RNA operon of Escherichia coli to determine the ribosomal RNA gene restriction patterns. ResultsFour different <b>ribotyping</b> patterns were found with the restriction endonuclease SmaI and nine with SphI. <b>Ribotypes</b> of isolates which could be allocated epidemiologically to a common source usually corresponded. Almost 60 % of the Enteritidis infections had the <b>ribotyping</b> pattern SphI-A. In contrast, this pattern was not found {{in any of the}} five Enteritidis strains isolated in 1989. The suspicion that Enteritidis phage type 4 infections are caused by consumption of insufficiently heated eggs is supported {{by the fact that the}} <b>ribotyping</b> pattern Sph 1 -A was found in isolates from eggs and from human specimens. ConclusionsAs patterns SphI-A and SmaI-J appeared in 58 % and 75 % of the isolates, respectively, <b>ribotyping</b> cannot be used for the differentiation between various outbreaks with these two patterns. In cases where the Enteritidis strains showed less frequent patterns, <b>ribotyping</b> seems to be a practical tool for the identification of infection chains. In addition newly appearing <b>ribotyping</b> patterns can give information about the epidemiologic development of Enteritidis infection...|$|R
