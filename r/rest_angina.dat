40|$|Nineteen {{patients}} with recurrent <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> were given oral nifedipine. All patients had chest discomfort refractory to propranolol and oral or topical nitrates given to tolerance.

40|$|Several autopsy studies {{indicate}} that disrupted atherosclerotic plaques particularly those rich in lipid with associated thrombus. are the cause of acute MI. Other plaques without disruption are fibrocellular without lipid. Although unstable <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> (UA) shares a common pathogenesis to acute MI, there are little pathological data on plaque composition in UA. Directional Coronary Atherectomy (DCA) provides the opportunity to study plaque composition in UA. MethodsWe prospectively analyzed the DCA tissue specimens of 60 pts with de novo culprit lesions for fibrocellular and lipid constituents by hematoxylin & eosin and oil red O stains. A fibrous plaque (FP) was defined as one which had predominantly fibrous and sclerotic tissue with no or minimallipid (0 or 1 +on scale of 3). A lipid plaque (LP) was defined as one with moderate or high lipid (2 or 3 +) content. The presence of inflammatory cells and thrombus were also noted. Histopathology was analyzed independent of clinical presentation.

40|$|Reports {{of acute}} ischemic events after {{withdrawal}} of calcium antagonist therapy in outpatients and during bypass surgery {{in patients with}} prior angina at rest prompted {{the examination of the}} effect of nifedipine withdrawal in 81 patients who had completed a prospective, double-blind randomized trial of nifedipine versus placebo for <b>rest</b> <b>angina.</b> Thirty-nine patients underwent bypass surgery for uncontrolled angina or left main coronary artery disease. No significant difference between patients withdrawn from nifedipine or placebo was seen in the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction, hypotension requiring intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, vasopressor or vasodilator requirements or incidence of significant arrhythmias. An additional 42 patients had completed 2 years on a protocol consisting of nitrates and propranolol in addition to nifedipine or placebo. During a mean of 66 hours of continuous monitoring after withdrawal of nifedipine or placebo, heart rate and blood pressure were unchanged. A worsening of previously present angina at rest occurred in five patients who had continued to experience <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> before drug withdrawal, four of whom were withdrawn from nifedipine. No patient with class I to III angina experienced new onset of <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> during drug withdrawal. No patient experienced myocardial infarction.

Patients with prior myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery were excluded, as were patients with important aortic stenosis. Each coronary artery stenosis in a major epicardial vessel was evaluated for the presence or absence of intracoronary thrombus (defined using standard criteria), complex lesion morphology (defined as the presence of haziness, a smudged appearance or irregular lesion margins) and eccentricity, and the frequency of each of these findings in groups I and II was compared. Intracoronary thrombus was present significantly more often in group I patients (42 %) than in group II patients (17 %) (χ 25. 77; p < 0. 02). Complex lesion morphology was also present significantly more often in group I (44 %) than in group II (14 %) patients (χ 28. 17; p < 0. 01). Either standard criterion for intracoronary thrombus or complex morphology was present in 70 % of group I but only 21 % of group II patients (χ 219. 7; p < 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the outcome of coronary angioplasty according to the various presentations of unstable angina pectoris. Background. Although unstable angina is a mosaic of clinical manifestations, a comprehensive analysis of short- and long-term outcome of coronary angioplasty in subsets of unstable angina is not available. Methods. Data from 15 clinical centers for the 857 patients with unstable angina in the 1985 – 1986 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty registry were analyzed. Five-year follow-up was available in > 96. 5 %. Patients were first classified as those with (679 [79 %]) or without (178 [21 %]) <b>rest</b> <b>angina.</b> Patients were also allocated to five mutually exclusive categories of decreasing unstable angina severity: postinfarction angina, acute coronary insufficiency, plain <b>rest</b> <b>angina,</b> accelerating angina and new onset angina. Results. The group with <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> had more older patients (p < 0. 01) and women (p < 0. 001), and a greater proportion had a previous myocardial infarction (p < 0. 001) and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50 % (p < 0. 01) than did the group without <b>rest</b> <b>angina.</b> Angiographic characteristics were nearly the same, whereas procedural characteristics and outcome were the same for both categories. At 5 -year follow-up, there was a higher crude mortality rate in patients with than without <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> (p < 0. 05). Resolution into five subsets yielded additional information. Women were more represented only in the acute coronary insufficiency and plain <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> subsets (p < 0. 001). Patients with angina after myocardial infarction had the second shortest history of angina (p < 0. 001), the highest percent of smokers (p < 0. 01) and, with those with acute coronary insufficiency, the highest incidence of congestive heart failure (p < 0. 05) and an ejection fraction ≤ 50 % (p < 0. 001). They had the highest percent of totally occluded arteries, coronary thrombus and collateral blood flow received but also the lowest rate of severe stenoses (p < 0. 001 for all). Patients with new onset angina had the highest prevalence of single-vessel disease (p < 0. 05), critical and complex stenoses (p < 0. 001) and no coronary angioplasty-related deaths. The crude 5 -year mortality rate was higher for both postinfarction and acute insufficiency groups (p < 0. 05) than for the other subsets. After adjustments for risk factors, no significant differences in adverse event rates remained among the different unstable angina subgroups. Conclusions. Analysis of the diverse clinical presentations of unstable angina supports underlying pathogenetic differences. Coronary angioplasty is safe and effective in all subsets of unstable angina.

40|$|A 72 -year-old {{woman came}} to our {{emergency}} department because of several prolonged episodes of <b>resting</b> <b>angina,</b> caused by emotional stress. Relevant aspects of her medical history were hypertension and hyperlipidemia. A resting 12 -lead electrocardiogram showed only minimal T-wave changes in leads I, aVL, and V 4 through V 6. Although angiography (Fig. 1) showed no substantial coronary atherosclerosis, it revealed an anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) from the right sinus of Valsalva, just above the right coronary artery ostium. The LMCA followed a prepulmonic anterior course, then bifurcated into a large, dominant circumflex coronary artery (Cx) and a small left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The ramus intermedius (RI) rose early from the LMCA, gave rise to some conal branches and a major septal branch, and passed intraseptally between the aorta and the outflow tract of the right ventricle, where it narrowed dur-ing each systole. The RI crossed under the middle LAD and emerged epicardially to reach the free lateral wall.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of spontaneous remission in variant angina, 100 patients with this diagnosis who had undergone coronary arteriography {{in the hospital and}} a follow-up of at least 1 year were studied.

Remission was diagnosed in 45 of the 100 patients who had been angina-free and had had no treatment for more than 3 months (mean 18. 3). The other 55 patients were receiving medical treatment; 37 had been angina-free for at least 6 months (mean 22. 5) and angina persisted in 18. The persistent angina group had a lower prevalence of organic coronary stenoses 70 % or greater: 4 of 18 versus 22 of 45 and 22 of 37 for the other two groups (p < 0. 05), and a longer history of <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> before admission. The remission group contained more patients (17 of 45 versus 4 of 55 [p < 0. 001]) whose attacks had been documented only by provocative testing. <b>Rest</b> <b>angina</b> recurred when calcium antagonist drugs were discontinued in 15 of 51 instances, within 1 month in 11 patients and later in 4 patients.

40|$|SUMMARY Variant angina was {{diagnosed}} after {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery in six patients over a 22 -month period. Although all six patients had at least occasional angina at rest preoperatively, all but one had predominantly exertional angina. After surgery, <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> with transient ST-segment elevation appeared in all six after an asymptomatic interval of 1 week to 4 years. In two patients the involved artery had not been bypassed, in two patients it was perfused by a patent graft and in two patients the graft to the involved vessel was occluded. Treatment with calcium antagonist drugs (four cases) or isosorbide dinitrate (one case) eliminated symptoms; one patient spontaneously became asymptomatic. The diagnosis of variant angina should be considered when <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> occurs after bypass surgery, particularly if exertional angina is absent and grafts are patent. RELIEF OF ANGINA accompanies coronaryartery bypass surgery {{in the majority of}} cases. ' Patients with incomplete revascularization may have persistent angina. Graft closure, which usually occurs in the first year after surgery, 2 and progressive occlusive disease in the native coronary circulation, which occurs in most patients by 5 - 7 years postoperatively, 3 can cause recurrent angina in some patients with an initially satisfactory surgical result. Over a 22 -month period at our institution, the cause of postoperative angina was determined to be previously undiagnosed variant angina in six patients.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was the {{investigation}} of the in vivo role of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ] and inflammatory infiltrates in the human coronary atherosclerotic plaque and their correlation with the clinical syndrome of presentation. Background. Lipoprotein(a) is an atherogenic and thrombogenic lipoprotein, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes. Lipoprotein(a) induces monocyte chemoattraction and smooth muscle cell activation in vitro. Macrophage infiltration is considered one of the mechanisms of plaque rupture. Methods. This study of atherectomy specimens investigated the in vivo role of Lp(a) at different stages of the atherogenic process, and its relationship with macrophage infiltration. We examined coronary atheroma removed from 72 patients with stable or unstable angina. Specimens were stained with antibodies specific for Lp(a), macrophages (KP- 1), and smooth muscle cells (alpha-actin). Morphometric analysis was used to quantify the plaque areas occupied by each of the three antigens, and their colocalization. Results. All specimens had localized Lp(a) staining; the mean fractional area was 58. 2 %. Ninety percent of the macrophage areas colocalized with Lp(a) positive areas, whereas 31. 3 % of the smooth muscle cell areas colocalized with Lp(a) positive areas. Patients with unstable angina (n = 46) had specimens with larger mean plaque Lp(a) areas than specimens from stable angina patients (n = 26) : 64. 4 % versus 47. 7 % (p = 0. 004). Unstable angina patients with rest pain (n = 28) had greater mean plaque Lp(a) area than unstable angina patients with crescendo exertional pain (n = 18) : 71. 1 % versus 52. 4 % (p < 0. 001). Mean KP- 1 area was 31. 2 % in unstable <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> versus 18. 3 % in stable angina (p = 0. 05); alpha-actin area was greater in stable (48. 5 %) and crescendo exertional angina (48. 8 %) than in <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> (30. 4 %). The strongest correlation between plaque KP- 1 and Lp(a) area was in unstable <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> (r = 0. 88, p < 0. 001), and between alpha-actin and Lp(a) areas in the crescendo exertional angina (r = 0. 62, p < 0. 01). Conclusions. Lipoprotein(a) is ubiquitous in human coronary atheroma. It is detected in larger amounts in tissue from culprit lesions in patients with unstable compared to stable syndromes, and has significant colocalization with plaque macrophages.

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to clarify the incidence of coronary spasm in emergency patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute chest pain at rest. BackgroundChest pain at rest is a frequent symptom in the emergency room. Acute coronary syndrome is suspected in patients with elevation of cardiac markers, ischemic electrocardiographic changes, or simply typical clinical symptoms of unstable (usually <b>resting)</b> <b>angina.</b> However, of all patients with suspected ACS who undergo coronary angiography, up to 30 % have nonobstructed coronary arteries. We sought to clarify how many of these patients suffer from coronary spasm as a possible cause of their chest pain. MethodsIn a prospective study from June to December 2006, all patients with suspected ACS who underwent coronary angiography and had no culprit lesion underwent intracoronary provocation with acetylcholine. The ACH testing was considered positive at a vasoconstriction of ≥ 75 % relative to the diameter after intracoronary nitroglycerine when the initially reported symptoms could be reproduced. ResultsOf 488 consecutive patients, 138 had no culprit lesion (28 %). Twenty-two were found to have another diagnosis. The ACH testing was performed in 86 of the remaining 116 patients. In 42 patients, coronary spasm was verified (49 %). ConclusionsEvery fourth patient with ACS had no culprit lesion. Coronary spasm could be documented in nearly 50 % of the patients tested by ACH. Coronary spasm is a frequent cause of ACS and should regularly be considered as a differential diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. To {{determine}} whether excision of complex, ulcerated plaque improves {{the risk of}} patients with unstable angina {{to the level of}} those with stable angina, the results of directional coronary atherectomy were compared in patients with these two syndromes. Background. The procedural results of angioplasty in the setting of unstable angina are not as favorable as those observed for chronic stable angina, presumably because thrombus-associated plaque augments the risk of abrupt closure. Methods. Two hundred eighty-seven consecutive patients who had undergone directional atherectomy for a single new stenosis were studied. Seventy-seven patients had stable angina (Group I); 110 patients had progressively worsening angina hi the absence of <b>rest</b> or postinfarction <b>angina</b> (Group II); and 100 patients had <b>rest</b> or postinfarction <b>angina,</b> or both (Group III). Results. Major behende complications (death, Q wave infarction, emergency bypass surgery) occurred more frequently in Group m (1. 3 % [Group I] vs. 0. 9 % [Group II] vs. 7 % (Group III], p = 0. 036). This difference was largely due to a higher incidence of emergency surgery in Group III (1. 3 % [Group I] vs. 0 % [Group II] vs. 5 % [Group III], p = 0. 05). Clinical follow-up was obtained in 97 % of successful procedures for a mean followup period of 22 months (range 9 to 52) and revealed a higher incidence of hospital admission for angina (p = 0. 05) and a trend toward more bypass surgery (p = 0. 09) and myocardial infarction (p = 0. 16) in Group III. There was no difference in repeat percutaneous interventions among the three groups (range 19 % to 24 %, p = 0. 75). Conclusions. These results show that the definition of unstable angina is important in determining the immediate outcome of directional atherectomy. In the absence of <b>rest</b> or postinfarction <b>angina,</b> the immediate results are not significantly different from those obtained in stable angina. Our results also suggest that both the immediate and short-term outcome in unstable angina are not greatly influenced by atherectomy but more so by the pathophysiology of unstable angina, which increases the complications of percutaneous interventions...|$|R
40|$|The haemodynamic {{effects of}} a single dose of {{intravenous}} molsidomine were assessed in 12 patients with severe coronary disease. The investigation was carried out at <b>rest</b> during <b>angina</b> induced by pacing and after molsidomine during pacing at {{the rate at which}} angina had been produced. During angina, left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure rose, left ventricular stroke work fell and coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption increased by 58 - 3 % above the control levels. After the administration of molsidomine, atrial stimulation was not followed by angina and there were no signifi-cant changes in systolic blood pressure. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell sharply and coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption were only 38 % and 33 % higher, respectively, than the control levels. The beneficial effects of molsidomine in ischaemic heart disease, therefore, are the result of peripheral vasodilation which, by reducing the preload and afterload, lowers the oxygen requirements of the myocardium and thus increase the threshold for angina.

METHODS: In total, 3, 664 consecutive asymptomatic patients without prior diagnosis of CAD undergoing myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) were evaluated and followed-up < or = 1 year for Events (HE) : cardiac death or myocardial infarction. MPS was interpreted using a 20 segment model to define summed stress, rest, and difference scores (the extent of % myocardium ischemic was derived). Prognostic high-risk ischemia was defined as ischemia consistent with a HE rate < or = 3 %. RESULTS: Overall, < or = 7. 5 % myocardium ischemic was consistent with high risk.

However, long-term prospective data after coronary stenting (CS) are limited. MethodsFour-hundred and eighty-three consecutive patients with either stable or unstable coronary syndromes were followed for up to three years after successful CS. The composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction or rehospitalization for <b>rest</b> unstable <b>angina,</b> whichever occurred first, was the prespecified primary end point. Moreover, the one-year incidence of clinical recurrence of symptoms, in-stent restenosis (ISR) and progression of atherosclerosis to a significant lesion (PTSL) were additionally evaluated. PTSL was defined as an increase by at least 25 % in the luminal diameter stenosis of a known nonsignificant lesion (≤ 50 % luminal diameter stenosis) that was located in a nonintervened vessel at restudy, resulting in an angiographically significant lesion (≥ 70 % luminal diameter stenosis). ResultsBy the end of the follow-up, high plasma levels of either CRP or Lp(a) but not tHCY were independently associated with the primary end point. In particular, CRP ≥ 0. 68 mg/dl (p < 0. 001) or Lp(a) ≥ 25 mg/dl (p = 0. 003) conferred a significantly increased risk. By 1 year, a CRP ≥ 0. 68 mg/dl conferred a significantly increased risk for clinical recurrence of symptoms (p < 0. 001) or PTSL (p < 0. 001). None of the studied biochemical markers was related to ISR. ConclusionsHigh plasma levels of either CRP or Lp(a) but not tHCY may be associated with a higher incidence of late adverse events after successful CS. PTSL in vessels not previously intervened upon may play a significant role in the underlying pathophysiology as opposed to ISR...|$|R

Lesions were also classified as a denovo or a restenosis lesion. Frozen sections were examined for the presence of TF using a murine IgG monoclonal antibody against human tissue factor. Samples were read independently by two investigators without knowledge of the clinical information. The results were expressed dichotomously as positive or negative using human skin sections as a positive control and a nonsense murine monoclonal antibody as a negative control. Statistical analysis were performed using a Chi-Square or Fischer's Exact Test. For the entire study group, TF was detected in 15 (45 %) of 33 patients with unstable coronary syndromes versus only 3 (13 %) of 24 patients with stable coronary syndromes; p ≤ 0. 02. Moreover, within the subgroup of patients with unstable coronary syndromes, TF protein was detected in 14 (61 %) of 23 patients with de-novo lesions versus only 1 (10 %) of 10 patients with <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> from a restenosis lesion; p ≤ 0. 01. An additional 7 patients with stable coronary syndromes due to a restenosis lesion were also all negative for TF, for an overall incidence of only 1 (6 %) of 17 restenosis lesions. In conclusion, tissue factor is readily detected in atherectomy specimens from de-novo lesions in patients with unstable coronary syndromes, suggesting a role for this protein in the pathogenesis of this disease process. Conversely, tissue factor is rarely detected in patients with restenosis lesions even if the clinical presentation is an unstable coronary syndrome. These results may have implications in regard to the management of patients with unstable angina from de-novo lesions and all patients with recurrent symptoms from restenosis lesions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{examined}} {{the relation between}} the level of urinary fibrinopeptide A and the presence of angiographic intracoronary thrombus in patients with unstable angina to determine whether this marker predicts active thrombus formation. Background. Although it is known that thrombus plays a role in acute ischemic syndromes, a noninvasive method to predict its presence in individual patients with unstable angina has not been determined. Fibrinopeptide A is a polypeptide cleaved from fibrinogen by thrombin and thus is a sensitive marker of thrombin activity and fibrin generation. Methods. Angiographic thrombus, graded 0 to 4, and the presence of ST segment depression or T wave inversions, or both, on the electrocardiogram (ECG) were related to fibrinopeptide A levels in 24 patients with <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> of new onset, 18 with crescendo angina, 19 with stable angina and 9 with chest pain but without coronary artery disease. All patients had chest pain within the 24 h of sample acquisition. Results. The angiographic incidence of thrombus was significantly higher in patients with new onset of <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> (67 %, p < 0. 001) and crescendo angina (50 %, p < 0. 001) as were fibrinopeptide A levels (p = 0. 002). Fibrinopeptide A levels correlated significantly (p < 0. 001) with the presence of a filling defect (grade 4 intracoronary thrombus) or contrast staining (grade 3). All patients with fibrinopeptide A ≥ 8 ng/mg creatinine showed grade 3 to 4 thrombus and 15 of 16 patients with levels ≥ 6. 0 ng/mg creatinine exhibited angiographic evidence of thrombus (13 with grades 3 to 4). Patients with reversible ST changes on the ECG had significantly higher levels of fibrinopeptide A (p < 0. 001), and ST changes correlated significantly with the presence of angiographic thrombus (p < 0. 001). Nonetheless, a significant minority of patients with unstable angina had neither angiographic nor biochemical evidence of thrombus. Conclusions. Elevated fibrinopeptide A levels in unstable angina reflected active intracoronary thrombus formation and were present in patients with angina of new onset as well as crescendo angina. Reversible ST changes are accompanied by thrombin activity and angiographic thrombus formation. However, a sizable percentage of patients with unstable angina had no evidence of thrombus and these patients may have had translent platelet aggregation without fibrin thrombus formation...|$|E
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} cineangiograms (30 degrees right anterior oblique projection) {{and high}} fidelity left ventricular pressure were recorded at rest in 10 individuals with normal hearts and at rest and during {{an episode of}} angina provoked by rapid atrial pacing in 14 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. Angiograms were digitised frame by frame. The ventricular perimeter was divided into 40 segments and regional ventricular function was examined by means of isometric and contour plots and by the construction of segmental pressure-wall displacement loops. In 10 patients 12 abnormal resting regions were identified. The commonest (11 regions) was delayed onset of inward endocardial motion during systole which was manifest by diagonal contour lines on the contour plot. Six regions (five with associated delay in onset of inward motion) showed <b>resting</b> hypokinesis. <b>Angina</b> {{was associated with the}} development of 19 new regions of abnormal wall motion in 12 patients. Fourteen of these regions of abnormality were thought to be primary events occurring as a consequence of ischaemia and five to be secondary events occurring in normally perfused regions of myocardium. Hypokinesis occurred in 12 regions, developing in a region with normal amplitude at rest in seven and as an extension of resting hypokinesis in five. In 10 out of 12 cases the region of hypokinesis developed in a region showing diagonal contour lines at rest. Asynchrony with delay in the timing of peak inward displacement relative to minimum volume occurred with angina in eight regions (in six cases concomitant with hypokinesis and in two cases in isolation). In contrast with hypokinesis the pattern of wall motion at rest did not permit regions developing asynchrony with angina to be identified. Pressure-displacement loops show that regional hypokinesis is associated with reduced segmental work and that regional asynchrony (delayed or premature timing of peak inward endocardial displacement) is associated with a loss of efficiency of energy transfer between the myocardium and the circulation. These observations illustrate the complex nature of wall motion abnormalities occurring with angina...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of medical}} {{treatment}} {{of patients who}} had <b>resting</b> nocturnal <b>angina</b> as well as exertional angina was investigate. The effects of atenolol 100 mg a day, nifedipine 20 mg three times a day, and isosorbide mononitrate 40 mg twice a day were investigated in a double blind, triple dummy randomised study. Nine patients with coronary artery disease, early positive exercise tests, and transient daytime and nocturnal ambulatory ST segment changes were initially assessed off all antianginal medication. They were then treated with each drug for three five day periods. Angina diaries were reviewed and maximal treadmill exercise tests and 48 hour ambulatory ST segment monitoring were performed {{at the end of}} each treatment period. Resting and exercise heart rate and blood pressure were significantly lower on atenolol than on either isosorbide mononitrate or nifedipine. The duration of exercise to 1 mm ST segment depression was significantly greater on atenolol than on isosorbide mononitrate. Only one patient had an improvement in exercise tolerance on nifedipine that was greater than the improvement on atenolol; this patient had single vessel disease. The total number and duration of episodes of ST segment change during ambulatory monitoring were significantly lower with atenolol than on either isosorbide mononitrate or nifedipine. Nocturnal ST segment changes were abolished in six patients on atenolol, in six patients on nifedipine, and in five patients on isosorbide mononitrate. When nocturnal ST segment changes occurred, their frequency was reduced with all three drugs. Pain was abolished in four patients on atenolol and pain relief was significantly better on atenolol than on isosorbide mononitrate. There was no significant difference in pain relief between isosorbide mononitrate and nifedipine. Thus beta receptor blockade with atenolol was the most effective means of reducing myocardial ischaemia both during exercise and at rest at night without causing deterioration in any patient. Nocturnal myocardial ischaemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease can be effectively treated with beta receptor antagonists and vasodilators...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExperimental {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that myocardium reperfused after reversible ischemia exhibits prolonged depression of contractile function (“stunning”), which is associated with various ultrastructural, biochemical, vascular and other functional abnormalities. Clinical observations suggest that stunning occurs in many situations (for example, <b>rest</b> and exercise-induced <b>angina,</b> myocardial infarction with early reperfusion, open heart surgery, transplantation) and thus may contribute significantly to morbidity among patients with coronary artery disease. In recent years an increasing number of studies have provided indirect evidence that postischemic myocardial dysfunction may be mediated in part by the generation of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radical (· O 2 −), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and hydroxyl radical (· OH). Thus, {{it has been shown that}} the recovery of the stunned myocardium is enhanced by agents that either scavenge oxygen metabolites, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, N- 2 -mercaptopropionylglycine and dimethylthiourea, or prevent their generation, such as allopurinol, oxypurinol and desferrioxamine. More recent experiments utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy have directlydemonstrated that reperfusion after a reversible ischemic episode is associated with a burst of free radical production. At present, the evidence supporting the free radical hypothesis is suggestive but not conclusive. Definitive demonstration of the role of oxy-radicals will require careful studies measuring the production of these species is conscious animal models of postischemic dysfunction. If confirmed, the free radical hypothesis will provide not only new important insights into the pathophysiology of ischemic injury, but also a rationale for developing clinically applicable interventions...|$|R
40|$|The use of beta {{adrenoceptor}} blockade in {{the treatment}} of <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> is controversial, and the effects on severe angina of partial agonist activity in beta blockers are unknown. Eight patients with effort angina and seven with effort and nocturnal angina and severe coronary artery disease were studied initially when they were not taking any antianginal drugs. Pindolol 5 mg thrice daily (with partial agonist activity) and atenolol 100 mg daily (without partial agonist activity) were given for five days each in a double blind randomised manner. Diaries of angina were kept and treadmill exercise testing and ambulatory ST monitoring performed during the last 48 hours of each period of treatment. Daytime and nocturnal resting heart rates and the frequency of angina were significantly reduced by atenolol compared with pindolol (p less than 0. 01). The duration of exercise was significantly increased and the frequency, duration, and magnitude of daytime and nocturnal episodes of ST segment depression on ambulatory monitoring were reduced by atenolol. Reduction in resting heart rate is important {{in the treatment}} of both effort and nocturnal angina. Partial agonist activity in beta adrenoceptor antagonists may be deleterious in patients with severe angina pectoris...|$|E
40|$|To {{define the}} {{clinical}} and angiographic {{features of the}} syndrome of spasm of angiographically normal coronary arteries, 77 patients with spasm and fixed coronary stenosis {{equal to or greater}} than 50 % (group A) were compared with 35 patients with spasm and normal or minimally diseased coronary arteries (group B). Statistically significant differences between groups A and B were as follows: the incidence of <b>rest</b> <b>angina</b> (50. 6 % vs 85. 7 %; p< 0. 01) and mixed angina (32. 5 % vs 5. 7 %; p < 0. 01); the appearance of ST segment depression (53. 3 % vs 16 %; p < 0. 01) and no electrocardiographic changes during stress test (35. 6 % vs 76 %; p < 0. 01); and the tendency for arteriographically documented spasm to be focal (87. 5 % vs 71. 4 %; p< 0. 05) and to affect only one vessel (76. 6 % vs 57. 1 %; p < 0. 05).

40|$|We studied 57 {{patients}} {{admitted to}} hospital with ischaemic heart disease, including nine patients with variant angina, to evaluate platelet reactivity and {{its dependence on}} alpha-adrenergic receptor function. The threshold concentration for biphasic platelet aggregation in response to adrenaline and adenosine diphosphate was measured in fresh platelet rich plasma. There were age related alterations in platelet responsiveness to adrenaline. In 27 age matched control subjects platelets showed adrenaline induced aggregation at a concentration higher than 0. 1 mumol. The threshold concentrations for adrenaline and adenosine diphosphate were 0. 91 mumol and 4. 68 mumol. In 16 patients with acute infarction, 14 with old infarction, nine with effort angina, and nine with <b>rest</b> <b>angina,</b> mean values of platelet aggregation threshold for both adrenaline and adenosine diphosphate were not altered significantly when compared with control subjects. In contrast, the values for adrenaline and adenosine diphosphate in nine patients with variant angina were 0. 012 mumol and 2. 24 mumol and seven of them showed obvious platelet hyperactivity to adrenaline at a concentration lower than 0. 1 mumol. The threshold concentration for adrenaline induced aggregation did not correlate with serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{coronary}} artery bypass graft operation were studied in 32 patients with daytime ambulatory ST segment changes and 14 patients with daytime and nocturnal angina and ST segment changes. Patients had ambulatory ST segment monitoring and exercise testing before and after operation and coronary arteriography was repeated in 34 patients after operation. Before operation, patients with daytime and nocturnal ischaemia tended to have more severe coronary artery disease, lower exercise tolerance, and more frequent ambulatory ST segment changes than those who had daytime ST segment changes only. After operation chest pain recurred in 22 % of patients and ST segment depression during exercise testing or ambulatory ST segment monitoring recurred in 37 % of the patients and was significantly more frequent in those with nocturnal ischaemia than in those with daytime ischaemia. Graft patency rates were similar in patients with and those without recurrence of ischaemia. After operation the frequency and magnitude of ST segment changes and exercise duration were improved in patients with preoperative daytime angina and also in those with daytime and nocturnal angina. The improvement was more pronounced in the latter groups. Thus, absence of postoperative angina is not a reliable indicator of the absence of reversible myocardial ischaemia. After revascularisation, patients with <b>rest</b> and nocturnal <b>angina</b> can expect relief from ischaemia, and if this recurs postoperatively, the threshold is improved and pain usually occurs only on exertion...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Mechanisms {{involved}} in the altered left ventricular (LV) diastolic properties during angina were studied in 26 patients with coronary artery disease. Angina was induced by rapid atrial pacing and measurements were made at <b>rest</b> and during <b>angina</b> in the immediate post-pacing period. No changes occurred in heart rate (71 ± 3 to 73 ± 3 beats/min, NS) or right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic pressure (10 ± I to 11 ± 1 mm Hg, NS), while significant increases occurred in LV end-diastolic pressure (17 i 1 to 30 ± 1 mm Hg, p < 0. 01), aortic diastolic pressure (74 ± 3 to 80 ± 3 mm Hg, p < 0. 01), coronary sinus blood flow (133 ± 15 to 212 ± 32 ml/min, p < 0. 01), and the time constant (T) of LV pressure fall in early diastole (43 ± 2 to 58 ± 4 msec, p < 0. 01). Despite the rise in arterial pressure, a significant fall was observed in peak negative dP/dt (1961 ± 106 to 1751 ± 80 mm Hg/sec, p < 0. 01). Changes in RV end-diastolic pressure do not explain the increased LV end-diastolic pressure during angina. Increased aortic pressure and coronary blood flow may contribute, but the simultaneous fall in peak negative dP/dt and rise in T suggest that impaired ventricular relaxation {{is an important factor}} contributing to the previously demonstrated alteration in LV diastolic properties during angina pectoris.

40|$|Therapeutic {{angiogenesis}} using vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{is considered a}} promising new therapy for patients with arterial obstructive disease. Clinical improvements observed consist of improved muscle function and regression of <b>rest</b> pain or <b>angina.</b> However, direct evidence for improved vascularization, as evaluated by angiography, is weak. In this study, we report an angiogenesis-independent effect of VEGF on ischemic skeletal muscle, ie, upregulation of myoglobin after VEGF treatment. Mice received intramuscular injection with adenoviral VEGF-A or either adenoviral LacZ or PBS as control, followed by surgical induction of acute hindlimb ischemia at day 3. At day 6, capillary density was increased in calf muscle of Ad. VEGF-treated versus control mice (P < 0. 01). However, angiographic score of collateral arteries was unchanged between Ad. VEGF-treated and control mice. More interestingly, an increase in myoglobin was observed in Ad. VEGF-treated mice. Active myoglobin was 1. 5 -fold increased in calf muscle of Ad. VEGF-treated mice (P&LE; 0. 01). In addition, the number of myoglobin-stained myofibers was 2. 6 -fold increased in Ad. VEGF-treated mice (P = 0. 001). Furthermore, in ischemic muscle of 15 limb amputation patients, VEGF and myoglobin were coexpressed. Finally, in cultured C 2 C 12 myotubes treated with rhVEGF, myoglobin mRNA was 2. 8 -fold raised as compared with PBS-treated cells (P= 0. 02). This effect could be blocked with the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU 5416. In conclusion, we show that VEGF upregulates myoglobin in ischemic muscle both in vitro and in vivo. Increased myoglobin expression in VEGF-treated muscle implies an improved muscle oxygenation, which may, at least partly, explain observed clinical improvements in VEGF-treated patients, {{in the absence of}} improved vascularizatio...|$|R
