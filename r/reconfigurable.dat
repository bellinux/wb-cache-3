5|$|<b>Reconfigurable</b> {{computing}} {{is the use}} of a field-programmable {{gate array}} (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can rewire itself for a given task.|$|E
25|$|By {{introducing}} an asymmetric {{field effect}} along the nanochannel, a field-effect <b>reconfigurable</b> nanofluidic diode is feasible, which features post-fabrication reconfiguration of the diode functions, {{such as the}} forward/reverse directions and the rectification degrees. Unlike the nanofluidic field-effect transistor, where only the amount of ions/molecules is regulated by an electrostatic potential, the field-effect <b>reconfigurable</b> diode {{can be used to}} control both directions and magnitudes of ion/molecule transport. This device could be deemed as the building blocks for ionic counterpart of the electronic field-programmable gate array.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, it was {{announced}} that the 13 Pinzgauer Special Operations (MV-SO) Vehicles acquired in 2005 would be replaced by Supacat HMT Extenda vehicles designated as the Special Operations Vehicles – Mobility Heavy (SOV-MH). An undisclosed number will be ordered that are <b>reconfigurable</b> with four configurations under a $28 million contract with deliveries from late 2017.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the rise}} of <b>reconfigurable</b> {{programmable}} logic devices, sharing of logic designs has been a form of open-source hardware. Instead of the schematics, hardware description language (HDL) code is shared. HDL descriptions are commonly used to set up system-on-a-chip systems either in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) or directly in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs. HDL modules, when distributed, are called semiconductor intellectual property cores, or IP cores.|$|E
25|$|Discrete {{manufacturing}} plants adopted these technologies fast. The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analogue-based {{measurement and control}} still dominates. The growing use of Industrial Ethernet {{on the factory floor}} is pushing these trends still further, enabling {{manufacturing plants}} to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for <b>Reconfigurable</b> Manufacturing Systems.|$|E
25|$|In mid-August 2014, Coronado {{demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} rapidly stage and deploy U.S. Marine Corps ground units.

500|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} uses {{a mechanism}} called toehold-mediated strand displacement {{to allow the}} nucleic acid complexes to reconfigure {{in response to the}} addition of a new nucleic acid strand. [...] In this reaction, the incoming strand binds to a single-stranded toehold region of a double-stranded complex, and then displaces one of the strands bound in the original complex through a branch migration process. The overall effect {{is that one of the}} strands in the complex is replaced with another one. [...] In addition, <b>reconfigurable</b> structures and devices can be made using functional nucleic acids such as deoxyribozymes and ribozymes, which can perform chemical reactions, and aptamers, which can bind to specific proteins or small molecules.|$|E
500|$|The {{conceptual}} {{foundation for}} DNA nanotechnology was first {{laid out by}} Nadrian Seeman in the early 1980s, and the field began to attract widespread interest in the mid-2000s. This use of nucleic acids is enabled by their strict base pairing rules, which cause only portions of strands with complementary base sequences to bind together to form strong, rigid double helix structures. This allows for the rational design of base sequences that will selectively assemble to form complex target structures with precisely controlled [...] nanoscale features. Several assembly methods are used to make these structures, including tile-based structures that assemble from smaller structures, folding structures using the DNA origami method, and dynamically <b>reconfigurable</b> structures using strand displacement methods. The field's name specifically references DNA, but the same principles have been used {{with other types of}} nucleic acids as well, leading to the occasional use of the alternative name nucleic acid nanotechnology.|$|E

2500|$|Current {{research}} is exploring {{the potential of}} modular <b>reconfigurable</b> robotics and the complex software necessary to control the “shape changing” robots. [...] “Locally Distributed Predicates or LDP is a distributed, high-level language for programming modular <b>reconfigurable</b> robot systems (MRRs)”. There are many challenges associated with programming and controlling {{a large number of}} discrete modular systems due to the degrees of freedom that correspond with each module. For example, reconfiguring from one formation to one similar may require a complex path of movements controlled by an intricate string of commands even though the two shapes differ slightly.|$|E

50|$|Software/Configware Co-Compilation is {{used for}} <b>reconfigurable</b> {{computing}} to generate the code for both, an instruction-stream-based microprocessor and a <b>reconfigurable</b> accelerator interfaced to it. Such a co-compiler (see figure) has a partitioner which accepts input from a high level language source, such as, for instance a programming language, or the output from tools like MATLAB, and automatically partitions it into parallelizable parts suitable for the <b>reconfigurable</b> accelerator and the rest for running on the microprocessor. By loop transformations the partitioner converts the parallelizable parts into a configware source, which is compiled by a Configware Compiler generating configware code for {{the configuration of the}} <b>reconfigurable</b> accelerator like, for instance an FPGA, or a coarse-grained <b>reconfigurable</b> array, and flowware code for organizing the data streams going from and to the accelerator.|$|E
50|$|A <b>reconfigurable</b> antenna is {{an antenna}} capable of modifying {{dynamically}} its frequency and radiation properties {{in a controlled}} and reversible manner. In order to provide a dynamical response, <b>reconfigurable</b> antennas integrate an inner mechanism (such as RF switches, varactors, mechanical actuators or tunable materials) that enable the intentional redistribution of the RF currents over the antenna surface and produce reversible modifications over its properties. <b>Reconfigurable</b> antennas differ from smart antennas because the reconfiguration mechanism lies inside the antenna rather than in an external beamforming network. The reconfiguration capability of <b>reconfigurable</b> antennas is used to maximize the antenna performance in a changing scenario or to satisfy changing operating requirements.|$|E
50|$|Often the <b>reconfigurable</b> array {{is used as}} a {{processing}} accelerator {{attached to}} a host processor. The level of coupling determines the type of data transfers, latency, power, throughput and overheads involved when utilising the <b>reconfigurable</b> logic. Some of the most intuitive designs use a peripheral bus to provide a coprocessor like arrangement for the <b>reconfigurable</b> array. However, there have also been implementations where the <b>reconfigurable</b> fabric is much closer to the processor, some are even implemented into the data path, utilising the processor registers. The job of the host processor is to perform the control functions, configure the logic, schedule data and to provide external interfacing.|$|E
