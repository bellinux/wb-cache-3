The standard specifies a marking pattern which says which characters are erect and which are inverted in a particular pattern, that enables the system phase, channel and subchannel to be determined. Since the system is synchronous there is no start bit, and a receiver has to examine the bit stream to tell where {{the start of a}} marked cycle is. When system phase is established the correct received bit can be assigned to the correct place in each character in each channel.

This modified collocation method is based on the empirical estimation of a anisotropic and inhomogeneous covariance function of the interpolated field.

40|$|Six {{formulas}} representing what {{is commonly}} referred to as "daily load stimulus" are identified, compared and tested in their ability to relate skeletal mechanical loading to bone maintenance and osteogenic response. Particular emphasis is placed on exercise- induced skeletal loading and whether or not the formulas can adequately capture the known experimental observations of saturation of continuous cyclic loading, rest insertion between <b>repetitions</b> (<b>cycles),</b> recovery of osteogenic potential following saturation, and multiple shorter bouts versus a single long bout of exercise. To evaluate the ability of the formulas to capture these characteristics, a set of exercise scenarios with type of exercise bout, specific duration, number of repetitions, and rest insertion between repetitions is defined. The daily load values obtained from the formulas for the loading conditions of the set of scenarios is illustrated. Not all of the formulas form estimates of daily load in units of stress or in terms of strain at a skeletal site due to the loading force from a specific exercise prescription. The comparative results show that none of the formulas are able to capture all of the experimentally observed characteristics of cyclic loading. However, the enhanced formula presented by Genc et al. does capture several characteristics of cyclic loading that the others do not, namely recovery of osteogenic potential and saturation. This could be a basis for further development of mathematical formulas that more adequately approximates the amount of daily stress at a skeletal site that contributes to bone adaptation...|$|R

Using {{measurements}} in {{the frequency}} domain we have measured quality factor Q and travel times of direct and side-reflected elastic waves in a 1. 8 m long sample of Berea sandstone.

Each separate travel path yields a characteristic <b>repetition</b> <b>cycle</b> in frequency space as its wave vector-distance product is stepped; an inverse fast Fourier runsform (IFFT) reveals the corresponding travel time at the group velocity. Because arrival times of direct and reflected elastic waves appear as spikes along the time axis, travel times can be obtained precisely, and different arrivals can be clearly separated. Q can be determined from the amplitude vs. frequency response ofeach peak as obtained from a moving window IFFT of the frequency-domain signal.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a novel concept {{to overcome the}} dependence of image contrast on spatial positioning parameters such {{as the number of}} slices and slice separation in multislice measurements: TR-independent multislice (TRIM) acquisition allows the number of slices in a single measurement to remain independent of the repetition time TR. Ramped TRIM (rTRIM) allows the distance between the sections excited in each repetition to remain independent of the distance between the reconstructed slices. Even images from overlapping slices can be acquired without crosstalk between the images of adjacent slices due to spatially overlapping excitation profiles. This concept is based on a special reordering scheme: Within a single TR acquisition, steps are only taken from a fraction of all slices. This necessitates attribution of different phase-encoding steps to different slices within each <b>repetition</b> <b>cycle.</b> The reordering scheme can be derived by the use of a design matrix. The imaging properties of the technique are discussed theoretically and illustrated by a point spread function analysis based on simulations and phantom measurements.
