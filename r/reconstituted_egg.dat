Well-resolved 13 C NMR signals were recorded for monomeric [3 - 13 C]Ala-bR in egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayer at ambient temperature, although several 13 C NMR signals from the loops and transmembrane α-helices were still suppressed. This is because monomeric bR <b>reconstituted</b> into <b>egg</b> PC, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dipalmytoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers undergoes conformational fluctuations with frequency in the order of 104 – 105 Hz at ambient temperature, which is interfered with frequency of magic angle spinning or proton decoupling. It turned out, however, that the 13 C NMR signals of purple membrane (PM) were almost fully recovered in gel phase lipids of DMPC or DPPC bilayers at around 0 °C. This finding is interpreted in terms of aggregation of bR in DMPC or DPPC bilayers to 2 D hexagonal array in the presence of endogenous lipids at low temperature, resulting in favorable backbone dynamics for 13 C NMR observation. It is therefore concluded that [3 - 13 C]Ala-bR <b>reconstituted</b> in <b>egg</b> PC, DMPC or DPPC bilayers at ambient temperature, or [3 - 13 C]Ala- and [1 - 13 C]Val-bR at low temperature gave rise to well-resolved 13 C NMR signals, although they are not always completely the same as those of 2 D hexagonal lattice from PM...|$|R
40|$|TRF 1 and TRF 2 are {{double-stranded}} (ds) telomere DNA-binding {{proteins and}} the core members of shelterin, a complex {{that provides the}} structural and functional basis of telomere functions. We have reported that unlike mammalian TRF 1 that constitutively binds to chromatin, Xenopus TRF 1 (xTRF 1) associates with mitotic chromatin but dissociates from interphase chromatin <b>reconstituted</b> in Xenopus <b>egg</b> extracts. This finding raised the possibility that xTRF 1 and Xenopus TRF 2 (xTRF 2) contribute to telomere functions in a manner different from mammalian TRF 1 and TRF 2. Here, we focused {{on the role of}} xTRF 2. We prepared chromatin <b>reconstituted</b> in <b>egg</b> extracts immunodepleted for xTRF 2. Compared to mock-depleted nuclei, DNA damage response at telomeres was activated, and bulk DNAs were poorly replicated in xTRF 2 -depleted nuclei. The replication defect was rescued by inactivating ATR through the addition of anti-ATR neutralizing antibody, suggesting that ATR plays a role in the defect. Interestingly, the bulk DNA replication defect, but not the DNA damage response at telomeres, was rescued by supplementing the xTRF 2 -depleted extracts with recombinant xTRF 2 (rTRF 2). We propose that xTRF 2 is required for both efficient replication of bulk DNA and protection from the activation of the DNA damage checkpoints pathway, and that those two functions are mechanistically separable...|$|R

Preincubation of purified holotransducin with rhodopsin, in the absence of guanosine triphosphate, blocked the ability of the kinase to phosphorylate rhodopsin. Transducin-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation was relieved when guanosine 52 ̆ 7 -(3 -O-thio) triphosphate was present during the preincubation. Resolved alpha and beta gamma transducin subunits, in the absence of guanosine triphosphate, were each capable of specifically blocking phosphorylation of rhodopsin.

40|$|The anion {{transport}} {{system of the}} human erythrocyte membrane was <b>reconstituted</b> in <b>egg</b> phosphatidylcholine membranes by using either the unmodified transport protein, band 3, or covalently crosslinked band 3 dimers. Unilamellar vesicles of a diameter of 32 +/- 3 nm were then isolated from the sample by passage through a French press and subsequent gel filtration. According to sedimentation equilibrium measurements, around 85 % of the vesicles were devoid of protein. The remaining 15 % contained either a single band 3 monomer or, when crosslinked band 3 protein was used, a single band 3 dimer. Vesicles containing either single monomers or single dimers showed a rapid, inhibitor-sensitive sulfate efflux, and the turnover numbers of band 3 for the inhibitor-sensitive flux component were identical in both systems. This shows that monomeric band 3 protein is able to transport anions and that dimerization of the protein does not change its transport activity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Treatment {{of outer}} segment {{membranes}} from Loligo forbesi with endoprotease-V 8 from Staphylococcus aureus results in cleavage of the C-terminal {{extension of the}} squid rhodopsin, with accompanying reduction of the apparent molecular weight from 47 000 to 36 000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate/ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Negative-stain electron microscopy of the intact membranes shows that small clusters of the rhodopsin C-termini form structures extending from the membrane surface and that these are absent after protease treatment. Fourier transform infrared spectra of the amide I band of the protein indicate that removal of the C-terminal extension increases the relative a-helical content of squid rhodopsin to a level comparable to that for bovine rhodopsin in disk membranes, and to an extent {{which suggests that the}} a-helical structure lies mainly in the M, 36 000 (transmembrane) section of the protein. Saturation-transfer electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of the spin-labeled protein reveals that the rotational diffusion of squid rhodopsin in outer segment membranes that have been extensively washed with urea to remove peripheral proteins is much slower than that of bovine rhodopsin in rod outer segment disk membranes. This reduction in rotational mobility is also found with purified squid rhodopsin <b>reconstituted</b> in <b>egg</b> phosphatidylcholine and in urea-washed outer segment membranes which have been treated with endoprotease-V 8 to remove the C-terminal extension of squid rhodopsin.

40|$|Here, {{we report}} the first direct {{observation}} of Van der Waals' attraction between biomembrane capsules using {{measurements of the}} free energy reduction per unit area of membrane-membrane contact formation. In these studies, the membrane capsules were <b>reconstituted</b> neutral (<b>egg</b> phosphatidylcholine) lipid bilayers of giant (greater than 10 (- 3) cm diam) vesicles. Micromanipulation methods were used to select and maneuver two vesicles into proximity for contact; after adhesion was allowed to occur, the extent of contact formation was regulated through the vesicle membrane tensions that were controlled by micropipette suction. The free energy reduction per unit area of contact formation was proportional to the membrane tension multiplied by a simple function of the pipette and vesicle dimensions. The free energy potential for Van der Waals attraction between the neutral bilayers in 120 mM NaCl solutions was 1. 5 X 10 (- 2) ergs/cm 2. Also, when human serum albumin {{was added to the}} medium in the range of 0 - 1 mg/ml, the free energy potential for bilayer-bilayer adhesion was not affected. Using published values for equilibrium spacing between lipid bilayers in multilamellar lipid-water dispersions and the theoretical equation for van der Waals attraction between continuous dielectric layers, we calculated the value for the Hamaker coefficient of the Van der Waals attraction to be 5. 8 X 10 (- 14) ergs...|$|R
40|$|Lipid-protein {{interactions}} in reconstituted band 3 preparations were investigated by using spin-labeled lipids {{in conjunction with}} electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Purified erythrocyte band 3 was <b>reconstituted</b> into <b>egg</b> phosphatidylcholine liposomes at high protein density with preservation predominantly of the dimeric state. Lipid-protein associations were revealed {{by the presence of}} a component in the EPR spectra that, when compared to spectra obtained from protein-free bilayers, indicated that lipid chain motions are restricted by interactions with the protein. From the fraction of the motionally restricted component obtained from the phosphatidylcholine spin-label, a value of 64 +/- 14 annular lipids per band 3 dimer was obtained. This agrees with a value of 62 for the number of lipids that may be accommodated around the electron density map of a band 3 dimer. Selectivity of various spin-labeled lipids for the protein revealed that androstanol had a lower affinity for the band 3 interface, whereas a distinct preference was observed for the negatively charged lipids phosphatidylglycerol and stearic acid over phosphatidylcholine. This preference for negatively charged lipids could not be screened by 1 -M salt, indicating that electrostatic lipid-protein interactions are not dominant. Estimates of annular lipid exchange rates from measured acyl chain segmental motions suggested that the rate of exchange between bilayer and boundary lipids was approximately 10 (6) s(- 1), at least an order of magnitude slower than the rate of lipid lateral diffusion in protein-free bilayers...|$|R
40|$|Rates of {{diffusion}} of uncharged and charged solute molecules through porin channels {{were determined by}} using liposomes <b>reconstituted</b> from <b>egg</b> phosphatidylcholine and purified Escherichia coli porins OmpF (protein 1 a), OmpC (protein 1 b), and PhoE (protein E). All three porin proteins appeared to produce channels of similar size, although the OmpF channel appeared to be 7 to 9 % larger than the OmpC and PhoE channels in an equivalent radius. Hydrophobicity of the solute retarded the penetration through all three channels in a similar manner. The presence of one negative charge on the solute resulted in about a threefold reduction in penetration rates through OmpF and OmpC channels, whereas it produced two- to tenfold acceleration of diffusion through the PhoE channel. The addition of the second negatively charged group to the solutes decreased the diffusion rates through OmpF and OmpC channels further, whereas diffusion through the PhoE channel was not affected much. These results suggest that PhoE specializes in the uptake of negatively charged solutes. At the present level of resolution, no sign of true solute specificity was found in OmpF and OmpC channels; peptides, for example, diffused through both of these channels at rates expected from their molecular size, hydrophobicity, and charge. However, the OmpF porin channel allowed influx of more solute molecules per unit time than did the equivalent weight of the OmpC porin when the flux was driven by a concentration gradient of the same size. This apparent difference in "efficiency" became more pronounced with larger solutes, {{and it is likely}} to be the consequence of the difference in the sizes of OmpF and OmpC channels...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the voltage-dependent gating of batrachotoxin-modified sodium channels purified from rabbit T-tubular membranes in two ways. First, purified channels were reconstituted into planar bilayers and single-channel properties were measured. Batrachotoxin-activated channels showed steep voltage-dependent activation with half-maximal opening probabilities at potentials between - 95 and - 116 mV. The single-channel conductance (500 mM Na+ cis, 200 mM Na+ trans) averaged 20 pS and was independent of membrane potential. Channels usually inserted with their extracellular faces on the trans side of the bilayer; addition of tetrodotoxin to the cis side had no effect, whereas addition to the trans side blocked greater than 95 % of channel openings at - 77 mV. A second approach was used to establish that this voltage dependence was a characteristic of {{the entire population of}} purified channels and not just those few channels observed in planar bilayers. Channels <b>reconstituted</b> into <b>egg</b> phosphatidylcholine vesicles were functionally oriented by inclusion of internal saxitoxin; vesicle membrane potentials were then generated by K+ gradients in the presence of valinomycin. After batrachotoxin activation, Vm was altered by shifts of K+o. All of the specific 22 Na+ influx activated by batrachotoxin and blocked by saxitoxin was found to be voltage sensitive, activating between predicted membrane potentials of - 100 and - 50 mV. The single-channel properties of the purified T-tubular sodium channel correspond closely to those seen with native sodium channels from rat sarcolemma. The voltage-dependent activation of the batrachotoxin-modified reconstituted channel is the same as that seen with native channels in situ or in bilayers after exposure to this toxin. Most importantly, this voltage-dependent gating is a property of all of the purified channels capable of specific pharmacological activation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. DNA {{replication}} {{in higher}} eukaryotic cells occurs {{at a large}} number of discrete sites called replication foci. We have previously purified a protein, focusforming activity 1 (FFA- 1), which is involved in the assembly of putative prereplication foci in Xenopus egg extracts. FFA- 1 is the orthologue of the Werner syndrome gene product (WRN), a member of the RecQ helicase family. In this paper we show that FFA- 1 colocalizes with sites of DNA synthesis and the singlestranded DNA binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), in nuclei <b>reconstituted</b> in the <b>egg</b> extract. In addition, we show that two glutathione S-transferase FFA- 1 fusion proteins can inhibit DNA replication in a dominant negative manner. The dominant negative effect correlates with the incorporation of the fusion proteins into replication foci to form “hybrid foci, ” which are unable to engage in DNA replication. At the biochemical level, RPA can interact with FFA- 1 and specifically stimulates its DNA helicase activity. However, {{in the presence of the}} dominant negative mutant proteins, the stimulation is prevented. These results provide the first direct biochemical evidence of an important rol...|$|R
40|$|Some DNA topoisomerase inhibitors induce {{cleavage}} of DNA strands {{and lead}} to cell death. Therefore the inhibitors are utilized for chemotherapy against cancer. The treatment, however, can cause severe side effects such as genetic modification of normal cells. Camptothecin (CPT) and etoposide (VP 16) belong to this class of anticancer agents that inhibit DNA topoisomerase I and II, respectively. In the present study, we investigated whether treatment with CPT and VP 16 induces DNA breaks in nuclei <b>reconstituted</b> in Xenopus <b>egg</b> extract by observing focus formation of replication protein A (RPA), which is thought to accumulate on loci of DNA lesions prior to DNA repair. Treatment with CPT caused formation of discrete RPA foci at a later stage of incubation of demembranated Xenopus sperm nuclei with egg extracts. The RPA foci increased {{with the amount of}} CPT. However, at 30 min, before or just starting the initiation of DNA replication, the discrete RPA foci in CPT-containing extract were not obvious, suggesting that DNA replication is necessary for the focus formation induced by CPT. On the other hand, discrete RPA foci were induced by VP 16 even at 30 min...|$|R

They were substantially suppressed as {{compared with those of}} 2 D crystals, especially at the loops and several transmembrane αII-helices. Surprisingly, the 13 C NMR spectra of [3 - 13 C]Ala-D 85 N turned out to be very similar to those of [3 - 13 C]Ala-bR in lipid bilayers, in spite of the presence of globular conformational and dynamics changes in the former as found from 2 D crystalline preparations. No further spectral change was also noted between the ground (pH 7) and M-like state (pH 10) as far as D 85 N in lipid bilayers was examined, in spite of their distinct changes in the 2 D crystalline state. This is mainly caused by that the resulting 13 C NMR peaks which are sensitive to conformation and dynamics changes in the loops and several transmembrane αII-helices of the M-like state are suppressed already by fluctuation motions in the order of 104 – 105  Hz interfered with frequencies of magic angle spinning or proton decoupling. However, 13 C NMR signal from the cytoplasmic α-helix protruding from the membrane surface is not strongly influenced by 2 D crystal or monomer. Deceptively simplified carbonyl 13 C NMR signals of the loop and transmembrane α-helices followed by Pro residues in [1 - 13 C]Val-labeled bR and D 85 N in 2 D crystal are split into two peaks for reconstituted preparations in the absence of 2 D crystalline lattice. Fortunately, 13 C NMR spectral feature of reconstituted [1 - 13 C]Val and [3 - 13 C]Ala-labeled bR and D 85 N was recovered to yield characteristic feature of 2 D crystalline form in gel-forming lipids achieved at lowered temperatures...|$|R
40|$|At fertilization, the glycocalyx (vitelline layer) of the {{sea urchin}} egg is {{transformed}} into an elevated fertilization envelope by the association of secreted peptides {{and the formation of}} intermolecular dityrosine bonds. Dityrosine cross-links are formed by a secreted ovoperoxidase that exists in a Ca 2 +-stabilized complex with proteoliaisin in the fertilization envelope. By using purified proteins, we now show that proteoliaisin is necessary and sufficient to link ovoperoxidase to the egg glycocalyx. Specifically, we have found that ovoperoxidase can associate with the vitelline layer only when complexed with proteoliaisin; proteoliaisin binds to the vitelline layer independently of its association with ovoperoxidase; proteolytic modification of the vitelline layer is not required for this interaction to occur; the binding of proteoliaisin to the vitelline layer is mediated by the synergistic action of the two major seawater divalent cations, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +; the number of proteoliaisin-binding sites on the vitelline layer of unfertilized eggs is equivalent to the amount of proteoliaisin secreted at fertilization; and the binding of ovoperoxidase to the vitelline layer, via proteoliaisin, permits the in vitro cross-linking of these two in vivo substrates.

40|$|The nuclear pore {{supports}} molecular {{communication between}} cytoplasm and nucleus in eukaryotic cells. Selective transport of proteins is mediated by soluble receptors, whose regulation {{by the small}} GTPase Ran leads to cargo accumulation in, or depletion from the nucleus, i. e., nuclear import or nuclear export. We consider the operation of this transport system by a combined analytical and experimental approach. Provocative predictions of a simple model were tested using cell-free nuclei <b>reconstituted</b> in Xenopus <b>egg</b> extract, a system well suited to quantitative studies. We found that accumulation capacity is limited, so that introduction of one import cargo leads to egress of another. Clearly, the pore per se does not determine transport directionality. Moreover, different cargo reach a similar ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic concentration in steady-state. The model shows that this ratio should in fact be independent of the receptor-cargo affinity, though kinetics may be strongly influenced. Numerical conservation of the system components highlights a conflict between the observations and the popular concept of transport cycles. We suggest that chemical partitioning provides a framework to understand the capacity to generate concentration gradients by equilibration of the receptor-cargo intermediary.

40|$|SummaryDuring cell division, correct {{positioning}} of chromosomes in mitotic and meiotic spindles depends on interactions of microtubules with kinetochores and, especially in higher eukaryotes, with the chromosome arms [1, 2]. Chromokinesins, highly concentrated on mitotic and meiotic chromatin, {{are thought to}} actively push the chromosome arms toward the spindle center, thereby contributing to chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate in early mitosis [1 – 9]. How many distinct classes of chromokinesins exist and how they cooperate to form a motile chromatin-microtubule interface are not known. Using a novel experimental assay with nonkinetochore chromatin <b>reconstituted</b> from Xenopus <b>egg</b> extract, we demonstrate that the microtubule motility generated on chromatin is continuous and plus-end directed. Using specific antibody depletions, we identify two distinct chromokinesins, kinesin- 10 (Xkid) [8, 10, 11] and kinesin- 4 (Xklp 1) [12, 13], as the major activities mediating the interaction of meiotic chromatin with microtubules. Interestingly, {{we find that the}} slower motor, kinesin- 10, more efficiently recruits microtubules and also dominates in collective microtubule transport both in the close-to-physiological environment of chromatin and also in a minimal in vitro assay. Our results provide an identification of the molecular activities involved in the generation of motor protein-mediated chromosome arm motility and yield mechanistic insight into the cooperation of the two major chromokinesins...|$|R
40|$|Nucleocytoplasmic {{exchange}} of proteins and RNAs is mediated by receptors that usher their cargo through the nuclear pores. Peptide localization signals on each cargo determine the receptors {{with which it}} will interact. Those interactions are normally regulated by the small GTPase Ran. Hydrolysis of GTP provides the chemical energy required to create a bona fide thermodynamic pump that selectively and directionally accumulates its substrates across the nuclear envelope. A common perception is that cargo delivery is irreversible, e. g., a protein imported to the nucleus does {{not return to the}} cytoplasm except perhaps via a specific export receptor. Quantitative measurements using cell-free nuclei <b>reconstituted</b> in Xenopus <b>egg</b> extract show that nuclear accumulation follows first-order kinetics and reaches steady state at a level that follows a Michaelis–Menten function of the cytoplasmic cargo concentration. This saturation suggests that receptor-mediated translocation across the nuclear pore occurs bidirectionally. The reversibility of accumulation was demonstrated directly by {{exchange of}} the cytosolic medium and by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Based on our results, we offer a simple biophysical model that predicts the observed behavior. A far-reaching consequence is that the nuclear localization signal dictates the fate of a protein population rather than that of the individual molecules that bear it, which remain free to shuttle back and forth. This implies an open communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm and a ubiquitous mechanism for signaling in both directions...|$|R
