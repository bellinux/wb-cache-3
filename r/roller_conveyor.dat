50|$|Vayeron is an Australian based {{company that}} has {{developed}} a hardware sensor device {{which is designed to}} be embedded within the <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> itself. The Smart-Idler™ is an automated <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> condition monitoring & prognostics technology that is embedded within <b>conveyor</b> <b>rollers</b> when they are manufactured. The device monitors bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell-wear to predict <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> failure. This ultimately makes <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> condition monitoring more efficient and reduces operational downtime. The Smart-Idler™ sensor operates without batteries, taking its power directly from the rotation of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller,</b> using a dynamo style energy harvesting method as it turns whilst in operation within the conveyor. Companies that make <b>conveyor</b> <b>rollers</b> can integrate the Smart-Idler™ within their <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> products to create an enhanced roller offering for their clients - the owners and operators of conveyor systems. The embedded sensors have a multi-modal monitoring capability. Parameters such as bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell wear are monitored and analysed to determine roller condition deterioration and flag impending failure.|$|R

50|$|The oranges then {{go through}} <b>roller</b> <b>conveyors,</b> which expose {{all sides of}} the fruit. The <b>roller</b> <b>conveyors</b> are {{efficiently}} built as they are well lighted, installed at a convenient height, and width to ensure all inspectors can reach the fruit to determine inadequacies. Some reasons why fruit may be rejected include indication of mold, rot, and ruptured peels. Afterwards, the oranges are separated based on size through machines prior to juice extraction. There are a number of different ways orange juice industry leaders extract their oranges. Some common methods include halving the fruit and pressing/ reaming the orange to extract juice from the orange. One instrument inserts a tube through the orange peel and forces the juice out through the tube by squeezing the entire orange. Despite the variety of machines used to extract juices, all machines have commonalities in that they are rugged, fast, easy to clean, and have the ability to reduce peel extractives into the juice. The extracted juice product does not contain the orange peel, but it may contain pulp and seeds, which are removed by finishers.|$|R
50|$|The AGV can tow objects {{behind them}} in {{trailers}} {{to which they}} can autonomously attach. The trailers {{can be used to}} move raw materials or finished product. The AGV can also store objects on a bed. The objects can be placed on a set of motorized <b>rollers</b> (<b>conveyor)</b> and then pushed off by reversing them. AGVs are employed in nearly every industry, including pulp, paper, metals, newspaper, and general manufacturing. Transporting materials such as food, linen or medicine in hospitals is also done.|$|R

50|$|A {{discontinuous}} conveyor {{also called}} a reciprocating elevator, lifts the product on to a platform using a platform, <b>roller</b> <b>conveyor</b> or belt conveyor and then moves the platform with {{the product to}} another level. Because of the cycle time required for input and output as well as lifting/lowering movements, such a conveyor can only be used for smaller capacities. Continuous conveyors {{are more suitable for}} bigger capacities. There are two important solutions which can be used for this group. It is possible to choose a spiral conveyor or a continuous product lift. Both solutions are able to handle several products at a time.|$|E
50|$|As far as {{growth is}} {{concerned}} the material handling and conveyor system makers are getting utmost exposure in the industries like automotive, pharmaceutical, packaging and different production plants. The portable conveyors are likewise growing {{fast in the}} construction sector and by the year 2014 the purchase rate for conveyor systems in North America, Europe and Asia is likely to grow even further. The most commonly purchased types of conveyors are Line shaft <b>roller</b> <b>conveyor,</b> chain conveyors and conveyor belts at packaging factories and industrial plants where usually product finishing and monitoring are carried. Commercial and civil sectors are increasingly implementing conveyors at airports, shopping malls, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Tunnels are {{available}} {{with or without a}} conveyor system. Some are built into a production line or are integral with machinery that also applies the shrink film. Others are movable by hand or by castors. A shrink tunnel, referred to as an oven, may be equipped with an integrated conveyor of two different kinds: the <b>roller</b> <b>conveyor</b> or the belt conveyor. Roller conveyors can be used with polyolefin, PVC, and shrink polyethylene films. The space in between the rollers is filled with hot air {{from the bottom of the}} tunnel to shrink the film layer around the object, creating a sealed package. When used with polyolefin and PVC based films the rollers are called [...] "live" [...] or spinning. When used with polyethylene films the rollers are called [...] "dead" [...] or not spinning. The tunnels with Teflon mesh belts and polymer mesh belts are used for smaller packages, or when the package may have an instability and need a stable platform.|$|E

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the <b>roller</b> lineshaft <b>conveyor</b> {{is that it}} can only be used to convey products that span at least three rollers, but rollers can be as small as 17mm in diameter and as close together as 18.5mm.

40|$|The University of Newcastle has {{undertaken}} a systematic research program to identify, model and measure key design elements {{to reduce the}} energy consumption of belt conveyors. Research outcomes include the development of theoretical models to accurately predict the main resistances of belt conveyors, in parallel with developing extensive test facilities to verify the new models and to provide industry with data {{that can be used}} directly in the design process. This paper discusses the application of these models and test results for conveyor design, demonstrating the advantages of informed component selection to not only reduce energy consumption, but also total cost of ownership. In particular, the combination of design parameters is discussed in relation to the rotating resistance of idler <b>rollers,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt indentation rolling resistance and conveyor belt and bulk material flexure resistance. Through a combination of theoretical models and measured data, trends are identified to assist in the design of energy efficient belt conveyor systems...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} verse, Mercury {{opens the door}} of a storage room that briefly reveals a dark place, which is further used in the second verse; {{it appears to be a}} coal mine. There, the group {{features}} in their normal-life look (with Mercury naked above the waist that was common for his live and studio performances). It is surrounded by a crowd wearing black robes and miner's helmets with headlamps. The crowd moves in sync with the music. The camera is constantly closing up on the musicians who are arranged in the same pattern as in the video for the song [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody". Mercury sings, while Deacon, May and Taylor just stand around him with their heads down. During the third verse, Mercury moves to another set and hides behind a big white box. In the beginning of the synthesiser solo, the box [...] "explodes" [...] and falls apart revealing a large stone. Mercury sits at the top of the stone, playing on a copper pipe, though the sound is of electric guitar. He is surrounded by two men and two women, all wearing the same spotty tights. In the second part of the solo, more people wearing the same outfit join in and together they perform a choreographic composition. In its first part, Mercury is carried through a row of people who pass his body over their heads. He then climbs the stone and dives in between two rows of people who catch him on the fly. After that, Mercury moves over a group of people who lie parallel on the ground and roll him over their bodies by turning around, as on a lineshaft <b>roller</b> <b>conveyor.</b> This part is finalised by a static scene of Mercury with a female dancer in a dry ice smoke.|$|E
