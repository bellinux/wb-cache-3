500|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the battlefield, Latour's column marched through part of the night to Feldburg, passed through Vögisheim at [...] to Feldberg, after which it separated into two smaller columns. [...] At 07:00, the right column attacked Ferino's positions in two vineyards which lay approximately [...] to the northeast at [...] This column forced the French to retire behind Liel at , [...] east of Schliengen. The left column, meanwhile, had attacked another position by Egennen. [...] After fierce fighting, Latour's column dislodged the French after obstinate resistance; the second portion of Latour's column approached the hamlet Eckenheim from the <b>reverse</b> <b>angle,</b> and forced a French contingent from the village. Grueling combat followed as the Austrians made the steep, uphill advance.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{the battle}} was one {{instance}} in which Moller's and Seydlitz's awareness of Frederick's operational objectives led to battlefield success. [...] For example, not content with the single attack and recall, the coup de main, Seydlitz withdrew his squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. When the moment was right, he led his cavalry forward again in the coup de grâce, the finishing blow. Similarly, Moller's artillery waited on the <b>reverse</b> <b>angle</b> of the hill until the French were in range, then mounted the Janus and laid down a thorough and precise pattern of artillery fire; the concussion of Moller's thorough cannonade could be felt several miles away. Rossbach proved that the column {{as a means of}} tactical deployment on battlefield was inferior to the Prussian battle line; the massed columns simply could not hold in the face of either Moller's fire or Seydlitz's cavalry charges. The greater the formation of men, the greater the loss of life and limb.|$|E
500|$|Vulcan and the Bird-of-Prey {{exterior}} {{was created}} {{with a combination}} of matte paintings and a soundstage. Nimoy had searched for a suitable location for the scene of the Enterprise crew's preparations to return to Earth, but various locations did not work, so the scene was instead filmed on a Paramount backlot. The production had to mask the fact that production buildings were [...] away. A wide-angle shot of Spock {{on the edge of a}} cliff overlooking the scene was filmed at Vasquez Rocks, a park north of Los Angeles. The Federation council chamber was a large set filled with representatives from many alien races. Production manager Jack T. Collis economized by building the set with only one end; <b>reverse</b> <b>angle</b> shots used the same piece of wall. The positions of the Federation President's podium and the actors on the seats were switched for each shot. Since The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film to show the operations at Starfleet Command, Bennett and Nimoy visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to learn how a real deep space command center might look and operate. Among the resulting set's features was a large central desk with video monitors that the production team nicknamed [...] "the pool table"; the prop later became a fixture in USS Enterprise-D's engine room on the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.|$|E

The influence of pouring temperatures and the <b>reversed</b> cone <b>angle</b> on the semisolid microstructure were investigated, and the microstructure of the slurry after soaking was also studied. The {{results indicate that}} the suitable pouring temperature for obtaining semisolid feedstock is not above 660 ℃ and the semisolid microstructure can be improved by increasing the <b>reversed</b> cone <b>angle,</b> but proper <b>reversed</b> cone <b>angle</b> should be considered for avoiding solid shell in the condition of big <b>reversed</b> cone <b>angle...</b>|$|R

50|$|Butcher was {{considered}} a very innovative player in his time.

His lack of stamina during long matches {{was considered}} to be one of his main weaknesses, however, and this gave the athletic Amr Bey a key advantage over Butcher on the occasions they played.|$|R
5000|$|For the show's {{large-scale}} exterior look, {{the producers}} {{drew inspiration from}} the work of John Ford, who shot four of his Western films in Castle Valley, east of Moab. In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly {{fell in love with the}} place. Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah, including Castle Valley. Most Utah locations, like Dead Horse Point State Park, were [...] "walk-in" [...] areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear. Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land. To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film <b>reverse</b> <b>angles</b> of scenes originally filmed in California. For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then <b>reverse</b> <b>angles</b> over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs. The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along Utah State Route 128.|$|R

500|$|Like {{the rest}} of the fourth season, [...] "Home" [...] was filmed in British Columbia. Most of the scenes {{depicting}} buildings were shot in the town of Surrey, British Columbia. As the town's architecture comprised both old and new styles, careful <b>reverse</b> <b>angles</b> were employed to preserve the impression of [...] "small-town America". The building used as the Peacock house had been previously utilized in the season two episode [...] "Aubrey". [...] At that time, the producers noted that the house had been [...] "untouched for years" [...] and was [...] "so good" [...] that they had to return to film it again. The car that served as the Peacock family's vehicle was found on a farm outside Vancouver. [...] It was rented and restored for use in the episode.

5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most <b>reverse</b> <b>angles</b> would show a large car park across the street.|$|R
50|$|When the torpedo tilted over 10 {{degree and}} is rolling back the angle toward the neutral center position, the tiny {{mechanical}} {{system in the}} control air valve works. When it rolls back within the tilt angle 10 degree, the controller now countersteers roll rudders switching back to the <b>reverse</b> <b>angles</b> to break the counter-rolling moment, and to prevent overshoot. The torpedo rolls over the neutral center position and keeps rolling to some degree. The torpedo then stops in opposite tilt at certain degree, and starts rolling back the angle toward the neutral center position. Then the controller senses the angle tilted and countersteers roll-rudders to break the moment. It is rolling over the neutral center position then stops at certain degree, vice versa, like an air cushion is bouncing and settled to the floor. The movement continues but damps to neutral the rolling angle within 2.0 to 3.6 second in the air.|$|R
50|$|In the {{simplest}} form of camera lucida, the artist {{looks down at}} the drawing surface through a half-silvered mirror tilted at 45 degrees. This superimposes a direct view of the drawing surface beneath, and a reflected view of a scene horizontally in front of the artist. This design produces an inverted image which is right-left reversed when turned the right way up. Also, light is lost in the imperfect reflection. Wollaston's design used a prism with four optical faces to produce two successive reflections (see illustration), thus producing an image that is not inverted or <b>reversed.</b> <b>Angles</b> ABC and ADC are 67.5° and BCD is 135°. Hence, the reflections occur through total internal reflection, so very little light is lost. It is not possible to see straight through the prism, so it is necessary to look at the very edge to see the paper. The instrument often includes a weak negative lens, creating a virtual image of the scene at about the same distance as the drawing surface, so that both can be viewed in good focus simultaneously.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{allowed to}} film, Barnette {{struggled}} with several production issues, including a smaller budget and restricted shooting schedule that {{was cut from}} 30 days to 15 days. [...] After being shut down after 14 days of shooting, there were a total of 21 scenes missing from the film and Barnette waited for a year to receive extra shooting time only to receive 1 day, which was used to film 41 set-ups needed to piece the movie together. [...] Lions Gate gave her a week to edit {{the final version of}} the film and in order to piece the scenes together and create fluidity, Barnette had Da Brat narrate more and cut out some original scenes she had.While filming, she used strategic camera techniques to hide missing elements of the film. Because of the reduced budget, Barnette was forced to shoot the cell block scenes in a static frame rather than complicated frames requiring a wheelchair camera, which she did not have. To hide the emptiness of the prison courtyard and lack of extras to play inmates, the director used camera techniques to section off one area of the courtyard and avoided shooting any <b>reverse</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
