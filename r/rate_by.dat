5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear {{a striking resemblance}} to wasps, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling <b>rate</b> <b>by</b> predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction <b>rate</b> <b>by</b> enforcing this conformation.|$|E

5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction <b>rate</b> <b>by</b> lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or distort the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that cleave the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion. Such proteins distort {{the structure of the}} junction in various ways, often pulling the junction into an unstacked conformation, breaking the central base pairs, and/or changing the angles between the four arms. Other classes are branch migration proteins that increase the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>by</b> orders of magnitude, and site-specific recombinases. In prokaryotes, Holliday junction resolvases fall into two families, integrases and nucleases, that are each structurally similar although their sequences are not conserved.|$|E
5|$|The wing profile {{remained}} {{the same as the}} F-5E, but had modified leading edge extensions (LEX), which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12% with an increase in wing area of only 1.6%.

40|$|Background: Internalizing {{and externalizing}} problem {{behavior}} at school can have major consequences {{for a child}} and is predictive for disorders later in life. Teacher ratings are important to assess internalizing and externalizing problems at school. Genetic epidemiological studies on teacher-rated problem behavior are relatively scarce and the reported heritability estimates differ widely. A unique feature of teacher ratings of twins is that some pairs are <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> different and others are <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same teacher. This offers the opportunity to assess geneenvironment interaction. Methods: Teacher ratings of 3, 502 7 -year-old, 3, 134 10 -year-old and 2, 193 12 -year-old twin pairs were analyzed with structural equation modeling. About 60 % of the twin pairs were <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same teacher. Twin correlations and the heritability of internalizing and externalizing behavior were estimated, separately for pairs <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same and different teachers. Socioeconomic status and externalizing behavior at age 3 were included as covariates. Results: Twin correlations and heritability estimates were higher when twin pairs {{were in the same}} class and <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same teacher than when pairs were <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> different teachers. These differences could not be explained by twin confusion or rater bias. When twins were <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same teacher, heritability estimates were about 70 % for internalizing problems and around 80 % in boys and 70 % in girls for externalizing problems. When twins were <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> different teachers, heritability estimates for internalizing problems were around 30 % and for externalizing problems around 50 %. Conclusions: Exposure to different teachers during childhood may affect the heritability of internalizing and externalizing behavior at school. This finding points to geneenvironment interaction and is important for the understanding of childhood problem behavior. In addition, it could imply an opportunity for interventions at schoo...|$|R
