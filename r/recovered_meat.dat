Methods: Three hundred and ten food samples (80 of cooked and 230 of raw meat) were screened for E. coli O 157 by ISO culture method and by enzyme-linked-fluorescent-assay (ELFA) -based methods (VIDAS ®system, bioMérieux). All isolates obtained were tested for VT 1 and VT 2 genes by PCR. The statistical analysis considered absolute frequencies and percentages. The K statistic was applied to assess agreement between direct culture method and the VIDAS system. Results: A total of 6 (1, 9 %) E. coli O 157 isolates were <b>recovered</b> from raw <b>meat</b> samples by the culture method; of these only four were identified by PCR as VTEC producers. A total of 9 (2, 9 %) E. coli O 157 isolates were <b>recovered</b> from raw <b>meat</b> samples by the VIDAS ® system. No E. coli O 157 was detected in cooked products. All comparisons between the direct culture method and the VIDAS system were statistically significant (K= 0, 795; p< 0. 001). Conclusions: The present study showed how ELFA-based methods are highly specific and rapid for the detection of E. coli O 157 in food samples compared with the direct culture method.

The <b>recovered</b> <b>meat,</b> {{referred to as}} pork trim-finely textured (PTFT), has unique properties which must be understood to best use this lean meat source. This research characterized the chemical and physical properties of PTFT, determined incorporation levels in ground pork and studied the storage and shelf-life-stability of products containing PTFT. Chemical and physical properties of PTFT were compared to knife trimmed meat (KT) and 80 percent lean ground pork (GP). PTFT had higher iron, calcium, total pigment and cholesterol than GP or KT. Moisture and fat content of PTFT {{did not differ from}} GP. When PTFT (0, 5, 10 and 15 percent) was incorporated into ground pork patties (10 percent and 20 percent fat), redness and sensory juiciness increased and hardness and cohesiveness decreased at all levels of incorporation. Storage stability of patties containing up to 15 percent PTFT displayed for four days under retail conditions were not affected by PTFT as measured by lipid oxidation, microbial counts and pH. PTFT obtained by mechanical recovery appears to be an exceptional substitute for pork trim in ground pork formulations. PTFT does not negatively influence, and may enhance, the attributes of ground pork when added below 15 percent. Utilization of PTFT contributes to the profitability of the pork industry which is already recognizing the benefits of mechanical recovery due to a reduction in repetitive motion syndrome, which is typically associated with knife trimming...|$|E

To evaluate the quality attributes of the product, the structure of a surimi protein matrix and its relationship to selected physicochemical parameters and morphological characteristics was assessed. Both the number of washing cycles and the starch addition were found to influence the moisture, protein and lipid content of the MRFM surimi. Higher whiteness was found after five washing cycles. Because the tapioca starch acted as a stabilizer, the fat globules were more stable and well distributed, and an emulsion with better properties resulted. A homogeneous network of fat globules linked to the protein matrix by a layer of tapioca starch was formed. Another advantage of this approach is that tapioca starch is gluten free. This property is important for specific groups in the population, e. g., celiac-intolerant consumers. 2015 Autoria: FABÍOLA HELENA [i. e. DOS SANTOS] FOGAÇA...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of antimicrobial resistance bacteria {{in both the}} medical and agricultural fields has become a serious problem worldwide. The use of antimicrobial agents in animals for prophylaxis and growth promotion favors the selection of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. These resistant bacteria may subsequently transmit to humans through food chain or human-animal interactions. The objectives {{of this study were}} to characterize and determine the molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and Escherichia coli. E. coli isolates recovered from diseased piglets and chicken in China were characterized for the antimicrobial resistance phenotype and the presence of mutation in their gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes. Results indicated that multiple- antimicrobial-resistant E. coli, including fluoroquinolone-resistant variants, are commonly present among diseased swine and chickens in China. DNA sequencing revealed that double gyrA mutations coupled with parC mutation conferred high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones. In addition, Salmonella isolates <b>recovered</b> from retail <b>meats</b> in the United States and China were characterized for antimicrobial resistance genotypes and the horizontal transfer o...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, the {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of tigecycline against 1140 enterococci collected from humans, food products, {{animals and the}} environment in Portugal (1996 - 2008) was analysed. Ten isolates (seven and three spp.) non-susceptible to tigecycline (minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mg/L), which were also resistant to tetracycline and minocycline, were mostly observed in samples collected before the introduction of tigecycline in the therapeutic arsenal. The isolates were recovered from hospitalised patients (= 2; ST 319 /CC 2 and ST 34), healthy humans (= 2; ST 21 /CC 21), chicken meat (= 1; ST 260) {{as well as from}} two swine samples. The remaining isolates were also <b>recovered</b> from chicken <b>meat</b> (= 1;) and swine (= 2; and spp.). Recovery of enterococcal isolates with reduced susceptibility to tigecycline among different reservoirs, including animals for food consumption, suggests that selection of tigecycline-resistant isolates by antibiotics other than tigecycline might occur in non-clinical settings...|$|R
