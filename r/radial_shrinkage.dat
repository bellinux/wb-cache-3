The studied material came from Votorantim Metais Zinco S. A., and the plantations, located in Vazante, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were six years old. Six trees were harvested from which were cut two logs with three meter long each. Those logs were sawed into thick diametral slabs.

Following this,samples were taken {{for the evaluation of}} specific gravity and apparent density, shrinkage from green or from 12 % moisture, fiber and vessel sizes and static bending properties. It was foundthat basic and apparent specific gravities, total longitudinal shrinkage, fiber length, vessel diameter and moduli of rupture and elasticity tended to increase in the bark-to-pith direction,while partial longitudinal shrinkage, the tangential/radial ratios and the vessel frequency were reduced. <b>Radial</b> and tangential <b>shrinkages,</b> width, lumen diameter and fiber wall thickness showed different patterns of variation.

Atlas cedar {{seems to be one}} of the most promising species for reforestation in Central-South Italy, due to its ecological adaptability, quality of standing trees, even without thinnings and pruning, and productivity of the stands. From a 30 -year-old stand in Sicily 6 trees were selec-ted in order to analyse the natural durability of wood against fungi, according to European Standards, and the main physical and mecha-nical properties from clear specimens, according to ISO Standards. The heartwood resulted classified from “durable ” to “very durable”, while sapwood is “not durable”. The wood is quite dense, taking into account the fast-grown characteristics of the stand, but the volume-tric shrinkage is limited and the ratio between tangential and <b>radial</b> <b>shrinkages</b> is less than 1. 5. Mechanical characteristics show a wood with a quite high ratio of static quality.

40|$|Assessments {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in wood properties are difficult and expensive to carry out. As a consequence, {{the inclusion of}} wood quality traits in eucalypt breeding programs has to date been limited. This study {{is part of a}} large investigation into the use of non-destructive methods of assessing wood properties by comparing the results with traditional destructive methods. This component of the study investigates the genetic variation in linear shrinkage of 152 open-pollinated families of Eucalyptus pilularis (Smith). Increment cores and test blocks were used to assess radial and tangential shrinkage as well as their ratio. Shrinkage results at 17 % MC, 12 % MC and 5 % MC are presented here. Heritability estimates were moderate for tangential shrinkage but not significant for <b>radial</b> <b>shrinkage</b> or the ratio of the two. The genetic correlation between shrinkage measured on cores and on blocks at this stage was not sufficient to justify the use of increment cores alone in genetic assessments. Basic density had a moderate and negative correlation with tangential shrinkage, suggesting that selecting for higher basic density may help reduce tangential shrinkage. The increment core method was not successful at measuring <b>radial</b> <b>shrinkage</b> due to core distortion but an improved method is suggested. Measurements from scans and blocks showed that <b>radial</b> <b>shrinkage</b> was not heritable...|$|E

This paper presents a new setup allowing sinter forging ceramic compacts in a 2. 45 GHz single-mode microwave cavity. This setup has the following features: maximum temperature of 1600 degrees C, heating rate between 1 and 250 degrees C min(- 1), maximum stress of 50 MPa applied upon an 8 mm diameter sample. A specific protocol has been defined to calibrate the pyrometer used to measure the sample temperature. Alpha-alumina compacts have been microwave sinter forged under various stresses in the range 0 - 30 MPa. The results are compared to those obtained in a conventional furnace under 0, 4 and 8 MPa.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of pre-treatment techniques to produce high quality back-sawn boards from regrowth messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua L'Herit), which is very prone to collapse and checking. Saturated urea solution, one percent sodium hydroxide, four percent acetic acid, water, urea formaldehyde resin (UF), and polyvinyl acetate glue (PVA) were used. In Chapter 4, the experiment of chemical soaking pre-treatments showed that soaking in sodium hydroxide solution for up to 15 days caused almost double increase of boards' drying rate. However, this technique and soaking in acetic acid solution caused more collapse and checks. In Chapter 5 and 6, the surface coating experiment confirmed that coating with UF resin did not significantly improve the drying properties of the boards. In contrast, PVA coating prevented surface checking and considerably reduced edge checking and collapse. The check value of these P boards was only a quarter the check value of control boards. In Chapter 6, the pre-treatments trial proved that significant reductions of shrinkage and collapse were achieved mainly by urea soaking for eight weeks (SSW boards). Both tangential and <b>radial</b> <b>shrinkages</b> of S 8 W boards were {{less than half the}} shrinkages of control boards. The collapse free boards of S 8 W were almost double amount of that in control boards. However, this pretreatment caused more surface checks.

No sentido medula-casca houve uma tend?ncia da densidade aumentar da posi??o de 50 % (cerne) e em seguida diminuir para os valores m?nimos na regi?o do alburno pr?ximo a casca (100 %). Os m?nimos valores de densidade foram verificados na regi?o do alburno e m?ximos na regi?o do cerne.

The samples were collected from five equidistant positions in the pith-bark direction, corresponding to 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %, and in the heights of base, DAP, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of the tree. Three trees were used and the samples had nominal dimensions of 2, 0 x 3, 0 x 5, 0 cm. The results showed that occurred tendency of basic density variations in pith-bark and base-top directions. In the pith-bark direction the density increased until the position of 50 % (heartwood) and followed by decreasing to minimum values on sapwood near bark (100 %). Minimum values of density were observed on sapwood and maximum values on heartwood. In the base-top direction, a tendency of decreasing density was observed for samples from sapwood. Minimum values were found on sapwood (100 %) where it was practically free of extractives. In the other positions there were not obvious tendencies of density behaviour which {{may be caused by}} extractive. Volumetrics and linear shrinkages had tendency to decrease in the pith-bark direction, independently of position of the sample in the trunk. The anisotropic factor (T/R), was lower in the area near pith, increasing substantially towards the sapwood. Area near pith showed smaller rate of anisotropic factor and heartwood and sapwood showed greater rate of anisotropic factor. There was no statistic difference for basic density and volumetric, tangencial and <b>radial</b> <b>shrinkages</b> in the longitudinal direction of the trunk of tauari.

The fitting results demonstrated that a curvature-dependent surface energy at the nanoscale (so-called nanocurvature effect) much higher than that predicted from the existing theories is exerted on the elongation and shrinkage of the NW. At the same time, the so-induced plastic flow of massive atom and surface diffusion of atom presented as well a further direct experimental evidence for our predicted soft mode and instability of atomic vibration as induced under energetic beam (including e-beam) irradiation in amorphous materials The study has important implications for the nanoprocessing or nanostability of future NW-based structures or devices. More importantly, it further demonstrates that the nanocurvature effect and the beam-induced atomic vibration soft mode and instability effect, which have been normally neglected or inadequately taken into account in the current literature, are universal concepts and applicable to explanation of energetic beam-induced nanoinstability or nanoprocessing of low dimensional nanostructure in general.

A model is described which {{is based upon the}} <b>radial</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of a magnetic flux tube. The concentration of the current, along with the {{reduction in the number of}} available charge carriers, can rise to a condition where the current demand exceeds the capacity of the thermal electrons. Driven by the large inductance of the external current circuit, an instability takes place in the tube throat, resulting in the formation of a potential double layer, which then accelerates electrons and ions to MeV energies. The double layer can be unstable, collapsing and reforming repeatedly. The resulting pulsed particle beams give rise to pulsating emission which are observed at radio and X-ray wavelengths...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} wood physical properties of Pinus patula, aged 38, from a forest stand located in Machipanda, central region of Mozambique. Determination of physical properties, such as basic specific gravity, shrinkage, and moisture content of {{wood in the}} pith-bark followed {{the recommendations of the}} Panamerican Standard - COPANT. Results showed statistically significant differences at significance level of 5 %, in the radial direction for the shrinkage coefficient in the pith-bark. <b>Radial</b> and tangential <b>shrinkage</b> values were 6. 06 and 8. 80 % in juvenile wood and 6. 18 and 8. 65 % in adult wood, respectively, with anisotropy coefficient of 1. 43 for juvenile wood and 2. 44 for adult wood. Pinus patula growing in Inhamacari forest shows stable wood at age 38. It can be used for structural purposes and for manufacture of joinery and furniture. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe fast-growing hardwood, okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana Pierre), {{is a major}} forest {{species in}} Gabon and is used principally for making plywood, but {{research}} into the growth and quality of this wood is scanty. Trees from natural forests are favoured for production, yet little information exists on wood characteristics from plantation trees. Therefore, we carried out a dendrochronological study along with measurements of wood longitudinal modulus of elasticity (EL), density (Dw), dimensional stability parameters (longitudinal, <b>radial</b> and tangential <b>shrinkage</b> and fibre saturation point) and fibre cell morphology to determine if these properties were related to age in trees from two plantations. We then used segmented regression analysis to define the limit (breakpoint) between juvenile (JW) and adult wood (AW). Using monthly precipitation data, {{we were able to}} determine that one growth ring is formed per year, composed of a large light coloured ring formed during the long rainy season and a thick, dark band formed during the major dry season. However, thinner bands, analogous to false rings, may also form during the short dry and short rainy seasons. Ring width decreases from the pith to the bark, and the breakpoint between JW and AW was at 19 years old when trees from both plantations were pooled together. No differences in Dw or <b>radial</b> and tangential <b>shrinkage</b> occurred with cambial age. EL increased significantly up to the cambial age of 12 - 14 years, after which the increase with age was only slight and no breakpoint between JW and AW was found. With regard to mean longitudinal shrinkage, AW was found to form after the age of 13 years but fibre cell length was significantly longer after the age of 14. 5 and 20 years, depending on the plantation of origin. Therefore, the boundary between JW and AW in plantation grown okoumé occurs between the ages of 13 and 20 years, depending on the characteristic examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the physical properties of wood from Araucaria (Araucaria angustifolia). Parameters included apparent density and dimensional stability of trees at different ages and at different positions along the stem. Data were analyzed {{as a function of}} age and height along the tree stem, and then correlated {{with each other and with}} other dendrometric variables. A variation was observed in the apparent density between ages, yet it was not possible to determine a variation pattern. A variation was found in the apparent density along the stem, decreasing with increasing heights for all ages. Wood obtained from the lower portion of the stem was more unstable dimensionally. Linear equations are provided of the sum of <b>radial</b> and tangential <b>shrinkage</b> as a function of the apparent density. Equations reveal that more than 40 % of the shrinkage was explained by the variation in apparent density...|$|R
