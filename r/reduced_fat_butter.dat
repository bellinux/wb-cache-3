Sprague–Dawley females were fed AIN, high <b>fat</b> <b>butter,</b> 17 α-ethinyl estradiol, or high <b>fat</b> <b>butter</b> plus four bisphenol A doses (2500 µg/kg bw-d, 250 µg/kg bw-d, 25 µg/kg bw-d, and 2. 5 µg/kg bw-d) before and during pregnancy. All diets were switched to AIN after the pups were born. Male offspring received testosterone (T) - and estradiol- 17 β (E 2) -filled implants from postnatal day 70 – 210 for 20 weeks (T+E 2 rat model).

25|$|In Britain, {{rationing}} {{was finally}} imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and <b>fats</b> (<b>butter</b> and margarine), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, {{from a little}} over four million to a little over eight million.|$|R
50|$|The {{mixture is}} {{composed}} exclusively of flour, sugar, eggs, pine nuts; and almonds {{that are not}} roasted or skinned. The traditional recipe uses no form of yeast or <b>fat</b> (<b>butter,</b> oil, milk). The barely wet dough is then cooked twice: once in slab form, and again after cutting in sliced form, with the second baking defining how hard the biscotti are.|$|R
25|$|As {{butter is}} {{essentially}} just the milk fat, it contains only traces of lactose, so moderate consumption of butter {{is not a}} problem for lactose intolerant people. People with milk allergies may still need to avoid butter, which contains enough of the allergy-causing proteins to cause reactions. Whole milk, butter and cream have high levels of saturated <b>fat.</b> <b>Butter</b> is a good source of Vitamin A.|$|R
50|$|Goro is a Norwegian sweet bread {{which forms}} an {{important}} part of the cuisine associated with the Norwegian Christmas celebration. It is a cross between a cracker, a cookie, and a waffle. Goros are made from a mixture consisting of eggs, sugar, cream, <b>fat</b> (<b>butter</b> or lard), flour and spices, baked in a special waffle iron called a Goro-iron. Cardamom is an important spice in Goros.|$|R

25|$|Since the 1950s, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat <b>fats,</b> milk <b>fat,</b> <b>butter,</b> lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.|$|R
50|$|Almost all quick breads {{have the}} same basic ingredients: flour, leavening, eggs, <b>fat</b> (<b>butter,</b> margarine, shortening, or oil), and liquid such as milk.

The type of bread produced varies based predominantly on the method of mixing, the major flavoring, and the ratio of liquid in the batter. Some batters are thin enough to pour, and others thick enough to mold into lumps.|$|R

40|$|Dietary {{fat intake}} has {{been implicated in}} the {{causation}} of major diseases including coronary heart disease and cancer. Hence, current recommendations to improve health emphasise the reduction of fat intake (COMA, 1991). The present study investigated the effect of perceived need to <b>reduce</b> <b>fat</b> intake and past behaviour on peoples' expectations of <b>reducing</b> <b>fat</b> intake, using {{the framework of the}} Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985; 1991). The effects of estimated fat intake and body weight on perceived need to reduce were also investigated. One hundred and fifty-two adults completed a four-day weighed dietary record and completed a questionnaire based on the TPB. Perceived need to <b>reduce</b> <b>fat</b> intake, cognitive and affective components of attitude and past behaviour were found to be significant predictors of expectation of <b>reducing</b> <b>fat</b> intake. Perceived body weight and estimated fat intake were significant predictors of perceived need to <b>reduce</b> <b>fat</b> intake.

50|$|Simple buttercream (also {{known as}} American buttercream, decorator's buttercream, and decorator's frosting) {{is made by}} {{creaming}} together <b>fats</b> (<b>butter,</b> margarine, or vegetable oil shortening) and powdered sugar to the desired consistency and lightness. Typically twice as much sugar as butter by weight is used. Flavorings, {{in the form of}} extracts and oils, may also be added. Some recipes call for non-fat milk solids or meringue powder; these add a creamy texture without any decrease in stability.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} effects of free access to <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> {{products}} or their full fat equivalents on fat and energy intake, body weight, plasma lipids and fat-soluble antioxidants concentrations and haemostasis variables. Design: A multicentre open randomised controlled trial in which intervention and control groups were followed in parallel for six months. Volunteers had free access to 44 different foods either in <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> or full fat version, covering between 30 and 40 % of energy intake. The remainder of energy intake was covered by foods bought in regular shops. Setting: Zeist, Wageningen and Maastricht, The Netherlands. Subjects: Two hundred and forty-one non-obese healthy volunteers who had no intention to lose weight. Main outcome measures: Food intake, body weight, plasma lipid, vitamin E, β-carotene, lycopene and fibrinogen concentrations, plasma factor VII clotting activity, and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-I antigen level. Results: One hundred and three volunteers in the full fat group and 117 volunteers in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group completed the study. Energy and fat intake from the free access products was lower in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group, but no difference in energy and fat intake of other products occurred. Body weight, energy-, fat- and vitamin E intake and percentage of energy derived from fat decreased in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group. No other statistical significant intervention effects were observed. Blood lipid concentrations, factor VII activity and plasminogen-inhibitor-activator- 1 level were reduced after consumption of <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products. Conclusions: When subjects without intention to lose weight limit fat intake by switching from ad libitum consumption of full <b>fat</b> products to <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products body weight gain is prevented, and fat and energy intake are reduced. Such a switch may have beneficial effects on biochemical cardiovascular risk factors. We concluded that <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products will help in a population strategy aimed at preventing overweight and obesity, they will also be effective in maintaining a lower body weight after slimming. Ad libitum consumption of <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products will be ineffective for those individuals that want to reduce body weight because they are currently overweight or obese.

50|$|Different {{forms of}} {{exercises}} are practiced for the fitness {{of the body}} and also for health. It is a common belief that targeted exercise <b>reduces</b> <b>fat</b> in specific parts of the body —for example, that exercising muscles around the belly <b>reduces</b> <b>fat</b> in the belly.

However, emerging evidence suggests that dairy fat may not have detrimental health effects. We aimed to investigate prospective associations between consumption of regular versus <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> {{dairy products}} and cardiometabolic risk factors from early to late adolescence. In the West Australian Raine Study, dairy intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires in 860 adolescents at 14 and 17 -year follow-ups; 582 of these also had blood biochemistry at both points.

40|$|The {{majority}} of consumers refuse meat {{with higher levels}} of fat, because of possible association between high levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and heart disease. The meat production tries to fit consumers preferences with lowering fat content of meat. Such meat should also contain less cholesterol. In the following contribution the possibilities for <b>reducing</b> <b>fat</b> and cholesterol content and altering fatty acid composition of meat are discussed. In meat animals the estimated heritability for fat content is relatively high (between 0. 3 and 0. 6). This means that selection represents a powerful tool for fat reduction. Even better possibility for <b>reducing</b> <b>fat</b> and altering fatty acid composition is adequate nutrition. The decrease of animal age and weight at slaughter can also <b>reduce</b> carcass <b>fat</b> content. Also the use of transgenic animals and different growth stimulators represents a wide range of possibilities to <b>reduce</b> <b>fat</b> content in farm animals. ...|$|R
