5|$|Snedden also {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} upgrades to the News-Miner's printing equipment. In 1953, rotary printing was introduced to Fairbanks after Snedden purchased a used <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> from The Sacramento Union. To house the press, Snedden built a two-story building adjacent to the Lathrop Building. The Lathrop Building still contained most of the News-Miner's offices and typesetting equipment, but it was not large enough to contain the new press without extensive renovations, thus requiring a new building. Shortly after the new press was introduced, the News-Miner produced its first full-color newspaper. The new equipment also allowed for larger print jobs, and Snedden introduced an annual Progress Edition that was intended to be distributed outside Alaska in order to attract business and industry to the state. In 1954, the News-Miner obtained a dedicated teletype to the Associated Press, avoiding the need for contracts for telephone and telegraph service to a correspondent in Seattle who would relay AP material to the News-Miner.|$|E
25|$|Those {{engraved}} {{images on}} the 2 and 3 cent Washington-head issues that appear similar but whose lines vary significantly are referred to and often cataloged as types. Type I occurs on flat plate printings only while types II & III also occur mostly in <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> printings and in offset printings as they were produced from photo plates made from the former printing plates. The 2-cent Type II stamp does not occur on a flat plate stamp. Because the commonly used denominations of the Washington-Franklin issues were printed in greater quantities the worn printing plates {{would have to be}} replaced in the process from time to time. Though each new plate was made from the same die transfer, the plates would still differ slightly from the previous plate in use due to the bending process to fit the plate around the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> printing cylinder. Plates would also differ because the transfer die itself would wear from repeated image transfers to the printing plate.|$|E
25|$|Chandler ran the {{newspaper}} {{for the next}} 43 years, first as The Bend Bulletin and after 1963 as The Bulletin. During his tenure, Chandler brought new technology into his newspaper operation. Soon after he bought the paper in 1953, he expanded the photoengraving facilities. In 1956, he replaced the paper's flatbed press with a new <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> that printed 13,000 32-page sections per hour. The new press also allowed the paper to print photographs in color.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s or early 1940s, <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> had {{increased}} substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press {{was capable of}} performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.|$|R
25|$|From 1908 to 1914 coil stamps {{were printed}} with Flat Plate presses in sheets of 400 {{which were then}} cut into strips for coiling. In 1915 the Bureau began {{printing}} coil stamps from continuous rolls of paper with the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Press.</b> The printing plates were curved and affixed around a rotating cylinder, a process that stretched the images somewhat, making them slightly longer than similar images printed from a flat-plate. The difference in size becomes evident when the two different types are placed side by side.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{the arrival}} of the Gutenberg-style press to the shores of Tahiti (1818), Hawaii (1821) and other Pacific islands, marked the end of a global {{diffusion}} process which had begun almost 400 years earlier. At the same time, the 'old style' press (as the Gutenberg model came to be termed in the 19th century), was already {{in the process of being}} displaced by industrial machines like the steam powered press (1812) and the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> (1833), which radically departed from Gutenberg's design, but were still of the same development line.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 a 1 and 2-cent Washington-head were issued, {{again on}} unwatermarked paper with gauge 11 perforations. These two stamps were issued in sheets of 170 and {{were made from}} coil waste printed on the <b>rotary</b> <b>press.</b> Images {{produced}} from curved printing plates are slightly longer than images produced from a flat plate as the surface and images elongate from the bending. The only way to distinguish this printing from the 1918 perf.11 printing is to measure {{the parameters of the}} stamp designs which measure 19½ mm wide by 20mm tall, or by placing it next to and comparing it with a flat-plate printing.|$|E
5000|$|Die cutting {{can be done}} {{on either}} flatbed or <b>rotary</b> <b>presses.</b> <b>Rotary</b> die cutting is often done inline with printing. The primary {{difference}} between rotary die cutting and flatbed die cutting is that the flatbed is not as fast but the tools are cheaper. This process lends itself to smaller production runs where {{it is not as}} easy to absorb the added cost of a rotary die.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1920s, <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> {{came into}} use for {{printing}} stamps which used long rolls of paper rather than individual sheets, and this made the paste-up phase unnecessary, as sheets of any length could {{be produced by}} the press and merely needed to be cut into strips.|$|R
50|$|Spray powder is {{not used}} on <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> {{including}} <b>rotary</b> letterpress, web offset (often used for printing magazines), flexographic (often used for printing flexible packaging and labels) or gravure (often used for printing long-run catalogues). Similarly, spray powder is not generally used in sheet-fed (silk) screen-printing, ink-jet or toner based digital printing.|$|R
25|$|In 1923 the Post Office {{released}} the last Washington-Franklin stamp {{that would also}} become the rarest non-error stamp (Scott 544) in this issue. Printed on unwatermarked paper with gauge 11 perforations, this issue can only be distinguished from the 1-cent 1918 issue (which is also printed on unwatermarked paper with gauge 11 perforations) by measuring {{the parameters of the}} design: 19mm wide by 23½. In 1922 a small quantity of 1c <b>Rotary</b> <b>Press</b> stamps was perforated 11, using remainder sheets from the earlier printings that were normally perforated in 10 gauge or 10 x 11 dual (or compound) gauge. Its existence as a Perf. 11 variety was discovered in 1936, and the stamp finally received a Scott Catalogue listing in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Postage stamps {{issued in}} sheets with no {{perforations}} between the rows and columns of individual stamps {{are referred to}} as imperforate. The Washington-Franklin issue contains several series of imperforate stamps that occur on a small range of denominations from 1 through 5-cents. These stamps were issued in imperforate form to accommodate several major vending machine companies of that period who used this stock for coil stamps in their machines which were in wide use about the country. Many of these companies applied their own form of perforations, such as the , Mail-O-Meter, and Brinkerhoff vending machine companies. There were at least seven such firms, each having its own patented machines. Imperforate stamps were issued in full uncut sheets of 400 subjects or in coil rolls of 500 or 1000 stamps. The imperforate issues were printed from a flat plate with 400 subjects until 1918 when they were produced on the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> from continuous rolls of paper. Imperforate coils from this stock are much rarer than examples cut from full sheets.|$|E
2500|$|Widow Martha Custis married George Washington {{enhancing}} {{his status}} as a colonial gentleman, from which he launched his public career. Martha Washington, America’s first “First Lady” was also the first American woman to appear on stamps, featured in the series of 1902 on the 8-cent denomination, and later appeared on the 4-cent value in the so-called [...] "Fourth Bureau Issue": [...] the 1922-31 Series (which comprised 27 stamps). The Fourth Bureau stamp employed an engraving based on a drawing by French artist Charles Francois Jalabert. It was printed on both the flatbed press and the Stickney <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> and offered in sheet and coil versions.|$|E
50|$|Lloyd {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the efficiency of his production processes. In 1856, he imported two <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> made by Richard Hoe in New York that multiplied the speed of printing and were soon imported by the rest of Fleet Street. Then, exasperated by the unreliability of newsprint supplies, he decided to make his own.|$|R

As chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s, Charles Babbage developed his [...] "difference engine," [...] the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his [...] "analytical engine” by 1834. By 1843 Richard Hoe developed the <b>rotary</b> <b>press,</b> and in 1844 Samuel Morse sent the first public telegraph message. By 1848 William F.

2500|$|When the AP was founded, news {{became a}} salable commodity. The {{invention}} of the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> allowed the New York Tribune in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the Civil War and Spanish–American War, {{there was a new}} incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. Melville Stone, who had founded the Chicago Daily News in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925–48), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after World WarII), the Middle East. He introduced the [...] "telegraph typewriter" [...] or teletypewriter into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.|$|E
