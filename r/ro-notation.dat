40|$|Syntax Notation 1) {{language}} and the <b>RO-notation</b> (Remote Operation notation) language 1. For both languages, automatic code generation tools have been developed. All OSI application layer standards use ASN. 1 in order to specify data structures such as mail messages or directory entries that are exchanged in distributed applications. ASN. 1 allows to define complex data types, which are encoded in a standardized exchange format, the so-called transfersyntax. To automate the tedious task to program the encoding and decoding routines by hand, socalled ASN. 1 compilers can be used (e. g. MAVROS [Huit 91], Pepsy [Onio 89], [Neuf 90], [Harv 91] and [Koiv 92]). Today, ASN. 1 is a well-established language {{that has been used}} not only in all OSI application layer standards, but also for non-OSI standards such as the Internet Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Open Document Interchange Format (ODIF). The performance and expressiveness of ASN. 1 is equal to or even better than that of s [...] ...|$|E
