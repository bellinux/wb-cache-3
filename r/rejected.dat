40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the importance of}} using proper techniques for the <b>reject</b> inference to develop consumer credit scoring. The focus is treating <b>reject</b> inference as a missing data problem and using model-based imputation techniques {{as a way to}} enhance the information inferred from the <b>rejects</b> over that of traditional approaches when developing credit scorecards. An overview and comparison of the standard missing data approaches to <b>reject</b> inference are provided. Multiple imputation is also discussed as a method of <b>reject</b> inference which can potentially reduce some of the biases which can occur from using some of the traditional missing data techniques. A quantitative analysis is then provided to confirm the hypothesis that model-based multiple imputation is an enhancement over traditional missing data approaches to <b>reject</b> inference...|$|R

Next, attention is drawn to the close link between <b>reject</b> grammars (under the modified definition), indexed least fixpoint grammars (Rounds) and simple literal movement grammars (Groenink).
