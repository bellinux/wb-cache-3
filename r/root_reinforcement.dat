30|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} fine-root {{frequency}} {{may also be}} an important factor influencing lateral <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> McIvor et al. (2011) found that ‘Veronese’ poplar had a significant reduction in fine-root length density during the dormant season, with little change in coarse root distribution observed. From the modelling perspective, it may be assumed that only root diameters greater than 2  mm contribute to lateral <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> constantly during the year; this assumption may have a strong effect on the estimation of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> since fine roots in some cases determine the overall mechanical behaviour of the root bundle. For instance, the calculation of lateral <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for the root distribution measured at trench number 4 (P 4) on the 160  sph plot of the PN dataset produced a value of 10.4  kN m− 1, whereas assuming zero root for diameter classes < 2  mm, a value of 8.85  kN m− 1 lateral <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> was obtained. In this case, the contribution of fine roots to total lateral <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is relatively small (about 20  %), {{but in the case of}} a root bundle far from the tree stem, this contribution may be higher and lead to values of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> equal to 0.|$|E

The reinforcements were oriented longitudinally in the soil samples and the samples were failed in extension to mobilize tension in the reinforcements. The pore pressure was gradually increased during field stress path testing by raising the water level in a water column connected in series with the backpressure line in order to simulate a rising water table during rainfall. The test results indicated that the reinforcements significantly increased the pore pressures necessary to initiate soil failure.

The increasing number of landslides during wet season evidences the close relationship between hydro-climatic conditions as a triggering factor for the occurrence of landslides. In addition, the type of vegetation covering the slope affects the soil shear strength by the <b>roots</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> plants weight and changes in soil moisture due to transpiration and interception. This paper proposes a probabilistic methodology to study the slope stability on the long-term, considering different hydro-climatic conditions and the effect of vegetation cover in the soil moisture. The ecohydrological model developed by Rodríguez-Iturbe et al. [1] was used to determine the boundary conditions of the problem. To generate the pore pressure field, the flow equation was solved using the Finite Element Method and Finite Differences Method. Finally, the Limit Equilibrium Method was used to find the Factor of Safety. The stability of a hypothetical slope under certain hydro-climatic conditions and two types of vegetation was evaluated. The analysis showed that it is more likely that a grass-covered slope slides than a tree-covered slope, and that the average FS of the slope during wet and dry season is very similar, but the FS dispersion is higher when the probability and intensity of rainfall events increases...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{have been described}} satisfactorily for a single root or several roots passing a potential slip plane and verified by field experiments. Yet, precious little {{attempts have been made}} to apply these models to the hillslope scale pertinent to landsliding at which variations in soil and vegetation become important. On natural slopes positive pore pressures occur often at the weathering depth of the soil profile. At this critical depth <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is crucial to avert slope instability. This is particularly relevant for the abandoned slopes in the European part of the Mediterranean basin where root development has to balance the increasing infiltration capacity during re-vegetation. Detailed investigations related to <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were made at two abandoned slopes susceptible to landsliding located in the Alcoy basin (SE Spain). On these slopes semi-natural vegetation, consisting of a patchy herbaceous cover and dispersed Aleppo pine trees, has established itself. Soil and vegetation conditions were mapped in detail and large-scale, in-situ direct shear tests on the topsoil and pull-out tests performed in order to quantify <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> under different vegetation conditions. These tests showed that <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> was present but limited. Under herbaceous cover, the typical reinforcement was in the order of 0. 6 kPa while values up to 18 kPa were observed under dense pine cover. The tests indicate that fine root content and vegetation conditions are important factors that explain the <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of the topsoil. These findings were confirmed by the simulation of the direct shear tests by means of an advanced <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> model developed in FLAC 2 D. Inclusion of the root distribution for the observed vegetation cover mimics root failure realistically but returns over-optimistic estimates of the <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> When the <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is applied with this information at the hillslope scale under fully saturated and critical hydrological conditions, root pull-out becomes the dominant root failure mechanism and the slip plane is located at the weathering depth of the soil profile where <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is negligible.

ChinaInternational audienceBackground: The {{contribution}} of vegetation to shallow-slope stability is of major importance in landslide-prone regions. However, existing slope stability models use only limited plant root architectural parameters. This study aims {{to provide a}} chain of tools useful for determining the {{contribution of}} tree <b>roots</b> to soil <b>reinforcement.</b> Methods: Three-dimensional digitizing in situ was used to obtain accurate root system architecture data for mature Quercus alba in two forest stands. These data were used as input to tools developed, which analyse the spatial position of roots, topology and geometry. The contribution of <b>roots</b> to soil <b>reinforcement</b> was determined by calculating additional soil cohesion using the limit equilibrium model, and the factor of safety (FOS) using an existing slope stability model, Slip 4 Ex. Key Results: Existing models may incorrectly estimate the additional soil cohesion provided by roots, as the spatial position of roots crossing the potential slip surface is usually not taken into account. However, most soil <b>reinforcement</b> by <b>roots</b> occurs close to the tree stem and is negligible at a distance > 1 · 0 m from the tree, and therefore global values of FOS for a slope do {{not take into account}} local slippage along the slope. Conclusions: Within a forest stand on a landslide-prone slope, soil fixation by roots can be minimal between uniform rows of trees, leading to local soil slippage. Therefore, staggered rows of trees would improve overall slope stability, as trees would arrest the downward movement of soil.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a discrete-time option pricing model that is <b>rooted</b> in <b>Reinforcement</b> Learning (RL), {{and more specifically}} in the famous Q-Learning method of RL. We construct a risk-adjusted Markov Decision Process for a discrete-time version of the classical Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, where the option price is an optimal Q-function. Pricing is done by learning to dynamically optimize risk-adjusted returns for an option replicating portfolio, as in the Markowitz portfolio theory. Using Q-Learning and related methods, once created in a parametric setting, the model is able to go model-free and learn to price and hedge an option directly from data generated from a dynamic replicating portfolio which is rebalanced at discrete times. If the world is according to BSM, our risk-averse Q-Learner converges, given enough training data, to the true BSM price and hedge ratio of the option in the continuous time limit, even if hedges applied at the stage of data generation are completely random (i. e. it can learn the BSM model itself, too!), because Q-Learning is an off-policy algorithm. If the world is different from a BSM world, the Q-Learner will find it out as well, because Q-Learning is a model-free algorithm. For finite time steps, the Q-Learner is able to efficiently calculate both the optimal hedge and optimal price for the option directly from trading data, and without an explicit model of the world. This suggests that RL may provide efficient data-driven and model-free methods for optimal pricing and hedging of options, once we depart from the academic continuous-time limit, and vice versa, option pricing methods developed in Mathematical Finance {{may be viewed as}} special cases of model-based Reinforcement Learning.

In addition to the ecological and economical benefits of mixedwoods, paper birch trees can maintain or enhance slope stability. This thesis attempted to quantify the contribution of birch <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in BC to slope shear resistance. The objectives of this thesis were to determine the: 1) genetic variation in paper birch <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> 2) environmental variation in <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> between birch and pine, and 3) differences in <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> between birch and pine. The first study compared the contribution of birch and pine roots (from different populations growing in three soil types) to soil shear resistance using two controlled environment shear tests (Sonotube and Polytube Experiments). The second study (Tree Uprooting Experiment) compared the vertical uprooting resistance of birch and pine growing in different soil types at three field study sites. The third study (Genecology Experiment) determined the variation of four birch populations growing at one location. Results from the tube experiments found that the roots of birch and pine trees contributed to {{a significant increase in}} shear strength, regardless of soil type. At a depth of 20 - 44 cm, paper birch increased shear strength by as much 88 %, while pine increased strength by as much as 61 %. There was little variation in <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> among the six birch populations in the Sonotube Experiment, which suggested that these trees were from one generalist population rather than six specialist populations. Soil texture affected the <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of birch and pine in the Polytube Experiment~ both species had the highest <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in coarse textured sand and the least <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in medium textured silt. The limiting factor in <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> in this case, was attributed to a lack of water and nutrients in the silt soil. In the Tree Uprooting Experiment, birch trees had 50 % greater resistance to uprooting than did pine trees. Small diameter birch and pine at Aleza Lake had greater uprooting resistance than birch and pine at other field sites. However, larger diameter trees at Gregg Creek and Red Rock had greater uprooting resistance than similar size trees at Aleza Lake. Soil strength and moisture content may have accounted for the uprooting resistance differences among diameter classes at Aleza Lake. Results from the Genecology Experiment showed that the Skeena population had the greatest uprooting resistance, and the greatest height, diameter, and root biomass compared to the other three populations. The results from companion trials, and from the uprooting tests suggested that Skeena trees represent a generalist population. In the same experiment, the nursery where the trees were grown impacted uprooting resistance, even after five years growing in the field. The results from this study reconfirmed the significant length of time nursery can affect field performance. Significant findings arising from this thesis were that: 1) birch saplings have greater root strength than pine across all soil types, 2) root system structure has an important role in <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> between tree species, 3) <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is maximized by birch and pine when growing in freely drained, cohesionless sandy soil, and 4) further study of birch genecology is needed to identify generalist, high performing populations such as Skeena.

Although there is growing interest in using vegetation to stabilize hillslopes against landslides, we noted the scarcity of studies examining temporal variations in slope stability, particularly with regard to different land uses. In three tropical and temperate landslide-prone regions (Laos, Costa Rica and France), we combined soil moisture monitoring to 1. 2 - 1. 8 m depths in the field, soil shear resistance measurements and numerical modeling to compare slope stability under competing land uses for 2 - 3 years. Slope stability tracked temporal changes in soil moisture, with smaller contributions from <b>root</b> mechanical <b>reinforcement.</b> Land uses with denser vegetation had greater stabilizing impacts than those with sparser vegetation, which lasted for six to twelve months per year and coincided temporally with growing or rainy/dry seasons. Greater stability under denser land use persisted into wet seasons in one of the sites and were minimized or reversed in the other two sites. Site-specific factors such as climate, soil and species may explain these differences in the vegetational control on slope stability. A review of the data in the literature found that woody vegetation increased slope stability and decreased temporal variation in stability compared to herbaceous vegetation. However, while variations in slope stability decreased in increasingly humid climates, indicating that the largest fluctuations in stability, and hence potential to improve slope integrity with land-use changes, will be found in arid to sub-humid regions. Our results show that dense vegetation provides greater stability and protection against landslides from rainfall. Land managers need to take into account this biological control on hydrology when managing vegetated slopes.

The main objectives of this thesis was to test {{the possibility of using}} plant roots to modify soil structure and to use laboratory screening methods to find plant species suitable for penetrating strong soil. Two laboratory screening methods were tested. The first method used soft and hard wax layers installed in sand cores. The proportion of roots penetrating the hard relative to the soft layer was highest for lucerne, intermediate for chicory, lupin and red clover, and lowest for barley. The second method used natural soil compacted by different vertical stresses. Measurements of root length density showed that lucerne had a greater ability to establish a deep root system in compacted soil than barley and lupin. A field experiment was carried out to test the possibility to use plant roots to modify subsoil structure. The complete area of all plots except the control plots were compacted by a dump truck (weight 30 Mg) {{prior to the start of}} the experiments. The plant species studied were lupin (Lupinus luteus L.), lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea L.), chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Tall fescue had the highest root length density (RLD) at 30 - 35 cm depth, but RLD of chicory and lucerne were also fairly high. Chicory had the largest effect on subsoil structure, as estimated by saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) at 30 - 35 cm depth, closely followed by lucerne. Abundance of earthworms was related to tillage intensity and was consistently higher in plots of perennial crops. The influence of earthworms on Ksat was lower than that of plant roots.

For example, a dense lateral network of woody roots predominantly confined to the upper soil horizons often forms a membrane that stabilises shallow soils (Schmidt et al. 2001) and significantly reduces shallow landslide potential on steep slopes (Ekanayake et al. 1997), while the larger tree <b>roots</b> can provide <b>reinforcement</b> across lateral planes of weakness bounding potential slope failures (Sidle et al. 1985). However, deeper soil mantles (>[*] 5  m) benefit little from such <b>reinforcement</b> as <b>root</b> density decreases dramatically with depth and few large roots are able to anchor across the basal shear plane (Stokes et al. 2008). The only benefit of root strength to the stabilisation of deep-seated landslides, e.g. earthflows and slumps, is when very large lateral woody roots cross planes of weakness along the flanks of potential failures (Sidle and Ochiai 2006). However, such reinforcement would only benefit deep-seated landslides of small area extent whereas lateral roots also offer protection against most shallow landslides (Swanston and Swanson 1976).|$|R

Most of these experiments consist in shearing rectangular parallelepiped soil blocks (shear tests) with and without roots and deducing a “root additional cohesion-friction angle” from the analyses of resulting response curves. However {{it is often difficult to}} interpret the results without considering the effect of each individual root as well as the group effect involved by neighbor roots.

The effect of an increase in the stiffness of the wires on soil shear resistance was analyzed. The main results are: 1 - the Euler explicit method is suitable to simulate shear tests involving large distortion; 2 - simulations explained why real shear tests exhibited lower shear strength of “reinforced” soils compared to bare soils, and thus can help designing more suitable experiments; 3 - a variation in the bending stiffness of wires modifies the stiffness and shear resistance of reinforced soil blocks through a modification of the ratio between normal and shear stress components involved during their deformation...|$|R

These obstacles provoke a lack of experienced operators and they desire a base of knowledge related to optimal parameters to obtain good quality welds. In this scenario, understanding of the physical LAHW phenomena has been proven useful for better control of the process,particularly to predict and avoid groups of parameters that can originate defects. For this reason, it is valuable to carry out experiments and to systematize the analysis methods. The presented work {{is focused on the}} impact of geometrical joint fit-up properties on the weld surface quality. The papers included here are organized as a comprehensive study of the effects and impact of various geometrical aspects of the laser-arc-workpiece arrangement on the surface quality of the welds, i. e. tracking from joint fit-up tolerances like gap width to critical weld shape aspects like undercuts via observation of fluid flow at the weld pool surface. Three frequent and critical geometrical aspects were identified from industrial edge preparation, namely gap width variations, vertical edgemismatch and vertical plate position to the laser-arc tool. These aspects can cause defects when the surface is bended or when the LAHW tool is automatically moved. Although in production they arise all simultaneously, to understand the respective contribution, systematic experiments were designed. These experiments were carried out to measure and surpass the stability threshold related to each aspect, to observe the flow behaviour and to evaluate the physical phenomena related to weld bead formation. The three Papers I, II, III describe a systematic methodology based on High Speed Imaging, HSI, on quantitative weld surface measurement obtained from a laser triangulation scanner and on statistical analysis of different experimental results. This methodology is based on the observation, measurement, automatic location and calculation of fundamental bead variables (top and <b>root</b> undercuts, <b>reinforcement,</b> melt pool length, pool width and flow speed, or mass balance) related to the melt flow. In Paper I, using a pulsed arc mode, the effects of increasing the standoff between the LAHW tool and the workpiece are described and a mechanism is identified to explain the flow behaviour and its consequences on the resulting weld pool shape. In Paper II, again using pulsed arc mode in LAHW, the effects of the vertical edge mismatch and of the gap width on the weld pool shape are described, again followed by a theoretical description. Paper III compares the pulsed arc mode with the CMT mode in LAHW,again for the effect of the gap width on the weld surface shape, in particular the top bridging phenomenon that was identified. Also these results are theoretically described, explaining the mechanisms via HSI. Altogether, the three papers comprise a theoretical description of the LAHW weld shape behaviour and weld quality depending on the fit-up tolerances, based on experimental evidence and analysis. From this chain of evidence and associated understanding, conclusions were drawn and practical guidelines were derived.

40|$|Root {{networks}} {{contribute to}} slope stability through complex interactions with soil that include mechanical compression and tension. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of root distribution and {{the dynamics of}} root turnover, the quantification of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> on steep slopes is challenging and consequently the calculation of slope stability also. Although considerable progress has been made, some important aspects of root mechanics remain neglected. In this study we address specifically the role of root-strength variability on the mechanical behavior of a root bundle. Many factors contribute to the variability of root mechanical properties even within a single class of diameter. This work presents a new approach for quantifying <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> that considers the variability of mechanical properties of each root diameter class. Using the data of laboratory tensile tests and field pullout tests, we calibrate {{the parameters of the}} Weibull survival function to implement the variability of root strength in a numerical model for the calculation of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (RBMw). The results show that, for both laboratory and field data sets, the parameters of the Weibull distribution may be considered constant with the exponent equal to 2 and the normalized failure displacement equal to 1. Moreover, the results show that the variability of root strength in each root diameter class has a major influence on the behavior of a root bundle with important implications when considering different approaches in slope stability calculation. Sensitivity analysis shows that the calibration of the equations of the tensile force, the elasticity of the roots, and the root distribution are the most important steps. The new model allows the characterization of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in terms of maximum pullout force, stiffness, and energy. Moreover, it simplifies the implementation of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in slope stability models. The realistic quantification of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for tensile, shear and compression behavior allows for the consideration of the stabilization effects of root networks on steep slopes and the influence that this has on the triggering of shallow landslides...|$|E
30|$|This {{study shows}} that root {{distribution}} data are important inputs for quantifying <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> at the hillslope scale, and that root distribution strongly depends on local environmental conditions and on the tree planting density. The results also show {{that the combination of}} soil mechanical properties (soil angle of internal friction and cohesion) and topographic conditions (slope inclination) are the major parameters to define how much <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is needed to stabilise a specific slope, and thus the spacing of the trees to achieve this.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{describes}} a unique quantitative approach that combines information about root distribution and root mechanical data {{in order to}} calculate the spatial distribution of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{as a function of}} tree dimension and distance between ‘Veronese’ poplar trees. The results were used to formulate guidelines for the planning of bioengineering measures with the aim of reducing erosion on pastoral hill slopes in New Zealand. The calculations show that the definition of effective planting density for the same poplar clone ‘Veronese’ {{is a function of the}} local root growing condition, the slope inclination, and the soil mechanical properties (effective friction angle and cohesion). Generally, it can be concluded that planting density that ranges between 330 and 160  sph (corresponding to stem distance of 5.5 and 8  m, respectively) would assure significant <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for slope stabilisation (> 2  kN m− 1) and reduce the volume of triggered shallow landslides by up to 100  %. In ideal growing conditions, tree spacing starting from 100  sph is sufficient for stem DBH larger than 0.15  m to assure enough <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> A lower planting density would lead to less lateral <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> and the contribution of vegetation to slope stability would probably be limited to the hydrological effects.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 A {{hypothesis}} used {{to explain}} the relationship between timber harvesting and landslides is that tree roots add mechanical support to soil, thus increasing soil strength. Upon harvest, the tree roots decay which reduces soil strength and {{increases the risk of}} management -induced landslides. The technical literature does not adequately support this hypothesis. Soil strength values attributed to <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> that are in the technical literature are such that forested sites can't fail and all high risk, harvested sites must fail. Both unstable forested sites and stable harvested sites exist, in abundance, in the real world thus, the literature does not adequately describe the real world. An analytical model was developed to calculate soil strength increase due to <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Conceptually, the model is composed of a reinforcing element with high tensile strength, i. e. a conifer root, embedded in a material with little tensile strength, i. e. a soil. As the soil fails and deforms, the reinforcing element also deforms and stretches. The lateral deformation of the reinforcing element is treated analytically as a laterally loaded pile in a flexible foundation and the axial deformation is treated as an axially loaded pile. The governing differential equations are solved using finite-difference approximation techniques. The <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> model was tested by comparing the final shape of steel and aluminum rods, parachute cord, wooden dowels, and pine roots in direct shear with predicted shapes from the output of the <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> model. The comparisons were generally satisfactory, were best for parachute cord and wooden dowels, and were poorest for steel and aluminum rods. A parameter study was performed on the <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> model which showed reinforced soil strength increased with increasing root diameter and soil depth. Output from the <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> model showed a strain incompatibility between large and small diameter roots. The peak increase in soil strength attributed to roots was controlled by the small (< 4 mm) diameter root fraction. These results were used to calculate the effect of timber harvesting on a small, approximately 7. 6 m^ 3 (10 yd^ 3), hypothetical landslide in a shallow, cohesionless, forest soil. The <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> model predicted a post-harvest reduction in soil strength of 14 and 19 percent for a soil with and without 5 kPa (105 lbs/ft^ 2) of cohesion, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In steep soil-mantled landscapes, the {{initiation}} of shallow landslides is strongly controlled by the distribution of vegetation, whose roots reinforce the soil. The magnitude of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> depends on the number, diameter distribution, orientation and the mechanical properties of roots that cross potential failure planes. Understanding how these properties vary {{in space and time}} in forests remains a significant challenge. Here we test the hypothesis that spatio-temporal variations in <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> along a hillslope occur as a function of topographic soil moisture gradients. To test this hypothesis we compared <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> measurements from relatively dry, divergent noses to relatively wet, convergent hollows in the southern Appalachian Mountains, North Carolina, USA. Our initial results showed that <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> decreased in areas of higher soil moisture because the tensile strength of roots decreased. A post-hoc laboratory experiment further demonstrated that root tensile strength decreased as root moisture content increased. This effect is consistent with other experiments on stem woods showing that increased water content in the cell wall decreases tensile strength. Our experimental data demonstrated that roots can adjust to changes in the external root moisture conditions within hours, suggesting that root moisture content will change over the timescale of large storm events (hours-days). We assessed the effects of the dynamic changes in root tensile strength to the magnitude of apparent cohesion within the infinite slope stability model. Slopes can be considerably less stable when precipitation-driven increases in saturated soil depth both increase pore pressures and decrease <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> This article is protected by copyright.

30|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to characterise the lateral root distribution of poplar trees using datasets from two different locations in order to compare the influence of environmental conditions, calibrate the root distribution model from Schwarz et al. (2010 a), and calculate the spatial distribution of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> on slopes with different tree spacing. Finally, {{it was also the}} aim to simulate the stabilisation effects of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> on slopes prone to failure in order to formulate general guidelines for planning and evaluation of ground bioengineering stabilisation measures.|$|E
30|$|Some {{knowledge}} and understanding of how wide-spaced trees contribute to slope stabilisation is provided by limited data on the root distribution of young (< 12  years) poplar and willow trees on slopes (McIvor et al. 2008; McIvor et al. 2009; Douglas et al. 2010). However, although significant advances in understanding {{have been made in the}} last decade, and are being used to refine planting recommendations, a key gap is linking the mechanical quantification of <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement</b> with its effects on slope stability. The framework proposed by Schwarz et al. (2010 a) provides an opportunity to upscale root distribution data to the stand scale, calculate <b>root</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> and thus discuss its effects on slope stability.|$|E
