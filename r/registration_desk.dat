40|$|Some {{results of}} an {{investigation}} are presented in which answers on some basic variables (occupation and education) are registered in several ways. The variables were measured in a setting in which the registration was to occur as fast as possible. All registrations went by using a computer. The registrations were checked a few weeks afterwards. This gives information about {{the reliability of the}} registrations. About 70 % of those having a job reported the same occupation during the registration and the check. For educational level the same answer was given in about 80 % of the cases. People not in the labour process reported both times nearly identical. Typing the labels resembles most the way employees at <b>registration</b> <b>desks</b> work. Choosing, however, from a list gives more reliable results.

5000|$|The RIA {{centers and}} the Digital Libraries act as {{community}} spaces for shared learning {{and as part}} of the online global culture. Due to their modular and environmental architecture they were included in the OECD’s 4th Compendium of Exemplary Educational Facilities (http://edfacilitiesinvestment-db.org/facilities/38). Designed by Ludens, the RIA centers provide an environment conducive to learning through spaces that are sustainable, comfortable, secure and strategically located. The <b>registration</b> <b>desks</b> and the interior walls are built with a modular design that allows them to be easily moved, opened and closed or disassembled when changing the configuration of a center. Moreover, in order to minimize waste, the dimensions of the modules are based on the materials’ industrial measurements; this way, little to no material goes unused.The location of each RIA center is determined through an [...] "urban acupuncture" [...] process that analyzes population density, income levels, educational attainment levels, the location of schools and major transportation routes. This process has aided to maximize the impact of its projects. Each RIA center benefits an average of 10.7 schools in a radius of 2 kilometers and provides services to an average of 5,000 users per year. The Digital Libraries focus on the target population by being inside public schools and combining digital learning tools, fostering reading skills and providing cultural services.|$|R
40|$|I love museums, and I {{love the}} museum family and these yearly family gatherings. I am {{particularly}} {{honored to be}} invited to address the CARE community gathered here today because I think you are critical to the salvation of our family. Our museum family is in danger. Outside economic forces find us vulnerable because of internal divisions and because we don’t have our act together. So, I am here on a mission to save museums and to engage your considerable skills in a family intervention, for we have lost our way. Management has failed our mission by focusing on outputs like attendance numbers, and audience researchers have failed management by not shedding light on the connections between the pleasure of learning and attendance or, if you will, between individual gains and a museum’s public value. This research vision for museums looks at how you can make that connection and save museums in their hour of need. We are all museum professionals. We are part of that larger field, with this AAM Big Tent conference hosting our largest family gathering. After the “museum boom ” of the Giddy Nineties, there are now more museums than Starbucks (Katz, 2008) – yet many of them are struggling in today’s economy and wired lifestyle. I mentioned that I am particularly fond of these annual family gatherings, where I run into friends and colleagues near the <b>registration</b> <b>desks</b> and in the aisles of AAM’s Expo Center. This annual conference has always reminded me of a Lewis Thomas quote from his Lives of a Cell, that Jeanie and I used as one of our marriage readings, over 25 years ago. As you listen to Thomas’s description, think of our professional family and of this conference: “Viewed from a suitable height, the aggregating clusters of medical scientists in the bright sunlight of the boardwalk at Atlantic City, swarmed there from everywhere for the annual meetings, have the look of assemblages of social insects. There is the same vibrating, ionic movement, interrupted by the darting back and forth of jerky individuals to touch antennae and exchange small bits of information…. ” A Research Vision for Museums...|$|R

[...] One {{of the chief}} features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes and stained glass. The entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling. [...] The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a <b>registration</b> <b>desk</b> when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897. Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with an alcove off it containing the elevators and grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which {{was used as a}} reception room for women. It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of Marie Antoinette, and an antique clock which was once owned by her. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling Delmonico's and Sherry's. It was modeled after the grand salon in King Ludwig's palace at Munich, with satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and Crowninshield's frescoes. Empire in style, the Waldorf's restaurant feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that came opposite them were of mahogany, with ormolu work in the panels. The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, the Francois V Bedroom, which was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits.|$|E

The lobby is furnished with polished nickel-bronze cornices and rockwood stone. The grand clock, a [...] bronze was built by the Goldsmith's Company of London originally for the 1893 World Columbia Exposition in Chicago, but was purchased by the Waldorf owners. [...] Its base is octagonal, with eight commemorative plaques of presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S.

Franklin Street in 1984. Several boutiques surround the lobby, which contains Cole Porter's Steinway & Sons floral print decorated grand piano on the Cocktail Terrace, which the hotel had once given him as a gift. Porter was a resident at the hotel for 30 years and composed many of his songs here. The Empire Room is where many of the musical and dance performances were put on, from Count Basie, to Victor Borge, Gordon MacRae, George M. Cohan and Lena Horne, the first black performer at the hotel.|$|R

Further upgrades and repairs {{were made to the}} heating system controls and the air conditioning, electrical, and ventilation systems. A moveable partition was added to the Great Hall, allowing it to be divided. New lighting and more than 800 telephone lines were added as well, and exhibitor offices were built on a new mezzanine overlooking the exhibition space. Turner Construction was contractor for the Public Auditorium work. The old exhibition space below Public Auditorium was converted into a lobby, cocktail lounge, office space, piano bar, and 15 new meeting rooms. The bathrooms in Public Auditorium were renovated to make them accessible as well as modern, and all public spaces in Public Auditorium were retiled, repainted, and replastered, while furniture received new upholstery. New taxicab stands were built at each end of Public Auditorium, and small gardens placed at each end of each taxi stand. The exterior metal sheathing on the reception pavilion was removed and replaced with stone, and new paving and exterior lighting installed. New mechanical window blinds were installed to help cool the pavilion as well as to block bright sunlight. [...] Indoor trees were planted in the pavilion to add visual warmth, and the facility received a new terrazzo floor, new stone wainscoting, and new fabric wall coverings. To make registration more efficient, a new, central curved <b>registration</b> <b>desk</b> was built. A closed-circuit television system was added throughout the convention center, with monitors placed at the central <b>registration</b> <b>desk.</b> Displays about Cleveland area attractions and dining facilities were erected in the reception pavilion, and various airlines serving the local airport were allowed to have kiosks so that convention-goers could make flight reservations more easily. The total cost of Phase Two was $6 million ($ in [...] dollars). The Public Auditorium renovations were complete by the end of July 1986, while the Great Hall work was just beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Lakeside Hall was {{converted}} into a new ballroom which could seat 4,000 people. Service space between the Great Hall and Lakeside Hall {{was converted}} into a new lobby, with staircase access to the surface above. The contemporarily-styled lobby had an illuminated ceiling the mimicked a skylight. The steel columns in the space were plastered, and one bare concrete wall covered with a new decoration of sculpted glass block and stone. A corner kiosk in the lobby doubled as a <b>registration</b> <b>desk</b> and a bar. A new monumental staircase, echoing {{the look of the}} staircase in Public Auditorium, was built to connect the lobby with the new banquet hall. Rather than the traditional plush look, the ballroom space was designed with an industrial feel that helped unite it visually with the Great Hall. Industrial ceiling lights, covered in Teflon fabric and perforated metal wall sconces helped to light the space. The walls remained raw concrete. To help eliminate the underground feel of the space, the north wall with its three-door railroad loading dock was removed, and a new glass curtain wall installed. [...] To improve the view of Lake Erie beyond, a retaining wall outside the facility was lowered.
