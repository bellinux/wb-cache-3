5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>wheels</b> {{were chosen}} over {{other types of}} wheel, such as steel, to {{minimize}} noise. <b>Rubber</b> <b>wheels</b> have a property of making little noise as they roll on surfaces such as plexiglass. The noiseless train will serve two purposes, transferring guests and supplying the underwater hotel. Supplies will be packed on land, and delivered efficiently to the hotel to minimize the space taken up by goods in the hotel. Cars transferring supplies will feature palettes, and cars transferring passengers will provide {{a view of the}} ocean. The guest transporting aspect of the train will have a maximum efficiency of 1000 people per hour.|$|R
50|$|The new subtype {{differed}} from the original one in having a raised and more angular engine deck (in later production vehicles with crosswise instead of longitudinal ventilation slits on the right side); a range decreased to 120 km; closed idler wheels; tracks two centimetres wider at 27 cm; metal instead of <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> treads; a silencer directed to the back and larger, more reliable and effective, ventilators.|$|E
50|$|Patrick M (2014) {{notes that}} apart from {{switching}} issues monorail processes, considerable maintenance and energy issues.While monorail along with LRT {{has a life}} span of around 30 years, monorail which has tires that run on the beam only last 160,000 km requiring periodic replacement and additional operational and maintenance costs. It is also suggested that energy consumption of monorail is 25-30% greater than LRT technologies due to the <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> system’s greater rolling resistance.|$|E
5000|$|Gear-drive ceiling fans. These {{were similar}} to (and even less common than) the {{friction}} drive models; however, instead of a <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> on the motor shaft using friction to turn the flywheel, a gear {{on the end of}} the motor shaft meshed with gear teeth formed into the flywheel, thus rotating it. The company [...] "Panama" [...] made gear driven ceiling fans and sold them through [...] "Family Handyman" [...] magazine in the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|Shreveport's past {{reflects}} {{the need for}} mass transit and public roads. As {{far back as the}} 1870s residents used mule-drawn street cars that were later converted to electric-motorized cars by 1890. Commuter rail in Shreveport flourished for many decades, and rail car lines extended out to rural areas. In the 1930 the trolleys and rail cars were replaced by <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> trolleys and buses. In the 1960s the Interstate Highway System came to the area with construction of Interstate 20 (I-20).|$|E
50|$|Wheel chocks {{must be used}} on a level surface; some <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> chocks have steel grates and ice cleat accessories. The {{vehicle is}} placed in park (on {{vehicles}} with automatic gearboxes) and the parking or emergency brake is applied. The wheel chocks are then snugly positioned against {{the center of the}} tires {{in the direction of the}} grade, on both the left and right side of the vehicle. On even surfaces, chocks are applied to the rear-facing as well as the front-facing side of each tire.|$|E
50|$|As part of Record Store day, {{it will be}} {{released}} on two singled sided heavyweight 180g with etched markings, encased in a white, branded, <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> and housed in a transparent plastic box designed by Alexander Brown. The physical product was also inspired by the golden discs launched with both Voyager spacecraft in the 1977.

50|$|The carrier is {{a hollow}} {{rectangular}} box girder with a slit {{in the bottom}} through which the cabin is suspended at the running gear, whose two axles carry the load with a <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> on both sides providing both suspension and propulsion. Two wheels run horizontally along {{the top and bottom}} of the interior side walls of the carrier box, providing horizontal guidance. Thus, the designation as a monorail system is to be taken with a grain of salt, meaning just that there is a single axis of suspension.|$|E
5000|$|Friction-drive {{ceiling fan}}s. This {{short-lived}} type of ceiling fan was attempted by {{companies such as}} Emerson and NuTone in the late 1970s with little success. Its advantage was its tremendously low power consumption, but the fans were unreliable and very noisy, {{in addition to being}} grievously underpowered. Friction-drive ceiling fans employ a low-torque motor that is mounted transversely in relation to the flywheel. A <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted {{on the end of the}} motor's shaft drove a hub (via contact friction, hence the name) which, in turn, drove the flywheel. It was a system based on the fact that a low-torque motor spinning quickly can drive a large, heavy device at a slow speed without great energy consumption (see Gear ratio).|$|E
5000|$|A {{program could}} be saved to mylar-based magnetically coated cards (71 mm &times; 9.5 mm), which were fed through the reader by a small {{electric}} motor through a worm gear and rubber roller at a speed of 6 cm/s. [...] The recording area used {{only half of the}} width of the card. While reversing the card to store a second program was possible, it was officially discouraged (unlike in later models such as the HP-67) because {{the other half of the}} card was touched by the <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> during transport, causing extra abrasion. When inserted into an extra slot between the display and the keyboard, the printing on top of the card would correspond to the top row of keys (A - E), which served as shortcuts to the corresponding program entry points.|$|E
50|$|Pinch wheel or {{pinch roller}} {{was the name}} used for the plastic or <b>rubber</b> <b>wheels</b> in an 8-track cartridge, used to guide and align the {{magnetic}} tape. Rubber rollers were known to degrade over time, creating a maintenance issue.|$|R
30|$|Vehicles {{are walking}} with air springs, <b>rubber</b> <b>wheels,</b> and {{electric}} drive, {{resulting in low}} noise, comfortable ride, and less environmental pollution. Generally, its noise is over 10  db lower than metro, {{so it is a}} better choice for urban traffic.|$|R
40|$|In {{case that}} a heavy vehicle gets in {{metallic}} {{contact with a}} medium voltage distribution line it happens a thermal breakdown of the <b>rubber</b> <b>wheels,</b> with the consequence the power supply not to be interrupted during the scheduled three cycles of ""interruption-reclosing"" of the protection equipment, but to be required much longer time for the definite interruption. Danger of electric shock is then emerging, due to the step voltage developed near the vehicle. In case of a low voltage line, breakdown of the <b>rubber</b> <b>wheels</b> does not occur but there is the danger of ignition in warm points and to the fuels. In any case the driver must jump away from the vehicle without touching it...|$|R

50|$|Variable {{speed was}} {{obtained}} using a rotating metal disc driving a <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> resting against it. The {{position of the}} wheel could be moved in and out along a radius of the disc, so that the wheel turned at different speeds (faster the further out). Operating errors would occur from adjusting the wheel, as the wheel tended to slide as it was dragged {{across the face of}} the spinning disc as it was adjusted. The workaround adopted was to adjust the rate quickly and in a discrete manner, accepting that the generated ranges would deviate moderately from the desired continuous hyperbolic curves that predominated in use. In 1909, alterations were made to the clockwork drive to improve reliability of the governed speed and to increase the power of the drive.|$|E
50|$|Teacups is an {{amusement}} ride characterized by cup-style spinning vehicles atop a turntable-like floor. Typically, {{each set of}} six teacups has a center bearing mounted underneath, similar to a car wheel bearing mounted on a circular floor capable of turning 360°. The circular floor of the cup sits on a larger turntable-like floor. This is driven by a motor through a starting device; the ride when started begins to spin slowly and build up speed as the operator applies more power. When in operation, the ride operator spins each cup while the turntable spins the entire ride base. They are driven by a motor fixed to the base in either the middle or the outside, the motor fixed in the middle has a gearbox which changes direction, as well as gives the correct ratio to the desired speed. The motor fixed on the outside again has a gearbox, but {{is attached to a}} small <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> which sits along the rim under the platform. Either way, the end result is achieved and under modern health and safety guidelines, children's rides should not spin faster than eight times per minute...|$|E

5000|$|During the {{industrial}} age, iron strakes {{were replaced by}} a solid iron tyre custom made by a blacksmith, who first measured each wheel to ensure proper fit. Iron tyres that were always made smaller than the wheel in circumference, expanded by heating in a fire then placed on the wooden wheel and quenched quickly with water to shrink it onto the wood, then fastened to the wooden wheel by nails or tyre bolts. Tyre-bolts were less likely than tyre-nails to break off because they were flush finished and countersunk into the wheel's outer surface also allowing for wear without wearing the bolt head away. During {{the second half of}} the 19th century, the use of pre-manufactured iron hubs and other factory-made wood, iron and <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> parts became increasingly common. Companies such as Henry Ford developed manufacturing processes that soon made the village wheelwright obsolete. With the onset of two world wars, the trade soon went into decline and was very rare by the 1960s and almost extinct by the year 2000. However, owing to the efforts of organisations like the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights, wheelwrights still continue to operate in the UK.|$|E
40|$|The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} two powder metallurgical (PM) tool steels, {{high and low}} nitrogen containing, are investigated by means of three different wear tests: ball-on-disc, <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> and scratch test. The ball-on-disc tests showed two distinct friction curves corresponding to each material. In order to simulate the tribosystem existing in metal powder compaction dies, the <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> and the scratch test were modified. The <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> test was performed using ferrous powder instead of sand, and scratch testing {{was carried out by}} sliding a powder compact over the tool steels. The scratch tests indicated a higher steady-state coefficient of friction for the low nitrogen containing PM steel as compared with the high nitrogen containing alloy. Additionally, the results from the <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> tests were in agreement with industrial experiences, showing the low nitrogen containing tool steel to suffer from severe galling.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the front}} wheel of the Leveraged Freedom Chair (LFC) an all-terrain, off-road wheelchair with two distinct models: one for the developing world and one specifically for American riders. The functional requirements of performance and price, were designated by the start-up company Global Research Innovation and Technology (GRIT), which makes the LFC. This study includes comparisons between the original <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is currently being used as {{the front wheel}} of the LFC, and alternative wheels available for purchase. The goal {{was to find a}} new wheel which could be implemented for future manufacturing to increase the lifespan of the LFC, improve the ride quality and efficiency of production. Based on performance it is concluded that a pneumatic wheel of comparable geometry to the original <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> is the best alternative for the American chair where maintenance is more routine and replacement parts and service are readily available. For the developing world future work is necessary to either improve the quality of the original <b>rubber</b> <b>wheel</b> or select a low cost, low maintenance alternative. by Sara Elizabeth Falcone.
