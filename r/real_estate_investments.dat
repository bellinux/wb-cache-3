During his lifetime, {{he was unable}} to secure the construction of railroads to his <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investments</b> in and around Superior, Wisconsin. As president of the newly formed Elizabethtown, Lexington, and Big Sandy Railroad company, he secured financial backing from Collis Potter Huntington for a railroad connecting Elizabethtown and Lexington to the Big Sandy River as part of a route linking those cities with the Atlantic Ocean. When Huntington invested in June 1871, he became president of the company, and Breckinridge became vice-president. A line from Lexington to Mount Sterling was all that could be completed before the Panic of 1873 dried up the needed investment capital. The proposed line was finally completed in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to offset losses from <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investments.</b>|$|E

30|$|<b>Real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> is an {{economic}} behavior that inputs resources and money to estate development, management and intermediary services {{in order to obtain}} the maximum profits. Since there is a high rate of return on <b>investment</b> in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> industry, the corresponding market grows rapidly (Hoag, 1980). However, the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> pattern is very different from other investment patterns because of its fixed location, long period, and great value. Besides, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> is more easily affected by economic policy, social needs, market capacity, laws and regulations, etc. Moreover, the risk of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> mainly originates from two aspects (Zietz et al., 2003): (1) the uncertainty of the developers and (2) the influence of the outside environment. <b>Real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> environment is the sum of external factors restricting and affecting <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment,</b> and people are struggling to make a satisfactory decision in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> environment, especially in the investment to buy their house. Therefore, {{there is no doubt that}} a good investment environment is critical to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investors in order to obtain better profits and lower risk.|$|R

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investments</b> as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E
