5|$|Gardiner {{was born}} in Edinburgh, Scotland to John and Janet Gardiner. The fourth of five children, there was also Gardiner's two older brothers, John and Alexander, an older sister, Edith, and a younger sister, Christina. In 1911, when Gardiner was seven, he {{and the rest of}} his family emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba. The family {{initially}} lived in a house on William Avenue before relocating to Alexander Street; both streets were south of the railways, and were full of Scottish-Irish working-class families. John took a job as a rail car <b>repairer,</b> and Gardiner took an early interest in the trains, often waiting up late at night to watch them arrive into the city. He was enrolled at the Albert School, and befriended Wilf Cude, who had immigrated from Wales who would also go on to be a National Hockey League (NHL) goaltender.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Mellotrons {{were intended}} {{to be used in}} the home or in clubs, and were not designed for touring bands. Even the later M400, which was designed to be as portable as possible, weighed over [...] Smoke, variations in temperature, and humidity were also detrimental to the instrument's reliability. Moving the instrument between cold storage rooms and brightly lit stages could cause the tapes to stretch and stick on the capstan. Leslie Bradley recalls receiving some Mellotrons in for a repair [...] "looking like a blacksmith had shaped horseshoes on top". Pressing too many keys at once caused the motor to drag, resulting in the notes sounding flat. Robert Fripp stated that [...] "Tuning a Mellotron doesn't". Dave Kean, an expert Mellotron <b>repairer,</b> recommends that older Mellotrons should not be immediately used after a period of inactivity, as the tape heads can become magnetised in storage and destroy the recordings on them if played.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} patients undergoing multiple groin hernia <b>repairs</b> and to identify strategies that prevent further recurrence. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: Although relatively infrequent, recurrent groin hernias where several <b>repairs</b> have previously been undertaken constitutes {{a major problem in}} hernia surgery. Low numbers and heterogeneity have made it difficult to perform large prospective studies on this group. METHODS:: The study was designed as an observational population-based register study. All <b>repairs</b> for recurrent hernia recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register (SHR) 1992 - 2006 were identified. Risk for reoperation by number of previous <b>repairs,</b> with adjustment for gender and age, and risk for reoperation by unit responsible for previous <b>repair</b> were determined using Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS:: There were 12, 104 cases of hernia <b>repaired</b> once, 2 <b>repairs</b> in 4199 cases, 3 <b>repairs</b> in 310 cases, 4 <b>repairs</b> in 32 cases, and 5 <b>repairs</b> in 3 cases. The risk for further reoperation increased with the number of previous <b>repairs</b> (P < 0. 001). The hazard ratios for reoperation following open preperitoneal mesh <b>repair</b> and laparoscopic <b>repair</b> decreased; whereas, the hazard ratio for sutured <b>repair</b> increased with the number of previous <b>repairs.</b> The difference between Lichtenstein <b>repair</b> and laparoscopic <b>repair</b> was significant for the first 2 <b>repairs</b> (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION:: Laparoscopic preperitoneal <b>repair</b> provides the best surgical outcome in repeated groin hernia recurrence...|$|R

2500|$|Heffer {{was born}} in Hertford into a working-class family. His {{grandfather}} was a bricklayer and later a railway signalman, and {{his father was a}} boot-maker and <b>repairer,</b> although he owned his own business. In later life Heffer proudly declared [...] "I am therefore completely proletarian in background". Heffer's family were members of the High church tendency of the Church of England, and Heffer himself was a choirboy in the local church: it was there that Heffer led his first strike at the age of 8, and, he said, first experienced victimisation by his employer. Despite growing up in the 1930s, his family did not experience much of the economic privations common {{in other parts of the}} country. Typically for a working-class boy he attended school at Longmore Senior School, Hertford, only until the age of 14.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the second day, 10 December 1878, leaving Byrne in charge of the hostages, the other three started out to work. First they cut the telegraph wires, chopping the posts down to make sure, and were careful to destroy more wire than an ordinary <b>repairer</b> would carry with him. Three or four railway men endeavoured to interfere, but they too joined the other hostages in Younghusband's storeroom. Carrying a cheque drawn by McCauley on the National Bank for a few pounds, the three bushrangers, all heavily armed, went to the bank. (Kenneally relates that Hart who approached from the back ran into the bank's housemaid, Maggie Shaw, with whom he had been at school in Wangaratta.) In the meantime Byrne had unlawfully kidnapped a telegraph-line <b>repairer,</b> who had begun to make trouble. The others reached the bank after closing time, travelling in the hawker's cart. Kelly knocked at the door and forced the clerk to open and cash the cheque he had. They held up the unwise clerk and his manager, a Mr Scott. The robbers took £700 in notes, gold, and silver. Ned Kelly insisted to the manager that there was more money there, and eventually forced him to open the safe, from which the outlaws got £1,500 in paper, £300 in gold, about £300 worth of gold dust and nearly £100 worth of silver. The reported total amount stolen was 68 £10 notes, 67 £5 notes, 418 £1 notes, £500 in sovereigns, about £90 in silver; and a 30oz ingot of gold. The outlaws were polite and considerate to Scott's wife. Scott himself invited the outlaws to drink whisky with him, which they did. The whole party went to Younghusband's where the rest of the hostages were. The evening seems to have passed quite pleasantly. McCauley remarked to Kelly that the police might come along, which would mean a fight. Kelly replied, [...] "I wish they would, for there is plenty of cover here." [...] In the evening, tea was prepared, and at half-past 8, the outlaws warned the hostages not to move for three hours, informing them that they were going. Just before they left, Kelly noticed that a Mr. McDougall was wearing a watch, and asked for it. McDougall replied that it was a gift from his dead mother. Kelly declared that he wouldn't take it under any consideration, and very soon afterwards the four of the outlaws left. What is unusual is that these stirring events happened without the people in the town knowing of anything. The hostages left the station after five hours.|$|E

In the laboratory beams were <b>repaired</b> using hand-applied <b>repairs.</b> <b>Repairs</b> to beams in two highway, bridges were carried out using both hand-applied and flowing <b>repairs.</b> The <b>repair</b> materials used were commercial products of wide-ranging properties (shrinkage, creep and elastic modulus). Both low stiffness <b>repair</b> materials of elastic modulus, E-rm, less than the substrate E-sub, and high stiffness <b>repair</b> materials (E-rm > E-sub) were used. The <b>repairs</b> were applied in the tensile zone of the beams.

The results show that high structural efficiency is achieved with <b>repairs</b> having E-rm > E-sub, other properties (shrinkage and creep) being within reasonable limits. Such <b>repairs</b> ave less plane to restrained shrinkage cracking and show a capacity for load redistribution into the <b>repair</b> patch. Low stiffness <b>repairs</b> (E-rm < E-sub), on the other hand, are prone to restrained shrinkage cracking and are ineffective in load-sharing with the substrate. <b>Repairs</b> to propped flexural members developed erratic and non-uniform load distribution in the different phases upon reapplication of load.
