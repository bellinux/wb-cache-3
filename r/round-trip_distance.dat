40|$|A {{traditional}} ultrafast fibre laser has {{a constant}} cavity length that {{is independent of}} the pulse wavelength. The investigation of distributed ultrafast (DUF) lasers is conceptually and technically challenging and of great interest because the laser cavity length and fundamental cavity frequency are changeable based on the wavelength. Here, we propose and demonstrate a DUF fibre laser based on a linearly chirped fibre Bragg grating, where the total cavity length is linearly changeable {{as a function of}} the pulse wavelength. The spectral sidebands in DUF lasers are enhanced greatly, including the continuous-wave (CW) and pulse components. We observe that all sidebands of the pulse experience the same round-trip time although they have different <b>round-trip</b> <b>distances</b> and refractive indices. The pulse-shaping of the DUF laser is dominated by the dissipative processes in addition to the phase modulations, which makes our ultrafast laser simple and stable. This laser provides a simple, stable, low-cost, ultrafast-pulsed source with controllable and changeable cavity frequency. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The classic definition, proposed by Bavelas (1950), Beauchamp (1965), and Sabidussi (1966), is (the inverse of) the average distance to all other nodes. We propose the first highly scalable (near linear-time processing and linear space overhead) algorithm for estimating, within a small relative error, the classic closeness centralities of all nodes in the graph. Our algorithm applies to undirected graphs, as well as for centrality computed with respect to <b>round-trip</b> <b>distances</b> in directed graphs. For directed graphs, we also propose an efficient algorithm that approximates generalizations of classic closeness centrality to outbound and inbound centralities. Although it does not provide worst-case theoretical approximation guarantees, it is designed to perform well on real networks.

Cumulative elevation gain, along with <b>round-trip</b> <b>distance,</b> is arguably the most important value used in quantifying the strenuousness of a trip. This is because hiking 10 mi on flat land (zero elevation gain) is significantly easier than hiking up a large mountain with a <b>round-trip</b> <b>distance</b> of 10 mi.

40|$|Gray gulls Larus modestus {{are unique}} among birds of {{northern}} Chile {{as the only}} species nesting in the interior Atacama Desert, and the only seagull nesting far (30 - 100 km) from surface water. During breeding-nesting (August - February) gray gulls congregate {{on the coast of}} northern Chile where they feed and initiate courtship. As early as August, breeding pairs commute daily to the inner desert to establish nesting territories, <b>round-trip</b> <b>distances</b> of 60 - 200 Km. During incubation (30 days) and brooding (7 days) adults alternate daily foraging flights to the coast. Afterwards, both adults forage daily for their chick(s) until fledging (ca. 60 days). Foraging flights and thermoregulatory costs during the period of maximal solar radiation, when ground temperatures may reach 61 C in the day and drop to 2 C at night, have selected for adaptations which minimize those costs: tolerance of hypothermia and hyperthermia; dark plumage; low egg-shell water vapor conductance; low standard metabolic rate; elaborate repertory of thermoregulatory behavior which allow adults to take advantage of microclimatic variations in the desert and minimize costs relative to a sympatric congenor, Larus belcheri scheduling foraging flights to take advantage of optimal atmospheric conditions and presence of forage fish (anchovies) close to the surface; scheduling migration to coincide with anchovy production and levels of interspecific competition; and reduced clutch size (≤ 2) relative to most seagulls. Periodic El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO), which reduce principal food items of gray gulls, have selected for 'bet hedging" tactic by which L. modestus either ceases reproduction or varies clutch size between one and two, as observed during and after the 1982 - 83 ENSO. During a typical reproductive season, breeding pairs allocate a minimum of 39 percent of their net metabolized energy (NME) to foraging flights.

40|$|Terahertz {{frequency}} quantum cascade lasers (THz QCLs) are compact, semiconductor {{sources of}} coherent THz radiation, and have numerous potential applications in chemical sensing and industrial inspection, {{as well as}} security and biomedical imaging. In this thesis, the development of QCLs as sources of THz radiation is explored, together with their application in self-mixing (SM) imaging systems. The effect of reducing the etch depth of the THz QCL active region was explored, and its influence on QCL performance evaluated. This was aimed of improving the thermal management in QCLs, as well as optimizing the structures for integration with electrical photonic components. The reliance of THz QCLs on slow and incoherent thermal detectors has limited their practical use in THz systems. This was addressed by using a THz QCL as both the radiation source and an interferometric detector. THz sensing and imaging through SM interferometry in a QCL was demonstrated, in which radiation is reflected from an object back into the QCL cavity, causing changes in the laser properties, depending on the amplitude and phase of the reflection. This allows simple, ‘detector-free’, sensing of displacement and reflectivity, with high-sensitivity owing to the coherent nature of the detection. The equivalence between SM-perturbations to the THz power and the laser voltage was shown. Owing to the high SM sensitivity, high-resolution stand-off imaging at <b>round-trip</b> <b>distances</b> of up to 21 m through air was demonstrated - the longest range interferometric sensing with a THz QCL to date. Coherent three-dimensional (3 D) terahertz imaging through SM in a THz QCL was also performed, in which the surface height was extracted from the phase of the SM signal. To achieve tunable single mode THz QCL emission, which is highly beneficial for imaging and sensing applications, surface acoustic waves (SAWs) propagation across the sloped etched facets of a QCL mesa was demonstrated. The work also investigated the effect on device performance of SAW propagation over the QCL active region. This demonstration could {{pave the way for}} monolithic integration of QCLs into terahertz circuits...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Small {{hospitals}} {{in rural areas}} usually have an insufficient caseload of frail old people to justify the regular presence of a geriatrician. This study examined the costs of providing a telegeriatric service by videoconference in a rural hospital, compared to the costs of a visiting geriatrician that travels to undertake in-person consultations. Methods A cost analysis was undertaken to compare {{the costs of the}} telegeriatric service model with the costs of a visiting geriatrician service model. A recently established telegeriatric service at Warwick Hospital was used as a case study. Results In the base case model (assuming four patients per round and a <b>round-trip</b> travel <b>distance</b> of 312 kilometres), an estimated AUD$ 131 per patient consultation can be saved in favour of the telegeriatric service model. Key drivers of costs are the number of patients per round and the travel distance and time in the visiting geriatrician model. At a workload of four patients per round, it is less expensive to conduct a telegeriatric service than a visiting geriatrician service when the round-trip travel time exceeds 76 minutes. Discussion Even under quite conservative assumptions, a telegeriatric service offers an economically feasible approach to the delivery of specialist geriatric assessment in rural and remote settings...|$|R

40|$|With recent {{advancement}} in underwater robotics and acoustic communications, {{the concept of}} mobile underwater acoustic networks (MUANs) has gradually become feasible. The advantage of MUANs lies in their mobility which allows them to adjust the topology easily and therefore adapt to environment changes. Many promising applications are made possible with this class of networks, for example, a network of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) {{can be used in}} fishery to herd fish or in the oil industry to monitor undersea pipelines. However, designing a mobile network in an uncertain environment, such as the ocean, is a challenging task. In this dissertation, we investigate three topics in in MUANs. The first piece of work presents a deployment framework for a typical scenario in Lagrangian oceanography measurement in which uses mobile sensors to collect data. The sensors are redeployed if drifted out of the area. Our proposed framework aims to provide guidance to network designers. For example, with the constructed models for coverage and connectivity, they are able to determine the number of nodes needed to guarantee coverage of 80 % or connectivity of at most 4 components with probability of 0. 5, for instance. The second piece of work proposes a MAC protocol, named PMAC, which has real applications in monitoring oil pipelines. The protocol is scheduling-based and is specifically designed for string networks to achieve high performance. Real sea test data shows that the protocol had much higher goodput than an RTS/CTS scheme tested in the same experiment, up to three times more efficient. On top of this, the end-to-end delay is also shorter. In this work, we also point out an important issue yet usually ignored by a majority of studies: the modem processing delay. With this delay, short packets can have adverse effects on network performance if they are not scheduled carefully. Additionally, we derive a closed form formula, considering real modems’ characteristics, for choosing the optimal packet size which can serve as the upper bound on the optimal packet size. The third piece of work is on a novel underwater navigation method designed for mobile vehicle. Our scheme has many potential applications, for example fish herding or undersea surveillance, because it does not require a vehicle to surface. In our approach, we deploy seamarks, which serve as landmarks at sea, to assist vehicles’ inertial navigation systems. Seamarks are lightweight undersea nodes whose main functionality is to help a vehicle measure <b>round-trip</b> <b>distances.</b> Based on this data, a vehicle executes our estimation algorithm to correct its velocity and position.

50|$|Consider {{two sets}} of observers, one set at rest in the preferred, {{stationary}} frame K, and the other set, in the frame k, moving with a uniform velocity V {{with respect to the}} preferred frame. Here, uppercase letters denote quantities evaluated in the preferred frame, and lowercase letters denote quantities evaluated in a moving frame. Each observer in each set is equipped with an identical clock and a means to receive, send, and record the arrival and departure times of light pulses. Clocks are defined operationally either by counting the number of wave crests associated with electromagnetic transitions between two atomic states (atomic clocks) or by observing the exponential time constant associated with the decay of an ensemble of unstable particles, such as muons. The Einstein approach will be used to set up coordinate systems. The origin of both the moving and preferred frames will be arbitrarily chosen within the constraint that the two origins must coincide at some point in time. Clocks at the origins will be set to zero at the moment the two origins coincide. Three orthogonal axes will be chosen as X, Y, and Z in the preferred frame and x, y, and z in the moving frame. Without loss of generality it can be assumed that the direction of relative motion is X (-x) and that the three axes coincide at T = 0. At some time well before T = 0 each distant clock will send a light pulse to the origin. The pulse will be reflected and the round-trip time noted. At T = 0 synchronization pulses will be sent out from the origin, and, upon arrival at each distant clock, each distant clock will be set to a time equal to one-half of the <b>round-trip</b> time. <b>Distances</b> between two observers will be set by multiplying c = C by half the time it takes for a light pulse to make a round-trip between the two observers. Since it is axiomatically assumed that the speed of light is C in the preferred frame (it is assumed that Maxwell’s equations are valid in the ether; see above), observers in the preferred frame will arrive at correct clock synchronizations and distance measurements using this procedure.|$|R

Our study shows that anthropogenic food resources can influence food habits, which can have cascading effects on movement patterns and hence habitat selection, ultimately resulting in the establishment of distinct behavioral types within a population.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a set of}} post-Newtonian reference frames for a comprehensive study of the orbital dynamics and rotational motion of Moon and Earth by means of lunar laser ranging (LLR) with the precision of one millimeter. We work {{in the framework of}} a scalar-tensor theory of gravity depending on two parameters, and, of the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism and utilize the concepts of the relativistic resolutions on reference frames adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2000. We assume that the solar system is isolated and space-time is asymptotically flat at infinity. The primary reference frame covers the entire space-time, has its origin at the solarsystem barycenter (SSB) and spatial axes stretching up to infinity. The SSB frame is not rotating with respect to a set of distant quasars that are assumed to be at rest on the sky forming the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). The secondary reference frame has its origin at the Earth-Moon barycenter (EMB). The EMB frame is locally-inertial with its spatial axes spreading out to the orbits of Venus and Mars, and is not rotating dynamically in the sense that equation of motion of a test particle moving with respect to the EMB frame, does not contain the Coriolis and centripetal forces. Two other local frames - the geocentric (GRF) and the selenocentric (SRF) frames - have their origins at the center of mass of Earth and Moon respectively and do not rotate dynamically. Each local frame is subject to the geodetic precession both with respect to other local frames and with respect to the ICRF because of the relative motion. The advantage of dynamically non-rotating local frames is in a more simple mathematical description. The set of the global and three local frames is introduced in order to fully decouple the relative motion of Moon with respect to Earth from the orbital motion of the Earth-Moon barycenter as well as to connect the coordinate description of the lunar motion, an observer on Earth, and a retro-reflector on Moon to directly measurable quantities such as the proper time and the <b>round-trip</b> laser-light <b>distance.</b> We solve the gravity field equations and find out the metric tensor and the scalar field in all frames, which description includes the post-Newtonian definition of the multipole moments of the gravitational field of Earth and Moon. We also derive the post-Newtonian coordinate transformations between the frames and analyze the residual gauge freedom imposed by the scalar-tensor theory on the metric tensor. The residual gauge freedom is used for removal spurious, coordinate-dependent post-Newtonian effects from the equations of motion of Earth and Moon. The work of Y.

40|$|Internet {{coordinate}} systems (e. g. [1,?]) {{have been proposed}} to allow for <b>distance</b> (<b>Round-Trip</b> Time, shortly RTT) estimation between nodes, {{in order to reduce}} the measurement overhead of many applications and overlay networks. Indeed, by embedding the Internet delay space into a metric space – an operation that only requires each node in the system to measure delays to a small set of other nodes (its neighbors), nodes are attributed coordinates that can then be used to estimate the RTT between any two nodes, without further measurements, simply by applying the distance function associated with the chosen metric space to the nodes’ coordinates. Recently, these coordinates-based systems have been shown to be accurate, with very low distance prediction error. However, most, if not all, of current proposals for {{coordinate systems}} assume that the nodes partaking in the system cooperate fully and honestly with each other – that is that the information reported by probed nodes is correct – this could also make them quite vulnerable to malicious attacks. In particular, insider attacks executed by (potentially colluding) legitimate users or nodes infiltrating the system could prove very effective. As the use of overlays and applications relying on coordinates increases, one could imagine the release of worms and other malware, exploiting such cooperation, which could seriously disrupt the operations of these systems and therefore the virtual networks and applications relying on them for distance measurements. In this talk, we first identify such attacks, and through a simulation study, we observed their impact on two recently proposed positioning systems [3], namely Vivaldi and NPS. We experimented with attack strategies, carried out by malicious nodes that provide biased coordinates information and delay measurement probes, and that aim to (i) introduce disorder in the system, (ii) fool honest nodes to move far away from their correct positions and (iii) isolate particular target nodes in the system through collusion. Our findings confirm the susceptibility of the coordinate systems to such attacks. Our major contribution is therefore a model for malicious behavior detection during coordinates embedding [4]. We first show that the dynamics of a node, in a coordinate system without abnormal or malicious behavior, can be modeled by a Linear State Space model and tracked by a Kalman filter. Then we show, that the obtained model can be generalized in the sense that the parameters of a filter calibrated at a node can be used effectively to model and predict the dynamic behavior at another node, as long as the two nodes are not too far apart in the network. This leads to the proposal of a Surveyor infrastructure: Surveyor nodes are trusted, honest nodes that use each other exclusively to position themselves in the coordinate space, and are therefore immune to malicious behavior in the system. During their own coordinate embedding, other nodes can then use the filter parameters of a nearby Surveyor as a representation of normal, clean system behavior to detect and filter out abnormal or malicious activity. A combination of simulations and PlanetLab experiments are used to demonstrate the validity, generality, and effectiveness of the proposed approach for both Vivaldi and NPS. Finally, we address the issue of asserting the accuracy of Internet coordinates advertised by nodes of Internet coordinate systems during distance estimations. Indeed, some nodes may even lie deliberately about their coordinates to mount various attacks against applications and overlays. Our proposed method consists in two steps: 1) establish the correctness of a node’s claimed coordinate by using the Surveyor infrastructure and malicious embedding neighbor detection; and 2) issue a time limited validity certificate for each verified coordinate. Validity periods are computed based on an analysis of coordinate inter-shift times observed by Surveyors. By doing this, each surveyor can estimate the time until the next shift and thus, can limit the validity of the certificate it issues to regular nodes for their calculated coordinates. Our method is illustrated using a trace collected from a Vivaldi system deployed on PlanetLab, where inter-shift times are shown to follow long-tail distribution (log-normal distribution in most cases, or Weibull distribution otherwise). We show the effectiveness of our method by measuring the impact of a variety of attacks, experimented on PlanetLab, on distance estimates...|$|R
