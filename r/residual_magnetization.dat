50|$|Pull-through AC demagnetizing coils: seen in {{the figure}} to the right are AC powered devices that {{generate}} a high magnetic field where the part is slowly pulled through by hand or on a conveyor. The act of pulling the part through {{and away from the}} coil's magnetic field slows drops the magnetic field in the part.

50|$|When {{the current}} in the coil is turned off, in the magnetically soft {{materials}} that are nearly always used as cores, most of the domains lose alignment and return to a random state and the field disappears. However some of the alignment persists, because the domains have difficulty turning their direction of magnetization, leaving the core a weak permanent magnet. This phenomenon is called hysteresis and the remaining magnetic field is called remanent magnetism. The <b>residual</b> <b>magnetization</b> of the core can be removed by degaussing. In alternating current electromagnets, such as are used in motors, the core's magnetisation is constantly reversed, and the remanence contributes to the motor's losses.|$|E

50|$|The generic FLASH {{technique}} {{emerges as}} a gradient echo sequence which combines a low-flip angle radio-frequency excitation of the NMR signal (recorded as a spatially encoded gradient echo) with a rapid repetition of the basic sequence. The repetition time is usually much shorter than the typical T1 relaxation time of the protons in biologic tissue. Only the combination of (i) a low-flip angle excitation which leaves unused longitudinal magnetization for an immediate next excitation with (ii) the acquisition of a gradient echo which does not need a further radio-frequency pulse that would affect the <b>residual</b> longitudinal <b>magnetization,</b> allows for the rapid repetition of the basic sequence interval and the resulting speed of the entire image acquisition. In fact, the FLASH sequence eliminated all waiting periods previously included to accommodate effects from T1 saturation.

The tip angles of the read pulses are adjusted to given equal tip-angle weighting for each image.

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Proton {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (MRS) enables the detection of several metabolites within the human body. The concentration of water is av thousand times {{higher than those of}} the metabolites. As a consequence, it introduces baseline distortions, eddy current and gradient modulation artifacts in the final spectrum [1 – 2]. Several techniques have been developed trying to suppress the water peak using special water suppression (WS) methods [3 – 4] etc. At low magnetic fields (i. e. T) the performance of the aforementioned WS techniques can be quite good. However, at higher magnetic fields this is a difficult task due to B 1 + inhomogeneity. A solution to this problem is the development of VAPOR [5]. This method enables very good WS against B 1 + ingomogeneity at the expense of time (* 700 ms). This duration can prolong significantly the examination time, especially in case of time consuming sequences (e. g. multi slice MRSI). For this reason, the aim of this study was the development of a short duration water suppression using optimised flip angles (SODA) at 9. 4 T. Subjects and Methods: An algorithm was developed trying to minimize the <b>residual</b> longitudinal <b>magnetization</b> for different number of CHESS [4] pulses, T 1 relaxation times, B 1 + inhomogeneity and time delays (Fig. 1). After the determination of the desired flip angles and time delays, an algorithm was written in order to find the best combination of gradient amplitudes for the suppression of the unwanted coherence pathways (Fig. 2; after n pulses, 3 n coherence pathways are produced). Afterwards, the final WS sequence was incorporated with a STEAM technique and tested on a phantom and a healthy volunteer. All the experiments were carried out using a 4 channel transceiver array coil connected to a whole body 9. 4 Tesla SIEMENS scanner. Results: The phantom results demonstrated a suppression of 99. 7 of the initial water peak (suppression factor = 449; Fig. 3). In addition, in vivo results showed that SODA scheme allows sufficient WS giving a suppression factor[1300. Discussion/Conclusion: In this study we demonstrated a short duration WS scheme using optimized flip angles (SODA) and gradients showing preliminary results of this study.
