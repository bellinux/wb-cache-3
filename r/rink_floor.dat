500|$|Buono chose {{black and}} red for the rink's new color palette. Red was used for its {{intensity}} and energy, and black was utilized because the rink would appear larger. Additionally, usage of black would contrast more boldly with the red colors. The ceiling above the rink was removed for lighting purposes. The <b>rink</b> <b>floor</b> was also refinished with darker colors to provide better light reflection. Rigging for the lights became an artistic challenge for Buono. Working with the art department, the rigging electrics and the rigging grips, he designed a wagon wheel effect that moved with {{the motion of the}} skating and allowed the lights to be programmed, aesthetically lighting both ends of the rink and capturing the action of the skating sequences. The skate rental section, arcade and snack bar were redesigned at the rink as well, so that the areas besides the skating floor wouldn't feel monotonous. “We did every inch of that rink,” said Buono. “The carpet on the walls, painting the ceiling, putting in the lights, painting the snack bar, changing the color of the tables.

The Knickerbocker Hotel was directly behind the building, but ABC could not purchase the hotel property from the Methodist Church, which had converted the hotel into a residential retirement facility. Moving the show to a Culver City sound stage was considered, but scuttled because of the expense.

40|$|Currently 341 ice rinks are in {{operation}} in Sweden {{with an estimated}} total energy consumption of 384 GWh/year. As it has been revealed in previous studies, most of the ice arenas are constructed and/or not operated efficiently. Thus it is considerable energy saving potential, which could be achieved in this area. The potential is even more significant if one can consider the savings in the ice rinks all over the world. This report is an in-depth study, which aims at analysing the Swedish ice rinks energy consumption and estimation of the corresponding energy saving potential. The report analyses the energy statistics obtained through the Stoppsladd study, which includes the ice rinks inventory, data collection and compilation of energy relevant data for 100 ice rinks located in Sweden. The inventory has revealed {{a number of important}} statistical figures, such as total energy consumption average in total (estimated to be 1, 137 MWh/year) and for different ice arenas categories in particular. Relevant specific energy consumption values {{as well as a number}} of other important figures are also provided in the paper, thus giving an idea on the way to minimise energy consumption at each specific ice rink. The results are additionally supported by statistical multifactor regression analysis, which resulted in a relation between the ice rink’s total energy consumption and some known factors values affecting it. Two in-depth studies fulfil the Stoppsladd project by analysing water quality and ice quality effect on the ice rink’s energy consumption and investigation of the static and dynamic heat flow distribution in ice rink slab. A static heat flow distribution model of an ice rink evaluated the effect of concrete  with different properties on temperature and heat flow distribution within an ice <b>rink</b> <b>floor</b> slab. The study proves that the ice rink refrigeration system COP 2 could be increased with 3. 5 % just implementing new high thermal conductivity concrete layer into the conventional concrete ice <b>rink</b> <b>floor.</b> The static analysis results were further completed with dynamic analysis, which adequately reflects the thermodynamic response of the concrete ice <b>rink</b> <b>floor</b> to a varying heat load. As a result, the thesis represents a holistic approach to the ice rink energy efficiency increase problem and provides a good basis for further studies in relevant areas. It is proved that modified concrete allowing higher (efficient) secondary refrigerant tempera­tures and also provides better response to change in heat load to the system. Stoppsla...|$|E
40|$|Tese de mestrado integrado em Engenharia da Energia e do Ambiente, apresentada à Universidade de Lisboa, através da Faculdade de Ciências, 2013 In Sweden, ice rinks {{are one of}} {{the largest}} energy {{consumers}} in the public building sector, requiring, each ice rink, about 1000 MWh/year, from which approximately 43 % is used by the refrigeration system. The first challenge in the work was to find the cooling capacity of the refrigeration system for two ice rinks, Älta and Järfälla, considering that the cooling capacity is approximately the sum of the total heat load on the ice and the losses in the distribution system. This estimative was achieved using data from a Performance Analyser called ClimaCheck. Furthermore, aiming at decreasing the ice rink high energy consumption, two approaches are studied: i) evaluating the heat transfer of the slab and ii) its thermal inertia. To do so new designs of ice rink slabs have been proposed and modelled to conclude which benefits can therefore be achieved. A practical case shows that replacing the standart type of concrete with one more conductive will enable energy savings around 9400 kWh/year. Although sometimes the results from the models only make sense if there is a previous known background from the studied ice rinks, like the type of concrete used in the slab, the obtained results show good evidence that the models can successfully be used to evaluate both heat conduction and thermal inertia of an ice <b>rink</b> <b>floor.</b> Further developments in the area, such as a creation of a dynamic model instead of the used static one, will contribute to the achievement of more accurate results regarding the energy saving potential, fact that would provide useful information when retrofitting or building a new ice slab...|$|E
40|$|Sweden has 350 ice rinks in {{operation}} which annually use approximately 1000 MWh each. Therefrigeration system usually {{accounts for about}} 43 % of the total energy consumption which is the largestshare of the major energy systems. Besides improving the facilities one-by-one, it is important todistinguish common features that will indicate the potential energy saving possibilities for all ice rinks. More than 97 % of the Swedish ice rinks use indirect refrigeration systems with a secondary fluid. Moreover, the thermo-physical properties of secondary fluids directly impact the heat transfer andpressure drop. Thus, assessing and quantifying their influence on the refrigeration system performance isimportant while estimating the energy saving potential for the ice rinks. A theoretical model {{as well as two}} case studies focusing on the importance of the secondary fluid choiceare investigated. The theoretical model calculations are performed assuming the steady-state conditionsand considering a fixed ice rink design independently on the secondary fluid type. Hence, they can becompared on the same basis. According to this theoretical model, the refrigeration efficiency rankingstarting from the best to the worst for secondary fluid is: ammonia; potassium formate; calcium chloride;potassium acetate; ethylene glycol; ethyl alcohol; and propylene glycol. Secondary fluids can be ranked inexactly the same order starting from the lowest to the highest value in terms of the dynamic viscosity. Itwas shown that potassium formate has the best heat transfer properties while ammonia leads to the lowestpressure drops and pumping power. Propylene glycol shows the worst features in both cases. Ammoniaand potassium formate show respectively 5 % and 3 % higher COP than calcium chloride for typical heatloads of 150 kW. When controlling the pump over a temperature difference ΔT, the existence of theoptimum pump control or optimum flow was highlighted. For common heat loads of 150 kW thisoptimum pump control ΔT is around 2, 5 K for calcium chloride while it is around 2 K for ammonia. It isshown that the secondary fluids having laminar flow in the ice <b>rink</b> <b>floor</b> pipes have a larger share in theconvection heat transfer resistance (~ 20 - 25 %) than the secondary fluids experiencing turbulent flow (~ 3 %). One of the case studies shows a potential energy saving of 12 % for the refrigeration system whenincreasing the freezing point of the secondary fluid. An energy saving of 10, 8 MWh per year was foundfor each temperature degree increase in the secondary fluid freezing point. QC 20171213 </p...|$|E
