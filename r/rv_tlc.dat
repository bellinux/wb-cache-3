40|$|THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF NUTRITIONAL DEPLETION ON INDICES OF PULMONARY FUNCTION. THIRTY STABLE MALNOURISHED PATIENTS WITH EMPHYSEMA WERE STUDIED. WE MEASURED: BODY WEIGHT, HEIGHT, TSF, MAMC, PIMAX, PEMAX, FEV, FVC, <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC,</b> DLCO. ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED A SPECIAL DIET OF 1250 KCAL GREATER THAN THEIR ENERGY REQUIREMENTS, CONTAINING 18 % PROTEINS, 50 % CARBOHYDRATE AND 32 % FAT. MEASUREMENTS WERE REPEATED AFTER ONE MONTH. ALL PATIENTS INCREASED THE MEAN VALUES OF THEIR BODY WEIGHT, TSF, MAMC AND THE PERCENT OF IDEAL BODY WEIGHT (P < 0. 001). THEY ALSO INCREASED THEIR PIMAX AND PEMAX (P < 0. 001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FEV 1, FVC AND DLCO (P < 0. 001). WE CONCLUDE THAT HYPERALIMENTATION IMPROVES THE NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND LUNG FUNCTION IN MALNOURISHED EMPHYSEMATIC PATIENTS.

40|$|Running title: CT worsens {{faster than}} lung {{function}} {{in children and}} adults with CF What this paper adds: Peripheral bronchiectasis CT-score in adults and composite CT-score in children with CF worsen faster than PFTs. A marked discrepancy between changes in CT-score and PFTs was seen, with CT-scores worsening more frequently than PFTs in children and adults. Peripheral bronchiectasis CT-scoring may be helpful in the clinical monitoring of CF-patients. Background: In a single centre study structural lung abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) scans worsened in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who had on average stable pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The aims {{of this study were}} to compare the ability of CT-scores and PFTs to detect changes in CF lung disease in children and adults. Methods: CT scans and PFTs were retrospectively studied in a cohort of CF-patients aged 5 to 52 years for whom 2 or 3 CT scans at 3 -year intervals were available in combination with PFTs (FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, MEF 25, MEF 50, <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC</b> and RV/TLC).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lung volume {{reduction}} surgery (LVRS) {{has been}} a frequent literature topic in emphysema management recently. Opinions differ in regard to usefulness, efficacy, and selection criteria. AIMS: To present {{the results of our}} first 55 bilateral videoscopically resected group, with follow-up of up to three years, and to present some of the local methodology problems faced. METHODS: Thirty-nine men and 16 women, age range 40 - 77, had either upper lobe (42), mixed (two), or lower lobe (11) resections without buttressing (except for unilateral buttressing in several of the latter patients as part of an intrapatient comparison trial) according to their pattern of emphysema determined by CT and perfusion scanning. RESULTS: Thirty day mortality was 5. 5 %. Follow-up pulmonary function is available for 44 patients, and demonstrates a mean 51 % improvement in FEV 1, and significant improvement in FVC, PaO 2, dyspnoea indices and walking distance, with a reduction in mean <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC,</b> PaCO 2. FEV 1 improvement is maintained above baseline at three years. Lower lobe surgery outcomes are at least as good as their upper lobe counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes confirm improvements reported elsewhere, and suggest that videoscopic resection may provide worthwhile benefit to lower lobe patterns of emphysema.

40|$|The lung {{function}} of 21 patients with leukaemia (11 with acute myeloid leukaemia, six with acute lymphatic leukaemia, four with chronic myeloid leukaemia) and of five with severe aplastic anaemia was tested {{before and after}} allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Vital capacity (VC) was lowered in patients with leukaemia before transplantation. VC and FEV 1 fell significantly after transplantation. Residual volume (RV) and RV {{as a percentage of}} total lung capacity (<b>RV</b> % <b>TLC)</b> were already increased and rose significantly after transplantation. Patients with severe aplastic anaemia had noticeably increased RV and <b>RV</b> % <b>TLC,</b> values that did not change after transplantation. In contrast to the patients with aplastic anaemia, the patients with leukaemia had significantly reduced VC, <b>RV,</b> <b>RV</b> % <b>TLC,</b> and FEV 1 before and after transplantation. The specific airway resistance (sRaw) was raised significantly before and after transplantation in the leukaemic patients. In addition, transfer coefficient (Kco) fell significantly more after transplantation in the patients with leukaemia than in those with severe aplastic anaemia. In three patients with histologically established obstructive bronchiolitis in conjunction with chronic graft versus host disease after transplantation, VC, FEV 1 and FEV 1 % VC fell, while <b>RV,</b> <b>RV</b> % <b>TLC,</b> and sRaw rose; Kco was far below normal. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that in patients with leukaemia obstructive disorders of ventilation develop or, if they are already present, worsen. In patients with severe aplastic anaemia {{lung function}} was not impaired in the early phase after transplantation. These differences are probably due to the more intensive immunosuppressive and cytotoxic preparatory regimen before transplantation in the leukaemic patients. Obstructive bronchiolitis, a complication of graft versus host disease, first manifests itself in a typical rise in specific airway resistance and must be treated early...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} reported experiences by Doddoli [1], Novoa [2], Martin [3] and Voltolini [4], add useful informations on post-operative morbi-mortality when patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are operated after induction treatment (IT). Even if {{the variability of}} reported ITs is a limiting factor to draw valuable conclusions the general idea is that an higher morbidity rate is expected when radiotherapy {{is included in the}} IT and when a pneumonectomy is performed at the time of operation. The importance of the impact of these two variables post-operatively has, however, never been confirmed with functional evidences. In fact, a comprehensive pulmonary function evaluation in an IT series remains hitherto unreported. We reviewed the records of 22 stage IIIa patients, operated after IT with concurrent radiochemotherapy as described elsewhere [5] between June 1992 and May 1994 (group 1). We selected (1 : 3 ratio) 61 control cases among the NSCLC patients operated in the same period without a prior IT (group 2). Patients whose functional data (FVC, FEV 1, TLC, <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC,</b> KCO, PaO 2, PaCO 2 and PA-aO 2) were not complete as measured before IT, prior and after (1 month) surgery, were priorily excluded. Functional differences pre and post-operatively have been analysed (Student's t-test). Differences before and after surgery in group 1 and 2 were compared using analysis of variance (χ 2 -test to compare type of surgery and staging). A multiple regression analysis was performed using the parameters measured post-operatively as dependent variables and age, sex, height, entity of resection (pneumonectomy as a risk factor), IT and baseline functionality as independent variables. No differences were detected among the two groups pre-operatively. Thirty days after surgery, regardless of the entity of resection, a significant functional reduction was observed in the group 1 versus group 2 (FVC=− 1. 42 vs. − 0. 958 l; FEV 1 =− 0. 91 vs. − 0. 64 l; TLC=− 2. 45 vs. − 1. 64 l; PaO 2 =− 2. 87 vs. + 3. 86 mmHg; PA-aO 2 =+ 5. 05 vs. − 3. 99 mmHg). In patients who underwent pneumonectomy, changes in lung volumes showed an overlap among the two groups. In patients who underwent lesser resections, function of the group 2 was better either in volumes, either in gas exchanges. Multiple regression (changes in post-operative function), after normalising data for age, entity of resection and pre-operative IT, showed a significant drop in pulmonary volumes and a worsening of intrapulmonary gas exchanges in group 1 patients (Table 1). We reviewed the records of 22 stage IIIa patients, operated after IT with concurrent radiochemotherapy as described elsewhere [5] between June 1992 and May 1994 (group 1).

40|$|Background: In {{the context}} of hematopoietic stem cell {{transplantation}} (HSCT), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) {{have been used to}} promote engraftment and prevent graft- versus-host-disease. However, in animal models, MSC were shown to cause pulmonary alterations after systemic administration. The impact of MSC infusion on lung function has not been studied in humans. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate the impact of MSC co-infusion on lung function and airway inflammation as well as on the incidence of pulmonary infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation after HSCT. Methods: We have prospectively followed 30 patients who underwent unrelated HSCT with MSC co-infusion after non-myeloablative conditioning (NMA). Each patient underwent detailed lung function testing (FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC,</b> DLCO and KCO) and measurement of exhaled nitric oxide before HSCT and 3, 6 and 12 months posttransplant. The incidence of pulmonary infections and CMV reactivation were also monitored. This group was compared with another group of 28 patients who underwent the same type of transplantation but without MSC co-infusion. Results: Lung function tests did not show important modifications over time and did not differ between the MSC and control groups. There was a higher 1 -year incidence of infection, particularly of fungal infections, in patients having received a MSC co-infusion. There was no difference between groups regarding the 1 -year incidence of CMV reactivation. Conclusions: MSC co-infusion does not induce pulmonary deterioration 1 year after HSCT with NMA conditioning. MSC appear to be safe for the lung but close monitoring of pulmonary infections remains essential. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} hydrostatic weighing (HW) at {{residual volume}} (RV), {{total lung capacity}} (TLC) -dry and TLC-wet in the determination of body density (00) and percent body fat (%BF). Considering {{the comfort of the}} submerged Ss, it was the dim of this study to establish a HW method which was reliable. Student volunteers included 44 competitive swimmers (25 females; 19 males) and 55 noncompetitive swimmers (31 females; 24 males) ages 17 - 34. Residual volume was determined by the open circuit nitrogen washout technique. Dry and wet measurements of forced vital capacity (FVC) and TLC were obtained from all Ss to determine appropriate measurement in application to BD and %BF calculations. All Ss underwent HW at RV and TLC. Three BD and %BF were calculated for Ss by applying lung measurements of RV, TLC-dry and TLC-wet. Ss noted method preference; at <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC</b> or neither. A 3 way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by a Scheffe' Post Hoc Test was used to analyze the following variables: FVC-dry, FVC-wet, TLC-dry, TLC-wet, BD and %BF by HW at RV, TLC-dry and TLC-wet. A Chi Square analyzed Ss HW method preference. There was a sig (p at TLC-wet > at TLC-dry. A 1 1 subgroups and Ss combined preferred HW at TLC (p<. 05). The sig diff in HW methods may be due to an underestimation of RV during HW at RV and an overestimation of TLC during HW at TLC-dry. It was concluded that HW is not equivocal at/RV, TLC-dry and TLC-wet. HW at TLC-wet may be most accurate in %BF determination. Previous research supports the conclusion that pulmonary air trapping was reduced or eliminated and TLC was truly represented during HW at TLC-wet...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} five studies were {{conducted}} to {{examine the effect of}} exercise on selected pulmonary function measurements. Studies I and II determined the effect of an acute bout of exercise on various lung volumes immediately post-exercise and over a 24 -hour post-exercise period. There were significant mean increases of 210 ml (20. 6 %) and 260 ml (20. 8 %) in the 5 -minute post-exercise residual volume (RV) measurement for studies I and II, respectively. There also were significant mean increases of 170 ml (3. 4 %) and 190 ml (2. 7 %) in the 5 -minute post-exercise total lung capacity (TLC) for studies I and II, respectively, while vital capacity (VC) remained unchanged. <b>RV</b> and <b>TLC</b> remained significantly increased over the pre-exercise values through 30 and 15 minutes of recovery, respectively. Studies III through V were undertaken to determine the physiological mechanism underlying the responses reported in studies I and II. In study III, transthoracic electrical impedance (TEI) was significantly decreased below the pre-exercise value through 30 -minutes of recovery, indicating that there was an increase in thoracic fluid volume following exercise. However, TEI measurements alone cannot separate between intra- and extravascular fluid shifts. Therefore, studies IV and V attempted to identify whether the decrease in TEI and increase in RV reported in study III were due to intra- or extravascular fluid shifts. Study IV examined the TEI, <b>RV,</b> and <b>TLC</b> responses before and following exercise, as central blood volume (CBV) was experimentally increased via G-suit inflation, and decreased via venous occlusion tourniquets. The results suggest that RV is relatively insensitive to intravascular volume shifts within the thorax. Study V determined and followed the effect of an acute bout of exercise on lung diffusion capacity (D(,Lco)). D(,Lco) /V(,A) did not increase significantly following exercise, suggesting that the decrease in TEI following exercise is the result of extravascular fluid accumulation. It was concluded that a sub-clinical pulmonary edema occurs following exercise. A logical sequence of events {{based on the results of}} studies I through V was proposed as a possible explanation for the responses of <b>RV</b> and <b>TLC</b> following exercise...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 This {{study was}} to {{determine}} if an increase of PaC 0 ₂, after breath-holding prior to full inspiration, could enable a person to reach the same FVC measured on land while submerged. Another purpose of this {{study was to}} explore the difference in Db and %BF between HW at <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC</b> and TLCwet with breath-holding. The FVC was measured under the conditions of on land and in water, both with breath-holding and without breath-holding. Secondly, subjects were hydrostatically weighed at RV, TLCwet, and TLCwet with breath-holding to determine the differences in estimation of Db and %BF. The RV was estimated via empirical formula. The TLC was determined by summing FVC and RV. Fifteen male (18 - 25 years old) and 15 female (19 - 28 years old) students volunteered for this study. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Scheffe's post hoc test were used for statistical analysis of data. The a level was set at. 05 for statistical significance. There was no indication of increase in FVC with breath-holding. The FVC both with and without breath-holding was significantly reduced in water (5. 4 % - 5. 5 % in females, 3. 4 % - 3. 9 % in males). The mean Db calculated from RV was the lowest in both genders and was significantly lower than Db from TLCwet, TLCdry, and TLCwet with breath-holding. The Db at TLCwet was lower than at TLCdry with no statistical significance in males (average 0. 002 gm/cc difference) and in females (mean difference was 0. 005 gm/cc). The mean %BF difference between TLCwet and TLCdry was 0. 75 % in males and 2. 01 % in females (p̲>. 05). It is unlikely that a possible increase of PaC 0 ₂ attained after breath-holding could facilitate inspiratory motion via stimulus to the chemoreceptors to overcome hydrostatic pressure. The empirical estimate of RV may not be suitable for young adults who have larger lungs. Using TLCdry in HW could be an alternative instead of using RV for males; for females it should be used with greater caution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWeight loss {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a feature of advanced emphysema and a factor of poor prognosis, but its mechanisms remain obscure. Studies have demonstrated high serum concentrations of TNF-a (cachexin) in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients with emphysema. Pink puffers (PP) COPD patients have worse tissue oxygenation when compared with blue bloaters (BB) COPD patients. Consequently, PP patients would become cachectic, whereas BB patients with better tissue oxygenation would not. The aim {{of this study is to}} test the hypothesis that malnutrition in emphysema is a cytokine-mediated marker of chronic progressive tissue hypoxia. Thirty male COPD patients, without clinical or laboratory evidence of infection and severe airway obstruction (FEV 1 < 1. 5 l) were allocated: 16 as pink puffers (PP) and 14 as blue bloaters (BB). Lung function measurements included FEV 1, FVC, <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC,</b> DL CO and arterial blood gases on room air. TNF-a serum levels were measured by immunoenzymic method (ELISA). Tissue oxygenation was assessed from oxygen delivery (D O 2), P vO 2 and oxygen extraction ratio (O 2 ER) obtained after right heart catheterization with Swan Ganz catheter. PP patients demonstrated lower Dl CO and higher TLC, FRC and P aO 2 from BB. We found that oxygen delivery was better in our BB than in PP patients (Cl 2. 9 ± 0. 2 vs 2. 5 ± 0. 4 l/min/m 2 –P< 0. 01, D O 2 16. 1 ± 2. 1 vs 13. 1 ± 0. 2 ml/min/kg−P< 0. 001) and the same was found for tissue oxygenation (P vO 2 34. 6 ± 2. 9 vs 31. 2 ± 3. 8 mmHg- P< 0. 01, O 2 ER 0. 27 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 34 ± 0. 06 %- P< 0. 001). The TNF-a values were higher in PP (31. 3 ± 26 pg/ml vs 15. 2 ± 9. 9 pg/ml- P< 0. 05) and their percent fat-free mass (%FFM) was 49. 6 ± 11. 5 vs 42 ± 8 %- P< 0. 001. We found that COPD patients with lower D O 2 had increased TNF-a levels; but the correlations between TNF-a serum levels and P vO 2 or O 2 ER were not statistically significant. TNF-a levels were elevated in PP patients with tissue hypoxia and may be a factor contributing to the weight loss of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Maximal expiratory flow in low {{parts of}} FVC is a {{sensitive}} indicator of small airways resistance. Clinical asymptomatic anatomic changes of small airways (SA) cannot be discovered by standard functional tests: FEV 1, FVC and FEV 1 %FVC. Increased resistance of small airways {{is the key}} point in asthma {{and it can be}} diagnosed by flow-volume curve (FV-C) early. HYPOTHESIS. The parameters used in asthma diagnosis and control: FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 %FVC and PEF are not sensitive enough and this results in hypodiagnosis and insufficient treatment of asthma in children. The consequence can be the existence of unidentified hyperinflation with the development of irreversible bronchial changes. My hypothesis is that more intensive usage of more sensitive inflamation markers in asthma: biological (IgE, ECP) and physiological (FEF 75 and FEF 50) significantly improves diagnosis and control of asthma in children and cuts down the danger of appearance of irreversible changes. AIMS. The discovery of the airway obstruction at an early, reversible stage of asthma aiming at an early stage treatment. Evaluation of hyperinflation level in children with mild and moderate asthma cured and controled according to GINA guidelines. Using the prospective follow up we want {{to determine the effects of}} the treatment in asmathic children, sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) test results of biological and physiological markers which are used in diagnosis and control of asthma in children. Evaluation of persistance of ventilation/perfussion disorders in children with mild and moderate asthma and determining its influence on TLC and treatment response. SUBJECTS: Out of total of 298 children, 81 healthy children were in the Control group (aged 10. 7 ± 2. 2), 217 children with mild and moderate asthma were in the Asthma group (aged 10. 2 ± 3. 1). All of them were patients of the Clinic for Allergy and Pulmology of the Pediactric Clinic at the Clinical Hospital Split. According to the treatment I established three groups: ICS group: 121 children treated with inhaled steroid IS: fluticasone propionate (100 - 200 mg daily), Ketotifen group: 65 children treated with ketotifen (2 mg daily) and Salbutamol group: 31 children treated with salbutamol as needed (100 - 200 mg). METHODS. In the prospective study (1996 - 2002) in all the children the following items were measured: ·Biological markers: 1 Total and specific IgE (RAST), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), · Physiological markers: 1 Sat. O 2, pO 2, pH and pCO 2 before lung function tests, 2 Flow-volume curve (FV-C), 3 Airway resistance (Rtot, plathysmographic), 4 Diffusing lung capacity TLCO (single breath method with carbone monoxyde), alveolar volume (VA), transfer coefficient (KCO), 5 Residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC) and RV%TLC: 5. 1 Plethysmographic and 5. 2 By diffusion. All parameters presented above (FV-C, Rtot, <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC,</b> TLCO) were repeated after bronchodilatation test (BT, salbutamol). In the Control group all the measurements were done once, while in the asthma groups measurements (in total 4) were repeated at intervals of 3 - 6 months. RESULTS. The parameters of highest sensitivity and NPV in children with mild and moderate asthma are: FEF 75 (60. 9 %) and FEF 50 (52. 2 %). They, as parameters of mid-expiratory flow on FV-C, reflect the flows through small airways. Repeated FV-C measurements in children with mild and moderate asthma proved better efficiency of IS treatment compared to ketotifen and salbutamol. The biggest measurement differences before and after BT were noticed in ICS group for all FV-C parameters which suggests that b 2 -receptors in children treated with IS have better therapeutic approachability. Children with mild and moderate asthma in ICS group show significantly lower values of FEF 25 in all measurements in spite of IS therapy. It suggests their hypotreatment and the necessity of add-therapy (B 2 -agonists, increase of IS dose). It confirms reversible increase of total airway resistance established by plethysmographic measurements in ICS group which considerably decreased with IS therapy and salbutamol inhalation. Asmatic children treated with IS (p= 0. 014, p 0. 05), unlike diffusion measurements of identical parameters which showed significant level of hyperinflation in asthmatic children (p< 0. 001). Diffusion measurements of <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC</b> and RV%TLC showed significantly higher level of sensitivity and NPV compared to plethysmographic, which makes diffusing measurement of the lung function parameters a better method of diagnosis and control of asthma in children. Children with asthma had significantly higher TLCO (p< 0. 0001), VA (p= 0. 005) and KCO (p< 0. 0001) at the begginning of the treatment which normalized during the treatment and after BT. Apart from reversibility of inflammatory changes and their good response to bronchodilatation therapy, it shows the disorder of ventilation/perfusion in children with mild and moderate asthma. CONCLUSIONS. Children with mild and moderate asthma, treated according to GINA guidelines, are hypodiagnosed and hypotreated. It is the consequence of insufficient sensitivity of parameters used in diagnosis and control of treatment: FEV 1, FVC and FEV 1 %FVC. I suggest a supplement to the algorhythm of tests used so far, introduction of parameters of mid-expiratory flow which reflect changes of small airways: FEF 75 and FEF 50 as the most sensitive, highly specific and parameters of high PPV and NPV values which would result in improvement of diagnosis and control even in asymptomatic asthma. Children with mild and moderate asthma show the presence of reversible hyperinflation which diminishes with bronchodilatation therapy and IS treatment. The estimation of the hyperinflation degree through diffusion shows significantly higher sensitivity and NPV compared to plethysmographic measurement. In case of disparity between clinical symptoms and FV-C results I suggest to rule out the presence of hyperinflation by diffusion measurement of RV and RV%TLC. With regard to proved significant decrease of total and specific IgE after IS treatment, it is useful to treat children who have mild asthma together with high level of IgE and even higher level of hypersensitivity on D. Pteronyssinus (RAST ³ 4), even in absence of symptons and spirometric disorders, with short and preventive IS cure (3 months), aiming at the decrease of risks of further sensibilisation and appearance of the desease. In available literature I have not found similar opinions on therapeutical prevention of these occurrences. I have found the ventilation/perfusion disorder even in children with mild and moderate asthma: increased level of TLCO, VA and KCO. My opinion is that that due to the ventilation/perfusion disorder the rest of alveolar-cappilary units are included of which in literature I have not found similar experience in children with asthma. Good response to bronchodilatation therapy and IS treatment confirms the reversibility of inflammatory changes. Comparing sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of biological and physiological markers used in diagnosis and control of asthma in children I found out that the most useful tests are those of highest sensitivity and NPV: IgE, RV%TLC determined by diffusion (d), RVd, FEF 75 and FEF 50. Using these tests together with already used parameters: FVC, FEV 1 and FEV 1 %FVC, it is possible to achieve further improvement in diagnosis and asthma control in children...|$|E

Fifteen subjects (GOLD stage I-II: 7; GOLD stage III-IV: 8) underwent methacholine bronchoprovocation in the absence of DI, followed by DI. The effectiveness of DI was assessed by their ability to improve IVC and FEV 1.

However, {{the great majority of}} diaphragm ultrasound studies have measured diaphragm thickness in B-mode. Some evaluated the variation of thickness at different lung volumes from <b>RV</b> to <b>TLC</b> in normal subjects [15, 18].

Postinfectious Bronchiolitis Obliterans (PIBO) {{is the most important}} complication. There are few studies assessing pulmonary function and quality of life in PIBO patients. Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the pulmonary function and the quality of life ofpatients with PIBO and the correlation between both variables. Methods: 14 children with PIBO in follow up at the pediatric pulmonology outpatient clinic of a public children hospital were included in this study. Study period: April 2009 - April 2010. Pulmonary function was assessed in a medical visit by spirometry, flow/volume curve and intrathoracic gas volume measurement. The following indices were analyzed FVC, FEV 1, FEV 25 - 75, FEV 1 /FVC, <b>RV,</b> <b>TLC,</b> RV and RV/TLC. A survey of a self-administered Quality of Life (PedsQL, version 4. 0, Spanish for Chile) was applied at the visit to investigate their global, physical and psychosocial quality of life. The Pearson linear correlation between quality of life and the pulmonary function test parameters was assessed, in the statistical analysis ap value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The mean age of our patients was 12. 4 (range: 9 - 19 years-old). The functional alterations were characteristics of an obstructive respiratory disorder in 64. 3 % of the patients. Average pulmonary function test indices showed decreases in FEV 1 (75 %), FEV 25 - 75 (48. 8 %), FEV 1 /FVC (67. 6 %) with normal value of FVC (93, 7 %) as well as pronounced increases in RV (333. 5 %), TLC (156 %) and RV/TLC (51. 8 %). Mean change of FEV 1 and FEV 25 - 75 post-bronchodilator was 11. 3 % and 26. 4 % respectively. Only 14. 3 % of our patients showed normal pulmonary function. The quality of life parameters were in average 58. 2 % of overall quality of life, 58. 6 % ofphysical quality of life and 57. 9 % ofpsychosocial quality of life. We found a positive correlation between global quality of life and FEV 1, FVC and FEV 25 - 75 (correlation index 0. 54, 0. 53 and 0. 53 respectively) as well between physical quality of life and FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 / FVC and FEV 25 - 75 (correlation index 0. 86, 0. 82, 0. 72 and 0. 55 respectively). Conclusions: Most patients with PIBO showed pulmonary function impairment characterized by an obstructive respiratory pattern.

This study aimed to characterize the late functional sequelae of TPL, and to establish the degree of reversibility of any consequent airway obstruction. METHODOLOGY: Pulmonary function was studied in 21 long-term (mean 35 years) survivors of TPL between the years 1990 - 2001. RESULTS: A mixed obstructive/restrictive defect was found in this patient cohort. After inhalation of bronchodilator, marginal increases in FEV(1) and FVC and marginal decreases in FRC, <b>RV</b> and <b>TLC</b> were observed. Maximum mid-expiratory flow rate was severely reduced (28. 8 % of predicted), but reversibility after inhaled beta(2) -agonist was highest for this parameter of pulmonary function (mean 11 %). Smokers had a higher RV (P = 0. 04), suggesting hyperinflation, while non-smokers had a larger increase in FEV(1) /FVC ratio postbronchodilator (P = 0. 004), suggesting more marked reversibility of airways obstruction in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of TPL have an obstructive {{as well as a}} restrictive ventilatory defect. These patients have partial reversibility of the obstructive defect.

40|$|On chest radiographs {{performed}} at spirometrically controlled residual volume (RV), {{functional residual capacity}} (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC), several distances were measured in 8 young and 7 elderly male subjects. Regional volumes {{above and below the}} minor fissure were calculated using Barnhard's method for thoracic gas volume determination. When the volumes above and below the fissure were expressed as a percentage of their volume at TLC, and related to overall lung volumes (in percent of TLC), graphs similar to the ones obtained in scintigraphic studies were obtained. This illustrates that the present radiographic method may provide information on regional pulmonary volumes. Regional TLC of the upper zone was larger in elderly subjects than in young ones, while the opposite was true for regional TLC of the lower zone, indicating that maximal regional expansion changes with age. For the upper zone, the changes in diameters between <b>RV</b> and <b>TLC</b> were largest in antero-posterior direction and smallest in cranio-caudal direction. For the lower zone, changes were largest in cranio-caudal direction. This suggests an anisotropic expansion of the upper and lower zone.

IOS measurements (R 5, R 20, X 5 & Fres), body plethysmography (sGaw, FRC, <b>TLC,</b> <b>RV</b> & IC) and spirometry (FEV 1) were performed. Pearson or Spearman correlation determined the relationships between IOS and other measurements. ResultsR 5, X 5 and Fres were all significantly associated (p< 0. 05) with FEV 1, sGaw, <b>TLC,</b> <b>RV</b> and IC. However, R 20 was not related to any of these measurements except for RV. The strongest associations were observed between FEV 1 and the reactance measurements X 5 (r= 0. 48) and Fres (r=− 0. 44), and sGaw with X 5 (r= 0. 47) and Fres (r= 0. 51). The r values for the associations with TLC and IC were all < 0. 25. There was no statistically significant change in the FEV 1, R 5, X 5 or Fres after 1 year, but R 20 significantly increased over the year. The changes in R 5 and R 20 did not significantly correlate with the changes in FEV 1. In contrast, X 5 changes were significantly related to FEV 1 changes over 1 year (r=− 0. 27, p= 0. 05), while for Fres changes there was a trend to statistical significance (p= 0. 08). ConclusionsIOS reactance measurements are more closely related than resistance measurements to other pulmonary function measurements in COPD patients. The IOS reactance measurements appear to be indicative of changes in pulmonary compliance caused by airflow obstruction...|$|R

This seems counter-intuitive given the changes in airway properties, body proportions, thoracic shape and respiratory muscle function that occur during growth. The age dependence of lung volumes, FEV 1 /FVC and RV/TLC were studied in children worldwide. Spirometric data were available for 22, 412 healthy youths (51. 4 % male) aged 4 - 20 yrs from 15 centres, and <b>RV</b> and <b>TLC</b> data for 2, 253 youths (56. 7 % male) from four centres; three sets included sitting height (SH). Data were fitted {{as a function of}} age, height and SH. In childhood, FVC outgrows TLC and FEV 1, leading to falls in FEV 1 /FVC and RV/TLC; these trends are reversed in adolescence. Taking into account SH materially reduces differences in pulmonary function within and between ethnic groups. The highest FEV 1 /FVC ratios occur in those shortest for their age. When interpreting lung function test results, the changing pattern in FEV 1 /FVC and RV/TLC should be considered.

In this trial, functional respiratory imaging (FRI) (De Backer et al., Radiology 2010) is evaluated for calculating post-operative FEV 1 (poFEV 1). Methods 23 patients (14 analyzed [10 single lobectomy, 2 double lobectomy, 2 pneumonectomy], 9 dropouts [2 deceased, 3 lost in follow up, 4 sub-lobar resection]) {{were included in the}} trial. All patients underwent spirometry, perfusion scanning, and pneumotach controlled CT scanning at maximum expiration (<b>RV)</b> and inspiration (<b>TLC),</b> both before and after resection. Post-surgery tests were acquired after recovery and before the start of any adjuvant therapy. <b>RV</b> and <b>TLC</b> scans were used to segment lobar volumes and to calculate regional expansion (EXP). Furthermore, resistances (iRaw, before and after virtual resection) were acquired through computational fluid dynamics. poFEV 1 was predicted using the guideline formulas and using the FRI based formula (Figure 1). Results Median actual poFEV 1 is 2100 ml (1210 ml [...] 3210 ml). The slopes of the fitted linear models between the actual and predicted poFEV 1 are 1. 10 (R 2 = 0. 81, p< 0. 001 *) and 0. 98 (R 2 = 0. 86, p< 0. 001 *) for the ACCP prediction and the FRI prediction respectively. A paired t-test shows no significant difference between actual poFEV 1 and FRI predicted poFEV 1 (p= 0. 76) while ACCP predicted poFEV 1 (p= 0. 002 *) underestimates actual poFEV 1. This is also reflected in the smaller root mean square error of the FRI method (213 ml versus 371 ml). Conclusions In contrast with the guideline formulas, there is {{no significant difference between the}} FRI predicted and the actual poFEV 1. Furthermore, the root mean square error of the proposed method is 43 % smaller than the standard method, and is lower than the minimally important changes in FEV 1 (323 ml) as very recently reported by Janssens et al. (Respiratory Medicine 2013). Also, the slope of the linear fit from the FRI prediction is very close to 1, indicating that the model is very well predicting reality. FRI seems to be a better tool to predict post-operative FEV 1 as compared to the current guidelines in patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to establish a link between the mechanical parameters including tissue elastance (H) and airway resistance (Raw), and thoracic gas volume (TGV) in addition to Prs in a mouse model of emphysema. Using low-frequency forced oscillations during slow deep inflation, we tracked H and Raw as functions of TGV and Prs in normal mice and mice treated with porcine pancreatic elastase. The presence of emphysema was confirmed by morphometric analysis of histological slices. The treatment resulted in an increase in TGV by 51 and 44 % and a decrease in H by 57 and 27 %, respectively, at 0 and 20 cmH 2 O of Prs. The Raw did not differ between the groups at any value of Prs, but it was significantly higher in the treated mice at comparable TGV values. In further groups of mice, tracheal sounds were recorded during inflations from <b>RV</b> to <b>TLC.</b> All lung volumes but RV were significantly elevated in the treated mice, whereas the numbers and size distributions of inspiratory crackles were not different, suggesting that the airways were not affected by the elastase treatment.

Measurements of spirometry and body plethysmography were made. Adding salmeterol to half the dose of fluticasone led to a mean improvement (95 % CI) vs. baseline in morning PEF of 41. 5 (14. 0 – 69. 0) l/min [p< 0. 05]; and RAW of 0. 98 (0. 14 – 1. 8) cm H 2 O/l/s [p< 0. 05].

Fourteen patients, seven men and seven women {{with a mean age of}} 62 years, who underwent bilateral lung volume reduction surgery have been followed up for 3 months. We here report the data on quality of life, lung function and elastic recoil. FEV 1 · 0 increased by a mean of 26 % from 0 · 58 1 to 0 · 73 1 (P< 0 · 01). The mean TLC was reduced by 16 % from 8 · 9 1 to 7 · 5 1 (P< 0 · 001). The level of hyperinflation decreased as implied by a reduction in the ratio of <b>RV</b> to <b>TLC</b> from 0 · 70 to 0 · 60 (P< 0 · 001). The pulmonary elastic recoil improved, with an increase in the transpulmonary pressure at maximal inspiration (Pe 1 tlc) from 0 · 95 kPa to 1 · 35 kPa (P< 0 · 05) and an average increase in the coefficient of retraction Pe 1 tlc/TLC) from 0 · 12 kPa 1 − 1 to 0 · 19 kPa 1 − 1 (P< 0 · 01).

A new group of 13 COPD male patients (FEV 1 /FVC< 70 % and FVC ≥ 80 %) was used in this study, with stricter inclusion criteria than in the previous one. Anthropometric parameters (age, weight, height, skinfolds) and values of several pulmonary function tests, such as spirometry (FVC, FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC), static volumes (<b>RV</b> and <b>TLC)</b> and pulmonary diffusion (DL,CO and DL,CO /VA) were recorded. The EIT system (TIE 4 sys) and a pneumotach were simultaneously connected to monitor tidal volume.

Static Volume test RV 168 ± 43 % and TLC 119 ± 12 % of reference value. Pulmonary diffusion test DL,CO 56 ± 15 %, DL,CO,ADJ 57 ± 15 % and DL,CO /VA 68 ± 13 % of reference value. The mean tidal volumes estimated with TIE 4 sys and the pneumotach were: 0. 544 ± 0. 196 L and 0. 763 ± 0. 168 L r = 0. 861 (p< 0. 01). The mean difference was 0. 218 ± 0. 100 L (p< 0. 01). The differences show a strong correlation with the subscapular and rear skinfold; and the pulmonary diffusion values.

Baseline sputum analysis revealed increased neutrophil counts in patients {Median (IQR) : 63 % (38 – 79) } compared to healthy subjects matched for age {Median (IQR) : 49 % (17 – 67), p <  0. 001 } but there was no significant change in any type of sputum cell counts over the three years. When comparing myeloablative (MA) vs non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning, falls in FEV 1, FVC and DLCO, and rise in RV and sputum neutrophils were more pronounced over the first year of observation in those receiving MA. ConclusionsThere was a progressive loss in lung function after HSCT, featuring a restrictive pattern. Myeloablative conditioning was associated with early rise of sputum neutrophils and greater alteration in lung function over the first year...|$|R
