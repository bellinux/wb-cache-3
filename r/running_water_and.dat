5|$|An acute {{shortage}} of housing {{after the fall}} of the Communist regime in 1990 led some Albanians to set up home in abandoned bunkers, though the lack of <b>running</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> sanitation meant that the area around inhabited bunkers soon became contaminated and unhealthy. A few bunkers have found more creative uses. In the coastal city of Durrës one beachside bunker has been turned into the Restaurant Bunkeri, and another bunker in Gjirokastër was turned into a café.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as <b>running</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, but the music is closer to ambient.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{is home to}} more 300 {{privately owned}} beach-huts, which {{are some of the}} UK's most expensive. In 2015 five of the huts were put on the market for a {{combined}} asking price of £1 million. On average the huts measure around five by three metres, have no <b>running</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> the occupants may only stay overnight from March to October. Despite the relative lack of amenities, the area {{has become one of the}} UK's most desirable; huts are rented out for up to £600 a week.|$|E

5|$|When the General Assembly {{convened in}} January, Ralston {{proposed}} several acts aimed to improve work conditions. Among the laws he promoted, and the Assembly passed, were acts that banned {{the sale of}} narcotic drugs for the first time, a minimum wage, and free vaccinations for several prevalent diseases. Ralston successfully lobbied for other improvements to the living conditions of the urban poor that included funding to provide clean <b>running</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> children's playgrounds.|$|E
5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not been set aside and no food had been prepared. The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had no electricity or <b>running</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Running</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> {{electricity}} are supplied at {{the national}} level by a government service provider, Jirama, which is unable to service the entire population. , only 6.8percent of Madagascar's fokontany had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5percent had access to its electricity services. 56% of Madagascar's power is provided by hydroelectric power plants with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators. Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30percent of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.|$|E

5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented economic strength, {{resulting in}} the increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. His {{first year in office}} ended with no fiscal deficit; the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, <b>running</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E
5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold <b>running</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. <b>Running</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E

5|$|P. fimbriata {{is found}} in the rain forests of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Malaysia {{including}} Malacca, Indonesia, and in Australia's Northern Territory and Queensland. It lives on foliage, tree trunks, boulders, and rock walls. Throughout its range, this is the most common species of the genus Portia. Queensland specimens of P. fimbriata live near <b>running</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> where there is moderate light, while Northern Territory specimens live in caves where the light varies from rather dark at the back to much brighter around the mouths. Other populations of Portia also live with higher light levels than in Queensland, and some members of these other populations are found in webs exposed to direct sunlight for part of the day. In Queensland, P. fimbriata shares its environment with a common prey, the very abundant Jacksonoides queenslandicus, and with large populations of other non-Portia salticids and non-salticid web-building spiders.|$|E

2500|$|By the 11th century, {{it appears}} that the town had once again been {{developed}} into a fortified city.

Its walls are strong, and it has an iron gate. There are fountains that gush out within the city".
