50|$|The {{air waybill}} is a contract, i.e. an {{agreement}} enforceable by law. To become a valid contract {{it has to}} be signed by the shipper or his agent and by the carrier or its authorised agent. Although the same individual or organisation may act on behalf of both the carrier and the shipper, the air waybill must be signed twice one each in the respective carrier and shipper boxes. Both signatures may be of the same person. This also implies that the air waybill should be issued immediately upon <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> and letter in instructions from the shipper.|$|E

50|$|Three judges, Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ, {{used the}} highly formalistic {{criterion}} of liability approach (which {{has since been}} discredited) to decide this case. In this approach, the fees were not viewed as excise duties because <b>the</b> criterion <b>of</b> liability does not fall in a step between <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> and <b>the</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> by <b>the</b> consumer due to the backdating (per Kitto J). <b>The</b> payment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fee is seen as occurring as part of business generally; also, because the fee is not payable at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purchase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquor, and because the retailer may choose not to renew his licence, the fee does not necessarily become an indirect cost for the consumer. The distinction, therefore, is that the fees were imposed not on goods, but on licences, and thus not an excise duty. These three judges held that the fees were not excise duties and hence were not invalid.|$|R

By far the most commonly used instrument of international payment is a documentary letter of credit. In addition to letters of credit and “traditional” payment instruments - waiting and bills in foreign trade transactions there is a possibility of payment bank transfer, which is mainly used for advance payments (payments in advance, before <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods),</b> which carries certain risks for the buyer. There is also the possibility of documentary collection - the so-called documentary collection. When any instrument is the reverse order of strokes of remittances advance.

Subsequently, it became also a document of title, so extending its capacity even to support the sale of the goods to be carried. At present, the bill of lading appears to be extended to the multimodal transports of goods with excellent results and can be used also in electronic applications. The particular and unique role of this document confirms the speciality of the maritime traffics and, more generally, of the maritime field, and emphasizes the consequent need of relevant studies and special legal rules for the purpose of meeting the evolving demands of the modern transport operators through adequate measures...|$|E

This research study; therefore, employed benchmarking techniques to assess inventory management performance at the case study company and so improve its inventory management processes. The research methodology comprised of four main steps, according to the benchmarking process introduced by Xerox Corporation, these being: planning, analysis, integration and action. A study into <b>the</b> finished <b>goods</b> inventory processes at the case study organization covered four key processes, these being: <b>the</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> for storage, <b>the</b> transportation <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> within <b>the</b> warehouse, and storage itself.

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} and analyzes a multi-location inventory {{model to}} examine the value of warehouse risk-pooling in high service-level systems. Specifically, risk-pooling over the outside-supplier leadtime is examined. Two alternative systems of N identical retailers are formulated. In System 1, each retailer operates independently: retailers receive goods directly from an outside supplier after a fixed leadtime (L s + L tr), where L s is the outside supplier's own (e. g., manufacturing) leadtime and L tr is the transportation/receiving leadtime to the retailers. In System 2, the system order is shipped to a warehouse, arriving after a fixed leadtime (L s + L tw), where L tw is the transportation/receiving leadtime to the warehouse. Upon <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> the warehouse allocates and ships units to the retailers to equalize their inventory positions. The warehouse does not hold inventory. Allocation and reshipment in System 2 requires a fixed leadtime of (L pw + L tr) time periods, where L pw is the allocation and (re) packaging leadtime at the warehouse. Hence, System 2 pools risk over the outside supplier leadtime, but at the cost of: (1) increased overall leadtime to the retailers; and (2) an `internal' pipeline inventory holding cost. Our analysis asks the question: given equal required service-levels and equal safety stock holding cost (plus pipeline inventory cost for System 2), how large can System 2 's extra leadtimes (L tw, L pw) be? Our analysis concludes that pipeline inventory-holding cost significantly influences the overall value of these breakeven leadtimes. Specifically, when pipeline inventory holding costs can (somehow) be ignored, the corresponding breakeven leadtimes can be quite large. However, if these costs cannot be avoided, then the corresponding breakeven leadtimes are significantly reduced. Managerial interpretations are provided. inventory/production, multi-echelon, leadtime policy, stochastic model...|$|E
