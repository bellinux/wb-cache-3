40|$|The British Geological Survey was {{commissioned}} by the Crown Estate to assess geological conditions in the Irish Sea {{in relation to the}} possible constraints they may place on development of offshore infrastructure. The report describes the geology between 0 m and 50 m below seabed, which is the depth most relevant to current pile foundation technology. The report reviews the best available data {{from a variety of sources}} including, BGS legacy data, map sheets, and regional reports, as well as site investigations carried out for hydrocarbon and offshore renewable industries. Additional data collected for the proposed Round 3 offshore wind farm in the Irish Sea (Celtic Array) was also included. Prof. Richard Chiverrell and Dr. Katrien Van Landeghem (of Liverpool and Bangor universities), who together have extensive experience working in the Irish Sea, provided valuable advice and guidance. The report is split into four principle sections as summarised below. Section 3 summarises seabed topography, sediments and processes. The topography of the <b>report</b> <b>area</b> is split into shallow platforms and deeper troughs. Seabed sediments are subdivided into regions of soft mud- (clay and silt) rich sediment in the eastern and western Irish Sea and a central gravel belt comprising coarse sand and gravel. Small areas of bedrock outcrop at seabed are also recognised. Currents in the Irish Sea mobilise sediment to form a collection of marine bedforms ranging from ripples to very large (up to 36 m in height) solitary sediment waves and banner banks. Predicting bedform migration speeds and pathways is difficult and requires repeat surveys. Bedform migration rates of 0 m/yr to 66 m/yr, with average values around 6 m/yr have been observed. Shallow gas is expected in some areas of the Irish Sea. Where this gas is present, pockmarks or methane derived authigenic carbonate may occur. Section 4 summarises the Quaternary history of the Irish Sea and its impact on the distribution, thickness and properties of sediment. Growth and collapse of ice sheets and associated sea level fluctuations principally determine geological properties of Quaternary sediments. The stratigraphy in the <b>report</b> <b>area</b> reflects three major glacial periods with the last one having the most pronounced influence. Very stiff diamicts (glacial ‘boulder clays’ or tills) are present across most of the <b>report</b> <b>area</b> of variable thickness. In enclosed deeps, locally sediment thickness can be > 100 m. Glacial landforms are preserved at the seabed and can be used to predict sediment properties. Extensive studies onshore can provide analogues to assess potential geological properties offshore. Section 5 provides a review of bedrock distribution and properties. Where Quaternary sediment cover is < 50 m, bedrock will be encountered in the shallow subsurface. The predominant bedrock lithologies in the <b>report</b> <b>area</b> are Triassic and Carboniferous sandstone and mudstone. Geotechnical properties of Triassic rocks are comparable and potentially predictable. Carboniferous rock show high lateral and vertical variability. There are a number of igneous intrusions in the <b>report</b> <b>area</b> and rock properties near to the location of these igneous bodies may differ due to alteration of the host rock during intrusion. Section 6 summarises the geological constraints identified in preceding sections with reference to engineering activities and infrastructure. The report outlines the current state of knowledge of geological conditions in the Irish Sea. It is recommended for use as a guide and should not replace a detailed site investigation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Area-level {{socioeconomic}} disparities {{have long}} been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Crime is {{an important element of}} the neighborhood environment inadequately investigated in the reproductive and public health literature. When crime has been used in research, it has been variably defined, resulting in non-comparable associations across studies. Methods Using geocoded linked birth record, crime and census data in multilevel models, this paper explored the relevance of four spatial violent crime exposures: two proximal violent crime categorizations (count of violent crime within a one-half mile radius of maternal residence and distance from maternal residence to nearest violent crime) and two area-level crime categorizations (count of violent crimes within a block group and block group rate of violent crimes) for adverse birth events among women in living in the city of Raleigh NC crime <b>report</b> <b>area</b> in 1999 – 2001. Models were adjusted for maternal age and education and area-level deprivation. Results In black and white non-Hispanic race-stratified models, crime characterized as a proximal exposure was not able to distinguish between women experiencing adverse and women experiencing normal birth outcomes. Violent crime characterized as a neighborhood attribute was positively associated with preterm birth and low birth weight among non-Hispanic white and black women. No statistically significant interaction between area-deprivation and violent crime category was observed. Conclusion Crime is variably categorized in the literature, with little rationale provided for crime type or categorization employed. This research represents the first time multiple crime categorizations have been directly compared in association with health outcomes. Finding an effect of area-level violent crime suggests crime may best be characterized as a neighborhood attribute with important implication for adverse birth outcomes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a {{cryptographic}} primitive that hides {{memory access}} patterns {{as seen by}} untrusted storage. Recently, ORAM has been architected into secure proces-sors. A big challenge for hardware ORAM schemes is how to efficiently manage the Position Map (PosMap), a cen-tral component in modern ORAM algorithms. Implemented naı̈vely, the PosMap causes ORAM to be fundamentally un-scalable in terms of on-chip area. On the other hand, a tech-nique called Recursive ORAM fixes the area problem yet significantly increases ORAM’s performance overhead. To address this challenge, we propose three new mech-anisms. We propose a new ORAM structure called the PosMap Lookaside Buffer (PLB) and PosMap compression techniques to reduce the performance overhead from Recur-sive ORAM empirically (the latter also improves the con-struction asymptotically). Through simulation, we show that these techniques reduce the memory bandwidth overhead needed to support recursion by 95 %, reduce overall ORAM bandwidth by 37 % and improve overall SPEC benchmark performance by 1. 27 ×. We then show how our PosMap compression techniques further facilitate an extremely effi-cient integrity verification scheme for ORAM which we call PosMap MAC (PMMAC). For a practical parameterization, PMMAC reduces the amount of hashing needed for integrity checking by ≥ 68 × relative to prior schemes and introduces only 7 % performance overhead.

40|$|Operation of SOFCs at {{intermediate}} temperatures (500 - 800 C) requires new {{combinations of}} electrolyte and electrode materials {{that will provide}} both rapid ion transport across the electrolyte and electrode-electrolyte interfaces and efficient electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction and fuel oxidation reactions. This project concentrates on materials and issues associated with cathode performance that are known to become limiting factors as the operating temperature is reduced. The specific objectives of the proposed research are to develop cathode materials that meet the electrode performance targets of 1. 0 W/cm{sup 2 } at 0. 7 V in combination with YSZ at 700 C and with GDC, LSGM or bismuth oxide based electrolytes at 600 C. The performance targets imply an area specific resistance of {approx} 0. 5 {Omega}cm{sup 2 } for the total cell. The research strategy is to investigate both established classes of materials and new candidates as cathodes, to determine fundamental performance parameters such as bulk diffusion, surface reactivity and interfacial transfer, and to couple these parameters to performance in single cell tests. The initial choices for study were perovskite oxides based on substituted LaFeO{sub 3 } (P 1 compositions), where significant data in single cell tests exist at PNNL for example, for La{sub 0. 8 }Sr{sub 0. 2 }FeO{sub 3 } cathodes on both YSZ and CSO/YSZ. The materials selection was then extended to La{sub 2 }NiO{sub 4 } compositions (K 1 compositions), {{and then in a}} longer range task we evaluated the possibility of completely unexplored group of materials that are also perovskite related, the ABM{sub 2 }O{sub 5 +{delta}}. A key component of the research strategy was to evaluate for each cathode material composition, the key performance parameters, including ionic and electronic conductivity, surface exchange rates, stability with respect to the specific electrolyte choice, and thermal expansion coefficients. In the initial phase, we did this in parallel with the perovskite compositions that were being investigated at PNNL, in order to assess the relative importance of the intrinsic properties such as oxygen ion diffusion and surface exchange rates as predictors of performance in cell tests. We then used these measurements to select new materials for scaled up synthesis and performance evaluation in single cell tests. The results of the single cell tests than provided feedback to the materials synthesis and selection steps. In this summary, the following studies are reported: (1) Synthesis, characterization, and DC conductivity measurements of the P 1 compositions La{sub 0. 8 }Sr{sub 0. 2 }FeO{sub 3 -x} and La{sub 0. 7 }Sr{sub 0. 3 }FeO{sub 3 -x} were completed. A combinational approach for preparing a range P 1 (La,Sr) FeO{sub 3 } compositions as thin films was investigated. Synthesis and heat treatment of amorphous SrFeO{sub 3 -x} and LaFeO{sub 3 -x} films prepared by pulsed laser deposition are described. (2) Oxygen transport properties of K 1 compositions La{sub x}Pr{sub 2 -x}NiO{sub 4 +d} (x = 2. 0, 1. 9, 1. 2, 1. 0 and 0) measured by electrical conductivity relaxation are presented in this <b>report.</b> <b>Area</b> specific resistances determined by ac impedance measurements for La{sub 2 }NiO{sub 4 +{delta}} and Pr{sub 2 }NiO{sub 4 +{delta}} on CGO are encouraging and suggest that further optimization of the electrode microstructure will enable the target to be reached. (3) The oxygen exchange kinetics of the oxygen deficient double perovskite LnBaCo{sub 2 }O{sub 5. 5 +{delta}} (Ln=Pr and Nd) were determined by electrical conductivity relaxation. The high electronic conductivity and rapid diffusion and surface exchange kinetics of PBCO suggest its application as cathode material in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells. The first complete cell measurements were performed on Ni/CGO/CGO/PBCO/CGO cells. (4) The oxygen exchange kinetics of highly epitaxial thin films of PrBaCo{sub 2 }O{sub 5. 5 +{delta}} (PBCO) has been determined by electrical conductivity relaxation and isotope exchange and depth profiling and confirm the high electronic conductivity and rapid surface exchange kinetics. (5) The phase compatibility of La{sub 2 }NiO{sub 4 }, Pr{sub 2 }NiO{sub 4 } and PrBaCo{sub 2 }O{sub 5. 5 +x} with YSZ and GDC electrolytes was investigated by solid state reaction and powder X-ray diffraction.
