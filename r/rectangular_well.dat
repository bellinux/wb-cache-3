Electrons {{confined to the}} heterojunction of HEMTs exhibit higher mobilities than those in MOSFETs, since the former device utilizes an intentionally undoped channel thereby mitigating the deleterious effect of ionized impurity scattering. Two closely spaced heterojunction interfaces {{may be used to}} confine electrons to a <b>rectangular</b> quantum <b>well.</b> Careful choice of the materials and alloy compositions allow control of the carrier densities within the 2DEG.|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss a}} finite <b>rectangular</b> <b>well</b> as a {{perturbation}} for the infinite {{one with a}} depth λ 2 of the former as a perturbation parameter. In particular we consider a behaviour of energy levels in the well as functions of complex λ. It is found that all the levels of the same parity are defined on infinitely sheeted Riemann surfaces which topological structures are described in details. These structures differ considerably from those found in models investigated earlier [1, 4, 8, 9, 10]. It is shown that perturbation series for all the levels converge what is in a contrast with the known results of Bender and Wu [1]. The last property is shown to hold also for the infinite <b>rectangular</b> <b>well</b> with Dirac delta barrier as a perturbation considered earlier by Ushveridze [4].

40|$|In paper {{approach}} of double complex SUSY-transformations with not coincident complex energies of transformation is developed, allowing to deform given real potential V 1 (with keeping of its shape real) with obtaining exact solutions. The explicit solutions of the deformation of {{shape of the}} potential, its wave function at arbitrary energy, not coincident with energies of transformation, wave functions at the energies of transformation are obtained, condition of keeping of continuity of the solutions and isospectral condition are determined. Using a <b>rectangular</b> <b>well</b> of finite width with infinitely high walls as the starting V 1 with discrete energy spectrum, by the proposed approach new types of deformation of this potential with deformation of the energy spectrum as a whole have been obtained. The new potential contains the <b>rectangular</b> <b>well</b> as own partial case (with simultaneous transformation of the shape of this new potential, energy spectrum, wave functions of all bound states, wave function at arbitrary energy into corresponding characteristics of the <b>rectangular</b> <b>well</b> at needed choice of parameters). Using null potential as the starting V 1 with continuous energy spectrum, new form of reflectionless real potential has been constructed. This potential generalizes well-known reflectionless potential of the type Vref(x) = A 2 (1 − 2 sech 2 Ax), allowing: to pull down tails of the potential Vref in the asymptotic regions up to zero (with keeping of nonzero depth); to pull down continuousl...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} energy {{properties}} of a particle in one dimensional semi-harmonic <b>rectangular</b> <b>wells</b> and barriers. The integration of energies is obtained by solving a simple transcendental equation. Scattering states are shown to include {{cases in which}} the impinging particle is 'captured' by the semi-harmonic rectangular potentials. The 'time of capture' is connected with the dwell time of the scattered wave. Using the particle absorption method, it is shown that the dwell time τ^a_D coincides with the phase time τ_W of Eisenbud and Wigner, calculated as the energy derivative of the reflected wave phase shift. Analytical expressions are derived for the phase time τ_W of the semi-harmonic delta well and barrier potentials...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a quantum confinement {{model for the}} electrical transport, the phototransport and the photoluminescence phenomena in nanocrystalline silicon.

Previous microstructure investigations have shown that the nanocrystalline porous silicon is formed by a nanowire network, so that the electron Hamiltonian is the sum of a one-dimensional Bloch-like Hamiltonian and a two-dimensional infinite <b>rectangular</b> quantum <b>well.</b> In the case of the silicon nanodots, the quantum well is three-dimensional.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} different well shapes on the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the efficiency droop in wide-well InGaN/GaN double-heterostructure light-emitting diodes. For forward current densities in the measurement range of greater than 135 [*]A/cm 2, the device featuring a trapezoidal well exhibited improved EQEs and alleviative efficiency droop, relative {{to those of the}} device featuring a <b>rectangular</b> <b>well.</b> The decreased Auger loss has been proposed as the main reason for the greater maximum efficiency that occurred at high current density (> 50 [*]A/cm 2). For the devices incorporating trapezoidal and rectangular wells, the EQEs at 200 [*]A/cm 2 decreased by 14 and 40 %, respectively, from their maximum values, resulting in the EQE at a current density of 200 [*]A/cm 2 of the device featuring a trapezoidal well being 17. 5 % greater than that featuring a <b>rectangular</b> <b>well.</b> These results suggest that, in addition to the decreased Auger loss, the alleviation in efficiency droop at higher current densities might be due to higher internal quantum efficiency resulted from the improved carrier injection efficiency of the trapezoidal well...|$|E

40|$|The linear and {{nonlinear}} intersubband optical absorptions in Al xl Ga 1 -xl As/GaAs/Al xr Ga 1 -xr As asymmetric <b>rectangular</b> quantum <b>well</b> are studied {{within the}} framework of the density matrix formalism. We have calculated the electron energy levels and the envelope wave functions using the effective mass approach. In addition, we have obtained an expression for saturation intensity. It is shown that the parameters such as asymmetry and width of potential well not only shift the peak positions in absorption spectrum but also considerably modify their height. These results suggest that the absorption process can be easily controlled by the structure parameters of an asymmetric <b>rectangular</b> quantum <b>well.</b> Also, the incident optical intensity has a great effect on the total absorption spectrum. We have seen that the absorption peak is reduced by half when the optical intensity is approximately 0. 8  MW/cm 2 for well width L= 90  Å and β= 0. 5. Moreover, it is seen that the saturation intensity is quite sensitive to the structure parameters of an asymmetric <b>rectangular</b> quantum <b>well.</b> Thus, the results presented here can be useful for electro-optical modulators and photodetectors in the infrared region.

The contribution to the bremsstrahlung emission from the different regions in tunneling is investigated using realistic double folded nuclear and Coulomb potentials.

However, for typical InGaN-based devices which are grown on c-plane, {{it is well known}} that there exists a large electric field caused by spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization effect, which affects the electrical and optical properties of the devices significantly [1, 2]. The polarization effect leads to inclined quantum wells, from which the emission wavelength is red-shifted. Due to the large polarization field strength in the quantum wells (usually in the order of MV/cm), the quantum levels in the triangular wells are quite different from the case of the <b>rectangular</b> <b>wells.</b> It is worth noting here that the change in the polarization field can be reflected in the emission wavelength.
