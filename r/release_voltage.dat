40|$|The {{cellular}} mechanisms governing cardiac atrial pacemaker {{activity are}} not clear. In {{the present study}} we used perforated patch voltage clamp and confocal fluorescence microscopy to study the contribution of intracellular Ca 2 + release to automaticity of pacemaker cells isolated from cat right atrium. In spontaneously beating pacemaker cells, an increase in subsarcolemmal intracellular Ca 2 + concentration occurred concomitantly with {{the last third of}} diastolic depolarization due to local release of Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), i. e. Ca 2 + sparks. Nickel (Ni 2 +; 25 – 50 μM), a blocker of low voltage-activated T-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,T), decreased diastolic depolarization, prolonged pacemaker cycle length and suppressed diastolic Ca 2 + <b>release.</b> <b>Voltage</b> clamp analysis indicated that the diastolic Ca 2 + release was voltage dependent and triggered at about - 60 mV. Ni 2 + suppressed low voltage-activated Ca 2 + release. Moreover, low voltage-activated Ca 2 + release was paralleled by a slow inward current presumably due to stimulation of Na+–Ca 2 + exchange (INa-Ca). Low voltage-activated Ca 2 + release was found in both sino-atrial node and latent atrial pacemaker cells but not in working atrial myocytes. These findings suggest that low voltage-activated ICa,T triggers subsarcolemmal Ca 2 + sparks, which in turn stimulate INa-Ca to depolarize the pacemaker potential to threshold. This novel mechanism indicates a pivotal role for ICa,T and subsarcolemmal intracellular Ca 2 + release in normal atrial pacemaker activity and may {{contribute to the development of}} ectopic atrial arrhythmias...|$|E
40|$|We used {{confocal}} Ca 2 + {{imaging and}} the patch-clamp technique {{to investigate the}} interplay between Ca 2 + entries through L-type Ca 2 + channels (LCCs) and reverse-mode Na+–Ca 2 + exchange (NCX) in activating Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiac myocytes from normal and failing rat hearts. In normal myocytes exposed to N(6), 2 ′-O-dibutyryl adenosine- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (db-cAMP, membrane-permeable form of cAMP), the bell-shaped voltage dependence of cytosolic Ca 2 + transients was dramatically broadened due to activation of SR Ca 2 + release at high membrane potentials (30 – 120 mV). This broadening of Ca 2 +-transient voltage dependence could be prevented by KB-R 7943, an inhibitor of the reverse-mode NCX. Trans-sarcolemmal Ca 2 + entries were measured fluorometrically in myocytes during depolarizing steps to high membrane potentials. The total Ca 2 + entry (ΔFTot) was separated into two Ca 2 + entry components, LCC-mediated (ΔFLCC) and NCX-mediated (ΔFNCX), by exposing the cells to the specific inhibitors of LCCs and reverse-mode NCX, nifedipine and KB-R 7943, respectively. In the absence of protein kinase A (PKA) stimulation the amplitude of the Ca 2 +-inflow signal (ΔFTot) corresponded to the arithmetic sum of the amplitudes of the KB-R 7943 - and nifedipine-resistant components (ΔFTot=ΔFLCC+ΔFNCX). PKA activation resulted in significant increases in ΔFTot and ΔFLCC. Paradoxically, ΔFTot became ∼threefold larger {{than the sum of}} the ΔFNCX and ΔFLCC components. In myocytes from failing hearts, stimulation of PKA failed to induce a shift in Ca 2 + <b>release</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence toward more positive membrane potentials. Although the total and NCX-mediated Ca 2 + entries were increased again, ΔFTot did not significantly exceed the sum of ΔFLCC and ΔFNCX. We conclude that the LCC and NCX Ca 2 +-entry pathways interact synergistically to trigger SR Ca 2 + release on depolarization to positive membrane potentials in PKA-stimulated cardiac muscle. In heart failure, this new form of Ca 2 + release is diminished and may potentially account for the compromised contractile performance and reduced functional reserve in failing hearts...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents designs, fabrication {{processes and}} measurements {{of a series}} of high performance RF MEMS switches. Chapter 2 presents a miniature RF MEMS metal contact switch based on a tethered-cantilever structure. The miniature size and the use of tethers result in an excellent biaxial residual stress and stress gradient tolerance. The switch is built using thin metal process with a large biaxial stress and a high stress gradient (50 MPa and - 105 MPa/um), and works well under these conditions. In the up-state, the switch capacitance is 9. 4 fF and results in an isolation of 20 dB at 20 GHz. In the down-state, the switch resistance is 3. 6 ohm for a gold-gold contact under 30 V actuation voltage. The switch is compatible with CMOS back-end processing. With its miniature size, the switch could be placed in arrays to achieve lower contact resistance and higher power handling. Chapter 3 presents a multi-contact mN-force RF MEMS metal-contact switchwith a pull-down voltage (Vp) of 45 V- 50 V and an operation voltage of 60 V- 65 V. The switch gets a contact force of s 2. 0 mN under 65 V actuation voltage and a release force of s 1. 2 mN (simulated). The switch gets an on-state resistance of s 1. 8 with Ru-Au contact and an off-state capacitance of 13. 5 fF, which results in a figure of merit of 24 fs. In the temperature stability measurement, the switch shows a change of 4 V in pull-down voltage and a change of 2 V in <b>release</b> <b>voltage</b> from 25 C to 125 C. In the high power handling measurement, the switch demonstrates a reliability of > 10 million cold switching cycles with 5 W RF power. Chapter 4 first presents a high capacitance ratio (Cr) capacitive switch with continuous tuning capability after pull-down. The measured up-state capacitance is 74 fF. The pull-down voltage of the switch is 30 V - 32 V and there is an 8. 4 % linear tuning range from 33 V to 40 V actuation voltage. The measured down-state capacitance is 1296 fF under 40 V actuation voltage, resulting in a Cr of 17. 5. Next, a back-to-back switch using the high Cr switch is designed to improve IP 2 without extra power supply. The back-to-back switch shows an up-state capacitance of 31 fF, a Cr of 19. 7 and a 6. 8 % continuous tuning range from 34 V to 40 V. The back-to-back switch shows a 14 dB higher OIP 2 than the single switch does...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a wide tuning range micro-electro-mechanical (MEM) capacitor. The two-gap MEM capacitor has a measured nominal capacitance of 1. 58  pF and achieves a tuning range of 2. 25 : 1 with parasitic capacitance. When all parasitic capacitance to the substrate are extracted the measured nominal capacitance is 1. 15  pF and the tuning range is 2. 71 : 1. The device {{is made of}} electroplated gold and has a Q of 66 at 1  GHz, and 53 at 2  GHz. In addition, a novel three-state capacitor is presented. Measured capacitance of the first, the second and the third state are 0. 86  pF, 1. 61  pF and 3. 68  pF, respectively. A novel temperature-compensated two-state microelectromechanical (MEM) capacitor is presented. The principle to minimize temperature dependence is based on geometrical compensation and can be extended to other devices such as continuously tunable MEM capacitors. The compensation structure eliminates the effect of intrinsic and thermal stress on the device operation. This leads to a temperature-stable device without compromising the quality factor (Q) or the voltage behavior. The compensation structure increases the robustness of the devices, but does not require any modifications to the process. Measurement results verify that the OFF and ON capacitance change is less than 6  % and the pull-in voltage is less than 5  % when the temperature is varied from − 30  °C to + 70  °C. In addition to the temperature stability, the charging of the dielectric layer is studied and a new continuous reliability measurement set-up is presented. This thesis describes important design principles of electrostatically actuated MEM capacitors. Key design principles, such as temperature compensation, calculation of mechanical properties, and calculation of electrical properties of MEM capacitor are studied in detail. A new design principle that describes how pull-in and <b>release</b> <b>voltage</b> ratio is only dependent on up and down capacitance ratio {{and not on the}} mechanical properties such as a spring constant is also derived. In addition, it is shown how the RF signal affects the voltage behavior of the MEM capacitor. Two-state, three-state and continuously tunable MEM capacitors are designed and fabricated using presented design principles. Modeling, fabrication and analysis of a truly three-dimensional high-quality-factor toroidal inductor using polymer replication processes is presented. The critical dimensions are in the micrometer range, and the applied manufacturing method is based on the polymer replication. Electrical measurements show that the inductor with an inductance of 6. 0  nH exhibits a Q of 37 at 1  GHz and a peak quality factor of 50 at a frequency of 3  GHz.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present control {{strategies}} for implementing reconfigurable planar microassmbly using multiple stress-engineered MEMS microrobots (MicroStressBots). A MicroStressBot is an electrostatic microrobot {{that consists of}} an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA) that provides forward motion, and a steering-arm actuator that determines whether the robot moves in straight line or turns. The steering-arm is actuated through electrostatic pull-down to the substrate initiated by the applied global power delivery and control signal. Control of multiple MicroStressBots is achieved by varying the geometry of the steering-arm, and hence affecting its electrostatic pull-down and/or <b>release</b> <b>voltages.</b> Independent control of many MicroStressBots is achieved by fabricating {{the arms of the}} individual microrobots {{in such a way that}} the robots move differently from one another during portions of the global control signal.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that jumping-droplet-enhanced {{condensation}} has higher heat transfer than state-of-the-art dropwise condensing surfaces by - 30 - 40 %.

Data from single adult muscle fibers of γ−/− mice are not yet available. In the present study, we performed voltage clamp experiments on enzymatically isolated mature muscle fibers of the m. interosseus obtained from γ+/+ and γ−/− mice. We measured L-type Ca 2 + inward currents and intracellular Ca 2 + transients during 100 -ms step depolarizations from a holding potential of − 80 mV. Ratiometric Ca 2 + transients were analyzed with a removal model fit approach to calculate the flux of Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca 2 + current density, Ca 2 + release flux, and the voltage dependence of activation of both Ca 2 + current and Ca 2 + release were not significantly different. By varying the holding potential and recording Ca 2 + current and Ca 2 + release flux induced by 100 -ms test depolarizations to + 20 mV, we studied quasi-steady-state properties of slow voltage–dependent inactivation. For the Ca 2 + current, these experiments showed a right-shifted voltage dependence of inactivation. Importantly, we could demonstrate that a very similar shift occurred also in the inactivation curve of Ca 2 + <b>release.</b> <b>Voltages</b> of half maximal inactivation were altered by 16 (current) and 14 mV (release), respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept of RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) tunable capacitors {{based on the}} lateral displacement of the sidewalls of a 3 -D micromachined coplanar transmission line. The tuning of a single device is achieved in multiple discrete and well-defined tuning steps by integrated multi-stage MEMS electrostatic actuators that are embedded inside the ground layer of the transmission line. Three different design concepts, including devices with up to seven discrete tuning steps up to a tuning range of 58. 6 to 144. 5 fF, (C-max/C-min = 2. 46) have been fabricated and characterized. The highest Q factor, measured by a weakly coupled transmission-line resonator, was determined as 88 at 40 GHz and was achieved for a device concept where the mechanical suspension elements were completely de-coupled from the RF signal path. These devices have demonstrated high self-actuation robustness with self-actuation pull-in occurring at 41. 5 and 47. 8 dBm for mechanical spring constants of 5. 8 and 27. 7 N/m, respectively. Nonlinearity measurements revealed that the third-order intermodulation intercept point (IIP 3) for all discrete device states is above the measurement-setup limit of 68. 5 dBm for our 2. 5 -GHz IIP 3 setup, with a dual-tone separation of 12 MHz.
