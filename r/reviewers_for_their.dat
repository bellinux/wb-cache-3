500|$|Andrew Shelton has {{suggested}} that Maria-sama ga Miterus [...] "reduced capacity for epic drama" [...] {{is due to the}} lack of malicious characters; he considers the series [...] "pure shōjo", mostly due to its character-driven storyline. Japanese <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> part regard the story as a revival of the Class S genre, and specifically a modern-day equivalent of Nobuko Yoshiya's Hana Monogatari. Hairston notes that Maria-sama ga Miteru emphasizes romance and emotion over sexuality, and it has a respectful treatment of its homoerotic themes. He describes the series as [...] "one of the most interesting and touching anime series of the last two years", adding that it is [...] "about self-discovery and self-acceptance." ...|$|E
500|$|Let the Right One In (...) is a 2008 Swedish romantic horror film {{directed}} by Tomas Alfredson, {{based on the}} 2004 novel of the same title by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also wrote the screenplay. The film {{tells the story of}} a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a vampire child in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, in the early 1980s. Alfredson, unconcerned with the horror and vampire conventions, decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, the 11-year-olds Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were chosen for the leading roles. They were subsequently commended by both Alfredson and film <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> performances.|$|E

50|$|When {{soon after}} that the Bristol branch of Sperry Gyroscope closed, Malcolm made a {{decision}} to concentrate fully on computer gaming. The firm New Generation Software he had founded kept producing 3D games for the Sinclair Research computers, and became synonymous with 3D gaming on this platform for some time. Some of his games were hailed by the gaming scene, but some titles occasionally drew criticism from <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> fancy graphics but poor game plot. After releasing 3D Defender and Breakout for the ZX81, Malcolm switched the development efforts from ZX81 to ZX Spectrum as the latter model hit the market. In addition to republishing the 3D Monster Maze, the new firm also released such game titles as Escape, 3D Tunnel, Knot in 3D, Corridors of Genon, Trashman and Travel with Trashman, Light Magic, Jonah Barrington's Squash, The Custard Kid and Cliff Hanger.|$|E
50|$|RateItAll {{was founded}} in San Francisco in 1999 by {{software}} entrepreneur Lawrence Coburn and one other creator with the following business idea. The Internet features {{a wide range of}} user reviews and ratings for numerous purposes including social networking sites and blogs. The business premise was to provide useful reviews to prospective consumers as well as compensate <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> effort. Since user reviews can be posted next to advertising, when people read the reviews, there is a chance that they will also see advertising beside the review, which may possibly lead to a sale or at least result in positive exposure. This benefits the advertiser. Since it is possible to track readership (of reviews and hopefully advertising) using Google's AdSense service, it's possible for advertisers to pay for this exposure through Google to RateItAll, and it's possible for RateItAll to share some of these revenues with reviewers to encourage contributions. Such was the business model.|$|E

5000|$|At {{one point}} in early 1991, FARMS claims that Signature Books {{threatened}} a lawsuit over several reviews of its books {{that appeared in the}} Review on Books of the Book of Mormon. The item which initiated the lawsuit threat was a book review published by Stephen E. Robinson, on Signature-published The Word of God: Essays on Mormon Scripture, in which Robinson blasted, [...] "Korihor's back, and this time he's got a printing press. In its continuing assault upon traditional Mormonism, Signature Books promotes with its recent and dubiously titled work, The Word of God, ...naturalistic assumptions...in dealing with Latter-day Saint belief." [...] Signature Books asserts that several of the scholars who participated in New Approaches considered themselves active and participating members of the LDS faith. The FARMS <b>reviewers,</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> part, considered these authors to be opponents to the LDS tradition. Signature management made an inquiry with the FARMS management, holding that such inferences were insulting and could be considered libelous. Signature then requested a retraction.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the early}} start and through its {{development}} {{up until the}} point of the theGlobe.com acquisition, Games Domain used a combinatorial management system incorporating internal office staff and external [...] "online" [...] managers to produce downloads and online publications. Dave Stanworth held the system together from his Birmingham office with programmers and some staff writers, while Games Domain Review internet writers from all over the world, showing talent and work ethic, were promoted to section editors of various gaming categories, called [...] "Zones", such as Role Playing Games (RPG), Strategy, Sport, Adventure and Action. Under these Zone managers (editors) were various freelance game reviewers. Section editors had the job of coordinating game <b>reviewers</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> subcategory, and for writing monthly editorials as well as contributing game reviews. The initial philosophy of Games Domain Review was that a reviewer should complete the entire game, and write a lengthy, honest review, regardless of marketing influences. For this reason, Games Domain was initially considered unbiased in its reviews of various games.|$|E
