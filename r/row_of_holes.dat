25|$|Their {{presence}} in the Mont'e Prama necropolis has been explained by Lilliu with two alternative hypotheses: the baetyls originated from a wrecked giants’ tomb or they are reproductions of more ancient specimens, due to a wish to preserve an ancient line of Nuragic tradition, {{in a sort of}} nostalgic commemoration. The double <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> noticed in one of the baetyls from Mont'e Prama, unattested elsewhere in Sardinia, suggests that these artifacts are the same age as the necropolis. Some scholars believe in fact that they were expressly produced for the Monti Prama complex.|$|E
500|$|During {{a period}} of {{aggressive}} acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of Britain's collection, it was acquired for the National Gallery in 1860 in Milan from the Guicciardi family by Charles Lock Eastlake for just over £120, along {{with a number of}} other Netherlandish works. Eastlake's notes mention that the works were [...] "originally in the possession of the Foscari family". The Foscaris were a wealthy Venetian family which included Francesco Foscari who was Doge of Venice at the time the work was painted; the dramatic story of him and his son is told in Lord Byron's play The Two Foscari, and Verdi's opera I due Foscari. There is no documentary evidence to substantiate the claim that the painting came from the Foscari [...] collection, and some art historians believe that representatives of the Guicciardis invented this provenance to impress Eastlake. Lorne Campbell considers the provenance [...] "probable", noting that a descendant, Fergio Foscari (1732–1811), an ambassador to Saint Petersburg, squandered his fortune and may have been forced into selling pictures belonging to the family. Campbell speculates that the painting was produced on commission for export to Venice, noting that unrolled linen would have been easier to transport than canvas, and that the <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> just below the upper border could be explained if it had been stretched, mounted and framed by someone other than Bouts or a member of his workshop.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coloration}} is dark brown, dark green, {{dark blue}} or almost black. The silvery {{interior of the}} shell shows a pale pinkish and greenish iridescence. [...] The exterior of the shell is smoother than most abalones, or may have low obsolete coarse spiral lirae and lines of growth. The shell is oval, evenly convex, the two sides equally curved. The back of the shell is regularly convex, with little algal growth. The shell is not carinated at the <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes.</b> The spire is near the margin. The cavity of the spire is minute, concealed or nearly so. The [...] muscle scar is generally not distinct. There are usually five to seven small, open respiratory holes, or pores, along {{the left side of}} the shell and the rims of the holes are flush with the rest of the shell. These holes collectively make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows. The columellar plate is not truncate below, sloping inward, its face concave. The rear of the shell is spiralled, and the mantle, foot and tentacles are black. The interior of the shell is pearly with pink and green iridescence.|$|E

40|$|Computational {{analysis}} of film cooling effectiveness using novel semicircular hole shapes with streamwise inclination of 30 o {{has been carried}} out. Pitch to diameter ratios of 3. 0 has been investigated. Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stoke equation solver FLUENT with standard k- turbulence model is used for simulations. Coolant to mainstream blowing ratios is varied from 1. 33 - 2. 0. It is observed that for the streamwise region x/D< 20 the centerline and laterally averaged effectiveness values from a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> semicircular <b>holes</b> are higher than that from a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> circular <b>holes</b> due to the less jet lift-off of coolant jet. For a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> semicircular <b>holes,</b> mean coolant jet heights are lower than that from a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> circular <b>holes.</b> Simulations for two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> inlined and staggered semicircular holes are also carried out {{and the results are}} compared with single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> full circular <b>holes.</b> It is found that centerline and laterally averaged effectiveness values from 2 <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> semicircular <b>holes</b> are much higher than a single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> full circular <b>hole</b> case at all streamwise regions at all blowing ratios tested. Among all the cases studied, effectiveness values from two staggered <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> semicircular <b>holes</b> are found to be highest.

40|$|Calculations {{were made}} of the film cooling {{provided}} by <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> around the circumference of a cylinder in crossflow {{and the results were}} compared to experimental data. The calculations and experimental data were for conditions that simulate most of those that are typical of air cooled turbine vane leading edges. Injection was from a single and multiple <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> located at different angular locations from the stagnation line. The holes in the rows were angled normal to the flow direction and at a 25 degree angle to the cylinder wall. The calculations and experimental data were for several constant values of blowing ratios for all rows and for different blowing ratios for each row, representing a simulation of a common coolant plenum supply to multiple <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes.</b> The calculations were made using a finite difference boundary layer code, STAN 5. Contrary to initial expectations that injection would trip the boundary layer flow into the turbulent regime, the results indicated that the high free stream acceleration apparently kept the flow laminar for holes in the first 45 degrees past stagnation. The trend in Stanton number reduction due to coolant injection was predicted with generally good agreement at the lower blowing rates, but for multile <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> agreement was poor beyond the first row...|$|R

He soon discovered that these air-holes were all the ends and mouths of long leaden tubes which doubtless carried air from some remote watering-place near Margate. One evening while he was engaged in the fifth investigation he noticed something like twilight in one of these dumb mouths, as compared with the darkness of the others. Thrusting his finger in as far as it would go, he found a hole and flapping edge in the tube. This he rent open and instantly saw a light behind; it was at least certain that he had struck some other cell.|$|E

Then {{he was going to}} bore a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> in the top of his box, near the front edge, with a small gimlet. These holes were to be about half an inch apart, and to be in a line about half an inch from the front edge of the top of the box. The wires were to be passed down through these holes, and then {{in the bottom of the}} box, at the points where the ends of those wires would come, respectively, he was to bore other holes, partly through the board, to serve as sockets to receive the lower ends of the wires.|$|E
60|$|We {{employed}} ourselves very busily {{during this}} time in making various garments of cocoa-nut cloth, as those with which we had landed were beginning to be very ragged. Peterkin also succeeded in making excellent shoes out of {{the skin of the}} old hog in the following manner: He first cut a piece of the hide, of an oblong form, a few inches longer than his foot. This he soaked in water, and while it was wet he sewed up one end of it so as to form a rough imitation of that part of the heel of a shoe where the seam is. This done, he bored a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> all round the edge of the piece of skin, through which a tough line was passed. Into the sewed-up part of this shoe he thrust his heel; then, drawing the string tight, the edges rose up and overlapped his foot all round. It is true there were a great many ill-looking puckers in these shoes; but we found them very serviceable notwithstanding, and Jack came at last to prefer them to his long boots. We also made various other useful articles, which added to our comfort, and once or twice spoke of building us a house; but we had so great an affection for the bower, and withal found it so serviceable, that we determined not to leave it, nor to attempt the building of a house, which in such a climate {{might turn out to be}} rather disagreeable than useful.|$|E

6000|$|... § 16. This second {{characteristic}} {{is a tough}} hardness, not a brittle hardness, {{like that}} of glass or flint, which will splinter violently at a blow in the most unexpected directions; but a grave hardness, which will bear many blows before it yields, {{and when it is}} forced to yield at last, will do so, as it were, in a serious and thoughtful way; not spitefully, nor uselessly, nor irregularly, but in the direction in which it is wanted, and where the force of the blow is directed--there, and there only. A flint which receives a shock stronger than it can bear, gives up everything at once, and flies into a quantity of pieces, each piece full of flaws. But a piece of granite seems to say to itself, very solemnly: [...] "If these people are resolved to split me into two pieces, that is no reason why I should split myself into three. I will keep together as well as I can, and as long as I can; and if I must fall to dust at last, it shall be slowly and honorably; not in a fit of fury." [...] The importance of this character, in fitting the rock for human uses, cannot be exaggerated: it is essential to such uses that it should be hard, for otherwise it could not bear enormous weights without being crushed; and if, in addition to this hardness, it had been brittle, like glass, it could not have been employed except in the rudest way, as flints are in Kentish walls. But now it is possible to cut a block of granite out of its quarry to exactly the size we want; and that with perfect ease, without gunpowder, or any help but that of a few small iron wedges, a chisel, and a heavy hammer. A single workman can detach a mass fifteen or twenty feet long, by merely drilling a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> a couple of inches deep, and three or four inches apart, along the surface, in the direction in which he wishes to split the rock, and then inserting wedges into each of these holes, and striking them, consecutively, with small, light, repeated blows along the whole row. The granite rends, at last, along the line, quite evenly, requiring very little chiselling afterwards to give the block a smooth face.|$|E
