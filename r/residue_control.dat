40|$|A {{ranking system}} for {{veterinary}} medicinal products and medicated feed additives has been developed {{as a tool to}} be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the National <b>Residue</b> <b>Control</b> Plan. In the context of food sampling and residue testing for the National <b>Residue</b> <b>Control</b> Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National <b>Residue</b> <b>Control</b> Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the {{veterinary medicinal products}} and medicated feed additives that might be prioritised for residue testing. However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the residue testing programme. Other factors which should be taken into account include issues such as evidence of misuse of veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed additives and changes to maximum residue limits in the specifications for particular veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed additives. In addition, the importance of multianalyte residue testing methods and dietary exposure need to be considered...|$|E

However, air pollution <b>control</b> <b>residues</b> are a by-product produced {{as a result of}} flue gas treatment, a key requirement for incineration. Air pollution <b>control</b> <b>residues</b> are classified as hazardous waste and are becoming increasingly difficult to dispose of in the UK due to tightening legislation.

Geopolymerisation offers advantages with regards to stabilizing heavy metals and has been investigated here as a means to reducing leaching rates of key elements in air pollution <b>control</b> <b>residues</b> collected from three UK based incinerators. The role of soluble chloride phases was also investigated by pre-treating the air pollution <b>control</b> <b>residues</b> with a washing procedure.

The influence of landfill gas and temperature on the release of trace elements from stabilized soil was simulated using a diffusion test. The air pollution <b>control</b> <b>residues</b> immobilized As through the precipitation of Ca–As minerals (calcium arsenate (Ca 5 H 2 (AsO 4) 3  ×  5 H 2 O), weilite (CaAsO 4) and johnbaumite (Ca 5 (AsO 4) 3 (OH)), incorporation of As into ettringite (Ca 6 Al 2 (SO 4) 3 (OH) 12  ×  26 H 2 O) and adsorption by calcite (CaCO 3). The air pollution <b>control</b> <b>residues</b> generally showed a high resistance to pH reduction, indicating high buffer capacity and stability of immobilized As in a landfill over time. Generation of heat in a landfill might increase the release of trace elements. The release of As from stabilized soil was diffusion-controlled at 60  °C, while surface wash-off, dissolution, and depletion prevailed at 20  °C. The air pollution <b>control</b> <b>residues</b> from the incineration of municipal solid waste immobilized Cr, indicating its stability in a landfill.

Due to the current problems with residues of CAP in shrimps, crayfish and prawns, a sensitive GC/NCI/MS method was optimised and validated using the in-house validation approach. The validation study resulted in a decision limit CCΑ of 0. 07 µg/kg, a recovery of 95 % and a within-laboratory reproducibility of 9 %. The method was used for preparing a proficiency test in order to get information on the quality of <b>residue</b> <b>control</b> in Germany. The proficiency test included five samples and the results were very satisfying. The reproducibility standard deviation of these five samples ranged from 17 to 24 %, the median concentrations lay between 0. 43 and 0. 51 µg/kg CAP.

40|$|The National <b>Residue</b> <b>Control</b> Plan (NRKP) is a {{programme}} {{of measures}} that monitor food-stuffs of animal origin {{at different levels of}} production in regard to residues of undesirable substances. The <b>residue</b> <b>control</b> plan for third-country imports (ERKP) monitors animal prod-ucts from third-countries for residues of undesirable substances. In many cases, maximum limits are defined for residues and contaminants that may not be exceeded in foodstuffs of animal origin.

40|$|For future {{targeted}} screening in National <b>Residue</b> <b>Control</b> Programmes, the metabolism of seven SARMs, from the arylpropionamide and the quinolinone classes, was studied in vitro using S 9 bovine liver enzymes. Metabolites were detected and identified with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToF-MS) and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS). Several metabolites {{were identified and}} results were compared with literature data on metabolism using a human cell line. Monohydroxylation, nitro-reduction, dephenylation and demethylation were the main S 9 in vitro metabolic routes established. Next, an in vivo study was performed by oral administration of the arylpropionamide ostarine to a male calf and urine samples were analysed with UPLC-QToF-MS. Apart from two metabolites resulting from hydroxylation and dephenylation that were also observed in the in vitro study, the bovine in vivo metabolites of ostarine resulted in glucuronidation, sulfation and carboxylation, combined with either a hydroxylation or a dephenylation step. As the intact mother compounds of all SARMs tested are the main compounds present after in vitro incubations, and ostarine is still clearly present in the urine after the in vivo metabolism study in veal calves, the intact mother molecules were selected as the indicator to reveal treatment. The analytical UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS procedure was validated for three commercially available arylpropionamides according to European Union criteria (Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC), and resulted in decision limits ranging from 0. 025 to 0. 05 µg l– 1 and a detection capability of 0. 025 µg l– 1 in all cases. Adequate precision and intra-laboratory reproducibility (relative standard deviation below 20 %) were obtained for all SARMs and the linearity was 0. 999 for all compounds.

The two proposed controllers have been simulated and tested experimentally to validate the control scheme.
