5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who {{saw it as a}} <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
5|$|In October 1933 Einstein {{returned}} to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, {{as a result of}} their Jewish quota which lasted until the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{area that}} is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams {{and was one of}} the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies of the United States. Williams and his company felt compelled to withdraw from Massachusetts Bay Colony. Providence quickly became a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> persecuted religious dissenters, as Williams himself had been exiled from Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|Drought <b>refuges</b> <b>for</b> algae are wide- spread {{because most}} med-river taxa can survive {{desiccation}} and show little specificity <b>for</b> <b>refuges,</b> provided drying occurs slowly. They include dry biofilm on stones and wood, dry leaf packs and perennial pools. <b>Refuges</b> <b>for</b> macrophytes and zooplankton typically comprise egg and seed banks in med-rivers and are resilient to prolonged drying.|$|R

5|$|The bramble (Rubus sp.) lie {{around the}} ruins {{and along the}} {{south-east}} of the site near the houses. Due to an interest in preserving wildlife (e.g. <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> mammals, insects, nesting wrens), they are not eradicated but contained.|$|E
5|$|The park is an {{important}} <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> other wildlife, including woodpeckers, squirrels, rabbits, snakes, frogs, toads, stag beetles and many other insects plus numerous ancient trees and varieties of fungi. It is particularly notable for its rare beetles.|$|E
5|$|The {{second son}} of Irish Catholic parents, Carroll was educated in France {{as a lawyer}} before {{returning}} to England, where he pursued the first steps in a legal career. Before that career developed, he secured a position as Attorney General of the young colony of Maryland. Its founder George Calvert and his descendants intended it as a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> Catholics.|$|E

5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|Leguat {{mentioned}} that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This {{may be the}} reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets {{would have been the}} last <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist Alexandre Guy Pingré visited Rodrigues during the French 1761 Transit of Venus expedition.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{became a}} prime tobacco {{exporting}} colony in the mid-Atlantic and, for a time, a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> Catholic settlers, as George Calvert had hoped. Under {{the rule of}} the Lords Baltimore, thousands of British Catholics emigrated to Maryland, establishing some of the oldest Catholic communities in what later became the United States. Catholic rule in Maryland was eventually nullified by the re-assertion of royal control over the colony.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is one of}} {{the last}} <b>refuges</b> <b>for</b> the Chilean huemul. In this also can be found species such as Andean condor, marine otter and cormorant.|$|R

5|$|Nasser {{played a}} {{significant}} part in the strengthening of African solidarity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, although his continental leadership role had increasingly passed to Algeria since 1962. During this period, Nasser made Egypt a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> anti-colonial leaders from several African countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo. Beginning in 1958, Nasser had {{a key role in}} the discussions among African leaders that led to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Pearl Harbor attack, in December 1941, {{construction}} began on a hardened bunker {{to the east}} of the White House grounds that would provide a secure <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> the president {{in the event of an}} air raid against the capital city. To hide construction of the facility from the public, the East Wing was built on top of the bunker. This facility would later become the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth's {{struggles with}} the Cossacks were being paid {{attention}} to at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began regarding Cossacks as a potent source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival and neighbor. Russian efforts to destabilize the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often {{raised the possibility of}} a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place of <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there.|$|E

5|$|The Old Crow Flats and basin {{was one of}} {{the areas}} in Canada {{untouched}} by glaciations during the Pleistocene Ice ages, thus it served as a pathway and <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> ice age plants and animals. The area holds evidence of early human habitation in Canada dating from about 12,000. Fossils from the area include some never accounted for in North America, such as hyenas and large camels. Bluefish Caves is an archaeological site in Yukon, Canada from which a specimen of apparently human-worked mammoth bone has been radiocarbon dated to 12,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created a haven for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E
5|$|The yamen {{building}} {{is made up}} of three halls. Originally the middle hall served the Assistant Magistrate of Kowloon's administrative office, and the rear block was his residence. After the government officials left the area in 1899, it was used for several other purposes, including an old people's home, a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> widows and orphans, a school, and a clinic. It was restored in 1996 and is now found near the centre of the park. It contains a photo gallery of the Walled City, and two cannon dating back to 1802 sit at the sides of its entrance.|$|E
40|$|Devising an {{evacuation}} support plan for handicapped {{people who are}} most vulnerable in disasters is a nationwide pressing need. Setting up <b>refuges</b> <b>for</b> the handicapped is thought {{as one of the}} evacuation support measures. However, the problem is complicated in making a evacuation support plan for the handicapped in disasters so that the progress is not well going. In this study, firstly distribution of <b>refuges</b> <b>for</b> the handicapped in Nagasaki City is evaluated with GIS, and secondly problems about evacuation support planning for handicapped people in disasters are structured. Finally, a new role of welfare institutions for supporting the handicapped in disasters is proposed...|$|R

5|$|Young Mallory {{prepared}} for a profession by reading law {{in the office of}} Judge William Marvin. Because of its geographical position, Key West was often sought as a port of <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> ships caught in storms, and was for the same reason near frequent shipwrecks. Marvin was recognized as an authority on maritime law, particularly applied to laws of wreck and salvage, and Mallory argued many admiralty cases before him. He was reputed {{to be one of the}} best young trial lawyers in the state.|$|E
5|$|A land {{of green}} fields for crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E
5|$|Calvert took an {{interest}} in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> persecuted English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606–1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.|$|E
50|$|In the 13th century, {{the king}} {{decided on the}} {{destruction}} of the three towers and their houses so as to eliminate all <b>refuges</b> <b>for</b> the Cathars. The castles, however, were rebuilt on the crest so as to make them less accessible to enemy fire.|$|R
50|$|The 1870 Education Act {{reduced the}} need for ragged schools and to reflect this the society changed its name again; this time to The National <b>Refuges</b> <b>for</b> Homeless and Destitute Children and 'Chichester' Training Ship. It closed the last of its ragged schools in 1891.|$|R
50|$|The {{catchment}} occupies {{an area of}} 4679 km2 and is {{bordered by}} the Archer River drainage basin to the south.
