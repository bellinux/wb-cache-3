The black-globe thermometer consists of a black globe {{in the center of}} which is placed a temperature sensor such as the bulb of a mercury thermometer, a thermocouple or a <b>resistance</b> <b>probe.</b> The globe can in theory have any diameter but as the formulae used in the calculation of the mean radiant temperature depend on the diameter of the globe, a diameter of 0.15 m, specified for use with these formulae, is generally recommended. The smaller the diameter of the globe, the greater the effect of the air temperature and air velocity, thus causing a reduction in the accuracy of the measurement of the mean radiant temperature. So that the external surface of the globe absorbs the radiation from the walls of the enclosure, the surface of the globe shall be darkened, either by the means of an electro-chemical coating or, more generally, by means of a layer of matte black paint.|$|E
