50|$|The toilets in {{the east}} wing are largely in {{original}} condition. Floors are glass mosaic with ceramic tile skirtings. Cubicle panels are terrazzo. Splash-backs to the hand basins and to the urinal are ceramic tiled. Walls are painted. Cubicle doors are painted timber with an unusual scalloped top and bottom. Towel rails and toilet <b>roll</b> <b>holders</b> appear to be original and match the door furniture. A number of the sanitary fittings appear to be original.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} case, {{the idea is}} that the toilet roll {{maintains}} contact with the door or wall as the roll's radius decreases. This provides enough friction to allow the user to tear off a piece of tissue. More sophisticated designs include a curved horizontal plate that covers the roll, thus removing the necessity of touching the <b>roll.</b> These <b>roll</b> <b>holders</b> can be used in both orientations, but may be difficult to use in the [...] "under" [...] orientation.|$|R

50|$|Methods of anal {{cleansing}} vary between cultures. If {{the norm}} {{is to use}} paper, then typically the room will have a toilet <b>roll</b> <b>holder,</b> with the toilet paper hanging either next to or away from the wall.

Toilets such as the Washlet, popular in Japan, provide an automatic washing function.|$|E
50|$|A toilet <b>roll</b> <b>holder,</b> {{also known}} as a toilet paper dispenser, is an item that holds a roll of toilet paper. Common models include a hinged length of wire mounted {{horizontally}} on a wall, a thicker axle either recessed into a wall or mounted on a frame, or a freestanding vertical pole on a base. In recent years, automatic toilet paper dispensers which automatically fold and cut the toilet paper are being installed in public toilets.|$|E

50|$|Film holders that adapt {{rollfilm}} to {{sheet film}} cameras are usually called film backs. Film backs for 4&times;5 inch cameras are particularly common - {{there is little}} point in taking 6&times;9 cm pictures on a 20 x 25 cm camera. Horseman, Linhof, Graflex, and other manufacturers have made roll film holders in 6&times;7, 6&times;8, 6&times;9, 6&times;12, and 6&times;17 cm formats. Some models can slip under the ground glass like a normal sheet film holder, while others require that the photographer replace the ground glass with the <b>roll</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hubbell Incorporated {{was founded}} as a {{proprietorship}} in 1888 by Harvey Hubbell II. Born in connecticut in 1859, {{he was a}} U.S. inventor, entrepreneur and industrialist. His best-known inventions are the U.S. electrical plug and the pull-chain light socket. He is {{graduated from high school}} and began working for companies that manufactured marine engines and printing machinery. During this time, he accumulated several ideas for new inventions, and in 1888 he set out on his own, opening a small manufacturing facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Hubbell's first product was taken from his own patent for a paper <b>roll</b> <b>holder</b> with a toothed blade for use in stores that sold wrapping paper. This cutter stand became a tremendous success; it was a common feature of retail stores that used wrapping paper in the early 1900s and remained in wide use into the late 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The Century Camera Company's catalog {{described}} the camera as follows:The Cirkut Panoramic Outfit {{is in itself}} a most complete affair, being {{made up of a}} camera which can be used in the ordinary manner for plates when desired and a Panoramic Attachment which is easily and quickly attached to the camera, thus converting it into a Panoramic Outfit. The Attachment in itself is much like an ordinary Cartridge <b>Roll</b> <b>Holder</b> in that it is made to use Eastman Daylight-loading Cartridge Film. In addition it contains the mechanism which, when the outfit is in operation, unwinds the film past a slot on a roller and in so doing exposes it {{and at the same time}} revolves the camera about on an axis, a special tripod and top being furnished. A pressure on the release is all that is necessary to start the motor — another pressure stops it, thus negatives of any desired length up to 6 feet with the No. 6 and 7 feet with the No. 8 may be made. A complete circle of 360 degrees may thus be photographed if desired. There is an indicator on the top of the Film Holder showing the exact quantity of film exposed and that remaining unexposed. By another very ingenious arrangement one is enabled to determine before exposure is made how long a photograph the view decided on will be.|$|E

But the multi-function wall doesn’t only support kitchen tools and cabinets. Knife blocks, kitchen <b>roll</b> <b>holders</b> and shelves can also be hung from its grooves. In addition, function boxes with hinged openings provide additional storage space, keeping all utensils, food, and herbs and spices close to hand.

Often referred to as “Australia’s Mrs Beeton” or “Tasmania’s Mrs Beeton”, she was born Marjorie Pearsall, in 1917, in the Tasmanian midlands township of Ross. In her self-styled career as a housewife superstar, she married three times and produced six books on cooking, home economics, craft, history and gardening. She published her signature household manual under all three of her married names: Marjorie Blackwell, Marjorie Cooper and Marjorie Bligh. A pioneer recycler, Marjorie has for several decades been renowned for her spirited campaign against useful resources being poured into landfill. Famous for never wasting a thing, she has converted thousands of used pantyhose and plastic shopping bags into reusable items. It has long been rumoured that Marjorie was an inspiration for Barry Humphries’ Dame Edna Everage. Marjorie lives in Devonport in a house that incorporates a small museum where she displays her handcrafts, scrapbooks and other treasures. She is 94 years old. ” [Danielle Wood 2011...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{associated with}} programing existing robots {{is one of}} the main impediments to them finding application in domestic environments such as the home. A promising method for simplifying robot programing is Programing by Demonstration (PbD). Here, an end user can provide a demonstration of the task to be programed, with a PbD "interface" interpreting the demonstration in order to determine low-level control details for the robot. A key aspect of the interpretation process is to make it robust to the noise typically included in a demonstration by the human. In this paper we present a method to help identify and eliminate any noise present in the demonstration. Our method involves two steps. The first step uses the demonstration to build up a partial knowledge of the geometry present in the task. Statistical regression analysis is used on demonstrated trajectories to determine equations describing curved surfaces in configuration space. The second step in our method uses the geometric information obtained in the first step to determine if there are more optimal paths than those demonstrated for completing the task. If there are, our method proposes these as the appropriate control commands for the robot. We show the validity of our approach by presenting successful experiments on a realistic household-type task [...] -changing rolls on a paper <b>roll</b> <b>holder...</b>|$|E
