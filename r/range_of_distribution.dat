5|$|Although not gifted with pace, stamina, physicality or notable {{defensive}} skills, work-rate, or tackling abilities, Pirlo {{was known}} for his composure in possession, and drew praise for his touch, technique, balance, close control, and dribbling ability, as well as his flair and creativity in beating players with feints during one-on-one situations, in order to retain the ball and create space. As a playmaker, he is highly regarded by pundits for his outstanding vision, awareness, and football intelligence, as well as his movement, inventive play, anticipation, ability to read the game, and his wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution,</b> which enabled him to play the ball first time and rarely relinquish possession, even when put under pressure; in addition to being capable of playing precise, short exchanges to teammates, he was also known for frequently attempting riskier and more difficult passes and is renowned in particular for his extremely accurate long-range passing, both on the ground or in the air, with either foot, despite being naturally right footed. He is considered {{to be one of the}} best passers in the history of the sport, and is also known for his accurate striking ability from distance. These characteristics allowed him to contribute to his team's offensive play with goals and assists.|$|E
25|$|Its <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> {{extends from}} the Pyrenees, across the Central Massif, the Alps, and the Carpathians as far as central Asia. It inhabits all European {{countries}} including Norway, where it appears rarely and only in certain places. A subspecies lived in Denmark, but is now extinct. A great number of geographical races and individual forms are distinguished in this extensive region. The most striking specimens include the dark race from the eastern Bavarian Alps (subspecies hartmanni); form melania has the most pronounced dark colouring.|$|E
25|$|Extreme {{temperatures}} present {{geographical constraints}} {{in the distribution}} of aquatic species, indicating temperature tolerance plays a role in the lionfish’s survival, reproduction, and <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution.</b> The abrupt differences in water temperatures north and south of Cape Hatteras directly correlate with the abundance and distribution of Pterois. Pterois expanded along the southeastern coast of the United States and occupied thermal-appropriate zones within 10 years, and the shoreward expansion of this thermally appropriate habitat is expected in coming decades as winter water temperatures warm in response to anthropogenic climate change. Although the timeline of observations points to the east coast of Florida as the initial source of the western Atlantic invasion, the relationship of the United States East Coast and Bahamian lionfish invasion is uncertain. Lionfish can tolerate a minimum salinity of 5 parts per thousand and even withstand pulses of freshwater, which means they can also be found in estuaries of freshwater rivers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} price determination by monopolistic sellers {{who know}} the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> valuations among the potential buyers. We derive a novel condition under which the optimal price set by the monopolist is unique. In many settings, this condition is easy to interpret, and it is valid for a very wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> valuations. The results carry over to the optimal minimum price in independent private value auctions. In addition, they can be fruitfully applied {{in the analysis of}} quantity discount price policies. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} optimal scaling and the {{efficiency}} of the pseudo-marginal random walk Metropolis algorithm using a recently-derived result on the limiting efficiency as the dimension, d→∞. We prove that the optimal scaling for a given target varies by less than 20 % across a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>distributions</b> for the noise in the estimate of the target, and that any scaling that is within 20 % of the optimal one will be at least 70 % efficient. We demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs even outside the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>distributions</b> for which we rigorously prove it. We then conduct a simulation study on an example with d= 10 where importance sampling is used to estimate the target density; we also examine results available from an existing simulations study with d= 5 and where a particle filter was used. Our key conclusions are found to hold in these examples also. Comment: New version: simulation study now on a real statistical example (confusing typos corrected...|$|R

In such systems the relative lamp power settings can be adjusted so that the lamps provide a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> power over the wafer; this is useful because the ideal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> incident energy varies according to processing conditions and changes substantially during a single process cycle.
