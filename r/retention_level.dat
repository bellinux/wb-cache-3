In the study, experimental models were used. The Subjects of the study consisted of fourth year students in the Department of Textile Education, Technical Education Faculty, who took the Guidance Courses. The Experimental group consisted of 55 students who were randomly selected. For the Experimental group, modular instruction style was used and for the Control group, expression-based (classic) instruction style was used. A Learning Style Scale, academic success test, and modular instructional design were used in this study. Two important results were obtained at the end of this study: 1.

50|$|Mucuna bracteata is a leguminous plant. It is a nitrogen-regulating {{plant that}} is used in agroecosystems {{operating}} around certain types of agricultural plant systems including: rubber trees, oil palm, citrus and coconut. M. bracteate is a cover crop which helps to cover and shield the soil from weeds or plants, {{as well as providing}} rapid growth for existing agricultural crops, preventing soil erosion, and providing nitrogen fixation. The Mucuna bracteata crop grows about 10-15 cm/day in conditions similar to those that rubber and palm oil plants thrive in. Mucuna bracteata grows in a warm and humid ecosystem, at a temperature of about 20-35 degrees Celsius, and consistent annual rainfall. Originating in the North Eastern areas of India, M. bracteata has been introduced into Hevea rubber plantations in India and oil palm plantations in Malaysia.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-one similar acrylic resin blocks were prepared and divided into three study groups: Group A (snap attachment) - 10 specimens, Group B (locator attachment) - 1 specimen, and Group C (syncone attachment) - 10 specimens. A single rectangular heat cure acrylic resin block with two implant analogs 22 mm apart was used with all specimens. Each specimen was subjected to 5500 cycles of insertion and removal in the presence of artificial saliva, representing 5 years of usage.

40|$|Orientation: The {{field of}} {{leadership}} {{has been extensively}} researched {{over the last couple}} of decades, with a particular emphasis on the different types of leadership styles. The most valuable resource that any manager works with is human resources. Studies have indicated that the way in which people are managed is influenced by the leadership styles of managers. This, in turn, influences employee behavioural intention, including intention to quit. Retention is, in turn, influenced by a number of factors, including remuneration. This study considers the relationship between satisfaction with remuneration and retention and the mediating role that a transformational leadership style may play in this regard. Research purpose: The objectives of this study were twofold. Firstly, to determine whether transformational leadership played a mediating role in the relationship between satisfaction with remuneration and intention to stay amongst artisans employed in the military. Secondly, to determine whether there were demographic differences for these findings. Motivation for the study: This study was conducted to determine whether a perceived lack or presence of transformational leadership influences the intention to quit amongst employees in relation to their level of satisfaction with their remuneration. In this way, the study may assist in determining strategies to improve artisan <b>retention</b> <b>levels.</b> Research methodology: The study was quantitative in nature. A survey research design was applied to collect data, using a questionnaire as the survey instrument, from artisans (N = 108) employed at a military unit in Pretoria. Main findings: The results revealed that the participants, regardless of gender or race, were generally unsatisfied with their remuneration. Transformational leadership was found to play a mediating role in the relationship between satisfaction with remuneration and intention to stay. Practical/managerial implications: Organisations should develop the transformational leadership skills of their managers in order to increase talent <b>retention</b> <b>levels</b> and reduce employees’ intentions to quit. Contribution and value additions: The results of the study could assist military base commanders in improving artisan <b>retention</b> <b>levels</b> through implementing effective transformational leadership development programmes. </p...|$|R

Determination of alpha- and beta-carotenes was made by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (conditions were developed by us) using spectrophotometric detection visible-UV at 470 nm; a RP- 18 column and methanol: acetonitrile: ethyl acetate (80 : 10 : 10) as mobile phase.

40|$|The {{retention}} of polystyrene and silica colloids {{that have been}} chemically modified is measured in several aqueous carrier liquids. <b>Retention</b> <b>levels</b> are governed by particle size and composition but are also sensitive to subtle changes in the carrier. Size-based selectivities are higher in aqueous carriers compared to acetonitrile. In aqueous carriers, retention varies dramatically {{with the nature of}} the additive, and for a given additive, retention increases with ionic strength, regardless of modifications to the particle surface. The role played by electrostatic effects in retention is studied by varying the ionic strength of the carrier, estimating electrical double layers, determining particle-wall interaction parameters, and calculating the coefficients of mass diffusion and thermal diffusion. Although electrostatic phenomena can affect mass diffusion and particle-wall interactions in carriers of low ionic strength (3 ̆c 10 - 3 M), such effects are not great enough to explain the dependence of retention on ionic strength. Therefore, thermal diffusion must be affected directly. Thermal diffusion is found to increase with pH, and at a given pH with the surface tension of the suspended particle.
