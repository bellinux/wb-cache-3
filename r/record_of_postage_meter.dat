25|$|A <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> is a {{mechanical}} device {{used to create}} and apply physical evidence <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> or franking, to mailed matter. <b>Postage</b> <b>meters</b> are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> <b>meters.</b> A <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> imprints an amount <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> was invented by Chicago inventor Arthur Pitney, receiving a patent for the invention on October 14, 1902.|$|R

50|$|In Britain unused {{postage stamps}} could be {{redeemed}} for cash {{at the post}} office. By agreement with postal authorities, a perfin stamp on a letter could be used only by {{the owner of the}} perfin. Therefore, a stolen perforated stamp would be of no value to the unauthorized bearer. Thus the use of perfins gave organizations better security over their <b>postage.</b> The demise <b>of</b> the perfin came about by the widespread use <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> machines which obviated the need for perfins.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a two-stage {{system for the}} recognition <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> values.

If the block recognition is not confident enough, a second stage tries to recognize single digits, {{taking into account the}} block classifier output for a neighboring digit as context. The system is evaluated on a large database. It can recognize meter values that are hard to read for humans. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{postage stamp}} afforded {{convenience}} {{for both the}} mailer and postal officials, more effectively recovered costs for the postal service, and ultimately resulted in a better, faster postal system. With the conveniences stamps offered, their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuries. Postage stamps during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail; however, {{by the end of}} the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use <b>of</b> <b>metered</b> <b>postage</b> and bulk mailing by businesses.|$|R
5000|$|In 1928, Frederick G. Creed {{developed}} a single-turn spring clutch (see above) that was particularly {{well suited to}} the repetitive start-stop action required in teleprinters. [...] In 1942, two employees <b>of</b> Pitney Bowes <b>Postage</b> <b>Meter</b> Company {{developed a}}n improved single turn spring clutch. [...] In these clutches, a coil spring is wrapped around the driven shaft and held in an expanded configuration by the trip lever. When tripped, the spring rapidly contracts around the power shaft engaging the clutch. At {{the end of one}} revolution, if the trip lever has been reset, it catches the end of the spring (or a pawl attached to it) and the angular momentum of the driven member releases the tension on the spring. These clutches have long operating lives, many have cycled for tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of cycles without need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication.|$|R
