The text of FRE 801(d)(1)(B) accorded not hearsay status only prior consistent statements by a testifying witness used to rebut a charge of <b>recent</b> <b>fabrication.</b> The Court reasoned that to properly rebut a charge of fabrication, a prior consistent statement would need to have predated the motive to fabricate.

5000|$|At trial, A.T. was {{six and a}} {{half years}} old and testified by short answers to leading questions. During cross-examination, the defense {{suggested}} that A.T. had fabricated the allegations against Tome because she wanted to go live with her mother. To rebut the charge of fabrication, the prosecution called six witnesses (a babysitter, A.T.'s mother, a social worker, and three pediatricians) that all testified to statements about the abuse that A.T. had made to them. The trial court admitted the statements under FRE 801, which reads: [...] (d) A statement is not hearsay if - (1) The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (B) consistent with the declarant's testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of <b>recent</b> <b>fabrication</b> or improper influence or motive [...] [...] [...] The Tenth Circuit affirmed Tome's conviction, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
5000|$|The {{link between}} the term [...] "Jayhawkers" [...] and any {{specific}} kind of bird, if such an association ever existed, had been lost or at least obscured by the time KU's bird mascot was invented in 1912. The originator of the bird mascot, Henry Maloy, struggled {{for over two years}} to create a pictorial symbol for the team, until hitting upon the bird idea. As explained by Mr. Maloy, [...] "the term 'jayhawk' in the school yell was a verb and the term 'jayhawkers' was the noun." [...] KU's current Jayhawk tradition largely springs from Frank W. Blackmar, a KU professor. In his 1926 address on the origin of the Jayhawk, Blackmar specifically referenced the blue jay and sparrow hawk. Blackmar's address served to soften the link between KU's athletic team moniker and the Jayhawkers of the Kansas territorial period, and helped explain the relatively recently invented Jayhawk pictorial symbol with folklore that appears to have been of even more <b>recent</b> <b>fabrication.</b>|$|E

Understanding the degree of toxicity induced by the unique cellular interaction of nanostructured materials is a major concern before utilization in biomedical applications[6 â 8].
