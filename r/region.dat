5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. <b>Region</b> One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the <b>region,</b> with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this <b>region,</b> and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. <b>Region</b> Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in <b>Region</b> Two than <b>Region</b> One. <b>Region</b> Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to <b>Region</b> Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this <b>region,</b> and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. <b>Region</b> Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E

40|$|Intrinsic {{disorder}} {{occurs when}} (part of) a protein remains unfolded during normal functioning. Intrinsically-disordered <b>regions</b> can contain segments that ‘fold on binding’ to another molecule.

From a convergence of three separate analyses, we find that for hydrophobicity, Ordered <b>regions</b> segregate from the other subsets, but the Ordered and FB <b>regions</b> group together as highly conserved, and the Disordered-around-FB and Other-Disordered <b>regions</b> as less conserved (with a lesser significant difference between Ordered and FB <b>regions).</b> FB <b>regions</b> are highly-conserved with net positive charge, whereas Disordered-around-FB have net negative charge and are relatively less hydrophobic than FB <b>regions.</b> Indeed, these Disordered-around-FB <b>regions</b> are excessively hydrophilic compared to other disordered <b>regions</b> generally.

40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} among four {{categories}} of protein flexibility: (1) low- 13 -factor ordered <b>regions,</b> (2) high-B-factor ordered <b>regions,</b> (3) short disordered <b>regions,</b> and (4) long disordered <b>regions.</b> Amino acid compositions {{of the four}} categories {{were found to be}} significantly different from each other, with high-B-factor ordered and short disordered <b>regions</b> being the most similar pair. The high-B-factor (flexible) ordered <b>regions</b> are characterized by a higher average flexibility index, higher average hydrophilicity, higher average absolute net charge, and higher total charge than disordered <b>regions.</b> The low-B-factor <b>regions</b> are significantly enriched in hydrophobic residues and depleted in the total number of charged residues compared to the other three categories. We examined the predictability of the high-B-factor <b>regions</b> and developed a predictor that discriminates between <b>regions</b> of low and high-B-factors. This predictor achieved an accuracy of 70 % and a correlation of 0. 43 with experimental data, outperforming the 64 % accuracy and 0. 32 correlation of predictors based solely on flexibility indices. To further clarify the differences between short disordered <b>regions</b> and ordered <b>regions,</b> a predictor of short disordered <b>regions</b> was developed. Its relatively high accuracy of 81 % indicates considerable differences between ordered and disordered <b>regions.</b> The distinctive amino acid biases of high-B-factor ordered <b>regions,</b> short disordered <b>regions,</b> and long disordered <b>regions</b> indicate that the sequence determinants for these flexibility categories differ from one another, whereas the significantly-greater-than-chance predictability of these categories from sequence suggest that flexible ordered <b>regions,</b> short disorder, and long disorder are, to a significant degree, encoded at the primary structure level...|$|R

40|$|Alongside the well-studied {{membrane}} spanning helices, α-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins contain several functionally and structurally important {{types of}} substructures. Here, existing 3 D structures of transmembrane proteins {{have been used}} to define and study the concept of reentrant <b>regions,</b> i. e. membrane penetrating <b>regions</b> that enter and exit the membrane on the same side. We find that these <b>regions</b> can be divided into three distinct categories based on secondary structure motifs, namely long <b>regions</b> with a helix– coil–helix motif, <b>regions</b> of medium length with the structure helix–coil or coil–helix and <b>regions</b> of short to medium length consisting entirely of irregular secondary structure. The residues situated in reentrant <b>regions</b> are significantly smaller on average compared to other <b>regions</b> and reentrant <b>regions</b> can be detected in the inter-transmembrane loops with an accuracy of ∼ 70 % based on their amino acid composition. Using TOP-MOD, a novel method for predicting reentrant <b>regions,</b> we have scanned the genomes of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens. The results suggest that more than 10 % of transmembrane proteins contain reentrant <b>regions</b> and that the occurrence of reentrant <b>regions</b> increases linearly with the number of transmembrane <b>regions.</b> Reentrant <b>regions</b> seem to be most commonly found in channel proteins and least commonly in signal receptors...|$|R
