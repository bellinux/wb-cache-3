For example, the Black-chested Buzzard-eagle, a large soaring species, was recorded six times, and it was neither recorded during <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects nor by Petersen et al. (2011), supporting our hypothesis that roadside point transects are better than <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects. In addition, the differences we found between methods were barely supported by statistical significance, and further efforts to compare these methods are needed before claiming superiority of one over the other.|$|E

Given their {{ecological}} importance, {{along with}} conservation issues, results from biased surveys may have undesirable consequences beyond the simple evaluation of raptor assemblages. Our {{data suggest that}} roadside point transects are better than <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects for recording abundances of raptors as well as rare and threatened species in open landscapes. However, studies that compare roadside point transects with other methods, especially <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects, in other open landscapes {{around the world are}} required to assess the generality of our findings. The effects of time of day, habitat features, and other aspects that could affect species detection also need further investigations to assess potential biases. Biased results have limited applications (Andersen 2007). Given that many sources of bias from roadside surveys are difficult or even impossible to avoid, we recommend that the ones that can be controlled (e.g., the time of the survey, sampled area, and number of observers) be standardized to enhance comparability of survey results.|$|E
30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that {{roadside}} point transects are better than <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects, at least for evaluating the abundance of raptors. Compared to Petersen et al. (2011), who surveyed one of the same routes (RS 020 between São Francisco de Paula and Cambará do Sul, Route T 3 in Figure  1), we found a similar richness (16 vs. 13). It was an expected result given that our analyses showed {{no significant differences between}} the two methods when assessing richness. However, during roadside point transects, we recorded about twice as many raptors (434 observations) as Petersen et al. (2011; 243 observations). Despite recording almost the same number of raptors (230 observations) as Petersen et al. (2011) during <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects, the conversion of the abundance to the number of observations per kilometer generated a large difference (2.09 ind./km vs. 0.12 ind./km). Unfortunately, such results are difficult to interpret because Petersen et al. (2011) provided no information on car speed, transect width, time of day, or weather conditions, features that could have biased the results (Fuller and Mosher 1987).|$|E
40|$|Road {{barrier effect}} {{is among the}} {{foremost}} negative impacts of roads on wildlife. Knowledge of the factors responsible for the road barrier effect is crucial to understand and predict species' responses to roads, and to improve mitigation measures {{in the context of}} management and conservation. We built a set of hypothesis aiming to infer the most probable cause of road barrier effect (traffic effect or road surface avoidance), while controlling for the potentially confounding effects road width, traffic volume and road age. The wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus was used as a model species of small and forest-dwelling mammals, which {{are more likely to be}} affected by gaps in cover such as those resulting from road construction. We confront genetic patterns from opposite and same roadsides from samples of three highways and used computer simulations to infer migration rates between opposite roadsides. Genetic patterns from 302 samples (ca. 100 per highway) suggest that the highway barrier effect for wood mouse is due to road surface avoidance. However, from the simulations we estimated a migration rate of about 5 % between opposite roadsides, indicating that some limited gene flow across highways does occur. To reduce highway impact on population genetic diversity and structure, possible mitigation measures could include retrofitting of culverts and underpasses to increase their attractiveness and facilitate their use by wood mice and other species, and setting aside <b>roadside</b> <b>strips</b> without vegetation removal to facilitate establishment and dispersal of small mammals...|$|R
50|$|Fragmentation has {{isolated}} the Reserve from other remnant patches {{making it difficult}} for species to move through the landscape. This places species at greater risk of local extinction by preventing range expansion and therefore decreasing genetic diversity and trapping species in areas without sufficient resources. Once a species becomes locally extinct re-colonisation through immigration across a fragmented landscape is highly unlikely. If species are forced to move across a fragmented landscape they are at greater risk of predation or collisions with vehicles; this is especially the case for species in the Reserve which is bordered by the Newell HighwayRoadside vegetation in NSW is now extremely important to the survival of many species that rely on them as the only corridors to larger remnants; this includes species found in the Reserve. Small remnants such as The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve and <b>roadside</b> <b>strips</b> are under increased pressure from edge effects as they have smaller interior habitats. The Reserve’s edges are linear and artificial making it more susceptible to degrading processes including severe weather events, erosion, insecticidal drift from neighbouring properties, select species dominance, grazing by neighbouring domestic livestock and invasion of pest species. Predation of bird nests along artificially created edges in Mallee is higher than naturally occurring Mallee edges. Gully erosion in the west of the reserve is a long-standing problem, caused by runoff from the cleared surrounding paddocks and the artificial drainage line to dams. The Reserve becomes a sink for the cleared surrounding landscape with topsoil disturbance and potential pollutants and seeds of pest plants entering the Reserve.The rest stop that has encroached into the Reserve from the Newell Highway allows easy access to the public. The area of the Reserve immediately adjoining the rest stop is regularly polluted by rubbish and is used as a toilet. Rubbish may attract introduced pest species to the Reserve, and general public access can increase the likelihood of fire with makeshift fireplaces evident.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{environmental}} awareness {{has made it}} necessary to plan new civil engineering projects according to sustainable development criteria. As regards the more specific case of transport infrastructures, the major environmental impact of roads is, undoubtedly, that caused by traffic noise. Obviously, the simple physical distancing of the sensitive receptors most exposed to the sources of noise is in itself a sure method of self-mitigation. However, {{it is clear that}} the hypothesis of direct physical distancing between source and receptors is impractical both for economic reasons (costs of expropriation) and the scantiness of non-urbanised territories bordering with the infrastructures. Any analysis of the phenomenon of acoustic impact must also include discussion on the need to extend the width of the strip pertaining to road noise, which is currently on the agendas of governments in Europe and other parts of the world. In Italy, for example, a recent government decree has laid down the widths of noise-abatement strips (varying from 250 m for major extra-urban roads and motorways, to 30 m for urban and local roads), extending the width of the limit of the true territorial impact of transport infrastructures. Therefore, the aim in the near future must be to project road infrastructures with “euphonic characteristics”, acting both on road geometry (sections in a natural or artificial cutting, tunnels, etc.) and materials (eco-technical, sound-absorbing, euphonic pavements, etc.). The goal may be more easily reached once the <b>roadside</b> <b>strips</b> are included within the concept of “road”, with the potential to mitigate the environmental impact of the infrastructure itself. A “widened road system” can be reasonably referred to, no longer means just the roadway but also strips of land of an adequate width on either side of the infrastructure, with truly self-mitigating characteristics with respect to the local environmental context. This discussion also covers the debate on the renewal of anti-noise systems for road infrastructures, specifically oriented towards minimising the environmental impact of the actual noise abatement systems and aimed at systematically increasing the sustainability of the new transport infrastructures during the preliminary project level...|$|R
30|$|Raptor {{distributions}} and abundances {{are poorly}} known in southern Brazil. Given that raptors have low population densities, methods typically applied to census birds are usually inappropriate for surveying raptors. Roadside surveys allow large areas to be searched {{at a relatively}} low cost and are often applied to count raptors. We conducted eight paired roadside surveys (roadside point transects and <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects of 54.5 [*]~[*] 58.6  km long) to assess the species richness and abundance of raptors in two grassland landscapes of southern Brazil and to compare results of the two methods.|$|E
30|$|Time {{and length}} of the survey. The time of day may bias raptor {{roadside}} surveys. Species activities supposedly change through the day, as reflected in species detectability. Hence, surveys could underestimate species abundances and richness depending {{on the time of}} day that the survey is conducted (Bunn et al. 1995; Vergara 2010). Roadside point transects take longer than <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects. Carrying out roadside point transect surveys that take nearly the entire day could bias abundance estimates of species that change activities during the day. In contrast, <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects can be conducted only during specific periods of the day, when raptors are expected to be more readily detectable (e.g., in late mornings when thermals and updrafts enable soaring flight; Fuller and Mosher 1987; Vergara 2010). However, changes in species abundance can be found even in a few hours; hence, the results from short roadside surveys (e.g., < 2  h) may have a greater probability of being affected by the time of day (Vergara 2010). Because raptors are less frequently detected when perched than flying in open habitats (Diesel 1984), we think that it is more appropriate to use techniques that increase detection of perched raptors, as the roadside point transect method seems to do, rather than those focused on flying ones. This could minimize time-of-day biases in estimating abundances of species when they are less active (e.g., resting).|$|E
30|$|Double counting. As birds {{frequently}} move, {{the longer}} {{the duration of the}} point count, the higher the probability is of double counting a bird. This can be a problem with roadside point transect surveys because much more time is spent surveying the same location than in the case on <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects. However, a couple of simple rules can be applied to reduce the probability of double counting. First, a minimum number of individual birds can be used as an abundance index per sample point, which is the maximum number of birds recorded at once. Second, one can reduce the probability of double counting by plotting all records in a sketch.|$|E

40|$|A lane {{departure}} {{warning system}} (LDWS) should give as much warning time as possible, while triggering few, if any, false alarms. In this paper, a virtual lane boundary based LDWS (VLWM) is proposed to approach this goal. VLWM allows the driver to drift beyond the physical lane boundary by adding a virtual lane boundary. Accounting for the driving habit of the driver, lane geometry, and the local driver behavior changes, the virtual lane width is determined using a fuzzy-logic inference method. When the vehicle is predicted to exceed the virtual lane boundary, an alarm is triggered. Real world driving data are {{used to test the}} LDWSs. Compared with time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) based method, the VLWM has a much lower false alarm rate, while their warning time is almost similar.

50|$|The Bucklands {{also had}} a brickmaking plant {{at the north end}} of Little Bucklands Beach near the old Bucklands Beach Yacht Club house in 1869.

Part bricks and field tiles can still be found at the {{northern}} end of Little Bucklands Beach, although many were buried by the dumping of material between the rock retaining wall and the <b>roadside</b> grass <b>strip.</b> It is possible that both bricks and field tiles were being made.

The brickworks closed in 1878, when Granger bought the equipment and moved to Whitford Creek.

30|$|Habitat effects. Habitat {{availability}} {{can affect}} distributions of species along roads (Austin et al. 2000; Meunier et al. 2000); hence, roadside surveys could bias estimations of population sizes and complicate assessments of species compositions (Hanowsky and Niemi 1995; Keller and Fuller 1995). An advantage of roadside point transects is that locations of point counts can be selected along roads according to habitat availability or restricted to specific selected habitats (e.g., marshes or crop fields), while <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transect surveys encompass all habitats along a route. Surveying each habitat proportionally to its availability could reduce bias due {{to differences in}} the probability of detection of distinct habitat types (Millsap and LeFranc 1988) or due to habitat preferences of individual species (Hanowsky and Niemi 1995; Keller and Fuller 1995).|$|E

40|$|Most highway-safety related {{research}} in the United States over the past 40 years has focused on major facilities (freeways, arterials, interchanges or intersections), or on specific treatments (traffic control devices, <b>roadside</b> barriers, rumble <b>strips).</b> Little effort {{has been devoted to}} a systematic assessment of potential safety improvements on low-volume rural roads, such as those administered by most counties, some states, and certain federal agencies.

30|$|Raptor assemblages were {{surveyed}} along four routes in July 2009 and March 2010 (Figure  1). Each route was surveyed using two methods (a roadside point transect and a <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transect) totaling 16 raptor surveys (four paired surveys per month). Each paired survey {{was carried out}} on consecutive days, or with a week interval between them, under similar weather conditions (e.g., cloud cover and wind speed) to minimize bias in the probability of detection of raptors caused by abiotic characteristics (e.g., traffic and weather). Survey routes were placed on double-lane paved roads (ca. 9  m wide, with traffic density at ca. 75 vehicles per hour; F Zilio personal observation). Surveys were conducted on sunny days with < 60 % cloud cover and wind speeds of < 20  km/h. No surveys were performed during rainy or foggy periods. Binoculars (10 [*]×[*] 42) and a 20 [*]~[*] 60 × spotting scope were used to identify the raptors sighted.|$|E
30|$|The {{efficiency}} of roadside point transects for estimating abundance could {{be related to}} better stationary scanning of the sample area for raptors rather than observers constantly moving along the route. The time spent scanning each unit of area (e.g., a hectare) in <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects tends to be shorter than when conducting roadside point transects, reducing the probability of detecting inconspicuous raptors. However, roadside point transects tend to increase the probability of individual detection, particularly of raptors perched in less exposed sites (e.g., in a tree with dense foliage, on a fence, or on the ground), where the sighting of raptors might be more difficult (Diesel 1984). Increasing the duration of the survey may compensate for differences in the probability of detection among species with different foraging behaviors. Most species, both those that usually soar and have active flight-foraging behaviors (e.g., vultures and the Black-chested Buzzard-eagle) and those that forage on the ground or from a perch (e.g., Savanna Hawk and Southern Caracara), were more abundant in the roadside point transects than strip transects, suggesting that the former is less sensitive to species behavior.|$|E
40|$|Background: Raptor {{distributions}} and abundances {{are poorly}} known in southern Brazil. Given that raptors have low population densities, methods typically applied to census birds are usually inappropriate for surveying raptors. Roadside surveys allow large areas to be searched {{at a relatively}} low cost and are often applied to count raptors. We conducted eight paired roadside surveys (roadside point transects and <b>roadside</b> <b>strip</b> transects of 54. 5 ~ 58. 6 km long) to assess the species richness and abundance of raptors in two grassland landscapes of southern Brazil and to compare results of the two methods. Results: In total, 1, 890 observations of 18 raptor species (118. 13 individuals (ind.) /transect) were recorded. Raptor abundances {{were higher in the}} altitudinal grasslands (299. 25 ± 48. 91 ind. /transect) than in the coastal plain (86. 63 ± 44. 04 ind. /transect). Abundances were higher when raptors were surveyed with point transects (9. 38 ind. · [10 km 2]− 1 · h− 1) than with strip transects (3. 55 ind. · [10 km 2] − 1 · h− 1). No significant differences were found in relation to species richness, although five species were exclusively recorded with point transects versus one with strip transects. Conclusions: Roadside point transects may reduce bias due to differences in species detection caused by habitat features and in abundance estimates resulting from survey habitat being disproportional to their availability. Point counts may enhance the quality of the search for raptors in a surveyed area, increasing the detection probability. The choice of survey method depends on the objectives of the study, but our results favor the use of point transects rather than strip transects to survey raptors in open landscapes...|$|E
