50|$|The Justice Jaganmohan Reddy Commission of Enquiry {{was set up}} by the Government of Gujarat's Home Department. It {{published}} a report in 1971, questioning the police's role in the riots. It found around six instances of Muslim religious places adjoining police lines or police stations being attacked or damaged. The police defended themselves claiming these police stations did not have adequate strength since the forces were busy quelling the riots at other places. However, the Commission refused to entertain this argument, since there was no <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to a Hindu place of worship near any police station. Overall, 37 mosques, 50 dargahs, 6 kabristans (Muslim graveyards) and 3 temples were destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Scarabaeidae {{defoliators}} {{are considered}} {{of great importance}} in Brazil because they seriously damage the leaf system of several plant species. The objective {{of this study was}} to report the occurrence of the defoliating beetle Bolax campicola Machatschke, 1974 (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) attacking ornamental plants in the urban area of municipality of Forestal, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The initial attack was observed on the ornamental palm species Dypsis lutescens (Arecaceae) whose leaves were completely consumed, and then these insects began to feed on Canna indica (Cannaceae), another ornamental species, which was found near to the first. However, in the same location newly planted fruit tree seedlings of Plinia trunciflora (Myrtaceae), Averrhoa carambola (Oxalidaceae) and Malpighia emarginata (Malpighiaceae) were attacked and completely defoliated. This <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to plants in urban areas by B. flavolineatus demonstrates the need for studies on the behavior and feeding preference of these insects, and even their ability to adapt to different host plants...|$|E
40|$|Atypical scab-like {{symptoms}} were {{reported for the}} first time in 2007 in the south of France on fruits of apple cultivars carrying the Rvi 6 (=Vf) major resistance gene to Venturia inaequalis. With microscopic observations, nucleotide sequence data and pathological tests, it was shown that the causal agent was Venturia asperata. Scanning electron microscopy was used to compare its infection process and conidiogenesis to those of Venturia inaequalis on apple and Venturia pirina on pear. Venturia asperata produced fewer hyphae and fewer spores than the two other Venturia species, and resulted in weaker symptoms. This fungal species was previously described as a saprotroph on apple leaf litter. This is the first <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> on apple fruits caused by V.  asperata. Changes in host and cultural practices may have created a new context favourable for the emergence of this pathogen. It was also detected on symptomless leaves and on overwintered leaves on the ground. Pseudothecia developed on overwintered leaves and released ascospores over a 2 -month period from the end of March until the end of May, suggesting that the fungus is able to survive from season to season. However, it is not yet known if this new disease will establish over coming years and become an emergent disease...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of the tuna long line fishery in the Indian Ocean in 1952, an annual average of 10 % of the number of tunas and spear fishes caught continues to be damaged by sharks. In {{spite of the fact that}} this method of fishing for tunas is also resulting in the exploitation of a significant quantity of the tuna-preying sharks, the extent of the damage by these predators continues to be fairly constant. Quite often the damaged tunas are acceptable to the market, especially for canning. On the other hand <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> caused by killer-whales, occasional at the beginning of the fishery in the Indian Ocean, has been increasing in frequency each year and since 1960 tuna fishermen have been desperately calling for ways and means of reducing the damage caused by these mammals. Unlike sharks killer-whales do not get hooked on the tuna long line; and tunas damaged by killer-whales are almost always unfit even for canning. The problem of predation by killer-whales exists not only in the whole of the Indian Ocean including the Timor and Banda Seas but also in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, especially in the seas around New Guinea, Samoa, Caroline and Marshal Islands. The seriousness of this problem of predation was highlighted at the annual tuna research conference held in Kochi, Japan, in February 1963, and steps were taken to devote considerable attention to this problem...|$|E
40|$|Southern Arizona and {{southern}} California are economically competing regions {{with regard to}} production of ornamental cacti and succulents for sale throughout the United States. Economics of field -production vs greenhouse- production are discussed for both regions. Comparatively few cacti and succulents are field -produced in Arizona because few ornamental selections have been located which can economically be produced in the open considering {{the rigors of the}} desert environment. The Golden Torch Cactus (Trichocereus spachianus (Lem.) Ricc.) represents a promising nursery crop for field production in southern Arizona but has four seemingly unrelated problems. These problems are all shown to result from damage to Trichocereus by a single species of Cerambycid beetle, with damage to the cactus occurring throughout the life cycle of the beetle. Despite such an intimate relationship between beetle and Trichocereus, and although the beetle seems more destructive to Trichocereus than to native North American cacti, the beetle, far from proving to be an Argentinian introduction like Trichocereus, actually belongs to the genus of native Opuntia Borer (Moneilema), associated with Cholla and Prickly Pear in North America since the classic observations by Thomas Say on Major Long's 1819 - 20 expedition to the Rocky Mountains. Although the present article is thought to be the first <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to Trichocereus by Moneilema, the degree to which we have found Trichocereus in Arizona to be infested suggests a rather long- standing condition. Specifically, we report Moneilema gigas LeConte to cause the following pathologic conditions in Trichocereus spachianus in Arizona: 1) bacterial and fungal rot of deep internal tissues, 2) external chewing disfiguration by adult beetles, 3) sporadic growth spurts making disfiguring constrictions of the stem, and 4) hollowing out of stems by boring larvae. Possible reasons for the virulence of Moneilema gigas in attacking Trichocereus are discussed. With the knowledge that four major problems associated with Trichocereus cultivation in Arizona actually result from infestation by a single beetle species, and with the possibility of controlling this insect pest, commercial field -production of the cactus in southern Arizona may finally prove economically rewarding...|$|E
