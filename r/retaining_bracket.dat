40|$|A good {{adhesive}} is {{an important}} factor to consider in orthodontic bonding. Frequent bracket failure prolongs treatment duration and causes inconvenience to patient and operator. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two bonding agents, i. e. the self etching primer (SEP) and the conventional etch and bond (CEB) by monitoring the incidence, time and sites of bracket failure. Eighty orthodontic patients were recruited after informed consent were obtained. A randomized split mouth technique was used where one side was bonded with CEB agent, while the other side was bonded using SEP agent. All bonded brackets were examined every 4 weeks for 20 months. Incidence of bracket failure was noted and comparison between the two groups was done using paired t-test. Time and frequent site of failure were also assessed. Out of 1314 brackets, only 33 brackets were debonded with 16 from SEP group and 17 from CEB group which statistically insignificant (p> 0. 05). Almost 55 % of bracket failure occurred during the first 3 months after bonding for both adhesives with lower premolars was most the frequent site to fail in both adhesives (39. 4 %). Bracket bonded on the left side failed significantly compared to the right side. In conclusion, both self-etching primer and conventional acid-etch bonding agents are equally effective in <b>retaining</b> <b>brackets</b> clinically. Bracket failure mostly occurres during the first 3 months after bonding. The premolar brackets and the left side are mostly debonded when compared to other sites...|$|R

30|$|The FE {{analysis}} {{supported the}} results of in vitro tests {{for each type of}} bracket tested in that the higher maximum principal stress resulted in lower bond strength (Figures  3, 4, 5; Table  3). Moreover, regarding the type of bracket material, ceramic brackets revealed the highest bond strength values in all testing modes compared with the other types of brackets, and the FE analysis also supported this finding to a great extent. Ceramic brackets have demonstrated higher bond strengths when compared with metallic brackets in previous studies [21, 22]. The bond strength values reported in the present study for ceramic brackets were 12.05, 15.25, and 21.76 MPa (Table  3), which are in agreement with the previously reported values of 10.4, 13.27, and 21.67  MPa [4, 23, 24]. However, {{it has been reported that}} increased bond strength with ceramic brackets resulted in bond failure at the enamel surface, rather than at the bracket-adhesive interface, resulting in more enamel fractures [21, 22]. Nevertheless, other studies evaluated the bond strengths of ceramic brackets with different retention mechanisms and found that mechanically <b>retained</b> <b>brackets</b> had adequate bond strength and caused minimal enamel damage [4, 25, 26]. Our study is in agreement with previous studies [4, 25, 26] as FE analysis showed that ceramic brackets presented with the lowest maximum principal stresses on enamel in all testing modes, indicating that negligible enamel damage could occur.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Decalcification of enamel during fixed {{orthodontic}} appliance treatment {{remains a}} problem. White spot lesions are observed in nearly 50 % of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. The use of fluoride-containing orthodontic materials has shown inconclusive results {{on their ability}} to reduce decalcification. The aims of this investigation were to compare the levels of Streptococcus mutans (SM) in saliva and biofilm adjacent to orthodontic <b>brackets</b> <b>retained</b> with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) (Fuji ORTHO LC) and a light cured composite resin (Transbond XT), and to analyze the influence of topical application of the 1. 23 % acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) on SM counts. In a parallel study design, two groups (n= 14 / 15) were used with random allocation and high salivary SM counts before treatment. Biofilm was collected from areas adjacent to the brackets on teeth 13, 22, 33, and 41. Both saliva and biofilm were collected on the 7 th, 21 st, 35 th, and 49 th days after appliance placement. Topical fluoride application was carried out on the 35 th day. Bonding with RMGIC did not alter SM counts in saliva or biofilm adjacent to the brackets. On the other hand, the biofilm adjacent to <b>brackets</b> <b>retained</b> with composite resin showed a significant increase in SM counts along the trial period. Topical application of 1. 23 % APF did not reduce salivary or biofilm SM counts regardless of the bonding material. In conclusion, fluoride topical application did not show efficacy in reducing SM. The use of RMGIC as bonding materials allowed a better control of SM cfu counts in dental biofilm hindering the significant increase of these microorganisms along the trial period, which was observed in the biofilm adjacent to the composite material...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that etching enamel with 37 % phosphoric acid for 30 s {{does not lead to}} detectable mineral loss when measured with transverse microradiography (TMR). DESIGN: An in vitro laboratory investigation. EXPERIMENTAL VARIABLE: Forty bovine incisors were used in the experiment. The crowns of the teeth were covered with acid resistant varnish except for a rectangular area on the labial surface approximately 10 x 12 mm. On the exposed labial surface of 20 teeth an enamel lesion similar to that used in the in situ caries model was induced. Twenty teeth were left without a lesion. The exposed area was divided into three areas of equal size. The control area (C) was covered with acid resistant varnish throughout the experiment. The first experimental area (E 1) was etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 30 s and a simulated bracket was bonded to the surface with composite resin. The second experimental area (E 2) was left exposed {{for the remainder of the}} experiment. The teeth were placed in a demineralizing solution for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h to replicate different cariogenic challenges. OUTCOME MEASURE: Mineral loss as measured with TMR. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the mineral loss between etched (E 1) and etched (C) areas of enamel. There were significant differences in mineral loss between E 1 and E 2 for the 48 h (p < 0. 001) and 72 h (p = 0. 001) exposures without a pre-formed enamel lesion. CONCLUSION: There is no detectable mineral loss with TMR when enamel has been etched for 37 % phosphoric acid for 30 s. The use of in situ enamel specimens with acid etch <b>retained</b> simulated <b>brackets</b> to investigate demineralization during orthodontics will not significantly affect the outcome compared with unetched specimens...|$|R

40|$|Variables for {{constraint}} free null canonical vacuum {{general relativity}} are presented which have simple Poisson brackets that facilitate quantization. Free initial data for vacuum general relativity {{on a pair}} of intersecting null hypersurfaces has been known since the 1960 s. These consist of the "main" data which are set on the bulk of the two null hypersurfaces, and additional "surface" data set only on their intersection 2 -surface. More recently the complete set of Poisson brackets of such data has been obtained. However the complexity of these brackets is an obstacle to their quantization. Part of this difficulty may be overcome using methods from the treatment of cylindrically symmetric gravity. Specializing from general to cylindrically symmetric solutions changes the Poisson algebra of the null initial data surprisingly little, but cylindrically symmetric vacuum general relativity is an integrable system, making powerful tools available. Here a transformation is constructed at the cylindrically symmetric level which maps the main initial data to new data forming a Poisson algebra for which an exact deformation quantization is known. (Although an auxiliary condition on the data has been quantized only in the asymptotically flat case, and a suitable representation of the algebra of quantum data by operators on a Hilbert space has not yet been found.) The definition of the new main data generalizes naturally to arbitrary, symmetryless gravitational fields, with the Poisson <b>brackets</b> <b>retaining</b> their simplicity. The corresponding generalization of the quantization is however ambiguous and requires further analysis. Comment: 40 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: More {{patients}} are seeking esthetic alternatives for their orthodontic treatment options, {{which has led}} to increased use of ceramic brackets in recent years. These brackets were marketed before independent scientific research was completed. Many of the early ceramic brackets used a silane coupling agent to allow for a chemical bond between the bracket and the adhesive resin. Early reports from clinicians of increased bond strengths and iatrogenic tooth damage after bracket removal were common. Manufacturers have made changes to their base designs, relying more on mechanical retention for bond strength. The goal {{of this study was to}} test the shear bond strength of two newer generations of mechanically <b>retained</b> ceramic <b>brackets</b> and compare them to a traditional stainless steel bracket. Materials and Methods: Two types of ceramic brackets, Clarity Advanced (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, CA), and Avex CX (Opal Orthodontics, South Jordan, UT) and one type of metal bracket, Victory Series MBT (3 M, Unitek, Monrovia, CA) were used in this study. Exemption from IRB Application was granted by the Marquette University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on 7 - 12 - 13. The shear bond strength of the three groups of brackets were examined after bonding to extracted premolars. Brackets were debonded with a universal testing machine (Instron Corporation, Canton, MA) in a motion parallel to the bracket/tooth interface. Each tooth and bracket was viewed under an optical stereomicroscope at 10 x magnification and given an adhesive remnant index (ARI) score. The one way ANOVA and Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s post hoc tests were used to determine significant differences in bond strengths, and the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney post hoc tests were used to analyze the difference in ARI scores. Results: Statistically significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) differences were found between the shear bond strengths of the Victory Series and Clarity Advanced groups, with the Victory Series having a mean strength of 199. 4 N and the Clarity Advanced having an average of 136. 0 N. Significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) differences in ARI scores were found between the Victory Series and both ceramic groups, with an average score of 1 for the Victory Series and an average score of 2 for both ceramic groups. The two ceramic brackets were not statistically different from each other in bond strength or ARI score. Conclusions: The shear bond strengths of the new generations of ceramic brackets are lower than those of the metal bracket tested, which suggests a safer bond to enamel. Further research on clinical debonding characteristics and behavior intra-orally are needed to support the in vitro results found in this study...|$|R
40|$|Arakawa and Lamb {{discovered}} a finite-difference approximation to the shallow-water equations that exactly conserves finite-difference approximations {{to the energy}} and potential enstrophy of the fluid. The Arakawa Lamb (AL) algorithm is a stunning and important achievement-stunning, because in the shallow-water case, neither energy nor potential enstrophy is a simple quadratic, and important because the simultaneous conservation of energy and potential enstrophy is known to prevent the spurious cascade of energy to high wavenumbers. However, the method followed by AL is somewhat ad hoc, {{and it is difficult}} to see how it might be generalized to other systems. In this paper, the AL algorithm is rederived and greatly generalized in a way that should permit still further generalizations. Beginning with the Hamiltonian formulation of shallow-water dynamics, its two essential ingredients-the Hamiltonian functional and the Poisson-bracket operator-are replaced by finite-difference approximations that maintain the desired conservation laws. Energy conservation is maintained if the discrete Poisson <b>bracket</b> <b>retains</b> the antisymmetry property of the exact bracket, a trivial constraint. Potential enstrophy is conserved if a set of otherwise arbitrary coefficients is chosen in such a way that a very large quadratic form contains only diagonal terms. Using a symbolic manipulation program to satisfy the potential-enstrophy constraint, it is found that the energy- and potential-enstrophy-conserving schemes corresponding to a stencil of 25 grid points contain 22 free parameters. The AL scheme corresponds to the vanishing of all free parameters. No parameter setting can increase the overall accuracy of the schemes beyond second order, but 19 of the free parameters may be independently adjusted to yield a scheme with fourth-order accuracy in the vorticity equation...|$|R
40|$|Previously, {{studies in}} the {{intersection}} of power and development have predominantly concentrated on power as domination; how powerful actors can force recipient countries into embracing specific policies due to economical asymmetries. Yet, {{with the introduction of}} the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) approach to development employed by the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWI), conditions on certain policies have decreased and it is said that the approach allows for country ownership as development strategies are written by the countries themselves. As a critical response, the conception of power is broadened here through the separate employment of governmentality theory and neo-Gramscian International Relations theory. They share among them a theoretical premise which allows for an understanding of power that extends beyond domination to the realm of discursive practices which, it is argued, allows for influence despite the notions of ownership and without power as domination. The object of this thesis is to suggest how the discourses of the PRSP regime can influence subjects whom they addressed. The two theories have different assumptions here. More specifically, the neo-Gramscian theory argue that discursive practice may render ideological issues as common sense why they can come to be embraced by subjects, whereas the governmentality theory assume that discourses can, perhaps without conscious recognition, reshape the very identities of subjects. The theories differences are <b>retained</b> and <b>bracketed</b> when a discourse analysis of the PRSP regime is conducted which concludes that the BWIs require that suitable skills are embraced by subjects appropriate for a good governed market economy. These skills are located to basic capacities in calculating, accounting and social capital accumulation. Thereafter a practical example of discursive practice in a capacity building mission is reviewed to explicate how these skills are actualized through training modules enabling influence towards preferred standards of the BWIs without power as domination. The two theories are brought in for a discussion on how these discursive practices may be understood according to their respective premises, but also to discuss the usefulness of these theories for studies of this kind. It is argued, among other conclusions, that the neo-Gramscian understanding of power as operating on the conscious level can fruitfully be coupled with the proposition of governmentality that powers also work on an unconscious level for understanding practises of capacity building. As concerning the weaknesses of the theories it is put forth that the neo- Gramscian theory suffers from an assumption of class identity presented as a “brute fact” before the realm of the political, whereas the governmentality theory suffers from an exclusive focus on discourse and leaves behind how different actor constellations may seek to appropriate discourses. To remedy these weaknesses, the thesis concludes with an argument that a combination of these theories can provide a lucrative foundation for further studies...|$|R
