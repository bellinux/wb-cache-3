[...] By 1852, the rank of purser was renamed Paymaster of the Navy, a distinct <b>rating</b> of <b>Clerk's</b> Assistant was created, for boys between 15 and 18, who took the same examinations on entry as naval cadets and had to serve for two years in the rank prior to promotion to clerk. [...] A [...] "passed clerk" [...] was appointed by commission and ranked with a mate, while clerk and clerk's assistants were appointed by order in the same way as midshipmen and cadets, and continued to live in the gunroom or midshipmen's berth. [...] In 1855, passed clerks received the title Assistant Paymaster, and in 1918, the <b>rating</b> <b>Clerk</b> disappeared when the paymasters received new military titles.

60|$|Mr. Medlin had {{a little}} rail round {{the top of his}} desk, and {{curtains}} on rods that could be drawn round it. He was a man of six or seven and thirty; with a long face, smooth shaven. He always seemed absorbed in his work and, when spoken to by Mr. Bale, answered in the fewest possible words, in an even, mechanical voice. It had seemed to Bob that he had been entirely oblivious to his presence; and it did not appear to him now, as he sat with a book before him, waiting for the clock on the mantel to strike five, that existence at Mr. Medlin's promised to be a lively one. Still, as there were boys and girls, it must be more amusing than it would be at his uncle's and, at any <b>rate,</b> the <b>clerk</b> would not be so formidable a personage to deal with as Mr. Bale.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{incidence}} of, {{and mortality}} from, malignant melanoma of skin in whites are {{strongly influenced by}} socio-economic conditions. Professional and administrative workers have the highest <b>rates</b> of all. <b>Clerks</b> and salesmen have higher rates than skilled manual workers, who have higher rates than unskilled workers. Women, when classified by the occupation of their husbands, show a similar relationship to social status. The biases of incidence data from systems of cancer registration, and mortality data from death certificates are different, and {{the consistency of the}} data from different periods and from different populations suggests that the relationship is real. The bulk of the data is from Britain, but there is sufficient from the U. S. to indicate that the effect is not restricted to one country. No consistent increase in risk was found in outdoor workers compared with indoor workers of similar socio-economic status.
