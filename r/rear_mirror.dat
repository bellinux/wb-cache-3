50|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{was added}} to the engine to lift power from 100 kW to 193 kW. The body was made from fibreglass, with carbon fibre panels and numerous air scoops leading to the engine bay. The front took style cues from Toyota's Formula 1 car, having a pointed nose and a front wing close to the ground with Formula 1 style wing-lets in front of semi-exposed tyres. The <b>rear</b> <b>mirror</b> was replaced with a camera.|$|E

5000|$|The drama was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} broadcast on April 21, 2014 at 8:30 p.m. but TVB decided to air TVS's mainland series Journey to the West 2011 instead to boast ratings, this caused controversy as Hong Kong audiences complained of the poor production quality of the [...] "Journey to the West" [...] series and didn't appreciate watching a mainland produced drama with poor voice dubbing instead of a locally produced Cantonese drama. <b>Rear</b> <b>Mirror</b> was then pushed back to be aired in August 2014 during TVB's Amazing Summer promotions.|$|E

50|$|For example, in a two-centimeter-thick {{infinity}} mirror, {{with the}} light sources halfway between, light from the source initially travels one centimeter. The first reflection travels one centimeter to the <b>rear</b> <b>mirror</b> and then two centimeters to, and through the front mirror, {{a total of three}} centimeters. The second reflection travels two centimeters from front mirror to back mirror, and again two centimeters from the back mirror to, and through the front mirror, totaling four centimeters, plus the first reflection (three centimeters) making the second reflection seven centimeters away from the front mirror. Each successive reflection adds four more centimeters to the total (the third reflection appears 11 centimeters deep, fourth 15 centimeters deep, and so on).|$|E

Chrissy is shown meeting a man driving a black car with a toy {{hedgehog}} hanging on the <b>rear</b> <b>mirror,</b> hedgehogs being another aspect of Ginny's drawing that Jerry believes to be a clue. Chrissy explains to Jerry that she met a wizard who gave her hedgehog candies and {{told her not to}} tell her parents they met. She figured it was OK to tell Jerry, since he is not her father. Jerry realizes this is the killer and, using Chrissy as bait, stages an operation, with Stan's help, to catch him.|$|E
5000|$|While racing, {{the player}} is offered a {{customizable}} 2D cockpit displaying various gauges, lap times {{information and a}} dynamic mini-map.

A <b>rear</b> <b>mirror</b> is also available, although quite expensive in terms of consumed computing power. An [...] "arcade" [...] mode, legacy of TORCS, is still maintained as of version 2.0; according to {{the authors of the}} Italian manual for TORCS, it is more suitable for the novice player of Speed Dreams.

50|$|The 3rd-generation Octavia is {{the first}} Škoda car to feature front radar and a {{multi-function}} camera. The radar sensor in the front bumper monitors the area {{in front of the}} vehicle and continually evaluates the distance, direction and speed of all nearby objects (not only traffic). This radar provides data for two assistants in the Octavia: Front Assistant (forward collision warning and emergency braking) and Adaptive Cruise Assistant (adaptive cruise control). A monochromatic fixed-focus multi-function camera is mounted on the windscreen in front of the <b>rear</b> <b>mirror,</b> and allows function of Lane Assistant (lane keeping system), Intelligent Light Assistant (automatic control of the high beams) and Traffic Sign Recognition (recognises and shows traffic signs on displays of both on-board computer and satellite navigation). Added to this, there are assists, whose functionality is based on evaluating data provided by ESC or steering sensors: Crew Protect Assistant (pro-active passenger protection), and Driver Activity Assistant (fatigue detection).|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Roman White and premiered in April 2013. It was filmed on the Santa Monica boardwalk and on Santa Monica Beach in California. Brad himself only appears during the video's final scenes, starting with the second line of the final chorus, at 3.5 minutes in. It {{tells the story of}} 2 kids, one male and one female, who meet on the boardwalk and spend the day doing various activities together, including having a tea party on the beach, going on rides, and playing and winning several games. When night falls, they are seen on a carousel together and the male lead is sporting a cowboy hat (possibly referencing a young Paisley.) The female's mother is then seen looking out her window, looking at her watch, and calling her in. She doesn't notice at first, but the mother eventually pulls her out. She then pulls her hand away from her mother, and goes to kiss the boy, before finally getting in the car with her mother (she is looking out the <b>rear</b> <b>mirror</b> with her hands in the air, referencing the fact that she wants to stay with the boy) and leaving. The video ends with a scene revealing that the whole video was a past memory, panning out to reveal that the boy was actually a younger version of Paisley himself. It ends with a note that the girl wrote in the sand, which reads [...] "S+B" [...] in a heart.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>Mirror</b> {{focuses on}} Anson Yiu Ngai Yan, {{appointed}} acting CEO of Yiu Gong {{after her father}} (Yiu Siu Bong) was taken ill, consolidating her position as CEO and winning over her family. Her increasingly perilous driving soon forces her {{to search for a}} driver, and Sunday Kei Yat Sing is soon appointed as her driver, being headhunted by Anson, with a promise of a place at a good school for his son, Kei Mong, who has numerous allergies and whom Sunday as raised alone for six years after his wife, Miu Man Yee, left him due to the difficulty of raising Mong. Anson soon restructures the company, but is at loggerheads with her fiance, Bevis Fong Tin Hang, who wants her to leave Hong Kong and start a new life with him in New Zealand. She initially postpones the wedding for six months, but after that, Bevis gives her an ultimatum- it's work or him. Anson realises that she {{has no choice but to}} leave Bevis. Just weeks later, she bumps into Bevis and his new girlfriend, causing much stress. She becomes much more attached both to Sunday, her driver, and her pet dog MoMo, who Elaine Fong Yi Lin, her step-mother, uses to challenge Anson. Anson soon realises her step-brother, Jason Yiu Ngai Chung's potential and sends him off on projects across the country, which Elaine mistakenly believes to be a sign that Anson is trying to get rid of him, as he was one of the other contenders to be CEO. However, when Elaine decides to finally challenge Anson at a board meeting, she is soon shocked as that very meeting, Anson soon declares her stepbrother Jason as full of potential and sends him off on Yiu Gong's biggest project, much to Gu Suk Yin, her other step-mother's annoyance as she wanted her son, Ryan Yiu Ngai Suan, the playboy of the company to take that project. Sunday and Anson soon bond and they decide to make a picture book together, with all profits going to a charity supporting those with allergies, taking into use Sunday's photography hobby and Anson's memory of bedtime stories she was told of as a young child. Within Yiu Gong, however, Yiu Siu Wing, Bong's brother repeatedly challenges Bong's investment in the Clean Water Project, calling it a scam, but Anson continues the investment, as it is what Bong wanted her to do. This eventually leads up to Yiu Siu Wing refusing to allow any more investment in the project through his financial department. This makes Bong leave the hospital just to force a vote which results in Yiu Siu Wing leaving the company.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{classical}} analysis of light interacting with a Fabry-Perot cavity {{consisting of a}} fixed (dielectric) front mirror and a vibrating <b>rear</b> <b>mirror.</b> In the adiabatic approximation, the returning light exhibits sideband symmetry, which will go away once the photon lifetime becomes comparable to or longer than the oscillation period of the <b>rear</b> <b>mirror.</b> When the oscillation period is short compared to the cavity photon lifetime, one must approach the problem differently, treating the vibrating mirror as a scatterer which sends {{a fraction of the}} incident light into sideband frequencies. With proper detuning, the cavity's internal radiation pressure could either dampen or amplify the vibrations of the mirror; the former is the physical principle behind opto-mechanical cooling by the back-action of cavity photons.
