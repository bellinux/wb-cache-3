2500|$|The M5A1 tanks {{employed}} by the ROC forces on Kinmen proved {{to be effective in}} countering the human wave attacks {{employed by}} the initial PLA landing forces, which were mostly composed of light infantry. ROC tank crews who had depleted their ammunition used their tanks as <b>road</b> <b>rollers</b> to crush PLA infantry. The pivotal role these tanks played caused ROC troops to give the M5A1 the nickname [...] "Bear of Kinmen" [...] (金門之熊). The PLA's initial landing force of the 244th regiment at Longkou (壟口) was met by three tanks (#64, #65, #66) of the 1st platoon, 3rd company of the ROC 1st Battalion, 3rd Tank Regiment. The #66 tank had broken down on the beach the previous evening after company exercises, and the other two tanks in the platoon had been ordered to stay and guard it while repairs were attempted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Comfort of the {{vibratory}} <b>road</b> <b>roller</b> is {{an important}} research title. A 2 -DOF non-line model is set up, which is more close to the actual situation of the vibratory <b>road</b> <b>roller.</b> A simulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK is carried out to validate this model and study its dynamic characteristic and analyze the motion laws of its housing and wheel. A kind of Magneto-rheological (MR) damper is designed which has been widely used in automotive and bridge damping in recent years, and applied to a vibratory <b>road</b> <b>roller</b> to control it. The control strategy uses fuzzy control. The {{results indicate that the}} damping performance of the vibratory <b>road</b> <b>roller</b> which applied MR damper is improved remarkably...|$|R

50|$|Ramjibhai Kamani pioneered many firsts for the Indian {{industrial}} sector, {{electric power}} transmission being one, the others being production of various derivatives of non-ferrous metals and alloys for use in specialized industrial applications viz. arsenical copper plates, cupronickel sheets and production of lead oxide and zinc oxide. Kamani Engineering Corporation (KEC) also manufactured a unique and innovative <b>road</b> <b>roller</b> with the trade name Tractmount — the design created a light-weight standalone <b>road</b> <b>roller</b> which could be easily transported in a truck and could be mounted on by a tractor for use at its destination. Several were sold all over India especially in hilly and mountainous areas where it would otherwise be difficult to lug a full-sized <b>road</b> <b>roller</b> up steep mountain roads.|$|R

5000|$|The {{final and}} decisive {{stepping}} {{stone in the}} pre-Matchbox era was a toy which Mr. Odell designed for his daughter: Her school only allowed children to bring toys that could fit inside a matchbox, so Mr. Odell crafted a scaled-down version of the Lesney green and red <b>road</b> <b>roller.</b> Based on the aforementioned size restriction, the idea was born to sell the model in a replica matchbox [...] - [...] thus also yielding {{the name of the}} series which would propel Lesney to worldwide, mass-market success.
