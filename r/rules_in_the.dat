5|$|Many of the <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sheffield game {{were adopted}} by {{and are still}} {{featured}} in today’s association game. Twelve changes {{were made to the}} FA code between 1863 and 1870, of which eight were taken from Sheffield Rules. During this period the Sheffield FA had significant influence over the FA and encouraged it to continue when it was close to collapse in 1867. The corner kick was adopted by the FA in 1872 and they restricted handling of the ball to the goalkeeper's own half in 1873. In the final negotiations between Sheffield and London the latter agreed to allow throw-ins in any direction in exchange.|$|E

Of late the club has become increasingly well-known inside the University and is no longer a society dedicated purely to members of Magdalen College.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of seasons}} played by Aston Villa Football Club in English and European football, from 1879 (the year of the club's first FA Cup entry) to the most recent {{completed}} season. Aston Villa football club was founded in March, 1874, by members of the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Aston. Throughout the 1870s Aston Villa played a small amount of games. At least one game, against Aston Brook St Mary's was played with one half under Rugby rules and the other under football <b>rules.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1880s the game became more formalised and in 1888, William McGregor formed the Football League with 11 other clubs.|$|E

40|$|Software {{systems are}} often model checked by {{translating}} {{them into a}} directly model-checkable formalism. Any serious software system requires application of compositional reasoning to overcome the computational complexity of model checking. This paper presents Translation-Based Compositional Reasoning (TBCR), an approach to application of compositional reasoning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of model checking software systems through model translation. In this approach, given a translation from a software semantics to a directly model-checkable formal semantics, a compositional reasoning <b>rule</b> is established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> software semantics and mapped to an equivalent <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formal semantics based on the translation. The correctness proof of <b>the</b> composition reasoning <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> software semantics is established based on this mapping and the correctness proof of <b>the</b> equivalent <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formal semantics. <b>The</b> compositional reasoning <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> software semantics is implemented and applied based on the translation from the software semantics to the formal semantics and reusing the implementation of <b>the</b> equivalent <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formal semantics. TBCR has been realized for a commonly used software semantics, the Asynchronous Interleaving Message-passing semantics. TBCR is illustrated by two applications of this realization...|$|R
5|$|Anshei Israel Synagogue is a {{historic}} synagogue located in Lisbon, Connecticut, United States. The Orthodox congregation was founded with 15 families and constructed the synagogue in 1936. It was built by George Allen & Sons. The interior is a single room that is lined with five benches before an altar which held the sacred ark. The congregation's membership dwindled throughout the 1940s and 1950s, limiting the services to holidays before finally closing in the early 1980s. <b>Rules</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> congregation were not as strictly enforced as in the Old World, as there was no curtain to separate the sexes and distant members were allowed to drive {{part of the way}} to its services. The Town of Lisbon took ownership of the property in the 1980s. The synagogue is currently maintained by the Lisbon Historical Society. The synagogue was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{has been}} a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in {{popularity}} in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E

The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor. The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby, the latter being mandated by the state constitution. Seating in the Senate is by party, {{with the leaders of}} each party choosing the exact seating assignments. Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller Senate Office Building.|$|E
5|$|Raised a Catholic, Antoine {{worked as}} a coal miner in his youth, then as a steelworker, before {{performing}} his military service in 1866. After marrying Catherine in 1873, he moved several times for professional reasons. Deeply impressed by Allan Kardec's writings, he organized a spiritualist group in the 1890s. In 1893, {{the death of his}} son marked the definitive loss of his faith in Catholicism. In 1896, he explained his Spiritist views in a book, then discovered the gifts of healing. Quickly known as a healer, he gathered many followers, mainly among workers disappointed by Catholicism or medicine. In 1906, he broke with Spiritism and started a religion, then published three books outlining his doctrine and consecrated the first Antoinist temple. After his death in 1912, Catherine ensured the continuity of the religion, promoting a centralized worship around the person of her husband and providing additional <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organization. When she died in 1940, some differences happened between the French and the Belgian temples.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Unearthed Arcana {{was written}} primarily by Gary Gygax, {{and published by}} game publisher TSR in 1985 for use with the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons first edition rules. The book consisted mostly of material previously published in magazines, and included new races, classes, and other material to expand the <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dungeon Masters Guide and Players Handbook. The book was notorious for its considerable number of errors, and was received negatively by the gaming press whose criticisms targeted the over-powered races and classes, among other issues. Gygax intended to use the book's content for a planned second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons; however, much of the book's content was not reused in the second edition, which went into development shortly after Gygax's departure from TSR.|$|E

5|$|The sole game of Navy's 1884 {{season was}} the annual {{competition}} against rival Johns Hopkins, {{the third consecutive}} playing of the series. In what was the final season where the rivalry was the only game of the year, Navy defeated Johns Hopkins 96. The game, played on November 27, was hosted by the Academy, likely on an unused drill or parade field. In an unusual agreement between the two schools, the contest was played entirely under rugby <b>rules.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first half, Hopkins scored twice, on a touchdown from Mr. Bonsall and on a two-point safety. Navy scored twice {{in the second half}} of the game, when halfback Julius Dashiell, brother of Hopkins' Paul Dashiell, kicked a five-point goal and rusher David W. Taylor scored a touchdown to secure a victory.|$|E
