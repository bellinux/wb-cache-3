40|$|In this paper, we derive the {{dispersion}} equations for field-aligned cyclotron {{waves in}} an axisymmetric dipole magnetospheric plasmas {{with both the}} bi-Maxwellian and bi-Lorentzian distribution functions. To evaluate the contribution of trapped particles to the transverse current density components the Vlasov equation is solved using a standard method of switching to new variables associated with conservation integrals; new time-like variable is introduced (instead of the geomagnetic latitude angle) to describe the bounce-motion of trapped particles along the geomagnetic field; the perturbed electric field and current density components are Fourier-decomposed over {{the length of the}} geomagnetic field lines. As a result, the transverse permittivity elements are expressed by summation of bounce-resonant terms including the double integration in velocity space, the resonant denominators, and the corresponding phase coefficients. Due to geomagnetic field nonuniformity, the wave-particle resonance conditions in magnetospheric plasmas are entirely different from ones in the straight magnetic field; the all spectrum of the electric field is present in the given current density harmonic; the left- and <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are coupled. To have some analogy with the linear theory of cyclotron waves in the straight magnetic field, we assume that the n-th harmonic of the electric field gives the main contribution to the n-th harmonic of the current density, and the connection of the left- and <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> is small. In this case, the dispersion equations for cyclotron waves have the simplest form and are suitable to analyze the instabilities of both the electron- and ion-cyclotron waves accounting for the bounce resonance effects.

40|$|Ion {{velocity}} distribution functions {{have been}} measured with high time resolution by the TAUS plasma instrument on the PHOBOS mission to Mars in 1989. The unambiguous separation of protons and alpha-particles by TAUS {{enabled us to}} study the nonthermal features of their distributions separately and to analyze {{the stability of the}} distributions against excitation of waves in the cyclotron-frequency domain. Typical nonthermal features include temperature anisotropies, with T(sub perpendicular) larger than T(sub parallel), and ion beam populations drifting along the local magnetic field direction. Also, distinctly non-gyrotropic alpha-particle velocity distributions were sometimes found. Non-gyrotropy strongly changes the wave dispersion and gives rise to new growing modes, related to the coupling of the standard wave modes existing in gyrotropic plasma.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} relation for {{circularly polarized}} electromagnetic waves {{in a warm}} two‐component plasma subject to parallel static electric and magnetic fields has been derived from the linearized coupled Boltzmann‐Maxwell equations with the collision frequency assumed to be independent of the particle velocity. The effect of a weak longitudinal electrostatic field, E 0 E 0, on the propagation characteristic of the right‐ and left‐hand circularly polarized waves in an isothermal electron‐proton plasma is examined in detail and illustrated numerically for a conveniently chosen set of the system parameters.

40|$|During {{the last}} six months, we have {{continued}} our study of the excitation of electromagnetic waves in the whistler frequency range and the role that these waves {{will play in the}} acceleration of electrons and ions in the auroral region. A paper entitled 'Electron Beam Excitation of Upstream Waves in the Whistler Mode Frequency Range' was listed in the Journal of Geophysical Research. In this paper, we have shown that an anisotropic electron beam (or gyrating electron beam) is capable of generating both left-hand and <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> electromagnetic <b>waves</b> in the whistler frequency range. Since <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> electromagnetic <b>waves</b> can interact with background electrons and left-hand <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> can interact with background ions through cyclotron resonance, it is possible that these beam generated left-hand and <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> electromagnetic <b>waves</b> can accelerate either ions or electrons (or both), depending on the physical parameters under consideration. We are currently carrying out a comprehensive study of the electromagnetic whistler and lower hybrid like waves observed in the auroral zone using both wave and particle data. Our first task is to identify these wave modes and compare it with particle observations. Using both the DE- 1 particle and wave measurements, we can positively identify those electromagnetics lower hybrid like waves as fast magnetosonic waves and the upper cutoff of these waves is the local lower hybrid frequency. From the upper cutoff of the frequency spectrum, one can infer the particle density and the result is in very good agreement with the particle data. Since these electromagnetic lower hybrid like waves can have frequencies extended down to the local ion cyclotron frequency, it practically confirms that they are not whistler waves...|$|R

It is shown that the continuum radiation is composed of both left-hand and <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> with distinct cutoffs observed at the plasma frequency and right-hand cutoff frequency, respectively. It is found that the Z-mode peak frequency lies close to the left-hand cutoff frequency, suggesting that the observed characteristics of the emission are the result of wave reflection at the cutoff layer. Another distinct emission occurring near the upper hybrid resonance frequency is detected simultaneously with the Z mode.

The code treats ions (protons) kinetically through Vlasov's equation in the six-dimensional phase space while electrons are a massless charge-neutralizing fluid [M. Palmroth et al., Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 99, 41 (2013); A. Sandroos et al., Parallel Computing 39, 306 (2013) ]. For first global simulations of the magnetosphere, {{it is critical to}} verify and validate the model by established methods. Here, as part of the verification of Vlasiator, we characterize the low-β plasma wave modes described by this model and compare with the solution computed by the Waves in Homogeneous, Anisotropic Multicomponent Plasmas (WHAMP) code [K. Rönnmark, Kiruna Geophysical Institute Reports 179 (1982) ], using dispersion curves and surfaces produced with both programs. The match between the two fundamentally different approaches is excellent in the low-frequency, long wavelength range which is of interest in global magnetospheric simulations. The left-hand and <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> modes as well as the Bernstein modes in the Vlasiator simulations agree well with the WHAMP solutions.

Then we study {{the stability of}} pump waves with small non-dimensional amplitude a (a 1) analytically, restricting our analysis to b < 1, where b is {{the ratio of the}} sound and Alfvén speed. Our main results are the following. The stability properties of <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are qualitatively the same as in ideal MHD. For any values of b and the dispersion parameter τ they are subject to decay instability that occurs for wave numbers from a band with width of order a. The instability increment is also of order a.

During most of this period, interplanetary parameters varied gradually and {{in such a way}} as to give rise to two extreme magnetosheath structures, one dominated by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects and the other by gas dynamic effects. We focus attention on unusual features of electromagnetic ion wave activity in the former magnetosheath state, and compare these features with those in the latter. Magnetic fluctuations in the gas dynamic magnetosheath were dominated by compressional mirror mode waves, and left- and <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves transverse to the background field. In contrast, the MHD magnetosheath, lasting for over one day, was devoid of mirror oscillations and permeated instead by EIC waves of weak intensity. The weak wave intensity is related to the prevailing low solar wind dynamic pressures. Left-hand <b>polarized</b> EIC <b>waves</b> were replaced by bursts of <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves,</b> which remained for many hours the only ion wave activity present. This activity occurred when the magnetosheath proton temperature anisotropy (=) became negative. This was because the weakened bow shock exposed the magnetosheath directly to the (negative) temperature anisotropy of the solar wind. Unlike the normal case studied in the literature, these right-hand waves were not by-products of left-hand <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> but derived their energy source directly from the magnetosheath temperature anisotropy. Brief entries into the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) and duskside magnetosphere occurred under such inflated conditions that the magnetospheric magnetic pressure was insufficient to maintain pressure balance.

40|$|We have {{performed}} {{a number of}} one-dimensional hybrid simulations (massless electrons, macroions) of almost parallel collisionless shocks (angle between the upstream magnetic field and shock normal of 5) for medium and high Mach number shocks. One of the key questions we address is whether downstream convected upstream waves or waves locally generated at the interface of the incoming solar wind and the partially thermalized plasma are {{the main source of}} the downstream turbulence. In the medium, supercritical Mach number regime the small-wavelength interface waves are damped in a transition region and contribute to downstream dissipation [Krauss-Varban, 1995]. These <b>waves</b> are <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> and propagate in the downstream rest frame toward the shock. In an Alfven Mach number regime around M_A #propor to# 8 we find behind the shock ramp <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> with both helicities. These are interpreted in terms of both the ion/ion resonant and the ion/ion right-hand nonresonant instability occurring in the shock transition region. The latter occurs, according to linear theory, when the beam density is high and when the relative speed between the ion beam and the ambient ions is large. In this Mach number regime the shock-produced waves have larger wavelengths and are less strongly damped. We suggest that they are subject to a parametric decay instability, resulting in an inverse cascade of short-wavelength waves to longer ones farther downstream. In the very high Mach number regime, damping as well as decay of the shock-produced waves is slow in comparison with the transit time from the shock to the magnetopause. The shock-generated waves are then the dominant source of the downstream turbulence. (orig.)

The magnetized plasma has a resonance for <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> electromagnetic <b>waves</b> at the electron cyclotron frequency Omega(0), so that a probe wave with frequency omega(1) = Omega(0) cannot propagate through the plasma. The plasma can be made transparent to such a probe {{by the presence of}} a pump wave. The pump may be an electromagnetic wave or magnetostatic wiggler. Simulations and theory show that the physical reason for the transparency is that the beating of the probe wave with the pump wave sets up a plasma oscillation, and the upper sideband of the pump wave cancels the resonant plasma current due to the probe. The theory of plasma EIT derived here extends that found in the earlier work to include the effects of the lower sideband of the pump and renormalization of the plasma frequency and an analysis of the transient response. A detailed comparison of theory to one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations is presented and estimates for the performance ion accelerator using the EIT interaction are given. The dispersion relation and estimates for the phase velocity and amplitude of the plasma wave are in good agreement with particle-in-cell simulations. open 151...|$|R
40|$|The {{solar wind}} {{interacts with the}} solar system bodies in various manners {{depending}} on the size and state of the body. It is notable that upstream whistlers have been commonly observed in the upstream regions of many solar system bodies, whereas their sizes and states are different. A wide variety of energy sources of the waves have been proposed including reflected ions and electrons from the bow shock, temperature anisotropies in the foreshock, and shock front perturbations. In order to clarify the generation process of the waves, it is necessary to understand effects on the observed wave spectra. We propose the group-standing effects [Tsugawa et al., 2014] which can form the observed wave spectra: narrowband wave spectra with frequencies near 1 Hz. The group-standing condition can explain dependences of the wave frequency and wave vector direction observed by Kaguya around the Moon and by Geotail around the terrestrial bow shock. Since the wave properties of the narrowband upstream whistlers are mostly determined by the group-standing effects, it is difficult to clarify the generation process of the narrowband waves from the observed properties. We find the same source waves while they are not group-standing, which are observed as <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> broadband <b>waves</b> in the frequency range around the lower hybrid frequency with their wave vector...|$|R
40|$|A {{consideration}} of waves propagating {{parallel to the}} external magnetic field is presented. The dielectric permeability tensor is derived from quantum kinetic equations with non-trivial equilibrium spin-distribution functions (NTESDF) in the linear approximation on amplitude of wave perturbations. In general case, x- and y-projections of the SDF are nonzero which is called the non-trivial regime. Corresponding equilibrium solution is found. Contribution of the NTESDF appears in the dielectric permeability tensor in the additive form. It is explicitly found here. Corresponding modification in the dispersion equation for the transverse waves is derived. Contribution of NTESDF in the spectrum of transverse waves is calculated numerically. It is found that the term caused by the NTESDF can be comparable with the classic terms for the relatively small wave vectors and frequencies above the cyclotron frequency. In majority of regimes, the extra spin caused term dominates over the spin term found earlier, except the small frequency regime, where their contributions in the whistler spectrum are comparable. A decrease of the left-hand circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> frequency, an increase of the high-frequency <b>right-hand</b> circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> frequency, and a decrease of frequency changing by an increase of frequency at {{the growth of the}} wave vector for the whistler are found. A dramatic decrease of the spin wave frequency resulting in several times larger group velocity of the spin wave is found either. Found dispersion equations are used for obtaining of an effective quantum hydrodynamics reproducing these results. This generalization requires the introduction of corresponding equation of state for the thermal part of the spin current in the spin evolution equation. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the waves that are present upstream of interplanetary, collisionless, quasi-parallel shocks are described. Two types of such waves have been detected, a higher frequency whistler mode wave and a lower frequency fast mode MHD wave. Both are typically circular or elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>waves</b> which propagate along the ambient magnetic field with a 15 deg angle cone. The high frequency waves have sufficient group velocities to outrun the shock, and may be generated by cyclotron resonance with 100 eV to 1 keV shock electrons. The lower frequency waves must be generated locally by particles upstream of the shock, probably by 1 - 10 keV ions flowing away from the shock. Distinct changes in the spectra of upstream waves {{as a function of}} distance from the shock have been noted...|$|R
