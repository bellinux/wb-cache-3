2500|$|Restoration {{began with}} {{replacing}} <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domes. Solovyov removed tin <b>roofing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main tent {{installed in the}} 1810s and found many original tiles missing and others discoloured; after a protracted debate <b>the</b> whole set <b>of</b> tiles on <b>the</b> tented roof was replaced with new ones. Another dubious decision allowed use of standard bricks that were smaller than the original 16th-century ones. Restorators agreed that <b>the</b> paintwork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century must be replaced with a [...] "truthful recreation" [...] of historic patterns, but these had to be reconstructed and deduced based on medieval miniatures. In the end Solovyov and his advisers set upon a combination of deep red with deep green that is retained to date.|$|R
