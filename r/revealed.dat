30|$|In {{daily life}} in western cultures, there are many {{contexts}} in which people wear <b>revealing</b> dress. As a function of that <b>revealing</b> dress they may be susceptible to other-objectification. One such context in which women and men may wear <b>revealing</b> dress in the US is Halloween. However, scholars have not studied {{the extent to which}} men’s and women’s Halloween costumes are <b>revealing.</b>|$|R
30|$|In two studies, the <b>revealing</b> {{nature of}} Halloween costumes was investigated. In Study 1 124 pairs of men’s and women’s Halloween costumes were content analyzed. Analysis showed that women’s costumes were {{significantly}} more <b>revealing</b> than men’s in terms of tightness {{and the extent to}} which they uncovered the body. Researchers interested in studying SO in media presentations have often relied on <b>revealing</b> dress in those depictions as evidence for SO. Since women’s Halloween costumes were found to be more <b>revealing</b> than men’s in Study 1 and that SO in the media is assessed by the presence of <b>revealing</b> dress in media depictions, we reasoned that women’s <b>revealing</b> Halloween costumes could be sexually objectifying. In Study 2, we conducted an online experiment; participants from AMT viewed and rated three images of women wearing <b>revealing</b> or non-revealing Halloween costumes. Participants rated women wearing the <b>revealing</b> costumes higher on sexually objectifying traits (perceived women in terms of their sexual appeal) and lower on a set of positive traits than women wearing the non-revealing costumes. Thus, the women in the <b>revealing</b> costumes were sexually objectified (i.e., they were judged primarily for their sexual appeal). Although men rated women higher on the sexually objectifying traits, both men and women were affected by the <b>revealing</b> dress condition.|$|R

Finally and most importantly <b>revealing</b> dress affected judgments of sexualizing traits and this was a moderate effect. Thus, women wearing <b>revealing</b> Halloween costumes were sexualized more than those wearing non-revealing costumes. This is consistent with results of Gurung and Chrouser; in their <b>revealing</b> dress condition the stimulus person was rated higher on traits selected to measure sexuality (attractive, sexually experienced, desirable) than in the non-revealing condition.|$|R
