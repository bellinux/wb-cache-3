40|$|For various reasons, second {{language}} learners modify their speech {{by means of}} self-repair. This study, based on a small-scale corpus, shows the patterns and features of self-repairs by intermediate Chinese learners of English. The results suggest that intermediate Chinese learners of English more frequently make repairs than advanced Chinese learners of English do. Within the three overt <b>repair</b> types (same <b>information,</b> different information, and appropriateness), different information accounts for {{the highest percentage of}} repairs, and appropriateness repairs the lowest. Same <b>information</b> <b>repairs</b> represent the highest percentage of all the repair types. From a chi-square test, the results indicate that intermediate Chinese learners of English make more significant use of same <b>information</b> <b>repairs</b> than relatively advanced Chinese learners of English do. Some pedagogical implications of this finding are discussed...|$|R

Although previous studies have shown that PET/CT might affect patient selection based on aneurysm wall inflammation, our preliminary results show a big impact on patient management {{as a result of the}} sensitivity of PET/CT for detecting malignancy. Future larger studies are warranted to investigate the effect and cost effectiveness of routine PET/CT in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients...|$|R
