The adverts read [...] "Were you seriously injured in last week's explosion?", and directed potential clients to the company website. The advert also claims that the firm has extensive experience in explosion-related cases. Fran Deisinger, director of the Milwaukee Bar Association, said of the ad [...] "It's a little disconcerting because it's such a terrible situation here that I think it probably rubs everybody a little wrong,", adding that although he believed the ad to be in poor taste, it didn't breach any rules for lawyer advertising. Although it is unclear whether any workers contacted Williams Bailey, it is known that at least one injured man, and the families of the deceased, have hired personal injury lawyer Bob Habush to represent them, who once before worked on a high-profile industrial case when three people {{died as a result of}} a crane collapse in 1991. On February 7, 2007, he launched a suit against Brennan based on these allegations. J.M. Brennan responded with the following statement: [...] "We are proud of our employees and the response they took in response to the explosion. And we're confident that the results of the official investigation will show that J.M. Brennan's work was reasonable and did not contribute to the cause of the explosion."

40|$|Justified {{purpose of}} the topic: Research on crisis {{management}} in the meetings industry only focused {{on the process of}} crisis preparedness and the perception of meeting planners towards crises, with little research carried out on the strategies adopted to manage crisis within the meetings industry. Objective: This paper explores crisis management perceptions and practices by meetings professionals from two perspectives: origins of crisis and crisis management strategies. Methodology: The study adopted an exploratory perspective through interviewing 11 Turkish meeting planners who were asked to revisit past crisis experiences through the critical incident technique. Results: Meetings were shown to be highly prone to smaller scale, operational crisis in particular. Therefore, according to meeting planners, crises are more about service failures than major disruptive events that question the organization’s existence as per the traditional definition of crisis. Crises are classified using a matrix that considers the source of the crisis (internal/external) and the degree of control (controllable/non-controllable). Meeting planners tend to attribute crises events to others than themselves and perceive them as mostly uncontrollable, <b>related</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> suppliers (including venues/hotels) and clients. Crisis management strategies employed {{in each of the four}} phases of crisis prevention/preparation, coping, recovery, and learning) were carried out at an individual level, with little formalization at the organizational level evident. Negative perceptions about the need for formalization were reflected in the rejection of developing crisis management plans. Originality: This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating that crisis management frameworks can be employed to examine crises that are essentially service failures. As a consequence, the distinction between the notions of service failure and crisis may be artificial rather than real. Therefore, researchers planning studies on crises-service failure should consider looking at both literatures in order to integrate both bodies of knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Globalized {{commerce}} and its characteristically complex production and supply chains have shaped {{the way the}} concept of contracting is perceived today. It is no longer appropriate to view commercial contracts as singular, exclusive, and private acts between two sovereign participants. Modern business operations form much more intricate contractual phenomena, multilateral contractual chains or networks that, when observed together, constitute entire contractual complexes, which allow the contracting entities to pursue their own, often intertwined interests most efficiently. The interrelation of interests renders these contractual creatures extremely volatile. The dependence on a successful performance of not only one's own contractual counterparty, {{but also on the}} performance of extra-contractual participants – a subcontractor, an execution assistant, or other <b>related</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> – is emphasized. When disputes arise, commercial conflicts, neither, can be viewed as singular, exclusive and private anomalies in a relationship between two sovereign participants. Instead, a disturbance in one relationship may cause ripple effects that penetrate the entire contractual complex. Multi-party arrangements transform into multi-party conflicts. 	 Arbitration has steadily grown in significance as the principal system of commercial dispute resolution. With the number of multi-party disputes constantly growing, the status of non-signatory third parties in the proceedings exerts pressure on the institution of international arbitration to evolve to satisfy the needs of its core audience. Central to the discussion is the dichotomy between market realities of globalized business on one hand, and the consensual nature of arbitration on the other. This thesis addresses the status of non-signatories in international commercial arbitration, providing an analytical summary of (i) the formation and limits of the contemporary legal framework for international commercial arbitration, (ii) the choice-of-law issues encountered in non-signatory situations, and (iii) the practical legal constructions employed to address the status of non-signatories, including a possibility for a hybrid non-signatory theory. The conclusion of the thesis is that a universal approach to the non-signatory issue does not come in a form of transnationalist application of supra-national rules (at times referred to as the new lex mercatoria). Instead, the contemporary approach to non-signatory issues is one of transnational territorialism, i. e. application of internationally harmonized legislative framework in conjunction with pertinent national legislation...|$|E

How to provide valuable recommen-dations to viewers is an important task for both video websites and <b>related</b> <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> such as search engines. Previous work conducted numerous analysis on the view counts of videos, which measure a video’s value in terms of popularity. However, the long-lasting value of an online video, namely longevity, is hidden behind the history that a video accumulates its "popularity " through time. Generally speaking, a longevous video tends to constantly draw so-ciety’s attention. With focus {{on one of the}} leading video websites, Youtube, this paper proposes a scoring mechanism quantifying a video’s longevity. Evaluating a video’s longevity can not only im-prove a video recommender system, but also help us to discover videos having greater advertising value, as well as adjust a video website’s strategy of storing videos to shorten its responding time. In order to accurately quantify longevity, we introduce the concept of latent social impulses and how to use them measure a video’s longevity. In order to derive latent social impulses, we view the video website as a digital signal filter and formulate the task as a convex minimization problem. The proposed longevity computa-tion is based on the derived social impulses. Unfortunately, the re-quired information to derive social impulses are not always public, which makes a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> unable to directly evaluate every video’s longevity. To solve this problem, we formulate a semi-supervised learning task by using part of videos having known longevity scores to predict the unknown longevity scores. We propose a Gaussian Random Markov model with Loopy Belief Propagation to solve this problem. The conducted experiments on Youtube demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the prediction re-sults comparing to baseline models. 1...|$|R

Thus, {{in order to understand the}} insurers? right of subrogation claim in construction contract, this master project has been carried out with the intention to identify circumstances that do not allow insurers to exercise their rights of subrogation. This project has been carried out mainly through documentary analysis of the relevant cases repeated in law journals, such as Malayan Law Journal, Singapore Law Report, Building Law Report, etc. Eighteen cases has been chosen to be analysed in accordance with the feature of right of subrogation against co-insured and the waiver of subrogation clauses in the standard forms of contract. The result showed that, in conjunction with insurance clauses, construction contracts do include provisions that require the insurance policies to be in the form of joint names of the employer, contractor, subcontractor and all <b>related</b> <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> This would lead to the insurers not being able to exercise the usual rights of subrogation against any of the joint insured. Besides that, the construction contracts also require the insurance policies to contain cross liability or waiver of subrogation clauses. The clauses provide that the insurances carrier, after settling and paying a claim, cannot pursue the damage paid for by the insured parties? insurance carrier. These effectively prevent an insurer from seeking recovery from the party at fault.

40|$|The {{handling}} of explosives and ammunition introduces a safety risk for personnel and <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Accidents <b>related</b> to storage, transport and transhipment {{may result in}} severe injury and material damage. TNO has developed a number of tools to quantify the consequences and risks of accidental explosions. Risk {{is defined as the}} multiplication of the probability of an event and its consequences. The tools differ in their application, considering explosion safety on a military base (within the home country or on a mission), or external safety (<b>related</b> to <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> outside a military base). Some tools are aimed at consequences, others also give risk quantities as output. Risk-NL is our national software for the risk analysis of ammunition storage sites. The individual risk and group risk calculated with Risk-NL have to be compared to Dutch risk criteria. Specifically for transhipment in ports the TNO Transhipment Tool can be employed. In this tool the probability of an accidental explosion depends on the exact type and frequency of the transhipment. The AASTP- 5 Consequence Analysis Tool was developed for military bases abroad, taking into account the protection offered by specific armoured containers against various threats. This tool has been integrated in the latest version of the NATO Field Storage Manual AASTP- 5, and is available for member nations. In the research program ‘Survivability of Compounds’, funded by the Dutch MoD this tool was further developed to predict not only physical consequences, but also consequence for the mission goals (i. e. at the system level). The Klotz Group Engineering Tool has been developed together with international partners in the Klotz Group, a group of explosives safety experts from 8 nations. This tool predicts the hazard from accidental explosions in reinforced concrete ammunition storage sites in detail. By comparing various scenarios the tools described above can also be used in cost-benefit analysis.

I {{argue that the}} mere threat of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry into the election induces anticipatory electoral strategies by the major parties. This effect, which is a normal aspect of the two-party system, is how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. elections. The ability for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to influence the major parties is moderated by electoral institutions. The ballot access requirement, {{in the form of}} a signature requirement, varies widely across House elections and is a significant predictor of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> electoral success. Consistent with conventional wisdom, I find that it has a negative effect on the likelihood of entry. Notably, the requirement also has a positive effect on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> vote shares, conditional on successful petitioning, due to a screening and quality effect. I explore the effects of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat in unidimensional and multidimensional settings. A formal model of elections predicts that the threat of entry induces major party divergence in a unidimensional ideological space. The major parties diverge in anticipation of potential <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry. An empirical analysis of candidate positioning in the 1996 U. S. House elections finds support of this hypothesis. Data on major party campaign advertising in the 2000 to 2004 U. S. House elections are used to assess <b>third</b> <b>party</b> effects in a multidimensional framework. I show that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat influences the scope and content of campaign advertising. Major party candidates, particularly incumbents, discuss a broader range of issues when <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat is higher. I use the case of environmental issues and the Green party to assess the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on issue-specific content. I find that Green party threat leads to predictable differences between Democratic and Republican advertising on environmental issues. In sum, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U.
