40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} perfluorocarbon (PFC) hemodilution on myocardial vessel capacity to autoregulate, circumflex coronary artery pressure-flow relations were studied in anesthe-tized dogs under three conditions: maximal vasodilatation before and after PFC; autoregu-lation before and after PFC with 100 % oxygen supplemented with <b>room</b> air <b>ventilation,</b> and autoregulation with PFC hemodilution during either room air or 100 % oxygen supplemented with <b>room</b> air <b>ventilation.</b> During coronary vasodilatation, PFC did not modify coronary conductance or zero-flow pressure. During autoregulation after PFC, the lower pressure limit of the autoregulatory pressure-flow relation was shifted leftward. This leftward shift occurred because endocardial blood flow was maintained at a lower coronary perfusion pressure with PFC while epicardial blood flow was unchanged. Endocardial blood flow was also preserved at 50 % of control blood flow levels as evidenced by the higher endocardial-epicardial blood flow ratio with PFC. After PFC with 100 % oxygen supplemented with <b>room</b> air <b>ventilation,</b> oxygen transport increased significantly when coronary perfusion pressure was below the lower pressure limit; the effect was most prominent in the endocardial tissue layer.

However, {{it is also possible that}} neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the Waratah was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the Geelong, and so the Waratah's handling was assumed to be the same.|$|R

50|$|VRLA Gel and AGM {{batteries}} offer {{several advantages}} compared with VRLA flooded lead acid and conventional standard lead-acid batteries. The battery can be mounted in any position, since the valves only operate on over-pressure faults. Since the battery {{system is designed}} to be recombinant and eliminate the emission of gases on overcharge, <b>room</b> <b>ventilation</b> requirements are reduced, and no acid fume is emitted during normal operation. Flooded cell gas emissions are of little consequence in all but the smallest confined areas, and pose very little threat to a domestic user, so a wet cell battery designed for longevity gives lower costs per kWh. In a gel battery, the volume of free electrolyte that could be released on damage to the case or venting is very small. There is no need (or ability) to check the level of electrolyte or to top up water lost due to electrolysis, reducing inspection and maintenance requirements. Wet cell batteries can be maintained by a self-watering system or by topping up every three months. The requirement to add distilled water is normally caused by overcharging. A well-regulated system should not require top-up more often than every three months.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Room</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{is a key}} {{determinant}} of airborne disease transmission. Despite this, ventilation guidelines in hospitals are not founded on robust scientific evidence related to the prevention of airborne transmission. Methods: We sought to assess the effect of ventilation rates on influenza, tuberculosis, and rhinovirus infection risk within 3 distinct rooms in a major urban hospital: a lung function laboratory, an emergency department negative-pressure isolation room, and an outpatient consultation room. Air-exchange rate measurements were performed in each room using CO as a tracer. The model developed by Gammaitoni and Nucci was used to estimate infection risk. Results: Current outdoor air-exchange rates in the lung function laboratory and emergency department isolation room limited infection risks to 0. 1 %- 3. 6 %. Influenza risk for individuals entering an outpatient consultation room after an infectious individual departed ranged from 3. 6 % to 20. 7 %, depending on the duration for which each person occupied the room. Conclusion: Given the absence of definitive ventilation guidelines for hospitals, air-exchange measurements combined with modeling afford a useful means of assessing, on a case-by-case basis, the suitability of <b>room</b> <b>ventilation</b> for preventing airborne disease transmission...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the numerical modelling of flows in ventilated rooms. A range of advanced turbulence models (non-linear low Reynolds number Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and hybrid LES/RANS models) are used to model the flow in four ventilated rooms. These describe the flow in a more physically consistent manner than the commonly used linear RANS models. The performances of Explicit Algebraic Stress Model (EASM) and, cubic eddyviscosity RANS model are first analysed on four benchmark flow configurations. They show significant accuracy improvements when compared to their linear equivalents. Flows in ventilated rooms are complex. Their numerical modelling required an accurate definition of the various boundary conditions. This is often lacking in the literature and hence, {{as part of this}} work, measurements in a controlled ventilated office (optimised for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling) have been done. The measurements comprise airflow velocities, temperatures, concentration decay and, a careful description of the room's boundary conditions under six ventilation settings. This room data is thus seen as ideal for validating of CFD codes when applied to <b>room</b> <b>ventilation</b> problems. The numerical investigations show that the predictions with zero- or, one-equation (k - 1) RANS models (commonly used in <b>room</b> <b>ventilation</b> modelling) are less accurate than those using two-equation k-e models. The study shows that the accuracy improvements of the EASM and cubic models are of lesser magnitude when applied to <b>room</b> <b>ventilation</b> modelling than when applied to the benchmark flow configurations. The cubic model in particular, besides being more numerically unstable than the other RANS models, does not always improve flow predictions when compared with its linear equivalent. The EASM, about 20 to 30 % more computationally demanding than its linear equivalent, improves solution accuracy for most flow considered in this work. LES predictions have highest level of agreement with measurements. LES is however too computationally expensive to be used for practical engineering applications. The novel hybrid RANS/LES model presented appears promising. It has similar accuracy to LES at lower computational costs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

We assessed the efficacy of wind-driven roof turbines to achieve recommended ventilation rates, compared to current recommended practices for natural ventilation (opening windows), in primary care clinic rooms in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Methods: <b>Room</b> <b>ventilation</b> was assessed (CO 2 gas tracer technique) in 4 rooms where roof turbines and air-intake grates were installed, across three scenarios: turbine, grate and window closed, only window open, and only turbine and grate open, with concurrent wind speed measurement. 332 measurements were conducted over 24 months. Findings: For all 4 rooms combined, median air changes per hour (ACH) increased with wind speed quartiles across all scenarios. Higher median ACH were recorded with open roof turbines and grates, compared to open windows across all wind speed quartiles. Ventilation with open turbine and grate exceeded WHO-recommended levels (60 Litres/second/ patient) for 95 % or more of measurements in 3 of the 4 rooms; 47 % in the remaining room, where wind speeds were lower and a smaller diameter turbine was installed.
