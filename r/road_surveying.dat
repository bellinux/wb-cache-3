40|$|Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) {{were listed}} as {{endangered}} by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1967. A variety of survey {{methods have been}} used in estimating deer density and/or changes in population trends for this species since 1968; however, a need to evaluate the precision of existing and alternative survey methods (i. e., road counts, mark-recapture, infrared-triggered cameras [ITC]) was desired by USFWS. I evaluated density estimates from unbaited ITCs and <b>road</b> <b>surveys.</b> <b>Road</b> <b>surveys</b> (n = 253) were conducted along a standardized 4 -km route each week between January 1999 ??December 2000 (total deer observed, n = 4, 078). During this same period, 11 ITC stations (1 camera/ 42 ha) collected 5, 511 deer exposures. Study results found a difference (P < 0. 001) between methods with <b>road</b> <b>survey</b> estimates lower (76 deer) than ITC estimates (166 deer). Comparing the proportion of marked deer, I observed a higher (P < 0. 001) proportion from <b>road</b> <b>surveys</b> (0. 266) than from ITC estimates (0. 146). Lower <b>road</b> <b>survey</b> estimates are attributed to (1) urban deer behavior resulting in a high proportion of marked deer observations, and (2) inadequate sample area coverage. I suggest that ITC estimates are a reliable and precise alternative to <b>road</b> <b>surveys</b> for estimating Key deer densities on outer islands. I also evaluated density estimates from 3 <b>road</b> <b>survey</b> methods. <b>Road</b> <b>survey</b> methods (n = 100) were conducted along a standardized 31 -km route where markresight, strip-transect, and distance sampling data were collected between June 2003 ?? May 2004. I found mark-resight estimates to be lower (x = 384, 95 % CI = 346 ?? 421) than strip-transect estimates (x = 854, 95 % CI = 806 ?? 902) and distance estimates (x = 523, 95 % CI = 488 ?? 557). I attribute low mark-resight estimates to urban deer behavior resulting in a higher proportion of marked deer observations along roadways. High strip-transect estimates also are attributed to urban deer behavior and a reduced effective strip width due to dense vegetation. I propose that estimates using distance sampling eliminate some of these biases, and recommend their use in the future...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{alternative}} method, respect today’s tipical <b>road</b> <b>survey,</b> is presented. Tipically, a <b>road</b> <b>survey</b> {{is carried out}} by a team composed by three operators at least, that moves with a vehicle on which an odometer is mounted on the rear {{in order to measure}} the effective travelled road. Given this operational procedure, a <b>road</b> <b>survey</b> requires, as a rule, a lot of time, resulting therefore very laborious and expensive regarding the employement of economic and human resources. Possible solutions to these problems could be represented by integration of Computer Vision technology with modern satellite positioning system, as GPS.

The system consists of a van equipped with two digital cameras, Sony XC 75 CE recording in continous way the surveyed environment and a GPS receiver that provides post-processed differential positions.

40|$|Currently, Global Positioning System (GPS) {{techniques}} {{are becoming a}} much larger part of the surveying industry. Many companies are now using GPS in their everyday work activities. The Real Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning {{is an integral part}} of topographic surveys, <b>road</b> <b>surveying,</b> con-structions and most civil engineering applications. Normally, RTK can be used to collect the posi-tioning data successfully and quickly. The civil and construction projects are designed in ground distances while RTK measurements are done in grid coordinate system, in which the distances between points are different from ground. The RTK measurements should be converted to ground for compatibility with the designed. In this paper, the accuracy of three alternatives for converting RTK measurements to ground was studied. These alternatives are, using scale factor, using two ground reference points and using Low Distortion Projection (LDP) surface. For the accuracy in-vestigation purpose, a traverse of 14 points elongated for a distance of about 1400 m was con-structed.

40|$|Terrestrial {{photogrammetry}} {{and laser}} scanning are technologies {{that have been}} successfully used for metric surveying and 3 D modelling in many different fields (archaeological and architectural documentation, industrial retrofitting, mining, structural monitoring, <b>road</b> <b>surveying,</b> etc.). In the case of structural applications, these techniques have been successfully applied to 3 D modelling and sometimes monitoring; {{but they have not}} been sufficiently implemented to date, as routine tools in infrastructure management systems, in terms of automation of data processing and integration in the condition assessment procedures. In this context, this paper presents a series of experiences in the usage of terrestrial photogrammetry and laser scanning in the context of dimensional and structural evaluation of structures. These experiences are particularly focused on historical masonry structures, but modern prestressed concrete bridges are also investigated. The development of methodological procedures for data collection, and data integration in some cases, is tackled for each particular structure (with access limitations, geometrical configuration, range of measurement, etc.). The accurate geometrical information provided by both terrestrial techniques motivates the implementation of such results in the complex, and sometimes slightly approximated, geometric scene that is frequently used in structural analysis. In this sense, quantitative evaluating of the influence of real and accurate geometry in structural analysis results must be carried out. As main result in this paper, a series of experiences based on the usage of photogrammetric and laser scanning to structural engineering are presented...|$|E
40|$|A mobile laser {{scanning}} (MLS) system allows direct collection of accurate 3 D point information in unprecedented detail at highway speeds and {{at less than}} traditional survey costs, which serves the fast growing demands of transportation-related <b>road</b> <b>surveying</b> including road surface geometry and road environment. As one type of road feature in traffic management systems, road markings on paved roadways have important functions in providing guidance and information to drivers and pedestrians. This paper presents a stepwise procedure to recognize road markings from MLS point clouds. To improve computational efficiency, we first propose a curb-based method for road surface extraction. This method first partitions the raw MLS data into a set of profiles according to vehicle trajectory data, and then extracts small height jumps caused by curbs in the profiles via slope and elevation-difference thresholds. Next, points belonging to the extracted road surface are interpolated into a geo-referenced intensity image using an extended inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) approach. Finally, we dynamically segment the geo-referenced intensity image into road-marking candidates with multiple thresholds that correspond to different ranges determined by point-density appropriate normality. A morphological closing operation with a linear structuring element is finally used to refine the road-marking candidates by removing noise and improving completeness. This road-marking extraction algorithm is comprehensively discussed {{in the analysis of}} parameter sensitivity and overall performance. An experimental study performed on a set of road markings with ground-truth shows that the proposed algorithm provides a promising solution to the road-marking extraction from MLS data.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a complex, low-cost road pavement measurement system designed primarily for pothole and crack detection. The onboard system {{is composed of}} a GPS/INS navigation unit, an image acquisition module, and a photogrammetric and imageprocessing subsystem. Due {{to the use of}} structured light and the availability of accurate navigation data, the 3 D coordinates of the road points, in the form of cross profiles, as well as the size and location of the potholes, can be derived from the images at cm-level relative accuracy. For the road classification the International Roughness Index (IRI) can be derived. This paper also discusses the potential future developments of the system; it reports on the initial investigations of applying single camera with laser line projection which can significantly simplify the overall procedure. 1. INRODUCTION AND CONCEPT In the well-motorized countries the transportation authorities spend significant amounts of money to road constructions and road pavement maintenance. The roads are aging; the maintenance works have {{to keep pace with the}} new constructions. The traffic delays are mostly caused by road closures, this topic is always highlighted in the news. Therefore, the optimized scheduling became extremely important, the authorities tend to turn to new technologies in order to map the actual condition of the road pavement and decide upon the priorities of the scheduled maintenance works. Since road engineering is one of the most extended engineering field, many “traditional ” <b>road</b> <b>surveying</b> methods used for construction and maintenance planning. As most of the maintenance works are scheduled based on experiences, the road conditions are often classified by visual observations. The number of potholes, the length and type of the cracks, and lane grooves are clear indicators of the overall road condition. However, there are a few autonomous (or at least semiautonomous) systems in use, e. g. the Swedish RS...|$|E

40|$|The guanaco (Lama guanicoe (Müller, 1776)) is a {{monomorphic}} polygynous mammal whose adult {{sex ratio}} {{is expected to}} be balanced or biased towards females. Remarkably male-biased sex ratios of adult guanacos are often estimated from <b>road</b> <b>surveys.</b> We analyzed the distribution of guanaco social groups recorded during <b>road</b> <b>surveys</b> in Patagonia, Argentina, to test the hypothesis that group assignation based upon behavioral traits is not unequivocal and can be biased by survey factors. Guanacos are organized into three social units (family groups, male groups, and solitary males) that are identified by their grouping behaviour. We recorded 992 guanaco groups, and estimated an adult sex ratio of 3. 2 males/female. We used generalized additive models to test the null hypothesis that the probability of recording a group as a family group was constant. Alternatively, this probability could decrease when juvenile abundance and (or) detectability was low. The most parsimonious model showed that the probability of classifying a “family” group increased with date, and decreased with group size, distance to the observer, and time of day.

40|$|Invasive species {{represent}} a significant threat to global biodiversity and a substantial economic burden.

Pythons have increased dramatically in both abundance and geographic range since 2000 and consume {{a wide variety of}} mammals and birds. Here we report severe apparent declines in mammal populations that coincide temporally and spatially with the proliferation of pythons in ENP. Before 2000, mammals were encountered frequently during nocturnal <b>road</b> <b>surveys</b> within ENP. In contrast, <b>road</b> <b>surveys</b> totaling 56, 971 km from 2003 – 2011 documented a 99. 3 % decrease in the frequency of raccoon observations, decreases of 98. 9 % and 87. 5 % for opossum and bobcat observations, respectively, and failed to detect rabbits. <b>Road</b> <b>surveys</b> also revealed that these species are more common in areas where pythons have been discovered only recently and are most abundant outside the python's current introduced range. These findings suggest that predation by pythons has resulted in dramatic declines in mammals within ENP and that introduced apex predators, such as giant constrictors, can exert significant top-down pressure on prey populations. Severe declines in easily observed and/or common mammals, such as raccoons and bobcats, bode poorly for species of conservation concern, which often are more difficult to sample and occur at lower densities...|$|R
