40|$|Drill & Blast is a {{commonly}} used excavation method {{for the construction}} of underground openings (e. g. tunnels, caverns) in hardrock conditions worldwide. Wear of the employed tools may take place during dif-ferent steps of the working cycle, affecting a wide range of machinery and materials. Although excavators, dump trucks or conveyor belts are also permanently exposed to the excavated rock mass and therefore un-dergoing geologically influenced wear, the wear of the rock cutting tools (i. e. drilling bits, excavator chisels, picks) is the most expensive wear phenomenon. Drilling equipment and bit tool wear Common blasthole diameters range from 38 to 48 mm and are typically drilled by use of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> hammers (impact power of about 15 to 20 kW). In most geological conditions, predomi-nantly button bits are used which consist of a number of cemented carbide buttons inserted and/or solded into holes of a steel body (Figure 1). The properties of the button bit can be adjusted effectively to the local cir-cumstances by variation of the amount of inserted buttons, button composition, button geometry, solding and steel quality or the bit's flushing system.

Despite the effort of making the practice of tunnel construction as efficient and safe as possible, the analysis of drill response parameters has not yet become a standard in the field. The use of drill parameter response in underground openings and tunnels is a helpful tool in assessing information on structural and mineralogical features. When drilling in hard rock with <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling,</b> the drill data are in most cases automatically collected, but hardly analyzed. In this study drill parameters collected in the LÃ¸ren tunnel, a road tunnel surrounding central Oslo, Norway, have been normalized and compared to engineering geological mapping collected by on site engineering geologists. The normalization process itself has been evaluated regarding the sensitivity and reliability of the method and the normalized parameters have been put to test.

40|$|Since the 1970 's {{measuring}} while drilling (MWD) {{has been}} used mostly for qualitative description of the subsurface. The techniques consist in observation and recording the drilling process in terms of advance rate, penetration thrust, rotation rate, torque, drilling pressure and flow to provide a fairly accurate representation of the stratigraphy while advancing a borehole in soils and in rocks. A study at a specially constructed test embankment {{was used to evaluate}} the potential of drilling parameters to deliver quantitative rather than qualitative data from instantaneous drilling logs. Theembankment, composed of 8 distinct areas of different soil types and materials, allowed measurements of MWD parameters under various drilling and soil conditions.

Subsurface conditions included gravel, sand, clayey sand, silt, clay, reconstituted chalk as well as a buried layer of concrete and a layer of hollow polymer blocks.

The compound parameters also allowed to determine the most efficient drilling techniques to advance boreholes in different materials.

40|$|This work is {{a method}} to drill into a rock surface {{regardless}} of the gravitational field or orientation. The required weight-on-bit (WOB) is supplied by a self-contained anchoring mechanism. The system includes a rotary percussive coring drill, forming a complete sampling instrument usable by robot or human. This method of in situ sample acquisition using micro - spine anchoring technology enables several NASA mission concepts not currently possible with existing technology, including sampling from consolidated rock on asteroids, providing a bolt network for astronauts visiting a near-Earth asteroid, and sampling from the ceilings or vertical walls of lava tubes and cliff faces on Mars. One {{of the most fundamental}} parameters of drilling is the WOB; essentially, the load applied to the bit that allows it to cut, creating a reaction force normal to the surface. In every drilling application, there is a minimum WOB that must be maintained for the system to function properly. In microgravity (asteroids and comets), even a small WOB could not be supported conventionally by the weight of the robot or astronaut. An anchoring mechanism would be needed to resist the reactions, or the robot or astronaut would push themselves off the surface and into space. The ability of the system to anchor itself to a surface creates potential applications that reach beyond use in low gravity. The use of these anchoring mechanisms as end effectors on climbing robots has the potential of vastly expanding the scope of what is considered accessible terrain. Further, because the drill is supported by its own anchor rather than by a robotic arm, the workspace is not constrained by the reach of such an arm. Yet, if the drill is on a robotic arm, it has the benefit of not reflecting the forces of drilling back to the arm s joints. Combining the drill with the anchoring feet will create a highly mobile, highly stable, and highly reliable system. The drilling system s anchor uses hundreds of microspine toes that independently find holes and ledges on a rock to create an anchor. Once the system is anchored, a linear translation mechanism moves the drill axially into the surface while maintaining the proper WOB. The linear translation mechanism is composed of a ball screw and stepper motor that can translate a carriage with high precision and applied load. The carriage slides along rails using self-aligning linear bearings that correct any axial misalignment caused by bending and torsion. The carriage then compresses a series of springs that simultaneously transmit the load to the drill along the bit axis and act as a suspension that compensates for the vibration caused by percussive drilling. The drill is a compacted, modified version of an off-the-shelf rotary percussive drill, which uses a custom carbide-tipped coring bit. By using <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling,</b> the drill time is greatly reduced. The percussive action fractures the rock debris, which is removed during rotation. The final result is a 0. 75 -in. (. 1. 9 - cm) diameter hole and a preserved 0. 5 - in. (. 1. 3 -cm) diameter rock core. This work extends microspine technology, making it applicable to astronaut missions to asteroids and a host of robotic sampling concepts.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{evidence}} of life on Mars is the ultimate motivation for its scientific exploration. The results from the Phoenix mission indicate that the high N. latitude ice-rich regolith at low elevations {{is likely to be}} a recently habitable place on Mars [Stoker et al., 2010]. The near-surface ice likely provided adequate water activity during periods of high obliquity, 3 to 10 Myr ago. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen are present in the atmosphere, and nitrates may be present in the soil. Together with iron in basaltic rocks and perchlorate in the soil they provide carbon and energy sources, and oxidative power to drive metabolism. Furthermore, the presence of organics is possible, as thermally reactive perchlorate would have prevented their detection by Viking and Phoenix. The Mars Icebreaker Life mission [McKay et al., 2013] focuses on the following science goals: (1) Search for biomolecular evidence of life; (2) Search for organic matter from either exogeneous or endogeneous sources using methods that are not effected by the presence of perchlorate; (3) Characterize oxidative species that produced reactivity of soils seen by Viking; and 4) Assess the habitability of the ice bearing soils.

Five datasets were utilized to quantitatively assess the effect of various rock properties on PR. The datasets consisted of two sets of diamond and <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> and one set of rotary drilling data. A new rating system called Rock Drillability Characterization index (RDCi) is proposed to predict PR for different drilling methods. This drillability model incorporates {{the uniaxial compressive strength}} of intact rock, the P-wave velocity and the density of rock. The RDCi system is further applied to predict PR in the diamond rotary drilling, non-coring <b>rotary</b> <b>drilling</b> and <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> Strong correlations between PR and RDCi values were observed indicating that the developed drillability rating model is relevant and can be utilized to effectively predict the rock drillability in any operating environment.

Heat flow measurements are a high priority for the geophysical network missions to the Moon recommended by the latest Decadal Survey and previously the International Lunar Network. One of the difficulties associated with lunar heat flow measurement on a robotic mission is that it requires excavation of a relatively deep (approx 3 m) hole {{in order to avoid the}} long-term temporal changes in lunar surface thermal environment affecting the subsurface temperature measurements. Such changes may be due to the 18. 6 -year-cylcle lunar precession, or may be initiated by presence of the lander itself. Therefore, a key science requirement for heat flow instruments for future lunar missions is to penetrate 3 m into the regolith and to measure both thermal gradient and thermal conductivity. Engineering requirements are that the instrument itself has minimal impact on the subsurface thermal regime and that it must be a low-mass and low-power system like any other science instrumentation on planetary landers. It would be very difficult to meet the engineering requirements, if the instrument utilizes a long (> 3 m) probe driven into the ground by a <b>rotary</b> or <b>percussive</b> <b>drill.</b> Here we report progress in our efforts to develop a new, compact lunar heat flow instrumentation that meets all of these science and engineering requirements...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface. Typical adhesion test results comparing tensile strength with shotcrete curing age are shown in Figure 4. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior and}} fragmentation response of rock materials is investigated in this work. In particular, Bohus granite is selected with application to <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> It {{is well known}} that rock behaves totally different in compression and tension and dynamic loading conditions and high strain rates under the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process makes the material behavior even more complicated. The KST-DFH material model is shown in this work to be appropriate in order to constitutively describe granite at dynamic fragmentation. It consists of a plasticity model in compression and a damage model in tension. The yield surface locus is a quadratic function of the mean pressure in the principal stress space and the damage model is anisotropic. Several experiments are performed in order to define the mechanical behavior and dynamic response of granite and calibrate the KST-DFH model parameters for this material. The material model is implemented as in a commercial finite element program and validated based on dynamic tests such as Edge-on Impact (EOI) and spalling test using Hopkinson bar. The numerical tool is then used to model the rock response during the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process. In doing so, only one spherical tool button and just the first impact are considered for simplicity. The anticipated fracture mechanism in <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> is captured and the penetration stiffness obtained is in agreement with practical drilling experiments. In paper A, the experimental work is described and the granite mechanical response is explained. In particular, the influence from pre-existing cracks and defects is examined in great detail. In paper B, the experimental results are used to calibrate the material model parameters. The numerical tool discussed earlier is employed to investigate the rock fracture mechanisms at <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> In paper C, the effect of pre-existing, or structural, cracks on dynamic fragmentation of granite is investigated in detail. These cracks may be the result from former impact of the drill bit, or by means of other unconventional methods such as microwave and laser that are used to increase the effectiveness of the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process. In paper D, the dynamic tensile behavior of granite samples is investigated. Spalling tests using a Hopkinson bar are performed and a strain rate of order 102 1 /s is obtained.

This includes different tests such as direct tension and compression, three point bending and quasi-oedometric tests to investigate the material behavior at both tension and confined compression stress states. The equation of motion is discretized using a FE approach and the explicit time integration method is employed. EOI (Edge-On Impact) tests are performed and the results are used to validate the numerical model. The <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> problem is then modeled in 3 D and the bit-rock interaction is considered using contact mechanics. The fracture mechanism in the rock and the bit penetration- resisting force response are realistically captured by the numerical model...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{maintain}} optimal energy efficiency is critical during the drilling operations performed on future and current planetary rover missions (see figure). Specifically, this innovation seeks to solve the following problem. Given a spring-loaded <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> driven by a voice-coil motor, one needs to determine the optimal input voltage waveform (periodic function) and the optimal hammering period that minimizes the dissipated energy, while ensuring that the hammer-to-rock impacts are made with sufficient (user-defined) impact velocity (or impact energy). To solve this problem, it was first observed that when voice-coil-actuated <b>percussive</b> <b>drills</b> are driven at high power, it {{is of paramount importance}} to ensure that the electrical current of the device remains in phase with the velocity of the hammer. Otherwise, negative work is performed and the drill experiences a loss of performance (i. e., reduced impact energy) and an increase in Joule heating (i. e., reduction in energy efficiency). This observation has motivated many drilling products to incorporate the standard bang-bang control approach for driving their <b>percussive</b> <b>drills.</b> However, the bang-bang control approach is significantly less efficient than the optimal energy-efficient control approach solved herein. To obtain this solution, the standard tools of classical optimal control theory were applied. It is worth noting that these tools inherently require the solution of a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP), i. e., a system of differential equations where half the equations have unknown boundary conditions. Typically, the TPBVP is impossible to solve analytically for high-dimensional dynamic systems. However, for the case of the spring-loaded vibro-impactor, this approach yields the exact optimal control solution as the sum of four analytic functions whose coefficients are determined using a simple, easy-to-implement algorithm. Once the optimal control waveform is determined, it can be used optimally in the context of both open-loop and closed-loop control modes (using standard realtime control hardware) ...|$|R

40|$|A stationary-periodic {{quasi-static}} {{model of}} rock <b>percussive</b> deep <b>drilling</b> is introduced. First, an auxiliary problem of stationary indentation of a rigid indentor is considered. The rock is modelled by an inÂ¯nite elastic medium with damage-induced material softening. The stationarity {{of the problem}} allows to reduce the damage history in a material point to the damage distribution down in space. The bore-hole is a semi-inÂ¯nite cylinder with a curvilinear bottom. It is assumed the indentation is produced by a stationary motion of the rupture front at which an appropriate rock strength condition is violated. The bore-hole boundary is not known in advance and consists of four parts: a free of traction non-rupturing part, a contact non-rupturing part, a free of traction part of the rupture front, and a contact part of the rupture front. Thus the problem is formulated as a non-local non-linear free-boundary contact problem and algorithms of its numerical solution are discussed. The problem solution provides axial force necessary for the drill bit progression through the rock. Then the stationary-periodic <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> problem is reduced to the stationary problem on the rupture progression stage of the cycle and to the classical contact problem on the reverse and progression-before-rupture stages of the cycle. As a result, this provides a nonlinear progression-force diagram...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{comprehensive}} strategy for automatic control of the ITH <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process. Such automation would provide the benefits of improved productivity and quality in terms of penetration rate and hole deviation, as well as enhanced hole quality and machine life. Analysis of field data acquired from drilling experiments performed at INCO's Little Stobie Mine is presented. As {{a result of this}} analysis, a control algorithm is formulated to enhance the drilling process efficiency. This algorithm calculates the specific energy (SE) of the rock and adjusts the applied feed force based on this SE value, using a relationship obtained from the field data analysis. A model of the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process is developed and simulated in software. The proposed control algorithm is tested through simulations on this simulated drilling process. The results of the simulation show a significant increase in efficiency of the drilling process. As a result of vibration data analysis it is concluded that vibration should be controlled through an improved design of the shock-absorber, rather than through drilling variables. A detailed shock-absorber test data analysis is therefore presented. Recommendations for design changes in the shock-absorber are also given. Deviation analysis is also presented in the thesis, which shows a poor correlation between the machine variables and the hole deviation data. Hence, it is recommended that deviation be controlled by steering. An innovative guided drilling mechanism for controlling the hole deviation is also proposed. This mechanism consists of an eccentric ITH percussive hammer with controlled rotational speed, which can be employed as an actuator to steer the drill string in a desired direction without using any down hole instrumentation. Modelling and simulation analysis of this system is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{drilling}} and cutting {{is essential in}} the mining industry. Rock characterisation and classification methods have been proposed to assess drilling or cutting performance. However, a unique method to relate rock characteristics to rock cutting performance {{has not yet been}} developed. This is due to the complexity of interactions among the variables involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties, but also the nature of drilling. Cost-effective drilling is achievable by allocating the available gross energy towards the drilling action and, at the same time, reducing systematically that energy consumed in frictional processes inherent to tool-rock interactions. Several {{attempts have been made to}} assess drilling performance by correlating different rock properties with the drilling rate. For instance, rock texture, grain size, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Mohs hardness and rock mass structural parameters, and others have been used to build a number of drillability indices. However, not only rock properties, but also different sets of drilling parameters and drilling techniques have an impact on the drilling performance and efficiency of the process. On one hand, to predict rock drilling performance and optimisation of drilling operation, tool-rock interaction laws, i. e. the relations between forces acting on the tool in contact with rock, are essential. For instance, through tool-rock interaction laws, it was found that during rotary drilling, the energy consumed in pure cutting action of rock is measured by the intrinsic specific energy. In the case of <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling,</b> tool-rock interactions are focused mostly in the prediction of the penetration rate and the optimum thrust. On the other hand, rock failure characterised by rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated as there is not a unique criterion able to describe rock brittleness quantitatively nor consensus about the most suitable and reliable brittleness index to apply to different rock engineering works encountered in the field. A new brittleness index upon fracture strain-energy quantities extracted from the area under complete stress-strain curve of rocks in uniaxial compressive tests is proposed herein to study drilling performance by rock brittleness capacity. This brittleness index takes into account post-peak instability in uniaxial compression as post-peak instability of rock during compression can be treated as a manifestation of rock brittleness. That is, an increase in the post-peak energy indicates an increase of stability (i. e. a decrease in brittleness or increase in ductility). In the same manner, a dramatic decrease of post-peak energy indicates less stability of the failure process (i. e. an increase in brittleness). In this view, advanced laboratory experiments on strength and deformability of soft-to-hard rock types (UCS is ranging from 7 to 215 MPa) were carried out. The compressive tests complied with the application of a prescribed constant lateral strain-rate as a feedback signal to control the axial load which was found to be a suitable loading rate to measure the complete stress-strain response for the rocks. The new brittleness index developed herein describes a monotonic and unambiguous scale of brittleness with increasing pre-peak strength parameters such as crack damage stress and peak stress as well as deformation parameters such as the tangent Youngâs modulus of rock. This outcome becomes relevant in order to better understand material brittleness associated with the progressive fracture process characterised by the typical threshold damage stresses, peak stress and the elasticity parameters. The brittleness index scale indicates that a higher brittleness index means that rock is more brittle which corresponds to higher strength rocks. In order to reliably estimate drilling performance both tool-rock interaction laws along with a proper rock brittleness index are required to be implemented. In this study the performance of a single PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) cutter cutting and different drilling methods including PDC rotary drilling, roller-cone <b>rotary</b> <b>drilling</b> and <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> were investigated. To investigate drilling performance by rock strength properties, laboratory PDC cutting tests were performed on soft-to-hard rocks to obtain cutting parameters. In addition, results of laboratory and field drilling on different rocks found elsewhere in literature were used. Laboratory and field cutting and drilling test results were coupled with values of a new rock brittleness index proposed herein and developed upon energy dissipation extracted from the complete stress-strain curve in uniaxial compression. To quantify cutting and drilling performance, the intrinsic specific energy in rotary-cutting action, i. e. the energy consumed in pure cutting action, and drilling penetration rate values in percussive action were used. The results show that the new energy-based brittleness index successfully describes the performance of the studied cutting and drilling methods. Thesis (Ph. D.)
