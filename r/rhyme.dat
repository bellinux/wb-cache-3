5|$|In many languages, {{including}} modern European {{languages and}} Arabic, poets use <b>rhyme</b> in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, {{the use of}} structural <b>rhyme</b> is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional <b>rhyme</b> schemes. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use <b>rhyme.</b> <b>Rhyme</b> entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part {{under the influence of}} the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used <b>rhyme</b> extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable <b>rhyme</b> schemes.|$|E

5|$|It {{is claimed}} that the word orange has no true <b>rhyme.</b> There are, however, several half rhymes or near-rhymes, {{as well as some}} proper nouns and {{compound}} words or phrases that <b>rhyme</b> with it. This lack of rhymes has inspired many humorous poems and songs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rhyme</b> {{is made up}} of quatrains, with a rhyming {{scheme of}} abcb (with {{occasional}} internal rhymes), using falling rhymes (where the rhyming sound is on a relatively unstressed syllable: de-emphasising the <b>rhyme)</b> and a trochaic rhythm (with the stress falling on the first of a pair of syllables), known as a ballad form, which is common in nursery rhymes. The melody commonly associated with the <b>rhyme</b> was first recorded by the composer and nursery <b>rhyme</b> collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs (1870). The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 10266.|$|E

5|$|Humpty Dumpty is a {{character}} in an English nursery <b>rhyme,</b> probably originally a riddle {{and one of the}} best known in the English-speaking world. He is typically portrayed as a personified egg, though he is not explicitly described as such. The first recorded versions of the <b>rhyme</b> date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.|$|E

5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that no single}} English word is a true <b>rhyme</b> for orange, though there are half rhymes such as hinge, lozenge, syringe, flange, Stonehenge, or porridge. Although this property {{is not unique to}} the word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of <b>rhyme</b> for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.|$|E

5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by <b>rhyme</b> or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which <b>rhyme</b> or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E
5|$|The line Ashes, Ashes {{in colonial}} {{versions}} of the <b>rhyme</b> is claimed to refer variously to cremation of the bodies, the burning of victims' houses, or blackening of their skin, and the theory has been adapted {{to be applied to}} other {{versions of the}} <b>rhyme.</b> In its various forms, the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used elsewhere to make oblique reference to the plague.|$|E

5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater weight {{on trying to}} {{convey a sense of}} the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style <b>rhyme</b> schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese <b>rhyme</b> scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhyme</b> {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in <b>rhyme.</b> The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|Some poetry {{types are}} {{specific}} to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may {{think of it as}} written in lines based on <b>rhyme</b> and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing <b>rhyme</b> or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.|$|E
