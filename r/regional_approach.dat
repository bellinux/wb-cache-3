5|$|A {{study by}} Arima et al. {{published}} in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling {{to provide the}} first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to soy production. Previously, the indirect impacts of soy crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a global scale, while the study took a <b>regional</b> <b>approach.</b> The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for cattle production on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC in measuring the carbon footprint of soy crops, whether produced for biofuels or other end-uses.|$|E

He vowed to increase the agency's role in emerging business markets, bring more information- and technology-based companies into the organization, grow the regional business base, and engage with government partners. Cunningham spent {{the first six months}} of his tenure meeting with Lehigh Valley stakeholders and business leaders, identifying their needs and concerns. He then commissioned Garner Economics, an Atlanta-based economic consulting firm, to conduct an analysis of the region and recommend economic development and marketing strategies for the Lehigh Valley. The study identified the economic strengths and weaknesses of the region and defined a <b>regional</b> <b>approach</b> for development and growth. LVEDC also adopted a three-year strategic plan in 2014 outlining the organization's mission, vision, values, principles, and priorities.|$|E
40|$|Influential immigrant-receiving country {{actors have}} long {{articulated}} {{the need for}} a comprehensive approach to immigration policy. However, {{even in the midst of}} immigration policy failure, immigrant receiving countries have tended to not implement comprehensive approaches. This thesis classifies comprehensive <b>approaches</b> into <b>regional</b> and unilateral <b>approaches</b> and asks: what factors explain immigrant receiving country marginalization of <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to immigration policy with immigrant-sending countries? Three factors can explain immigrant-receiving country marginalization of <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to immigration policy with immigrant-sending countries: political salience, interests and institutions. This thesis's explanatory model incorporates the political salience of immigration as the independent variable, interests and institutions as mediating variables, and the marginalization of <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to immigration policy as the dependent variable. First, this thesis hypothesizes that during shifts from low to high political salience of immigration, immigrant-receiving countries exhibit a tendency to marginalize <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to immigration policy. Second, the relative marginalization of <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to immigration policy across liberal democratic immigrant-receiving countries can be explained by key constraints: (1) convergence in political, economic and legal interests held by influential immigrant-receiving and immigrant-sending country actors towards <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to immigration policy; (2) insulation of immigrant-receiving country immigration agencies through internal constraints, including the immigrant-receiving country regime type; and (3) insulation of immigrant receiving country immigration agencies through external constraints, including bilateral and regional institutionalization. This thesis applies the Mexico-US and Morocco-Spain dyads to the explanatory model and explores their immigration policy experiences utilizing a process-tracing approach that considers political discourse and policy implementation stages of the public policy cycle. Ultimately, there is a relationship between the political salience of immigration and the marginalization of <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to immigration policy. Interest and institution-based constraints help to explain why Spain did not marginalize <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to immigration policy with Morocco to the same extent as the US with Mexico.

Fernow had been Pinchot's predecessor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry before leaving in 1898 {{to become the first}} Dean of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. Schenck was Pinchot's successor at the Biltmore Estate (widely recognized as the [...] "cradle of American forestry") and founder of the Biltmore Forest School on Biltmore Estate.

2500|$|One common {{feature of}} almost all {{resolved}} disputes is that the negotiations had a “need-based” instead of a “right–based” paradigm. Irrigable lands, population, technicalities of projects define [...] "needs". The success of a need-based paradigm {{is reflected in the}} only water agreement ever negotiated in the Jordan River Basin, which focuses in needs not on rights of riparians. In the Indian subcontinent, irrigation requirements of Bangladesh determine water allocations of The Ganges River. A need based, <b>regional</b> <b>approach</b> focuses on satisfying individuals with their need of water, ensuring that minimum quantitative needs are being met. It removes the conflict that arises when countries view the treaty from a national interest point of view, move away from the zero-sum approach to a positive sum, integrative approach that equitably allocated the water and its benefits.|$|E

40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>approaches</b> to EU energy {{policies}} have been termed the ‘Schengenisation’ of energy, making reference to the Schengen Convention eliminating intra-European border controls. They aim to hone the effectiveness of EU energy policy objectives through enhanced policy coordination at the regional scale. Typically, this includes energy market integration while accounting for member states’ continued deployment of national-level policy instruments regarding the appropriate energy mix and the security of energy supply, which is foreseen in the EU Treaty. This report explores the potential for such <b>regional</b> <b>approaches.</b> It assesses lessons from existing initiatives, regional energy arrangements such as the Danube Energy Forum, the Mediterranean Energy Forum, the Pentalateral Energy Forum, the North Seas Countries’ Offshore Grid Initiative and the Nordic Co-operation partnership, to determine whether regional energy initiatives are an efficient, effective and politically acceptable approach toward reaching three EU energy policy objectives: competitiveness, supply security and sustainability. <b>Regional</b> <b>approaches</b> could possibly {{play an important role}} for governing EU renewables policy, which the European Commission has identified in the 2030 climate and energy framework as an important element for governance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{detailed}} comparison {{of local and}} <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> for flood frequency analyses, with a special emphasis {{on the effects of}} (a) the information on extreme floods used in the analysis (historical data or recent extreme floods observed at ungauged sites), and (b) the assumptions associated with <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> (statistical homogeneity of considered series, independence of observations). The results presented are based on two case studies: the Ardèche and Argens rivers regions in south-east of France. Four approaches are compared: 1 - local analysis based on continuous measured series, 2 - local analysis with historical information, 3 - regional index-flood analysis based on continuous series, 4 - regional analysis involving information on extremes (including both historical floods and recent floods observed at ungauged sites). The inference approach used is based on a GEV distribution and a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach for parameters estimation. The comparison relies both on (1) available observed datasets and (2) Monte Carlo simulations in order to evaluate the effects of sampling variability and to analyze the possible influence of regional heterogeneities. The results indicate that a relatively limited level of regional heterogeneity, which may not be detected through homogeneity tests, may significantly affect the performances of <b>regional</b> <b>approaches.</b> These results also illustrate the added value of information on extreme floods, historical floods or recent floods observed at ungauged sites, in both local and <b>regional</b> <b>approaches.</b> As far as possible, gathering such information and incorporating it into flood frequency studies should be promoted. Finally, the presented Monte Carlo simulations appear as an interesting analysis tool for adapting the estimation strategy to the available data for each specific case study...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea has}} gained ground {{in recent years}} that, as conﬂicts in the {{countries}} of the Great Lakes Region are strongly interlinked, <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> are necessary to resolve them. This interest in regional dimensions of conﬂict and peacebuilding also gains currency {{in other parts of the}} world. Attention to <b>regional</b> <b>approaches</b> is reﬂected in the efforts of international organisations and donors to promote civil society peacebuilding. They assume that regional cooperation and exchange between civil society organisations contribute to peace, and provide an alternative to single-country interventions or regional diplomatic initiatives. This paper explores how such assumptions work out in practice. Experiences in the Great Lakes Region show that local and international organisations have diffculty in analysing the regional character of conﬂict and arriving at collaborative regional strategies. Moreover, local civil society organisations are deeply embedded in the politics of regional conﬂict. Consequently, the shift to <b>regional</b> peacebuilding <b>approaches</b> remains more theoretical than practical. This paper suggests that international supporting organisations need to adjust their ambitions in regional peacebuilding, but nonetheless have roles in fostering regional identiﬁcation among civil society organisations...|$|R
