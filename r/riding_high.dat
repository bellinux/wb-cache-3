25|$|In 1924, <b>riding</b> <b>high</b> as Speaker of the House of the Oregon State Legislature, Kubli {{left his}} seat {{to attempt a}} run for the United States Senate, running as a {{conservative}} alternative to progressive Republican incumbent Senator Charles McNary. The effort proved unsuccessful. He attempted a political comeback in 1926 in a race for the Oregon Senate but was once again defeated.|$|E

He then rocks back and forth, {{stimulating}} her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.|$|E

25|$|It {{was heavily}} rumored by Japanese media, in 1992 and 1993, that Mitsubishi Motors {{intended}} a hostile acquisition of Honda. While Mitsubishi was <b>riding</b> <b>high</b> off of profitable vehicles {{such as the}} Diamante and Pajero, Honda was caught off-guard with the SUV and truck boom and was losing focus after the illness and later death of its founder. However, Honda CEO Nobuhiko Kawamoto took drastic steps, such as exiting Formula 1 and discontinuing unprofitable vehicles to avert a Mitsubishi takeover, which proved effective.|$|E
25|$|After Arakan, Minkhaung was <b>riding</b> <b>high.</b> He {{was greatly}} {{impressed}} by his son's performance, and wanted to make him his heir apparent. With the advice of Min Yaza, he sent away Tarabya's eldest son and potential rival to the throne Min Nyo to Kalay, a frontier state by the Manipuri border, as governor. He tried to appease his brother Theiddat, governor of Sagaing, by giving him command of the Northern Cavalry. The king then appointed Minye Kyawswa his heir apparent, and married him to Saw Min Hla, a cousin of the groom.|$|E
25|$|On 18 February 2013, with Swindon <b>riding</b> <b>high</b> in League One and in {{contention}} {{for a second}} consecutive promotion, Di Canio announced his resignation, alleging mistreatment {{by the board of}} directors, including the sale of Matt Ritchie behind his back, and the financial instability of the club at the time. In his place came Kevin MacDonald who had previously held caretaker roles at Leicester City and Aston Villa. MacDonald guided Swindon to the League One play-offs; however, they were knocked out after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Brentford. On 13 July 2013, MacDonald left Swindon Town by mutual consent, only three weeks {{before the start of the}} 2013–14 season and only five months after taking the Swindon job.|$|E

25|$|A major {{landmark}} in San Bruno {{for many years}} was Tanforan Racetrack, which opened in 1899. Such famous racehorses as Seabiscuit and Citation raced there. Famed Hollywood director Frank Capra filmed scenes for two of his films, Broadway Bill and <b>Riding</b> <b>High,</b> at the racetrack. For six months in 1942, it served {{as one of the}} main Bay Area centers for those forced into Japanese American internment, processing about 8000 Japanese before they were sent out to larger facilities in the desert of Utah and Manzanar in Owens Valley. The track closed in 1964 and was about to be demolished, when it was destroyed in a major fire on July 31, 1964. The Shops at Tanforan mall was later built on the site; surrounding city streets were named for some of the racehorses who appeared at Tanforan.|$|E
25|$|A {{victory in}} their FA Cup fifth-round replay sent Middlesbrough {{into the home}} match with Liverpool with {{optimism}} that their disastrous run of form in the league would finally come to an end, and their hopes came true. Liverpool were <b>riding</b> <b>high</b> in second place, while Boro began the day in second bottom. A stroke of luck put the home side ahead as Xabi Alonso diverted the ball into his own net from a corner. Tuncay doubled the advantage in the second half, and they could have had more as the visitors left themselves open at the back {{as they tried to}} find a way back. Brad Jones kept a fourth consecutive home clean sheet and Boro moved out of the relegation zone with their 2–0 win, while Liverpool had now failed to win at the Riverside for seven seasons.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on 9 April Bruun was alerted {{by the local}} police and customs {{officials}} {{of the presence of}} Roda. The officials were suspicious of the ship, as the crew claimed she was loaded with 7,000 tonnes of coke despite the ship appearing to be a passenger/cargo vessel and was <b>riding</b> <b>high</b> in the water for such a heavy cargo. The ship's hatches were blocked by being covered with coke, preventing inspection. The suspicion was further heightened by reports coming in of neutrality violations taking place in Eastern Norway. By 01:05 customs officers boarded Æger and conferred with Bruun about the situation. After meeting with the police, Bruun ordered an inspection of Roda. Before despatching a seven-strong boarding crew led by his second-in-command to Roda, Bruun was approached by the German consulate in Stavanger, whose representatives requested to be let on board the German ship, requests which Bruun rejected. Before boarding Roda, Bruun spoke with his commanding officer, Admiral Carsten Tank-Nielsen on the telephone. Tank-Nielsen supported Bruun's decision to inspect the German ship. Tank-Nielsen also told Bruun to act on his own judgement in case the military situation escalated in Norway. The military commander in Stavanger, Colonel Gunnar Spørck, had also requested that Roda be inspected, as he feared the ship carried German troops, but his message never reached Bruun.|$|E

500|$|The Americans, <b>riding</b> <b>high</b> {{following}} their gold medal {{victory at the}} 1980 Olympics were considered to have the potential of upsetting the stronger teams in the tournament.

[...] A resoundingly positive review came from the pen of Peter Reilly, writing in Hi-Fi/Stereo Review, who described the record as [...] "an enjoyable and well-made album which, if listened to closely enough, explains a good deal {{about what is going on}} around us." ...|$|E

500|$|By the mid-2000s, whale tails became {{common to}} celebrities, {{providing}} opportunities to the paparazzi.

On 17 September 2004, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera regularly were photographed with thong straps <b>riding</b> <b>high</b> above their low-rise jeans. And even usually tasteful Halle Berry succumbed to the thong craze by attending an awards show with bejeweled thong straps peeking out from above her miniskirt."

500|$|Burnside {{offered to}} resign his {{commission}} altogether but Lincoln declined, stating {{that there could}} still {{be a place for}} him in the army. Thus, he was placed back {{at the head of the}} IX Corps and sent to command the Department of the Ohio, encompassing the states of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. This was a quiet area with little activity, and the President reasoned that Burnside could not get himself into too much trouble there. However, antiwar sentiment was <b>riding</b> <b>high</b> in the Western states as they had traditionally carried on a great deal of commerce with the South, and there was little in the way of abolitionist sentiment there or a desire to fight for the purpose of ending slavery. Burnside was thoroughly disturbed by this trend and issued a series of orders forbidding [...] "the expression of public sentiments against the war or the Administration" [...] in his department; this finally climaxed with General Order No. 38, which declared that [...] "any person found guilty of treason will be tried by a military tribunal and either imprisoned or banished to enemy lines".|$|E
500|$|While in Los Angeles in June 1971, {{and after}} being {{made aware of}} the gravity of the {{situation}} in what was then known as East Pakistan by friend and musician Ravi Shankar, George Harrison set about organising two fundraising concerts at Madison Square Garden, New York, to aid the war-ravaged and disaster-stricken country. In the middle of these hurried preparations, he composed the song [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] in order to call further attention to the Bengalis' cause, and rush-released it as a charity single four days before the shows. <b>Riding</b> <b>high</b> with the recent success of his All Things Must Pass triple album, Harrison then headlined the all-star UNICEF benefit concerts, backed by a 24-piece band of musicians and singers, on Sunday, 1 August 1971. Equally notable were appearances by fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr and Bob Dylan, both of whom, like Harrison, had been mostly unavailable to concert audiences for several years. In Dylan's case, it was his first appearance on a major US concert stage in five years, and his participation in the event had been uncertain until he walked on for his segment midway through the afternoon show.|$|E
