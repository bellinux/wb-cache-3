For combined removal of liquid droplets and particulates, a wet electrostatic precipitator is used. Cleaned gases from the precipitator are compressed in a compressor. Part of the gas from the compressor is recycled to the bottom of the retort to cool the combusted shale (shale ash) and carry the recovered heat back up the retort. Cooled shale ash exits the retort through the discharge grate in the bottom of the retort. After processing, shale ash is disposed of. The liquid oil is separated from produced water and may be further refined into high quality products. The mixture of evolved gases and combustions gases is available for use as a low quality fuel gas for drying or power generation.|$|E

The distributor is a perforated plate that rotates around the vertical axis of the column. The formation of the bubbles from the <b>rotating</b> <b>distributor</b> is theoretically analyzed.

40|$|Introduction: In {{conventional}} farming, {{the soil}} and crop are considered uniform in different locations of the farm and the fertilizers are applied according to the average of soil needs with an additional percentage for safety (Loghavi, 2003). Non-essential chemical fertilizers in the field have harmful effects and social, economic and environmental concerns will increase. Many fertilizers go into the surface waters and ground waters and cause poisoning and environmental pollution without being absorbed by the plants. In variable rate technology, the soil fertilizer needs a map of {{all parts of the}} farm which is prepared with the GIS system. This map is uploaded on the computer before variable rate fertilizer machine starts. The computer continually controls the fertilizing rate for each part of the farm using a fertilizing map and global positioning system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to construct and evaluate a map-based variable rate fertilizer system that can be installed on a common fertilizer in Iran to be used as a variable rate system. Materials and methods: In common variable rate fertilizers, the rotational speed change of the distributor shaft is used to apply fertilizers. In this way, a DC motor is assembled on the main shaft of all distributors, which reduces the fertilizing accuracy. The reason for this is that there is no separation for units along the width of the fertilizer. Therefore, we used one DC motor for each distributor and another motor to rotate the agitator in the tank. System Set up: To design and select a suitable engine, the required torque for the rotation distributor shaft was measured by a torque meter and the amount of 2. 1 Nm was acquired for that. With regard to the maximum rate of nitrogen fertilizer for land and tractor speed at the time of fertilizing, the order of 350 kg per hectare and 8 km per hour, the maximum distributor shaft speed and power required to <b>rotate</b> <b>distributor</b> shaft were calculated to be 55 rpm and 6. 9 watts, respectively. The selected motor was rated 27. 5 watts, 24 volts and 7. 5 amperes (Since there were no 6. 9 watts motors in the market, a more powerful motor was selected). According to the gear ratio and motor speed, the speed of the distributor shaft was adjustable in the range of 0 to 65 rpm. To determine the speed and position with respect to the direction, a central encoder (E 50 S 8 - 600 - 6 -L- 5 model manufactured by Autonix Korea) was used on the ground wheel. The encoder had 600 pulses per revolution of the axis. Performance evaluation of the system: Performance evaluation of the system consists of two parts; static and moving tests. In static tests, the purpose was the determination of the fertilizer loss (in grams), due to changes in distributor speed as well as the accuracy of the electromechanical control system according to the command values sent to the device. Results of this part were used for the calibration of the device. In motion tests: In motion tests, the assessment of fertilizer loss was due to values set in a given situation and the accuracy of planted fertilizer in place (delay and acceleration) is reviewed. The delay is found by the determination of the distance that the fertilizer was placed after the desired location on the ground and the acceleration is found by the determination of the distance that the fertilizer is placed before the desired location on the ground. Results and discussion: The distributor flow rate on F 0 valve position was measured for different rotation speeds. The correlation (linear regression) between the planted fertilizer and rotation speed of distributor shaft (rpm) were 0. 99 for y= 71. 636 x+ 75. 182. So, it can be deduced that these two parameters have a good linear correlation. The results achieved from diagrams and regression model were used in the programming of the system control unit. Thus, by reading the distributors motor speed, the amount of fertilizer can be calculated and the amount of used fertilizer according to the need of the farm in each part is controlled.

The frequency domain analysis suggests some kind of local structuring of fluidized bed dynamics imposed by the distributor motion.

This work evaluates {{the performance of}} this new design, considering pressure drop, Δp, and quality of fluidization. Bed fluidization was easily achieved with the proposed device, improving the solid mixing {{and the quality of}} fluidization. In order to examine the effect of the rotational speed of the distributor plate on the hydrodynamic behavior of the bed, minimum fluidization velocity, Umf, and pressure fluctuations were analyzed.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was aimed at}} studying the hydrodynamic behaviour of fluidization in an unconventional fluidized bed geometry consisting of a vertically orientated annular space. It was hypothesized that by using multiple gas injectors, orientated tangentially to the annulus walls, induced rotating fluid bed behaviour would occur in the annulus. Annular fluidized beds with induced rotating fluid bed behaviour would ensure complete lateral mixing of solids and gas-solids, and offer the additional advantage that the feed inlet to the fluidized bed can be positioned at a single location. A physical model, constructed of two Perspex tubes, was used to study the behaviour of a fluidized bed in an annulus with various bed materials and gas distributor designs. In order to study the hydrodynamics of the annular fluidized bed in more detail, representative 2 -dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models were also simulated. In experiments conducted with multiple tangential air injectors, induced rotating fluid bed behaviour was not observed throughout {{the entire range of}} superficial gas velocities tested with any bed material in the annulus. Induced rotating fluid bed behaviour was not observed even after a reduction in the air injector diameter and the addition of a secondary blower. It was concluded that the centrifugal forces were significantly less than initially anticipated with this air distributor design. In addition, it was also concluded that regions of stationary bed material located directly behind the air injectors significantly impeded the momentum transfer between the moving air and bed material, preventing any bed rotation in the annulus. In the experiments conducted using the overlapping metal leaves air distributor design, stationary regions of bed material were also observed on top of the overlapping metal leaves. These regions were significantly smaller than the regions observed directly behind the tangential air injectors. Unfortunately, induced rotating fluid bed behaviour was not observed with any of the bed materials throughout the entire range of superficial gas velocities tested. It was therefore concluded that the vertical and tangential components (?????????? and ??????????) of the air velocity flowing through the overlapping metal leaves were insufficient to result in uniform fluidization or the desired induced rotating bed behaviour in the annulus. In order to overcome the problems experienced with the overlapping metal leaves air distributor design, a new air distributor was designed and printed 3 -dimensionally to have double the number of slits for the fluidizing air to flow out of. Although induced rotating fluid bed behaviour was once again not observed, uniform bubbling fluidization was apparent during experiments conducted with river sand and poppy seeds as the bed material in the annulus. This observation implied that the vertical component (??????????) of the air velocity flowing through the slits was sufficient to achieve uniform fluidization in the annulus, significantly increasing the mixing effects of the bed material. However, the tangential component (??????????) of the velocity was still insufficient to induce any rotation of the fluid bed. Based on the sensitivity studies performed, a minimum percentage open area of 1. 6 % was recommended to ensure uniform fluidization of the bed material in the annulus. It was hypothesized that once uniform fluidization is achieved, induced rotating fluid bed behaviour is likely to occur with sufficient fluidizing air flowing in the tangential direction, since a uniformly fluidized bed experiences little resistance to flow and/or movement. In order to test this hypothesis, it was recommended that future experiments should be conducted using slit (or hole) angles below 45 ° and with blowers able to achieve higher superficial gas velocities (> 1 m/s) in the annulus. The Euler-Euler Model Laminar Flow Interface in COMSOL Multiphysics® software was used to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of the annular fluidized bed in more detail. The simulation results proved beneficial since the CFD models could illustrate several hydrodynamic properties not visibly obvious in the experiments conducted with the Perspex model. However, it is recommended that more accurate CFD models of the annular fluidized bed should be developed that model the dispersed phase as a particle size distribution and model the annulus in 3 D, and that a turbulent CFD model, capable of simulating high Reynolds numbers, be used. Such a CFD model can then be used to test porous plate-type distributors and variations in slit or hole angles with high superficial gas velocities in the annulus, as previously recommended. If induced rotating fluid bed behaviour is successfully modelled using CFD, the model can then be used to check whether sufficient contact time is available for the pyrolysis reactions to occur at the recommended higher superficial gas velocities. If not, the design concept of having an induced rotating fluid bed in the annular pyrolysis chamber of the new fluidized bed fast pyrolyser could be impractical, and in such an event, a <b>rotating</b> gas <b>distributor</b> plate should be considered instead.

The object size and density differ from those of the inert solids that conform the bed. Examples of objects moving in a bubbling fluidized bed include passive particles, catalysts and reactants. The rotation modifies the bed dynamics in the surroundings of the distributor and affects the motion of the object within the bed. A set of experiments was carried out in a lab-scale cylindrical bed, equipped with a perforated plate distributor that can rotate at around 1 Hz, for different bed aspect ratios, gas velocities, and object characteristics. Sizes were far larger than that of the solids of the dense phase and densities ranged from half the bed density to values around it. The experiments were video recorded, capturing the surface of the bed from above. As have often been noted, objects might remain in stagnant regions near the distributor and be "lost" or precluded to circulate.

40|$|What is a {{trickling}} filter? A {{trickling filter}} (TF) is a {{wastewater treatment system}} that biodegrades organic matter and {{can also be used}} to achieve nitrification. The wastewater trickles through a circular bed of coarse stones or plastic material. A <b>rotating</b> <b>distributor</b> (a rotating pipe with several holes across it) evenly distributes the wastewater from above the bed. The microorganisms in the wastewater attach themselves to the bed (also known as the filter media), which is covered with bacteria. The bacteria break down the organic waste and remove pollutants from the wastewater. When excess nutrients became a concern, it became necessary to adapt “conventional ” sewage treatment systems to meet the increased oxygen demand placed on receiving waters by high ammonia nitrogen concentrations in wastewater effluents. TFs and other attached-growth processes proved to be well-suited for the removal of ammonia nitrogen by oxidizing it to nitrate nitrogen (nitrification). What is nitrification? Nitrogen exists in many forms in the environment and can enter aquatic systems from either natural or human-generated sources. Some of the primary direct sources or transport mechanisms of nitrogen from sewage are listed below: • Untreated sewage—direct discharge • Publically owned treatment works (POTW) effluent—direct discharge, land application • POTW waste solids—direct discharge, land application • Septic tanks and leach fields—groundwater movement Nitrification/denitrification is the process of converting nitrogen into a form in which it can ultimately be removed. In the first step of this process, influent ammonia nitrogen is oxidized to nitrate nitrogen. At this point, the nitrogen has merely changed forms and has not yet been removed from the wastewater. In the second step, denitrification, nitrate nitrogen is A General Overview converted into nitrogen gas that vents to the atmosphere naturally. The two general types of TF nitrification configurations are single-stage and two-(or separate-) stage. • Single-stage: Carbon oxidation and nitrification take place in a single TF unit...|$|E
40|$|Fluidized {{beds are}} used {{for a wide variety}} of {{processes}} due to its high rates of heat and mass transfer. Due to that, fluidized beds {{are used for}} a variety of applications ranging from the gasification or combustion of biomass, to coating and drying processes. All these industrial applications show the main influence of the zone close to the distributor on the bed dynamics. In this way, a non-homogeneous mixing in this zone between dense and gas phases leads to fluidization problems such as segregation of particles, formation of dead zones, heterogeneous distribution of temperatures inside the bed and appearance of channels or preference paths for the flowing fluidization gas. These phenomena usually cause the process stop or the bed defluidization, which increase operational costs. Therefore, it is necessary to study the bed dynamics in order to be able to detect these fluidization problems, and modify somehow the hydrodynamic structure of the bed. This PhD thesis develops the methods needed to study and control the behaviour of a bed equipped with a <b>rotating</b> <b>distributor</b> as a tool to change the bed dynamics. These approaches were developed using a lab-scale facility with an electrical motor coupled to the distributor, capable of imposing its rotation in the horizontal plane. The experimental conditions of poor fluidization quality typically shown in industrial applications are studied to assess the potential use of the <b>rotating</b> <b>distributor</b> on the bed dynamics. Punctual injections of water over the bed surface were carried out to replicate the experimental conditions reported in literature. This water injection improved the development of dead zones over the distributor plate, facilitating the bed defluidization. The defluidization and re-fluidization processes were characterized using pressure fluctuation signals recorded during the experiments. Methods of analysis in the time domain, standard deviation, and in the frequency domain, Welch 0 s power spectrum, transient spectrogram and wide band energy, were employed to describe the defluidization and re-fluidization processes. By using the <b>rotating</b> <b>distributor,</b> the fluidization quality was improved due to its breakage effect on the agglomerates and channels settled over of the distributor. Such an improvement was shown for both shallow and deep beds. Therefore, the distributor rotation introduces a dynamic structure into the gas-solid fluidized bed. Moreover, concerning the methods of signal analysis, the channels appearance is related to an energy increase of the high frequencies within the pressure signal. The approach initially employed for the computation of the wide band energy was based on the visual division of the frequency domain. However, the results obtained using this method are influenced by the observer, specially if the quality of the measured signal is low. Therefore, an unbiased methodology is proposed for the systematic division of the frequency domain. The approach is based on the statistic distribution fitting of the power spectrum cumulative energy. Hence, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to compare the cumulative energy with the statistic distribution. The differences that appear at the distribution tails when comparing the cumulative energy with the statistic distribution discriminate the cut-off frequencies that separate the three frequency regions of the frequency domain. For the operation conditions considered, the Student 0 s t-distribution was used to fit the cumulative energy distribution. The reliability of the method to divide the frequency domain was shown for different fluidization velocities, changing the bed aspect ratio and using different pressure probes. Water-induced defluidization tests were conducted to illustrate the use of the wide band energy as a monitoring tool. Both visual and statistical approaches were compared. The results showed that the energy contained within the frequency regions obtained by the visual method is not able to detect changes in the bed aspect ratio or the beginning of the <b>rotating</b> <b>distributor.</b> On the other hand, the sensitivity exhibited by the proposed frequency division approach, for the range of fluidization conditions tested, encouraged the use of the energy contained in these regions as a diagnostic tool in fluidized bed processes. In order to determine whether or not the bed behavior has changed, the implementation of a monitoring system capable of ensuring the process operation at a certain level of efficiency is required. Therefore, an on-line monitoring methodology is proposed. This approach is based on the Statistical Process Control theory and it is applied to different variables, which were obtained through the analysis of the measured pressure signals. The statistical treatment of the variables allowed the definition of the control state through the study of the sample size and its underlying distribution. The good results showed by the different control variables encouraged the use of the proposed control scheme to any monitoring variable. Finally, once the high influence of the <b>rotating</b> <b>distributor</b> on the bed dynamics was proved, and the analysis and monitoring tools needed were developed, a practical application is presented. The paste drying process with inert particles as a support medium is analyzed recording humidity and temperature measurements together with pressure fluctuation signals. The experiments consisted on the paste-drop, which was composed of a mixture of silica sand and water, to a bed of dry silica sand particles. In this way, the paste tends to be homogeneously dispersed throughout the bed, beginning the drying process. The multi-resolution approach of the pressure fluctuation signals showed the effect of the paste-drop, relating the drying periods to the bed dynamics. To compare the results obtained from the humidity and temperature measurements with those of the pressure signals, a Statistical Process Control approach is applied to define the time needed to recover the bed dynamic. For the static distributor, similar values of the drying and recuperation times are obtained for shallow beds, while for deeper beds more time is needed to complete the drying than to recover the fluidization quality. For the <b>rotating</b> <b>distributor,</b> lower drying and dynamic times are needed for shallow and deep beds. Los lechos fluidizados se emplean en la industria debido a sus buenas propiedades de transferencia de calor y de masa. Esto hace que tengan un amplio rango de aplicaciones que comprende desde procesos de gasificación o combustión de biomasa hasta procesos de recubrimiento de partículas y procesos de secado. Todas estas aplicaciones tienen en común la importancia que tiene la zona adyacente al distribuidor sobre la dinámica del proceso. De esta forma, un mal mezclado entre las fases densa y gaseosa en esta zona induce la aparición de problemas como la segregación de partículas, la formación de zonas muertas en donde el mezclado es prácticamente inexistente, la mala distribución de temperaturas en el interior del lecho y la formación de canales o caminos preferentes a través de los cuales circula el gas de fluidización. Desde el punto de vista operativo, estos fenómenos suelen producir la parada o defluidización del lecho, con sus consecuentes costes económicos. Por ello, resulta necesario estudiar la dinámica del proceso para que, en caso de que aparezcan estos problemas operacionales, se pueda influir sobre la dinámica del lecho. La presente tesis doctoral desarrolla los métodos para estudiar y controlar la dinámica de un lecho que dispone de un distribuidor rotatorio como herramienta para modificar el comportamiento del lecho. Estas herramientas fueron desarrolladas utilizando una instalación de escala laboratorio equipada con un motor eléctrico acoplado al plato distribuidor, lo que permite su giro en el plano horizontal. Las condiciones experimentales de mal mezclado y baja calidad en la fluidización reportadas en la literatura fueron estudiadas para comprobar el efecto del giro del distribuidor sobre la dinámica del lecho. Estas condiciones de mala fluidización se consiguieron mediante la inyección de agua a la superficie del lecho cuando éste operaba en régimen de burbujeo. La inyección de líquido produjo la formación de aglomerados que, debido a su mayor densidad, tendieron a posarse sobre el distribuidor. De esta forma, aparecieron zonas muertas y canales produciendo la defluidización del lecho. La descripción de estos procesos de defluidización y posterior recuperación del régimen de burbujeo se realizó empleando las medidas de las fluctuaciones de presión en el gas fluidizante. Estas señales fueron estudiadas utilizando métodos de análisis en el dominio del tiempo, con la desviación típica, y en el dominio de la frecuencia mediante el espectro de potencias de Welch, el espectro transitorio y la energía contenida en las regiones frecuenciales. Para este estado de defluidización, se demostró que el giro del distribuidor mejora el proceso de recuperación comparado con las condiciones convencionales de distribuidor estático. Los resultados demostraron que el giro rompe los aglomerados y canales que aparecen sobre el distribuidor, imponiendo una estructura sobre la dinámica de la fluidización. Esta mejora en el proceso de re-fluidización se comprobó para lechos profundos y poco profundos. Respecto a los métodos de análisis de la señal, se relacionaron los procesos de formación de canales con la codificación de la energía de la señal a altas frecuencias. El método inicialmente empleado para estimar la energía contenida en las regiones frecuenciales utilizaba la inspección visual del espectro de potencias para dividir el dominio de frecuencias. Este método para dividir el dominio frecuencial está influenciado por el observador, lo que puede dar lugar a errores significativos especialmente si la señal de presión tiene ruido. Por ello, se propuso una metodología para dividir sistemáticamente el dominio de frecuencias. El procedimiento aproxima la distribución acumulada de energía del espectro de potencias a una distribución estadística. Después, el test de Kolmogorov- Smirnov determina cuáles son las zonas de coincidencia entre la distribución estadística y la distribución de energía acumulada de la señal. Usualmente la zona de coincidencia está centrada en el incremento de energía, mientras que las colas de la distribución quedan fuera de la aproximación. Para las condiciones experimentales consideradas, la distribución t-Student fue empleada para aproximar la distribución acumulada de energía. La fiabilidad del método fue demostrada utilizando sensores de presión de alta y baja calidad, y modificando la velocidad del gas y la relación de aspecto del lecho. Ensayos de defluidización inducida por la inyección de agua a la superficie del lecho fueron realizados para ilustrar el empleo de la energía contenida en las regiones frecuenciales como una herramienta de monitorización. Los resultados permitieron comparar el método de división visual con el método basado en la aproximación estadística. Se observó que la energía contenida en las regiones frecuenciales obtenidas de forma visual no era capaz de detectar cambios en la relación de aspecto o el inicio del giro del distribuidor. Por contra, la energía de las regiones frecuenciales de la t-Student varía en función de las condiciones experimentales, lo que facilita la identificación de procesos como la formación de canales o la defluidización del lecho. Para establecer si la dinámica del lecho ha cambiado es necesario definir una zona de control en la que se mantengan las condiciones de operación deseadas. Por ello, se propuso una metodología para la monitorización continua del estado del lecho. Esta metodología está basada en la teoría de control estadístico de procesos y fue aplicada a distintas variables obtenidas tras el análisis de la señal de presión para comprobar la aplicabilidad del método. Se obtuvo el tamaño de ventana de cada variable y la distribución estadística utilizada para calcular los límites de control. La buena sensibilidad mostrada por este esquema durante la monitorización de un proceso de secado estimula su empleo para cualquier tipo de variable. Por último, una vez se demostró que el giro del distribuidor tiene un efecto beneficioso en lechos con problemas de fluidización, y que se desarrollaron las herramientas de análisis y control necesarias, se estudió una aplicación práctica como es el secado de pastas, que están formadas por arena y agua. Siguiendo el procedimiento experimental descrito en la literatura, los experimentos consistieron en dejar caer la pasta a un lecho trabajando en régimen de burbujeo y formado por partículas secas de arena. De esta forma, la pasta tiende a romperse y dispersarse homogéneamente dentro del lecho, comenzando así el proceso de secado. Este proceso fue caracterizado utilizando medidas de temperatura y humedad del aire a la entrada y salida del lecho, junto con la medición de las señales de presión. El análisis multi-resolución de las señales de presión relacionó los periodos del secado con la dinámica del lecho. Por otro lado, el empleo del esquema SPC permitió definir el tiempo necesario para recuperar las condiciones de control tras el secado de la pasta. Este parámetro característico del proceso demostró que tanto el fin del secado como la recuperación de la dinámica ocurren simultáneamente en lechos poco profundos, mientras que para lechos profundos se recupera la dinámica antes de que finalice por completo el secado operando con el distribuidor estático. Por contra, el giro del distribuidor disminuye tanto el tiempo de secado como el necesario para la recuperación de la dinámica, igualando además el comportamiento de lechos profundos y poco profundos. Por tanto, se puede concluir que el giro del distribuidor mejora el proceso de secado.
