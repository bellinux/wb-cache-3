The gates themselves were closed fast, and the smaller ones on either side, intended for pedestrians, were fastened with a padlock. Wrayson stood for a moment looking through the bars into the park. The drive ran for half a mile perfectly straight, and then, taking an abrupt bend, passed upwards into the woods, amongst which was the château.|$|E

But we didn't wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see. We never stopped running till we got home. The old gentleman's eyes blazed a minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{collaborative}} use, and marking of locations in mobile workgroups, which are dispersed {{in a vast}} geographical area. We have performed fieldwork, investigating today's practice among bus drivers and road inspectors. To organize and conduct their working task {{there is a need}} for a shared understanding of their workspace. How the understandings are shared is what we pursue by looking at what sustains the stability of the "mobile-workplace" and the physical environment in which it occurs. The bus drivers and the road inspectors conduct ongoing mobile work in a <b>road</b> <b>setting.</b> It is not a fact of movement between different physical places, seeing that the continuous movement could be understood as the main activity itself. Still the participants actively attend to collaborative activities and relate to each other as members of a social space, a workplace. The movement of the participants illustrates these social similarities and differences, i. e. relations to colleagues, roadsides, road-users, and people far remote. While conducting this ongoing movement, participants continuously relate themselves and others to the physical environment. The "mobile-workplace" is kept stable through local adaptation and shifts of relations, locations and place. Still, the geographical locations and relations play a crucial part in the conceptualization of the social. An understanding of this space can be crucial when designing tools to support collaborative activities...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a starting point for those interested in using transportation modeling software in a rural <b>road</b> <b>setting.</b> An example problem will be offered, and the package that it will be demonstrated in is TRANPLAN Version 6. 20 (The Urban Analysis Group, Danville CA). It is assumed that the reader has a basic previous understanding of microcomputer hardware, software and operating systems. With this purpose in mind, this paper will also provide example code from TRANPLAN to illustrate various parts of the analysis process. Essentially this paper is a companion guide to the various sections of the TRANPLAN manual. Because of the applied nature of this task, only cursory discussion will be expended on the development of theory. References to several articles will be made instead.

40|$|A dynamic three–dimensional {{model of}} a tractor {{travelling}} through a half sine wave obstacle was developed considering bouncing, pitching, and rolling motions. Compared with the case of bouncing on a level <b>road,</b> <b>setting</b> the obstacle on a sideways slope under the upper side of the forwarding tractor could stimulates a much more dangerous scenario, which may lead to tractor overturn. In this model, the tractor was considered as a rigid body, except for the tires, which were regarded as spring–damper units. The entire passing–over process was divided into four periods as done by Yamamoto and Shimada (1957), and Takeda et al. (2010) for dissecting the influence of each specific travelling period on the tractor. Basic dimensional parameters and physical properties of the objective tractor, used as input parameters in our simulation, were cited directly {{from the work of}} Takeda et al. (2010). Dynamic behavior of the tractor was described by capturing the motion of its center of gravity, which includes vertical displacement, angle, and angular acceleration for the pitching and rolling phenomena. Using the Runge–Kutta method, the desired mathematical model was numerically simulated through programming in Visual Basic Application language within Microsoft Excel. Tractor dynamic predictions were presented as factors of forward constant speed and lateral slope. The simulation results show fluctuations and increase in danger levels owing to higher velocities and steep lateral slopes. Therefore, this model enables us to explore potential overturning judgment standards...|$|E
