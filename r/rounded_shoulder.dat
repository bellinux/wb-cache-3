This big-eyed lass with her nameless charm would bewitch even a borderman, unless he avoided her. So much he had not {{admitted}} until now. Love he had never believed could be possible for him. When she fell asleep her hand had slipped from his arm to his fingers, and now rested there lightly as a leaf. The contact was delight. The gentle night breeze blew a tress of hair across his lips.

60|$|Terga large, four-sided, {{with the}} {{internal}} growing surface (fig. 3 a´ b), almost diamond-shaped; basal angle blunt, rounded; exteriorly, from the apex to the basal angle there is a rather broad, very slight prominence, which bears the same relation to the carina and upper latus, as do the compound ridges on the scuta to the rostrum and upper latus. The {{upper part of the}} scutal margin forms a slightly-projecting, <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulder,</b> though variable in its degree of prominence, in relation to the variable depth of the recipient furrow in the scuta. Externally, parallel to the occludent margin, and close below the prominent shoulder, just mentioned, there is a slight and variable depression, extending up to the apex of the valve. This depression is due to the prominence, variable in degree, of the tergal edge of the recipient furrow in the scuta.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of shoulder postural impairments in 10 - 12 years old primary school students of Zahedan in 2005. One hundred-fifty three students participated in this descriptive study through multi-stage clustering sampling. The Level of shoulders (cm) and the <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulders</b> (cm) were measured using checkered board and board with red line in its center, respectively. Scapular symmetry (cm) was measured using Kibler test. The level of dominant shoulder was higher than non-dominant shoulder in 89. 7 % of right-handed students. Scapular asymmetry was not seen in zero (p = 0. 42) and 90 (p = 0. 3) degrees of shoulder abduction in dominant shoulders of the right handed students. <b>Rounded</b> <b>shoulders</b> were seen in 56. 2 % of students. Although, <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulders</b> was more common in 10 years old (in 61. 6 %) (p = 0. 002). Shoulder depression was seen in 61. 3 % of students that carrying shoulder bag (p = 0. 028). Present results showed that long term settling in abnormal posture with regard to flexibility of musculoskeletal system resulted in <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Also, carrying shoulder bag can lead to shoulder depression. The results support the effectiveness of proper postural and writing training for preventing shoulder postural impairments...|$|R

The style was inspired by Christian Dior's [...] "New Look" [...] collection, characterized by a below-mid-calf length, full-skirt, pointed bust, small waist, and <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulder</b> line. Summer and Day dresses became popular, as well as the pencil skirts and cardigans.|$|E

5000|$|... (Original description) The short, small, {{shell is}} polished, whitish and solid. It {{has a large}} protoconch of 1½ whorl and 3½ {{subsequent}} whorls. The suture is distinct, not appressed. The fasciole is inconspicuous. The whorls are moderately rounded. The aperture is about half the whole length. The axial sculpture consists of more or less obscure folds, stronger on the early whorls, seldom differentiated into distinct ribs, sometimes forming a <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulder</b> to the whorls. Beside these there are irregularly distributed incremental lines. There is no indication of any spiral sculpture. The aperture is narrow. The anal sulcus is hardly evident. The outer lip is straight, thin or very slightly thickened. The columella is straight, the axis not pervious.|$|E
5000|$|The {{notoriously}} large {{shell of}} Melo melo has a bulbous or nearly oval outline, {{with a smooth}} outer surface presenting distinguishable growth lines.

The columella has three or four long and easily distinguishable columellar folds. It has a wide aperture, nearly {{as long as the}} shell itself, yet this species is known to have no operculum. [...] The shell's spire is completely enclosed by the body whorl, which is inflated and quite large, and has a <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulder</b> with no spines. The apex is of smooth type.|$|E
5000|$|The minute, ovate {{shell is}} vitreous. Its length {{measures}} 1.7 mm.

5000|$|On February 12, 1947, Christian Dior {{launched}} the first {{collection of the}} House of Dior. The new collection went down in fashion history as the [...] "New Look". The signature shape was characterized by a below-mid-calf length, full-skirt, pointed bust, small waist, and <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulder</b> line. Resisted at first, especially in America, where fashion magazines showed padded shoulders until 1950, the radical new silhouette soon became immensely popular, influencing fashion and other designers {{for many years to}} come. The [...] "softness" [...] of the New Look was deceptive; the curved jacket peplum shaped over a high, rounded, curved shoulders, and full skirt of Dior's clothes relied on an inner construction of new interlining materials to shape the silhouette. This silhouette has drastically changed from its previous more masculine, stiff, triangular shape to a much more feminine form.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} very small, {{and it is}} one of the {{smallest}} of the endemic species found in the Cape Verde Islands. General profile is ventricosely conical, somewhat elongated with a <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Spire moderate, straight to slightly convex with 4-5 well defined cords on the flat to slightly convex sutural ramps. Sides of the last whorl are straight or slightly convex. Body whorl is smooth except for 8-10 spiral grooves that occupy almost the entire anterior third of the body whorl. Spire is predominantly white with alternating dark brown axial blotches. Last whorl is olive-green to light olive-green, normally with 3 interrupted spiral bands formed by well-defined white blotches occasionally arranged in zigzag or chevron shaped) tinged with brown to dark brown markings. Tip of anterior portion of last whorl is tinged with brown to very dark brown. Aperture is purplish-brown in fresh specimens with 2 distinct whitish bands: one located near mid-body and another, not so evident, just below the shoulder. Inner lip has a yellowish colour. Periostracum is thin, yellow, smooth and translucent.|$|E
50|$|The {{males of}} the species are 53 - 55 mm long and 8 mm wide, while females are of the same length but 8.5 mm in width. The colour is a bit {{different}} from A. magnus. The head have a deep median sulcus, which is sharply impressed and is extended between antennae and almost next to the posterior edge of the vertex. The vertex is swelled in front and is large. Their clypeus have 4 macrosetae, which are equidistant across the middle. The surface of the first segment is almost smooth and have dorsum of segments that are coriaceus and shining {{at the end of}} the body. The metazonites ventral surface is conic and tuberculate at the same time, and is located next to the keels, or rather to the posterior base which is next to it. Tubercles are continued throughout the surface and are advancing into the posterior margin. Segment 17 sternum is adjacent to the whole coxa which is elevated. The ridge is elongated and ends on anterior sterna, which have a rounded tubercle. The last segments sides are parallel and end up with a rounded and acute apex. The gonopods have a bent mesad branch, which goes over the opposite branch. The opening of the gonopod have a posterior with raised rim that ends into an angular and sometimes <b>rounded</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
