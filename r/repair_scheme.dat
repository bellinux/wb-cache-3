40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of <b>repairing</b> secret sharing <b>schemes,</b> i. e., schemes that encode a message into $n$ shares, {{assigned}} to $n$ nodes, so that any $n-r$ nodes can decode the message but any colluding $z$ nodes cannot infer any information about the message. In the event of node failures so that shares held by the failed nodes are lost, the system needs to be repaired by reconstructing and reassigning the lost shares to the failed (or replacement) nodes. This can be achieved trivially by a trustworthy third-party that receives the shares of the available nodes, recompute and reassign the lost shares. The interesting question, studied in the paper, is how to repair without a trustworthy third-party. The main issue that arises is repair security: how to maintain the requirement that any colluding $z$ nodes, including the failed nodes, cannot learn any information about the message, {{during and after the}} repair process? We solve this secure repair problem from the perspective of secure multi-party computation. Specifically, we design generic <b>repair</b> <b>schemes</b> that can securely repair any (scalar or vector) linear secret sharing schemes. We prove a lower bound on the repair bandwidth of secure <b>repair</b> <b>schemes</b> and show that the proposed secure <b>repair</b> <b>schemes</b> achieve the optimal repair bandwidth up to a small constant factor when $n$ dominates $z$, or when the secret sharing <b>scheme</b> being <b>repaired</b> has optimal rate. We adopt a formal information-theoretic approach in our analysis and bounds. A main idea in our schemes is to allow a more flexible repair model than the straightforward one-round repair model implicitly assumed by existing secure regenerating codes. Particularly, the proposed secure <b>repair</b> <b>schemes</b> are simple and efficient two-round protocols...|$|R

40|$|Timber {{has been}} a widely used {{construction}} material {{throughout the history of}} human development and it is still popular to this day. Timber frames are a common structural form used in historical and modern day structures. An effective means to connect timber members together is via bolts or dowels due to their high strength, ductile behaviour and flexibility in application. Such joints are, however, vulnerable and prone to damage especially during seismic attacks. In order to improve the performance and longevity of timber framed structures, it is necessary to develop simple but effective strengthening schemes for dowel-type timber joints. Additionally, strategies to repair and reinstate damaged joints are also required. The main objectives of this program of doctoral research are to (1) develop strengthening and <b>repair</b> <b>schemes</b> for bolted timber joints using advanced composite materials (i. e. carbon fibre reinforced polymer, CFRP) as well as traditional materials (i. e. steel plates, epoxies and mortars), and (2) investigate the effectiveness of the schemes in improving the seismic performance of timber frames. The strengthening and <b>repair</b> <b>schemes</b> are applied to single-bolt joints and tested under monotonic load. Optimal strengthening and <b>repair</b> <b>schemes</b> are then applied to moment resisting joints and the joints are subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. Finite element models are then assembled for the latter joint tests. The calibrated joint models are then used in finite element models of timber frames with varying number of storeys and support conditions. The seismic performances of the timber frames are investigated by conducting both nonlinear static and nonlinear time history analyses. The results of the experimental investigations and the finite element analyses show that the strengthening schemes can enhance the strength and stiffness of joints. Optimum strengthening schemes can also improve the seismic performance of timber frames. Based on the work arising from the program of research, future research needs are finally identified. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
