50|$|A very {{important}} {{feature in the}} aggregation of responses is that the combined responses of individuals will be more accurate than the responses of each individual included in the aggregation. Reliability theory in psychology (specifically, the <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the Spearman-Brown prediction formula) provides a mathematical estimate of the accuracy or validity of aggregated responses {{from the number of}} units being combined and the level of agreement among the units. In this case, accuracy of aggregated responses can be calculated from the number of subjects and the average Pearson correlation coefficient between all pairs of subjects (across questions).|$|E
5000|$|When {{the number}} of {{categories}} being used is small (e.g. 2 or 3), the likelihood for 2 raters to agree by pure chance increases dramatically.

The intraclass <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficients</b> for maximum jump height, force, and power were also assessed using the Kistler Quattro JumpÂ® force plate. METHODS: Ten healthy male college students, ages 22 to 34 years, volunteered to participate in this study. All subjects completed three individual testing sessions on three non-consecutive days. On each day the subjects completed one of three treatments (no stretch, ballistic stretch, and dynamic stretch). A paired samples t-test was used to test the effects of ballistic and dynamic stretching, respectively, on jumping height, force, and power performance scores. Hoyt 2 Ì 7 s analysis of variance model, (MSs-MSi) /MSs, was used to estimate the <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of jumping performance scores across three different trials.

50|$|Another {{important}} difference between CTT and G {{theory is that}} the latter approach takes into account how the consistency of outcomes may change if a measure is used to make absolute versus relative decisions. An example of an absolute, or criterion-referenced, decision would be when an individual's test score is compared to a cut-off score to determine eligibility or diagnosis (i.e. a child's score on an achievement test is used to determine eligibility for a gifted program). In contrast, an example of a relative, or norm-referenced, decision would be when the individual's test score is used to either (a) determine relative standing as compared to his/her peers (i.e. a child's score on a reading subtest is used to determine which reading group he/she is placed in), or (b) make intra-individual comparisons (i.e. comparing previous versus current performance within the same individual). The type of decision that the researcher is interested in will determine which formula should be used to calculate the generalizability coefficient (similar to a <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficient</b> in CTT).|$|E

Their religiocentrism scale comprises 33 items (for instance, [...] "I think my religion is nearer {{to the truth}} than any other" [...] and [...] "Most Moslems, Buddhists and Hindus are very stupid and ignorant"), with five-point Likert scale psychometric response options from [...] "Strongly agree" [...] (Scored 5) to [...] "Strongly disagree" [...] (1). To verify internal consistency among respondents, 11 items were reverse scored ("It makes no difference to me what religion my friends are" [...] is the converse of [...] "I think that it's better if you stick to friends of the same religion as your own"), resulting in a <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficient</b> of [...]88 among 154 first-year university students. The authors tested attitudes among Australian fifth-form students in two Catholic and two public schools, and discovered that neither ethnocentrism nor religiocentrism showed any correlation with religious background.

40|$|Aims. A {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effects of a standardized instructional videotape on training senior medical students to acceptable levels of reliability in performing several commonly used obsever dependent outcome measures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods. During a single day, six third-year medical students independently examined five patients with AS in predetermined order using a Latin Square design, before and after viewing a standardized videotape demonstrating 14 examination techniques. <b>Reliability</b> <b>coefficients</b> were calculated based on the variance components of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) table. Results. Prestandardization <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficients</b> were < 0. 80 for three measures. Following standardization 12 <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficients</b> exceeded 0. 80. For the majority of measures prestandardization <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficients</b> were high and no further improvement in reliability could be demonstrated. Conclusions. High levels of interobserver agreement were noted prior to viewing the instructional videotape.

With the exception of chest excursion, high levels of prestandardization reliability, by necessity, precluded the demonstration of significant effects from viewing the videotape. Nevertheless, the data indicate that senior medical students are capable of reliably performing quantitative measurement in AS. Recent surveys in Canada and Australia, showing a general lack of quantitative clinical measurement in the longitudinal follow up of AS outpatients by rheumatologists, suggest that the lack of quantitation is not due to inability to reliably perform the measurements...|$|R
