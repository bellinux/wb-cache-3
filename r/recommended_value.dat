5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the <b>recommended</b> <b>value.</b> Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E

They also have relatively high amounts of Vitamin B6. Fresh fruit is 94% water. Dried pepper fruit has a much different nutritional value due to the dehydration and concentration of vitamins and minerals.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A acute {{toxicity}} occurs {{when an individual}} ingests vitamin A in large amounts more than the daily <b>recommended</b> <b>value</b> in the threshold of 25,000 IU/kg or more. Often, the individual consumes about 3–4 times the RDA's specification. Toxicity of vitamin A {{is believed to be}} associated with the intervention methods used to upgrade vitamin A levels in the body such as food modification, fortification and supplementation, all of which are employed to combat vitamin A deficiency Toxicity is classified into two categories: acute and chronic toxicities. The former occurs few hours or days after ingestion of large amounts of vitamin A accidentally or via inappropriate therapy. The later toxicity (Chronic) takes place when about 4,000 IU/kg or more of vitamin A is consumed for a prolonged period of time. Symptoms associated with both toxicities include nausea, blurred vision, fatigue, weight-loss, menstrual abnormalities etc.|$|E

40|$|Introduction : In Islam, fasting means abstaining {{from food}} and {{beverages}} from sunrise Azaan to sunset Azaan. This long period of hunger with the increasing feeling of weakness leads to changes in nutritional habits and behaviors. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the dietary intake of different food groups {{with a view to}} see the effect of food diversity on nutritional needs of fasting individuals in Qom. Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was performed on 120 fasting individuals in Qom city in Ramadan in 2014. The respondents -aged between 20 - 45 years old- were selected from Qom. A dietary records questionnaire was used to survey the dietary intake. And all of questionnaires were collected after three days of recording. The food items were determined on the basis of consumption units and groups and then compared with <b>recommended</b> <b>values.</b> Findings : Consumption of vegetables, meat and meat products and dairy groups was significantly lower than the <b>recommended</b> <b>values</b> and consumption of fruits was higher than <b>recommended</b> <b>values.</b> Moreover, the intake of bread and cereal group and was not statistically different from the <b>recommended</b> <b>values.</b> Conclusion : According to the findings of this study, the dietary intake of fasting individuals in Qom had not enough diversity. Therefore, in accordance with the undeniable role of proper and enough food intake from different groups on health, it seems necessary for fasting individuals to have a nutrition education for proper food selection from various food groups...|$|R
