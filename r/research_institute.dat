There is growing evidence that human resource management practices can {{play an important role in}} attaining high quality workforce. Recruitment and selection has been specifically singled out as a major human resource management practice that can have an influence on the level of employee performance in organizations. <b>Research</b> <b>institutes</b> in Kenya have been facing performance challenges and there is need, therefore, for them (<b>Research</b> <b>Institutes)</b> to attract and retain high caliber personnel. The quality of employees recruited by <b>research</b> <b>institutes</b> in Kenya is viewed as a possible intervention. The overall objective of the study was to determine how recruitment and selection influence employee Performance in <b>research</b> <b>institutes</b> in Kenya. The study adopted the null hypothesis that recruitment and selection do not influence employee performance in <b>research</b> <b>institutes</b> in Kenya. The study adopted descriptive and correlation research designs while the study population was drawn from all Government owned <b>research</b> <b>institutes</b> formed under the Science & Technology Act. Cap 250. The target population was drawn from the <b>research</b> <b>institutes</b> that were within Nairobi county and its environs. The study adopted stratified sampling technique while the sample size was 256 employees.
