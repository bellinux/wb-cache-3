The patients {{were treated with}} corticosteroid therapy and the clinical syndrome, {{with the exception of}} optic subatrophy of the left eye in one patient and of both eyes in another patients, improved in all of them. In subsequent controls, the radiographic findings did not show any evolution suggesting that the cause of the empty sella syndrome is a potentially <b>regressive</b> <b>element</b> (endocranial hypertension?). The small number of our cases does not prove with any certainty that corticosteroid treatment, was beneficial but as improvement occurred and in all the subjects this therapy should be tried in other patients with "empty sella" syndrome. The possible improvement of the empty sella syndrome has {{to be taken into account}} before deciding on surgical intervention...|$|E

40|$|Altruistic parents, who {{differ in}} income, make {{financial}} transfers to their children, who differ in ability. The children invest in post-compulsory education, subject to an endogenous credit constraint, and taking policy as given. There are two policy tools: a subsidy {{to those who}} participate in education and a proportional income tax. Not all children participate; a larger subsidy encourages participation, and a larger income tax discourages it. The parents, prior to making transfers, vote on policy. A voting equilibrium, if it exists, is such that voters in the two tails of the income distribution support a reduction, while the “middle-class” supports an expansion, of the education subsidy. Public support of education is a policy with <b>regressive</b> <b>elements</b> as it entails, among other things, a redistribution from the poor to the middle-earners. We characterise a local equilibrium analytically, verify its existence numerically, and finally perform a number of comparative statics exercises. ...|$|R

"Progress", {{the fourth}} track on Every Valley, was {{inspired}} by the sound of Kraftwerk, with its bass line and use of a vocoder drawing parallels to the tropes of the German electronic group. The song, which appeared on a single prior to the release of the album, was intended by Willgoose as a message that [...] "progress will win in the end", using samples of 1950s documentaries on the progress of technology in the mining industry, and a chorus stating [...] "I believe in progress". Willgoose also affirmed that the song continued the band's motto of [...] "celebrating human achievements, innovation and resilience, {{even in the face of}} overwhelming odds", combating his fear that people thought of his band as purely nostalgia-based. He also affirmed that [...] "Progress" [...] is [...] "an attempt to state that more explicitly, especially at a time when certain <b>regressive</b> <b>elements</b> seem determined to take us back to some non-existent, halcyon 1950s era." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with both what creative cities are imagined to be, {{as well as what}} they actually are. This is a challenge for policy makers. Overall, the paper seeks to create a platform for a more nuanced and subtle approach to creativity, culture and cities: one that is situated and not universal. It seeks to map out an approach that is concerned not simply with the growth possibilities, but also redistributive strategies. In so doing it questions whether can we conceive of creative cities as a truly progressive field of policy and practice, in direct contrast to what we judge to be the socially regressive form they take at present. The paper is divided into three main parts. The first locates the creative city within the discourse of place marketing, but flags up the tensions between the universalism of place marketing, and the particularities of culture and creativity. The second critically examines notions of liberalism and creativity as they underpin the creative city. The final part takes the actually existing creative city and highlights many of the negative and <b>regressive</b> <b>elements</b> of policies that promote them. The paper argues for the need for more nuanced approaches, and for more attention to the (lack of) redistributive outcomes in existing creative city debates...|$|R
40|$|Diplomats spend {{four years}} at a time abroad in South Africa's foreign missions, and after a home posting to Pretoria, {{typically}} lasting two years, they leave again. Children attend international schools. Thus diplomatic families have to adjust to a lifestyle of change and discontinuity, foreign cultures and unknown environments. The extent of this adjustment seems underrated and misunderstood. Since 1994 the number of missions abroad has doubled {{and most of the}} new missions are in the third world, hence the focus on hardship postings. In this narrative research, interviews were conducted with diplomatic families in several hardship posts. The aim was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the process of adjustment based on first hand information. Adjustment is described as a complex unfolding narrative with regressive as well as progressive story lines. The first stage lasting up to six months is seen as regressive, since the person is further removed from his goal of adjustment than at arrival. The rest of the stay is largely progressive if adjustment is seen as "being settled in a familiar routine". <b>Regressive</b> <b>elements</b> refer to environmental restrictions. Findings include a description of an ideal couple for the foreign service; a need for effective preparation for a posting is confirmed; a changed relationship between Head Office and an official when abroad; diffuse identity among adolescents who spend formative years abroad, resulting in poorly understood adjustment problems on reentry; importance of attending to the soft issues of relocation instead of focusing on financial compensation.

40|$|German philosopher, musicologist, {{and leading}} {{light of the}} Frankfurt School for Social Research, Theodor W. Adorno (1903 - 69) has been {{frequently}} ignored or cast as a villain within university Film Studies. This {{is largely due to}} the heavy historical baggage of Dialectic of Enlightenment, the seminal book he co-authored with Max Horkheimer (first published in 1944), which was highly influential in Humanities departments until backlash in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Mounting an analysis via Greek mythology of Western modernity to find it has betrayed the Enlightenment's dual promises of reason and freedom, this central Frankfurt School work casts cinema as a principal star of 'the culture industry' - Horkheimer and Adorno's famous phrase describing mass culture propagated by the socio-economic and political interests of modern capitalism. '[T]he regression of enlightenment to ideology', we read in the early pages, 'finds its typical expression in cinema and radio' (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1979, p. xvi), fuelled by a model of heavily delimited 'individuality' characteristic of the culture industry's 'administered life' (ibid., p. 3). This seemingly blanket critique of film and mass media, given detailed form in Dialectic of Enlightenment's most discussed and debated chapter 'The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception', has for a long time been widely dismissed as 'elitist'. Yet a historically informed account should stress that Horkheimer and Adorno were writing when Hollywood and European fascism's domination of the moving image was crucial to address and a more radical vision of cinema seemed least tenable. Today a culture industry-themed analysis of cinema would provoke us to look afresh at the role it plays in sustaining <b>regressive</b> <b>elements</b> of contemporary life. However most fruitful for film-philosophy scholarship, I contest, is an engagement with the culmination of Adorno's writing on philosophy and art in his final decade's work...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{evaluating}} (the net social {{benefits of the}} dairy herd-improvement scheme operated by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture are described. The first involves derivation of 'an input demand' function for the herd-recording aspect of the scheme and use of this function to estimate the economic surplus (net of {{both private and public}} costs) provided by the service. The second approach involves deriving a production function for milk from which it is possible to estimate the contribution herd-recording and artificial breeding have made to increasing milk yields per cow. Social benefits are shown to have been less than social costs for herd-recording, however dairy farmers have made net private gains. The herd-recording scheme has contained a <b>regressive</b> subsidy <b>element.</b> The production function approach show that artificial breeding and herd-recording were profitable complements in production.

40|$|Concerning {{education}} we find contradictory developments. We observed {{an enormous}} educational expansion {{as well as}} we witness the emergence of educational poverty and social exclusion of people effected. Considering this background the aim is, to develop a concept that allows answering the research question, whether in the long run we can observe social progress or regress in the field of education. To give an answer a concept of social progress in education has to be developed first. Building upon theories of justice, equality of opportunity and progress I will work out 8 dimensions of social progress in education spanning from equity and capabilities to participation and recognition. The operationalisation of these dimensions consists of 26 indicators which all are calculated empirically and show the actual status and development over time. Besides that results for disadvantaged groups are calculated because the concept developed builds upon the hypothesis, that social progress can be observed, when social differences decrease. Many indicators cover besides Austria several European countries. The findings not only tell a story of educational success. Only a limited number of indicators show social progress others even social regress. For instance the odd ratio for belonging to the low achievers groups not only equals a five-time risk for pupils with a poor socioeconomic background but also grew over time. Even indicators showing social progress reveal a long way to go, since social disadvantages still are enormous. Dimensions focused on the educational system in many cases show progressive developments whereas the dimensions covering consequences of education in society point in a regressive direction. In international comparison developments work out differently for different countries. Besides booming countries starting from a low level of social progress also continuous improving countries starting from a high level can be found. On the other hand side countries are situated showing a decreasing trend either from a high or even from a low level of development. All together progressive and <b>regressive</b> <b>elements</b> are in balance and therefore do not allow a final judgement. But growing exclusion of migrants and low qualified people demand policy measures ensuring that also the most vulnerable find their place in the societal elevator and will not be left behind...|$|R
