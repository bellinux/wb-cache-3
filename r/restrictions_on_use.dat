A contributing factor has been the high load on Bodø Airport, which has caused <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> by recreational aircraft. Especially sailplane activities were allocated to Rognan. Saltdal Flyklubb was established as a local aviation club in 1993. It took over the responsibility for operating the airport, although it remained owned by the municipality.|$|E
500|$|The revised 2010 forest plan {{recognized}} the need to develop plans to manage wildfires at the wildland–urban interface, use prescribed fire as a tool to manage ecosystem health, and meet air quality requirements set by the Clean Air Act. The forest operates a fire management plan under federal fire policy that gives fire personnel direction for responding to unintended ignitions. Occasionally, area closures and <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>use,</b> such as prohibition of campfires, are implemented to aid in wildfire prevention. Following severe fires, area closures may be put in place to protect the public from risks such as falling trees and landslides. Proactive fire management strategies include prescribed burns and mechanical reduction of fuel levels. For instance, in 2014 Boise National Forest planned to conduct [...] of prescribed burns and [...] of mechanical treatment. The forest seasonally maintains staff at seven fire lookout towers, while six others remain unstaffed.|$|E

30|$|For EC, the {{threshold}} limit of 3  dS/m is selected because according to Table  1, for EC above 3  dS/m, there is severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> {{of water for}} irrigation while for EC values below 3  dS/m, there is no (where EC is below 0.7  dS/m) and a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> SAR of irrigation water {{except for a few}} locations is below 6, so under this situation according to Ayers and Westcot (1994) if EC is below 0.3  dS/m, there is a severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> As EC of groundwater is above 0.5  dS/m, there is no severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> Also for SAR between 0 and 3, in about 90  % of study area, EC of groundwater is above 0.7  dS/m and therefore there is no <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> For SAR between 3 and 6, where EC is above 1.2  dS/m, there is no restriction and where EC is between 0.3 and 1.2  dS/m, there is a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> (Ayers and Westcot 1994). Therefore, we used a threshold limit of 3 for SAR. For both Na+ and Cl−, a critical limit of 3  meq/L is considered for producing probability maps. According to Ayers and Westcot (1994) there is a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of irrigation water with Na+ and Cl− above 3  meq/L for sprinkler irrigation. So the probability maps of exceeding 3 dS/m, 3, 3  meq/L and 3 are produced for EC, Cl−, Na + and SAR, respectively.|$|R

The image of Flight 175's crash was thus caught on video from multiple vantage points on live television and amateur video, while approximately 100 cameras captured Flight175 in photographs before it crashed.

2500|$|Though {{there are}} {{regulations}} on {{the naming of}} children, many archaic characters can still be found in adults' names, particularly those born prior to the Second World War. Because the legal <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of such kanji cause inconvenience for those with such names and promote a proliferation of identical names, many recent changes {{have been made to}} increase rather than {{to reduce the number of}} kanji allowed for use in names. The Sapporo High Court held that it was unlawful for the government to deny registration of a child's name because it contained a kanji character that was relatively common but not included in the official list of name characters compiled by the Ministry of Justice. Subsequently, the Japanese government promulgated plans to increase the number of kanji [...] "permitted" [...] in names.|$|E
2500|$|TCP/IP {{network access}} {{expanded}} again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) provided access to supercomputer {{sites in the}} United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s. Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990. By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, removing the last <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of the Internet to carry commercial traffic. The Internet rapidly expanded in Europe and Australia {{in the mid to}} late 1980s and to Asia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The beginning of dedicated [...] communication between the NSFNET and networks in Europe was established with a low-speed satellite relay between Princeton University and Stockholm, Sweden in December 1988. Although other network protocols such as UUCP had global reach well before this time, this {{marked the beginning of the}} Internet as an intercontinental network.|$|E

2500|$|A final major {{distinction}} {{is made in}} whether the trousers take a belt or braces (suspenders). While a belt was originally never worn with a suit, the forced wearing of belts during wartime years (caused by <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of elastic caused by wartime shortages) contributed to their rise in popularity, with braces now much less popular than belts. When braces were common, the buttons for attaching them {{were placed on the}} outside of the waistband, because they would be covered by a waistcoat or cardigan, but now it is more frequent to button on the inside of the trouser. Trousers taking braces are rather different in cut at the waist, employing inches of extra girth and also height at the back. The split in the waistband at the back is in the fishtail shape. [...] Those who prefer braces assert that, because they hang from the shoulders, they always make the trousers fit and hang exactly as they should, while a belt may allow the trouser waist to slip down on the hips or below a protruding midsection, and requires constant repositioning; also, they allow, indeed work best with, a slightly looser waist which gives room for natural expansion when seated.|$|E
