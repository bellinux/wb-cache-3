5|$|The 1955 {{portrait}} {{was popular}} with the public and liked by the Queen but criticised for its romantic treatment and for prioritising Elizabeth's role as the monarch over insights into her inner life.

It was un{{popular with the}} public.|$|E

While shooting the film, Noonan remained in character at all times, keeping away from cast members playing his pursuers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited <b>role</b> <b>by</b> the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
5|$|Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, {{the rear}} {{section of the}} centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie {{was one of several}} actresses to {{audition}} for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, sister of Tom Six and the film's producer, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of her reading, until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the <b>role</b> <b>by</b> the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.|$|E

5|$|Because of this, he {{was later}} moved to a {{deep-lying}} playmaker <b>role</b> <b>by</b> his coaches Mazzone, Fatih Terim, and Ancelotti, where {{he was able to}} excel due to his unique capabilities. This position best utilised Pirlo's attributes, and allowed him to operate creatively from a deeper position, in or even behind the main midfield line, in a seemingly defensive midfield role, where he was allowed more time on the ball to create scoring opportunities with his trademark long balls. During his final season with Milan, Pirlo was also used on the wing under Allegri, due to his ability to provide accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, India had assembled one of the largest air forces in Asia, and the Hunter was the nation's primary and most capable interceptor. During the conflict, the Hunter demonstrated its superiority over China's Russian-sourced MiGs and gave India a strategic advantage in the air. India's aerial superiority deterred Chinese Ilyushin Il-4 bombers from attacking targets within India. In 1962, India had selected to procure its first supersonic-capable fighter, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21; large numbers of Russian-built fighters had increasingly supplemented the aging Hunters in the interceptor <b>role</b> <b>by</b> 1970.|$|E
5|$|Chris {{appears in}} the 2010 live-action film , portrayed by Wentworth Miller. In the film, Chris is found trapped in a maximum {{security}} cell after his unit's attempt to control the T-virus in Los Angeles goes haywire; the survivors who find him believe {{him to be a}} prisoner. He is reunited with his sister Claire, who cannot remember him because of memory damage caused by an Umbrella mind control device. He, Alice and Claire eventually defeat Albert Wesker and rescue imprisoned survivors being used for Umbrella's experiments. Miller said he prepared for the <b>role</b> <b>by</b> searching for images and videos of Chris on the Internet, as well as doing cardio for endurance.|$|E

5|$|Created by comedian Bill Cosby, Clair {{is based}} on Cosby's own wife, Camille. Cosby {{originally}} intended for the character to be a plumber, but the producers and Camille ultimately convinced him to rewrite her into a lawyer to reflect a family that closer resembled their own. At one point, Clair had also been envisioned as a Dominican housewife who speaks Spanish when frustrated, inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, but this idea was also abandoned. Rashad, originally credited as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, won the <b>role</b> <b>by</b> exhibiting a subtlety in her audition that other candidates lacked. After marrying husband Ahmad Rashad and adopting his surname, Rashad became pregnant with their child during the show's third season, thus requiring her to conceal her pregnancy during episode tapings.|$|E
5|$|Drax's henchman Chang, {{played by}} Japanese aikido {{instructor}} Toshiro Suga, was recommended for the <b>role</b> <b>by</b> executive producer Michael G. Wilson, {{who was one}} of his pupils. Wilson, continuing a tradition he started in the film Goldfinger, has a small cameo role in Moonraker: he appears twice, first as a tourist outside the Venini Glass shop and museum in Venice, then {{at the end of the}} film as a technician in the US Navy control room.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Lance Black's Virginia premiered on September 15, 2010, at the Toronto International Film Festival. Two years later, it was {{announced}} that the movie would receive a limited theatrical release in May 2012. Connelly portrayed the title role of Virginia, a mentally unstable woman who has a 20-year affair with the local sheriff, whose daughter then starts a relationship with Virginia's son. Connelly prepared for the <b>role</b> <b>by</b> watching documentaries on schizophrenia. She also spent time at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the New York University's Cancer Center to understand the afflections and obstacles of her character. While she was preparing for the role, director Dustin Lance Black requested Connelly's advice to design the set of Virginia's house, as well as the selection of the apparel to create the character's style.|$|E

The series was re-titled The New Temperatures Rising Show, and featured a new supporting cast: Sudie Bond, Barbara Cason, Jennifer Darling, Jeff Morrow, and John Dehner. Cleavon Little was the only returning member of the original cast.

5|$|HIV can infect {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, {{but another}} route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN {{can also be}} used. DCs {{are one of the}} first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought to play an important <b>role</b> <b>by</b> transmitting HIV to T-cells when the virus is captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs naturally in neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.|$|E
5|$|Hammett first {{represented}} New Zealand, {{while he}} was a pupil at St Thomas of Canterbury College, when selected for the New Zealand Under 17 team in 1989. He then captained the Under 19 team in 1991, before making his first appearance for Canterbury in 1992. Although his one game for Canterbury in 1992 was as a replacement, he played seven games the following season. As hooker, he played mainly as backup to Matt Sexton in 1993; however, by 1994 they were sharing the <b>role.</b> <b>By</b> 1995, Hammett played more games than Sexton.|$|E

He also signed with NBC to make a pilot on a show called Area 57, a sitcom about a passive-aggressive alien, but it was not picked up for the 2007–2008 season. Reubens did, however, appear on the hit NBC series 30 Rock as an inbred Austrian prince, a character Tina Fey created for him. He also made three guest appearances on FX's series Dirt. This time he was recommended for the <b>role</b> <b>by</b> Dirt star and close friend Courteney Cox. Cox's husband, David Arquette, would then cast Reubens for his directorial debut, the 2007 film The Tripper.|$|E
5|$|In mid-December, as Totti began regaining form post-injury, {{he started}} playing more regularly, {{often in a}} {{creative}} role as an attacking midfielder. On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi's opening goal in a 1–1 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match. He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo's goal in Roma's 3–1 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011, and also set up De Rossi's goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium. Playing in a deeper position on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting rather to play more of a supporting <b>role</b> <b>by</b> bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership and experience in games to offer some much needed depth to the team.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparing}} for their roles, the actors were granted access to lawyers who {{would act as}} advisors. Ford observed murder trials with Pakula at the Recorder's Court in Detroit and viewed training footage from the Michigan Prosecutors' Association. Greta Scacchi, who plays Carolyn Polhemus, observed Linda Fairstein, head of the Manhattan District Attorney's sex crimes unit. Raúl Juliá, who plays Sandy Stern, researched his <b>role</b> <b>by</b> meeting with criminal lawyer Michael Kennedy. Paul Winfield lobbied {{for the role of}} Judge Larren Lyttle upon reading the novel and learning that the adaptation was to be directed by Pakula.
