50|$|Grain {{boundary}} migration {{plays an}} important role in many of the mechanisms of creep. Grain boundary migration occurs when a shear stress acts on the grain boundary plane and causes the grains to slide. This means that fine-grained materials actually have a poor <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> relative to coarser grains, especially at high temperatures, because smaller grains contain more atoms in grain boundary sites. Grain boundaries also cause deformation in that they are sources and sinks of point defects.

The degree of crystallinity is an important parameter: higher crystallinity gives a larger modulus of elasticity, superior yield strength, improved <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> deformation and enhanced fatigue strength, all of which are desirable properties for joint components. The degree of crystallinity, within the range commonly used for medical-grade UHMWPE, does not substantially affect the wear resistance, which is related to the molecular mass [3]. The <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> deformation of the UHMWPE is important to evaluations of the relative contribution of deformation or wear to the penetration of the femoral head into the insert.

Chromium is being considered due to its high melting point (> 1800 °C), relatively low density (~ 7. 2 g/cc), high temperature strength, and oxidation resistance.

Previous efforts to reduce the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature have considered elimination of embrittling interstitals, increasing the grain size, pre-deformation and alloying. Recent computational studies have renewed interest in using alloying additions to ductilize chromium. A series of first principles calculations recently revealed elements (Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, V) which have potential to reduce the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature when alloyed with chromium.

However, a superalloy often also needs performance {{in terms of}} fretting resistance. Experimental results regarding fretting wear and contact properties of the superalloy René 80 are illustrated and discussed. The widespread applications of superalloys in jointing with friction as in the jointing of a turbine blade, is the main motivation for characterizing their fretting behaviour. The fretting experiments were performed at 100 Hz for two temperatures (600, 800 °C), and two sliding amplitudes (30, 60 µm). These temperatures and strokes are typical at the medium stage of a low-pressure gas turbine. Wear volume and the contact properties such as friction coefficient and tangential contact stiffness were measured and analysed. Results show that the lowest friction coefficient was measured at the temperature of 800 °C. This temperature hence {{appears to be an}} optimum working condition for the fretting wear of René 80. With regard to wear mechanism, a fundamental role of the sliding amplitude was found.

High and low molecular weight samples were blended to artificially create two series of broad distribution samples with polydispersities of 4 to 11. Characterization was done by size exclusion chromatography and membrane osmometry. ^ Adhesive performance was assessed for each homopolymer and blend by shear, peel and probe tack testing based on standardized test methods. In the homopolymer series, with an increase in molecular weight, 180 (DEGREES) peel and probe tack decrease to a constant level. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> shear (or <b>creep)</b> passes through a maximum at a number average of 300, 000. While the broad distribution blends generally showed slight improvement over the homopolymer with similar number and weight average molecular weight, there was no conclusive evidence to suggest a relationship with increasing polydispersity. ^ Rheological properties were determined for the homopolymers and blends as a function of frequency. Established trends for molecular weight and frequency were observed in the homopolymer series. Among the blends, little difference in rheological properties was found. ^ The adhesive performance for the homopolymers and blends was linked with the rheological properties of the sample. Each adhesive test was modeled so that a rate of deformation could be calculated for comparison to rheological properties at similar frequencies. In probe tack testing, the ability of the sample to establish contact with the test surface is related <b>to</b> the tensile <b>creep</b> compliance at a time corresponding to probe dwell time. Tack values increase with increasing compliance. Once a sample has wet a surface, its ability to resist subsequent deformation was found to depend on the dissipation factor (G 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 /G 2 ̆ 7) in the homopolymer series. With increasing dissipation factor, there is increased peel and probe tack. The magnitude of the increase is test rate dependent. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> shear (<b>creep)</b> increases sharply with an increase in complex viscosity. The lack of variation in rheological properties and adhesive performance of the blends made it impossible to make any positive conclusions regarding the influence of molecular weight distribution. ...|$|R
