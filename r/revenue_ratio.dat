40|$|Mobilizing {{more revenue}} is a {{priority}} for sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Countries have to finance their development agendas, and weak revenue mobilization is {{the root cause of}} fiscal imbalances in several countries. This paper reviews the experience of low-income SSA countries in mobilizing revenue in recent decades, with two broad aims: identify empirical norms of how much and how fast countries have been able to mobilize more revenue and empirical determinants (panel estimates) of revenue mobilization. The paper finds that (i) the frequency distribution of changes in <b>revenue</b> <b>ratios</b> for SSA low-income countries (LICs) peaks at a pace of about – 2 percentage points of GDP in the short-to-medium term and at a pace of about 2 – 3 percentage points of GDP over the longer term, and that (ii) almost all SSA-LICs managed to increase <b>revenue</b> <b>ratios</b> by more than 2 percentage points of GDP in the short-to-medium term, at least once in the last two decades. The sustainability of large increases in <b>revenue</b> <b>ratios</b> can be an issue, in particular for fragile countries.

Given the global crisis in 1997, many banks were liquidated because of a high Non-Performing Loan in this sector.

This study aimed to examine the effect of Size, loan to deposit ratio, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Operating cost to Operating <b>revenues</b> <b>ratio</b> and Interest Rate of Loans to the Non-Performing Loan. Samples which is used in this study is the Conventional Commercial Bank registered in Bank of Indonesia for the 2011 - 2014 period.

Differing from the previous research, a new dependent variable, the current <b>revenue</b> <b>ratio</b> is used in addition to the conventional tax ratio. The current revenue is the sum of tax revenue and non-tax soured revenue excludes State Owned Enterprises revenues and expenditures. Eleven independent variables falling into six categories were selected. These six categories were: The traditional tax handles, GDP decomposition, Population factors, Income inequality, Governmental factors, and Corruption. The contributions of this study are: Firstly, for the first time the author constructed the current <b>revenue</b> <b>ratio</b> as the second dependent variable to represent the broader fiscal revenue and true tax-like revenue performance for studying tax effort index in China. Secondly, this study constructed the rural-urban income disparity Theil index as one of the explanatory variables in the tax effort index models for the first time in China’s tax performance study. Thirdly, for the first time in the tax effort index literature, this study used country specific data on corruption in a single country tax effort index model. The main results of this study are: 1) tax revenue capacity is mainly determined by the economic factors whereas the current revenue capacity is determined by both the economic and social factors; 2) tax revenue performance is diluted by the existence of non-tax sourced revenues; 3) the current <b>revenue</b> <b>ratio</b> is a better indicator for true tax performance; 4) There exists a regional disparity of tax or current revenue capacity among provinces. 5) tax/current revenue capacities and tax/current revenue efforts are mismatched in some provinces...|$|E
