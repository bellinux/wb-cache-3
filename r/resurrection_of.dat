5|$|On April 3, 2005, {{eight months}} after the release of Doom 3, id Software {{released}} an expansion pack for Doom 3 on Windows. The expansion, entitled <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Evil, was developed by Nerve Software, a company that had partnered with id Software on several other projects, including Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the Xbox conversion of Doom. Once again published by Activision, a Linux version was released on May 24, 2005, and an Xbox version followed on October 5, 2005. The expansion featured a new twelve-level single player campaign, set two years after the original storyline, as well as three new weapons, one of which is geared towards manipulating the physics in the game. Several new enemy characters were also introduced. Multiplayer gameplay was enhanced, officially increasing the player limit to eight and adding new game modes such as capture the flag. <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Evils reception was not as positive as it had been for Doom 3, but still received generally favorable reviews from the industry's critics.|$|E

5|$|The manner {{with which}} van der Weyden {{presents}} the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> the dead across the five lower panels {{is reminiscent of}} a Gothic tympanum, specifically that at Autun Cathedral.

5|$|Church {{belief in}} the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> the body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law.

5|$|During {{the second}} half of Crusader reign in Nablus, Muslim forces {{launched}} incursions to regain control of the city. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.|$|E

5|$|Harry Potter pundit John Granger {{additionally}} {{noted that}} one of the reasons the Harry Potter books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism. In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Christ. While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.|$|E

Link defeats both Twinrova and a mindless, poorly resurrected Ganon. He frees Zelda, whose sacrifice {{would have been the}} full <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Ganon; together, they exit the crumbling castle.
