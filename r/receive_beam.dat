40|$|Very large, two-dimensional, {{anisotropic}} arrays {{have been}} proposed to improve ultrasound image quality. Due to noncontiguous acoustic windows into the body, however, {{a significant portion of}} such an aperture may be blocked. Blocked elements result in high sidelobes in the point spread function, degrading image quality. To compensate for this, an object dependent method using multiple <b>receive</b> <b>beams</b> has been recently proposed. This method is effective in removing undesired sidelobes. However, previous results were for one-dimensional arrays where only lateral beams were used for estimation. With two-dimensional arrays, the distribution of blocked elements can change beam characteristics, both laterally and elevationally.

A calibration procedure to determine high resolution, three dimensional transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>beam</b> patterns of a Reson SeaBat 7125 MBES was performed using the fresh water calibration tank at the University of New Hampshire. The measurements employed an omni-directional Reson TC 4034 projector/hydrophone as a reference transducer at an acoustic distance of 13 m. The multibeam sonar system was configured for 256 beams equi-angle mode and operating frequency of 396 kHz. The transmit beam pattern was computed for across-track angular range between +/– 90 o in 0. 1 o increments and along-track angular range between +/– 2. 55 o in 0. 09 o increments. Receive directional characteristics were measured for the across-track range of +/– 120 o in 0. 1 o increments with along-track angular range of +/– 1. 23 o in 0. 18 o increments. With these measurements, a three-dimensional plot of the transmit beam pattern was computed for {{the entire range of}} angles, although for the <b>receive</b> <b>beam</b> pattern it was only determined for the 0 o along-track angle. The reduced angular coverage of the <b>receive</b> <b>beam</b> pattern was due to discrepancies in the off-axis results that are thought to be related to receiver saturation. Measurements for the transmit beam pattern show a – 3 dB beamwidth of 0. 99 o for across-track angle of 0 o with side lobes below – 17 dB. The results show an unexplained curvature in the transmit beam pattern that would have gone un-noticed during a two dimensional beam pattern measurement. An interference effect causing ripples and attenuation of the transmit beam pattern was also observed. This effect is thought to be caused by a second 200 kHz projector mounted parallel to the 396 kHz projector. This interference occurs at an across-track angular region between + 30 o and + 75 o with gradual decrease in amplitude of about 3 dB. The <b>receive</b> <b>beam</b> pattern measurements show a – 3 dB beamwidth of approximately 0. 62 o for the most inner beams (beams 128 and 129) and of approximately 1. 40 o for the most outer beams (beams 1 and 256) at along-track angular position of 0 o with side-lobes below – 26 dB for the most inner beams and below – 17 dB for the most outer beams...|$|E

To increase the frame rate, as an alternative to parallel <b>receive</b> <b>beam</b> forming, it has been proposed to transmit multiple lines simultaneously (i. e. multi-line transmit (MLT)) although this approach has received less attention due to potential cross-talk artifacts between beams. In this study, the point spread function (PSF) of different number of MLT beams (i. e. 2, 4, 6) was compared to that of conventional beam forming by computer simulation in order to find optimal settings to develop an MLT system for fast cardiac imaging. To reduce the cross-talk artifacts, different combinations of transmit and receive apodizations were tested using windowing functions: Rectangular, Hanning, Tukey and Hamming. Results showed that the cross-talk became more severe as the number of the MLT beams increased. Apodizations could significantly reduce these artifacts. In particular a Hanning–Tukey (α = 0. 3) combination reduced these artifacts below the - 40 dB level for all MLT systems tested. With this apodization scheme, no marked differences between Single line transmit (SLT) and 6 MLT phantom images could be observed. This study showed that the 6 MLT imaging system has a competitive image quality to SLT but with a 6 times higher frame rate. In addition, the MLT approach can be combined with (multiple) parallel <b>receive</b> <b>beam</b> forming to increase frame rate further.

40|$|Refraction of the {{acoustic}} beam from a sodar, or {{translation of the}} beam due to the wind (known as wind drift), both affect the scattering angle and hence the Doppler shift of the return signal. Wind drift {{has been the subject}} of a number of previous studies, which have shown that errors increase with wind speed, giving about 6 [*]% error in the estimated wind speed when the actual wind speed is 7 [*]ms− 1. Since previous studies have not treated the general case of finite angular beam width, a new analytic treatment is given here for monostatic sodars. Surprisingly, it is found that the Doppler error contributed by the transmitted beam is exactly compensated by the Doppler error contributed by the <b>received</b> <b>beam,</b> if the two beam widths are the same. If the transmitter beam width is not equal to the receiver beam width, then either over-estimation or under-estimation of wind speed results, depending on which beam is wider.
