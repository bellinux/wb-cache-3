50|$|A sheet pan {{that has}} a {{continuous}} lip around all four sides may be called a jelly <b>roll</b> <b>pan.</b> A pan {{that has a}}t least one side flat, so that it is easy to slide the baked product off the end, may be called a cookie sheet.|$|R
50|$|A sheet cake is a cake {{baked in}} a large, flat {{rectangular}} pan {{such as a}} sheet pan or a jelly <b>roll</b> <b>pan.</b> These single-layer cakes are almost always frosted, with decorations and ornamental frosting along the borders and the flat top surface. In the United States, these inexpensive cakes are commonly available in supermarkets and bakeries.|$|R

5000|$|The {{engine was}} a '54 Dodge [...] Red Ram hemi from a Peters' wrecked racing boat. It was {{outfitted}} with Isky cam, Hilborn fuel injection, a Scintilla Vertex magneto and Sanderson custom headers. It was mated to a '39 Ford transmission with Zephyr gears through a Cragar adapter. Exhaust was routed through four pipes which {{passed through the}} rear <b>roll</b> <b>pan.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{camera was}} {{developed}} in 1976 specifically for complex special effects shots in Star Wars. Using old VistaVision cameras (for their high image resolution), created by engineers at Paramount Pictures in 1954, and hand wire wrapped TTL chips, the all-digitally controlled system allowed for 7 axes of motion: <b>roll,</b> <b>pan,</b> tilt, swing, boom, traverse, track, lens focus, motor drive, shutter control, and their duplication in multiple takes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} [...] "Yule log" [...] recipe {{emerged during}} the 19th century. It is traditionally made from a genoise, generally baked in a large, shallow Swiss <b>roll</b> <b>pan,</b> iced, <b>rolled</b> to form a cylinder, and iced again on the outside. The most common combination is basic yellow sponge cake and chocolate buttercream, though many variations which include chocolate cake, ganache, and icings flavored with espresso or liqueurs exist.|$|R
5000|$|The S-10 Cameo, and Cameo EL, {{appearance}} {{package for}} the S-10 pickup 2WD, from 1989-1991, In 1989 these trucks came in 3 color choices Apple Red, Frost White or Midnight black solid exterior colors, In 1991 other Tone-on-Tone paint schemes were available, and has the additional exterior features: a wraparound front bumper fascia with fog lamps. lower body ground-effects moldings and wheel flares, a flush-fitting tailgate valance, rear <b>roll</b> <b>pan</b> (If state laws allowed), and [...] "Cameo" [...] lettering on the doors and tailgate.|$|R
5000|$|For 1966, the 390-cubic-inch V8's {{power was}} {{increased}} to [...] The larger 428-cubic-inch (7.0 L) V-8 became optional, rated at 345 gross horsepower (257.4 kW) {{and providing a}} notable improvement in 0-60 acceleration to about 9 seconds. All models featured a new front clip. A flatter hood, re-shaped front fenders, new headlight buckets, new egg crate grille with large Thunderbird emblem, new bumper guards, a single bumper bar, and painted <b>roll</b> <b>pan</b> replaced the previous two model year's two-piece front bumper. The rear taillights were revised, now a 3 piece unit going the full width across the rear, the backup light now located in the center section replaced the formerly rear <b>roll</b> <b>pan</b> mounted lamps. A new Town Hardtop model was offered, featured a roof with blind quarter panels for a more 'formal' look (at the cost of rear visibility). The Landau {{was replaced by the}} blind quarter formal roofed Town Landau, which retained the previous model's padded roof and landau S-bars. It became by far the best-selling model, accounting for 35,105 of the 1966 model's 69,176 sales. The transmission used on early build 390 V8 equipped T-Birds was the Cruise-O-Matic MX, however late build 390 and all 428 V8 equipped T-Birds had the new C6 3 speed automatic installed.|$|R
50|$|The {{car that}} McCormick drove, the Coyote X, was built from custom molds {{based on the}} McLaren M6GT. The {{original}} Coyote X was molded, modified and assembled by Mike Fennel. The nose, windshield doors and lower body (minus the ventral intakes) are faithful representations of the McLaren; the cut down rear deck, however, was a custom component that became a feature on many Manta Montage kits with damaged or removed rear windows. The most noticeable differences between the Coyotes and Mantas are the wheel wells, <b>roll</b> <b>pan</b> height and shape, {{and the fact that}} the Coyote has a one piece front clip that terminates about an inch before and surrounding the windshield.|$|R

Pan dulce, which is Spanish for [...] "sweet bread", is eaten in the evenings with hot drinks like traditional hot chocolate.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>Rolling</b> Stone <b>panned</b> {{the album}} upon its release in 1979, calling it [...] "drearily obvious" [...] and [...] "stale", {{two years later}} the same {{magazine}} loved it, limiting its praise of the subsequent album, The Completion Backward Principle, by saying, good as it was, [...] "topping Remote Control will be difficult." [...] Allmusic gives it four stars. Crawdaddy called it [...] "a pop/rock masterpiece." ...|$|R

50|$|A major {{boost for}} her career came when a video clip was {{posted on the}} Internet, where Aneta was rolling a frying pan. The movie was {{unexpectedly}} popular and it {{got a lot of}} media interest. One of the results was the invitation (February 2008) for the Spanish edition of the show, where interesting tries of breaking the Guinness World Records are shown. Aneta had to <b>roll</b> most <b>pans</b> in one minute. She established the record rolling 4 pans.|$|R
50|$|The members {{formed the}} group in the early 1990s and {{released}} their first album Strange Cowboys in 1998 under Vagabond Productions. Rapper Speech of Arrested Development worked {{in the studio with}} the group, and Virgin Records signed El Pus and released the group's major label debut, Hoodlum Rock—Vol. 1 in 2005. Christian Hoard of <b>Rolling</b> Stone <b>panned</b> the album. David Jeffries of allmusic.com praised the album, considering it a combination of hard rock and crunk rap.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the changed}} cast {{reflected}} a distinct change in Roxy's musical style. Gone were the unpredictable {{elements of the}} group's sound, giving way to smoother musical arrangements. <b>Rolling</b> Stone <b>panned</b> Manifesto ("Roxy Music has not gone disco. Roxy Music has not particularly gone anywhere else either") as well as Flesh + Blood ("such a shockingly bad Roxy Music record that it provokes a certain fascination"), while other sources praised the reunion.

5000|$|By contrast, Jody Rosen of <b>Rolling</b> Stone <b>panned</b> Drake's rap as a [...] "desecration" [...] and [...] "desultory boasting, {{pointless}} 'wass ups,' slapped on like gaudy graffiti tags." [...] He {{gave the}} song three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars and asserted that, without his contribution, it would be [...] "an engrossing record, with eerily stark production from Noah '40' Shebib: a great fit, and a worthy tribute, to R&B's most avant-garde diva." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator criticized his rap as [...] "ill-advised" [...] and [...] "ho-hum", and stated, [...] "this is not the 'tribute' we {{would have liked to}} hear." ...|$|R

Allmusic gives it {{three out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "good clean fun" [...] which [...] "If nothing else...provides {{a portrait of a}} prime period in radio," [...] but <b>Rolling</b> Stone roundly <b>panned</b> it, describing the album as a symptom of corporate greed in the world of television animation.|$|R
5000|$|Some roulades {{consist of}} cake (often sponge cake) baked {{in a flat}} <b>pan</b> <b>rolled</b> around a filling. Cake rolled around jam, {{chocolate}} buttercream, nuts or other fillings, {{is an example of}} a sweet roulade like the bejgli or the Swiss roll.

2500|$|However, {{neither the}} second album, Alpha (released in July 1983), nor any {{following}} Asia album could repeat the chart {{success of the}} first release. [...] "Don't Cry" [...] was a #1 Album Rock Track and Top 10 Pop hit {{in the summer of}} 1983, and the video received considerable attention on MTV, while [...] "The Smile Has Left Your Eyes" [...] was another Top 40 hit for the band. The video for [...] "Smile" [...] also scored heavy MTV play. However, <b>Rolling</b> Stone <b>panned</b> Alpha as an over-produced commercial album, while others lamented that Howe and Palmer were effectively reduced to session musicians. Alpha received indifferent reviews from various critics, while still attaining platinum status and reaching #6 on the Billboard album chart.|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a <b>roll</b> <b>pan</b> located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler neck moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972–73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} the tail light panel just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much finer mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width red lens across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|R

He uses feats of {{strength}} {{as a tool to}} grab people's attention; he is the Guinness record holder for [...] "the tightest circumference of two aluminum frying <b>pans</b> <b>rolled</b> together with his bare hands in less than 30 seconds". In 1994 he started a non-profit organization, Feel the Power. Since then he has spoken to more than 3 million people.|$|R
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits <b>roll,</b> the camera <b>pans</b> down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is of load-bearing brick construction with timber floor and roof structure. A two-storey timber verandah {{at the rear}} overlooks the yard {{to the river and}} is not of cultural heritage significance. The building elevations are face brick in English bond, with the upper level finished in stucco with face brick quoining to the corners and around windows. The bricks are deep red with contrasting pale grey tuck pointing. Windows are large and rectangular with brick lintels and timber-framed, double-hung sashes with slender, moulded-timber glazing bars. There is one circular window on the upper level of the Alice Street side closest to the river. The hipped roof overhangs the upper floor, has bracketed timber eaves and is clad with <b>roll</b> and <b>pan</b> metal sheet. There is a central metal octagonal ventilation fleche on the ridge and two tall chimneys flank the sides of the building.|$|R
5000|$|Whitney Houston {{recorded}} a version for the soundtrack of the 2012 {{remake of the}} 1976 musical film Sparkle. RCA Records released the song as the second single from the album on June 8, 2012, four months after Houston's death. This version is Houston's last original single, and second posthumous one. The song made its debut only {{one day after the}} premiere of [...] "Celebrate". AllMusic called it a [...] "piano, organ, and choir" [...] showcase for Houston, citing it as a highlight of the soundtrack although admitting [...] "Houston sounds as commanding as one can expect from a later recording." [...] Entertainment Weekly editor Melissa Maerz called it [...] "a gorgeously rippling solo" [...] with Houston [...] "testif... that Jesus is watching over her." [...] Jody Rosen of <b>Rolling</b> Stone <b>panned</b> the cover, saying [...] "Houston sings - and croaks - in a voice octaves lower than in her prime. At times the song has a ravaged magnificence, but mostly it's painful." ...|$|R
500|$|Drummer Lombardo {{came in for}} {{particular}} praise; though <b>Rolling</b> Stone <b>panned</b> the album, the reviewer acknowledged that [...] "at least their awesome drummer Dave Lombardo shows off some chops." [...] Blabbermouths Don Kaye thought that [...] "while flawed", Christ Illusion [...] "proves that the band still has a few tricks up its sleeve and one very potent weapon behind the kit." [...] Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com felt similarly, and reported Lombardo's [...] "performance is top notch throughout and does give the album a looser feel than Paul Bostaph's technical precision offered." [...] In 2011, Complex Media Network's music website, Consequence of Sound, honored Christ Illusion on a List 'Em Carefully installment dedicated to writer David Buchanan's top thirteen metal records released between 2000 and 2010, citing foreign controversy and overall sonic brutality during drummer Dave Lombardo's powerful return. Decibel Magazine gave it a favorable review, stating, [...] "Their hatred for religion in general, Christianity in particular, unwitting Americans, and anyone {{on the other side}} of a soldier's gun has inspired Slayer to record their most vital album in years." [...] Chris Campion of The Observer stated that the album is [...] "their most rigorously conceived and focused for years." ...|$|R
5000|$|Marcy Playground {{garnered}} a mixed reception {{from music}} critics. A writer for NME said that, [...] "What is surprising is how enjoyable this window on Wozniak's soul is: his lazy drawl and gentle melodies coating his misery in a pop sheen....the mood remains resolutely downbeat but the angst is not imposing." [...] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt {{that some of}} the tracks don't quite match up to [...] "Sex and Candy", saying that [...] "only a handful the songs on the album are as memorable as the single. Still, those moments are what make Marcy Playground a promising, albeit imperfect, debut." [...] Robert Christgau graded the album as a [...] "dud", indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought." [...] Chuck Eddy of <b>Rolling</b> Stone heavily <b>panned</b> the album for Wozniak's post-grunge pop having subpar musicianship, saying that it [...] "sets icky new standards for commercial-post-alternative callowness." ...|$|R
40|$|When {{a camera}} {{installed}} on a vehicle is used, {{estimation of the}} camera pose including tilt, <b>roll,</b> and <b>pan</b> angle {{with respect to the}} world coordinate system is important to associate camera coordinates with world coordinates. Previous approaches using huge calibration patterns have the disadvantage that the calibration patterns are costly to make and install. And, previous approaches exploiting multiple vanishing points detected in a single image are not suitable for automotive applications as a scene where multiple vanishing points can be captured by a front camera is hard to find in our daily environment. This paper proposes a camera pose estimation method. It collects multiple images of lane markings while changing the horizontal angle with respect to the markings. One vanishing point, the cross point of the left and right lane marking, is detected in each image, and vanishing line is estimated based on the detected vanishing points. Finally, camera pose is estimated from the vanishing line. The proposed method is {{based on the fact that}} planar motion does not change the vanishing line of the plane and the normal vector of the plane can be estimated by the vanishing line. Experiments with large and small tilt and roll angle show that the proposed method outputs accurate estimation results respectively. It is verified by checking the lane markings are up right in the bird’s eye view image when the pan angle is compensated. ? ??? ?????????????????(???“GPS-DR, ?????????????? ??? 20 cm ??? ??? ?? ??? ??”, ????: 10045880) ? ??? ?? ?????...|$|R
