5000|$|The Duke was {{probably}} completed in 1817 and ran at Kilmarnock, but {{seems to have}} continued the problems of <b>rail</b> <b>breakage.</b> It was sold to the Earl of Elgin in October 1824 for his railway in Fife, but being too heavy for the rails {{was used as a}} stationary pumping engine in a quarry at Charlestown, and from 1830 at a colliery near Dunfermline; its subsequent fate is unrecorded.|$|E
50|$|Though {{probably}} {{not as a}} direct response to this accident, the Stirling Singles were replaced {{in the next few}} years by Ivatt's Atlantics. At this time also, cast, or wrought, iron rails were being replaced with steel and manufacturing processes were steadily improving. Serious accidents due to <b>rail</b> <b>breakage,</b> therefore, remained rare, though a full understanding of crack propagation from internal defects did not come about until the mid-twentieth century and the work of the British Rail Research Division among others.|$|E
50|$|The {{unsprung}} ride {{broke the}} original eight-spoked cast-iron wheels and so these {{were replaced by}} Hackworth with his distinctive two piece cast-iron disc wheels, trued by wooden wedges between the concentric parts. <b>Rail</b> <b>breakage</b> had been reduced by {{this time with the}} use of stronger rails. These new malleable wrought iron rails had been the source of a rift between Stephenson and Losh, as Losh had originally expected to supply cast-iron rails from his ironworks, which Stephenson had briefly been a partner in. Stephenson though chose to use an improved iron rail from John Birkinshaw's Bedlington Ironworks instead.|$|E
50|$|Cast iron is {{rigid and}} brittle so that {{deflection}} of the <b>rails</b> resulted in <b>breakages.</b> In 1785 a wearing surface of Swedish malleable iron, 1¾ inches broad, and ¾ {{of an inch}} thick, was tried with great success because {{of its ability to}} flex with the timber. The running resistance was also remarkably low.|$|R
50|$|In 1875, {{he became}} a chemist for the Pennsylvania Railroad and started to {{investigate}} the chemical composition and metallurgical structure of <b>rail</b> tracks, <b>breakage</b> being a major hazard at that time. He discovered enormous variation in the properties and quality of steel and the 1878 publication of his results caused an uproar in the steel industry who saw it as their sole domain to determine {{the quality of their}} products for sale. Dudley championed the development of company and industry standards and demanded rigorous testing of materials to verify conformity. He developed a complete range of standards for the Pennsylvania Railroad, not only for steel, but also for fuels, lubricants, paints, and even locomotives.|$|R
40|$|The {{current state}} of the art in {{detecting}} immediate and long-term railway track problems involves both inspectors walking the track lines and train cars instrumented with accelerometers and ultrasonic sensors that are capable of detecting wear of the <b>rail</b> and <b>breakages.</b> Additionally, a widespread practice of sensing rail continuity by using the tracks to complete simple circuits is in place. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach to improve the current practices in railway operations using wireless sensor network (WSN). The primary technical and scientific objectives of the system introduced in this paper are to generate innovative solutions for a number of the issues facing the railroad community through the development of a system based on WSN. The objectives from a railroad perspective include finding new approaches to reduce the occurrence rate of accidents and improving the efficiency of railroad maintenance activities...|$|R

30|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{improvements in}} rail material development {{and in the}} quality of non-destructive inspection techniques, together with implementation of specifically tailored rail grinding strategies and other measures in order to guarantee safe service, fatigue crack propagation and fracture is still of great concern as emphasised by the present special issue [4]. Rails, as the core of the railway system, are subjected to very high service loads and harsh environmental conditions. Since any potential <b>rail</b> <b>breakage</b> includes the risk of catastrophic derailment of vehicles, it is of paramount importance to avoid such a scenario.|$|E
30|$|A rail crack {{is defined}} by the International Union of Railways (UIC) as a rail which has one or more gaps of no set pattern, {{apparent}} or not, the progression of which could lead to a rapid <b>rail</b> <b>breakage,</b> irrespective of the parts of the profile concerned [5]. There are several causes of RCI. Rail crack initiation life is very sensitive to hydrostatic stress, which becomes larger when the wheel load and fiction coefficient increase [7]. Axle load, crack location, crack size and rail metallographic have also been studied to analyse their effects on fatigue crack growth by fracture mechanics [7]. A rail crack growth model has been established, the effects of nine operational environment factors compared, and three factors—thermal tension, track curvature and residual stress-identified as having the most impact [8].|$|E
40|$|AbstractControl of {{railway noise}} is very {{significant}} part of the urban traffic policy. An increase of railway noise could significantly reduce {{the quality of life of}} citizens. This paper analyzes and suggests necessary measures for managing railway noise and traffic safety by rail inspection and grinding. It considers and suggests inspection methods for early detection of head checking (HC) rail defects. Otherwise, HC defects could lead to <b>rail</b> cracks and <b>breakages</b> that might endanger the traffic safety. In addition, this paper examines the real limits of non-destructive methods for detecting HC defects in track in service. Combining several non-destructive inspection methods and rail grinding are recommended for efficient railway noise control in the urban area...|$|R
40|$|In-situ stress {{determination}} in structures under environmental variability {{without a}} reference value is a challenging experimental mechanics task. One potential {{application of this}} task is the management of longitudinal loads in railroad structures: the absence of expansion joints in Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) has created {{the need for the}} railroad industry to determine the in-situ thermal stress levels for <b>rail</b> buckling and <b>breakage</b> prevention. This dissertation examines the potentials of a nondestructive method, namely Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI) method, and a semi-destructive method, the hole-drilling test procedure, to provide an estimation of axial stress in bar-like structures. The EMI method is completely non-destructive, as it simply involves bonding a piezoelectric element on the host structure and measuring the electrical admittance signature of the PZT-structure assembly in selected frequency bands. This non-invasive method features the easiness of implementation and interpretation, while it is notoriously known for being vulnerable to environmental variability. A comprehensive analytical model is proposed to relate the measured electric admittance signatures to uniaxial applied stress and temperature, respectively, as functions of relevant parameters of the EMI monitoring system. The model results compare favorably to the experimental ones, where the sensitivities of features extracted from the admittance signatures to the varying stress levels and temperatures are determined. The temperature compensation algorithms are proposed, and the final results illustrate that the frameworks are capable to eliminate the temperature effect and highlight the ones from thermal stress. On the other hand, the semi-destructive hole-drilling method is explored as a possible solution for thermal stress measurement. A new set of calibration coefficients to compute the stress field relieved by fine hole depth increments required by the high strength steel was determined. The new calibration coefficients were experimentally validated on an aluminum plate subjected to a known uniaxial load. The thermal stress levels of constrained rails were estimated after compensation for the residual stress components, based on statistical relationships developed experimentally between the longitudinal and the vertical residual stresses. The results showed that the hole-drilling procedure, with appropriate calibration coefficients and residual stress compensation, can estimate the in-situ rail thermal stresses with an expected accuracy that is within the industry acceptable levels...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle–track {{interaction}} {{for a new}} resilient {{slab track}} designed to reduce noise and vibration levels was analysed, {{in order to assess}} the derailment risk on a curved track when encountering a broken rail. Sensitivity of the rail support spacing of the relative position of the <b>rail</b> <b>breakage</b> between two adjacent rail supports and of running speed were analysed for two different elasticities of the rail fastening system. In none of the cases analysed was observed an appreciable difference between either of the elastic systems. As was expected, the most unfavourable situations were those with greater rail support spacing and those with greater distance from the breakage to the nearest rail support, although in none of the simulations performed did a derailment occur when running over the broken rail. When varying the running speed, the most favourable condition was obtained for an intermediate speed, due to the superposition of two antagonistic effects...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{advantages in}} material development and in periodic non-destructive inspection together with periodic grinding {{and other measures}} in order to guarantee safe service, fatigue crack propagation and fracture is still in great demand as emphasised by the present special issue. Rails, as {{the heart of the}} railway system, are subjected to very high service loads and harsh environmental conditions. Since any potential <b>rail</b> <b>breakage</b> includes the risk of catastrophic derailment of vehicles, it is of paramount interest to avoid such a scenario. The aim of the present paper is to introduce the most important questions regarding crack propagation and fracture of rails. These include the loading conditions: contact forces from the wheel and thermal stresses due to restrained elongation of continuously welded rails together with residual stresses from manufacturing and welding in the field, which is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 provides an overview of crack-type rail defects and potential failure scenarios. Finally the stages of crack propagation from initiation up to final breakage are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Track {{buckling}} is {{a serious}} problem for railways. High longitudinal rail stresses contribute to many problems such as track buckling, rail joint failure, <b>rail</b> <b>breakage</b> and failure of turnouts. The direct and indirect costs of track buckling problems are very high. The influences of rail temperature, SFT and lateral misalignment of track on track buckling need comprehensive investigation. In this paper, an experimental design comprising strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress sensors has been implemented on the QR heavy haul 60 kg/m rail network. A new creep measurement technique using internal rail stress has been developed. The changes in rail neutral temperature due to the variation of actual rail temperature and the occurrence of rail creep in straight and curved track is quantified. Modes of differences of SFT in the two rails at a location, and of SFT in straight track and in curved track are discussed. The relationship of SFT to rail temperature is also presented. Daily variation in rail temperature due to ambient air temperature is presented. Field trials showed that SFT can vary by 2 - 30 C during the day. Based on this finding and the derivation of an equation for change of SFT, an improvement in utilising rail creep measurements for assessing track condition has resulted. This finding suggests {{that it is possible to}} determine the SFT throughout a day rather than just a single SFT value. This paper also presents a simple track stability management tool that is based on two major parameters, namely rail stress and track resistance. Each parameter in the tool has been given three levels of value to determine the required preventive measures. Overall, the tool decides the need for speed restriction during hot weather based on the quantified parameters from the field trials and rail standards...|$|E
