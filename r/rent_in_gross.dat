This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows, there are different forces that are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows.

40|$|The {{object of}} the article are the questions: 1) {{what is the role}} of <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> {{financing}} housing economy in Poland and 2) which are the arguments pro and contra applying economically justified <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> Poland. In Poland there is a two-level system of <b>rents.</b> <b>In</b> state-owned and privately owned houses rents are low. Much higher rents are paid by members of co-operative building societies. This results in economic differentiation of the population depending on whether they live in state-owned or privately owned houses on the one hand and in co-operative houses on the other. In consequence of the low <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> state-owned and privately owned houses it is necessary to cover part of the cost of housing management from the state funds. The authoress considers the advisability and possibility of applying the present rents to the requirements of financing upkeep costs, repairs and housing investments.

There is a preference for using GDP, unemployment rate, and office (FIRE) employment as the main determinants of the space market (demand side); office floor stock, construction orders and vacancy rate (especially in the United States) as the property market (supply side) determinants in the office market. A regression model for Singapore&# 039;s office property market for the period from June 1992 to December 2005 was constructed. The office rent equation was able to account for 72 per cent of variation <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> <b>rent</b> for the period June 1992 to December 2005. Changes in previous year vacancy rates, contemporaneous construction costs, prime lending rate (lagged 6 months) and contemporaneous office sector employment were identified as the key determinants in explaining the variation <b>in</b> office <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> the Central Region of Singapore...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the factors that}} drive livestock rental market participation by using farm household data. Furthermore, it assessed if there exits any association between livestock and land rental markets. Double hurdle models were applied {{on both sides of}} the livestock rental markets separately. Results show that low caste households are more likely to <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> livestock as compared to high caste; and this is similar for male headed households and households with more male labor. Caste however, does not affect the likelihood to rent out livestock. The larger the owned livestock the less is the probability to <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> livestock and the amount to <b>rent</b> <b>in.</b> Owned livestock holding only affected the amount to rent out but not the likelihood. Owned land holding increased the amount of livestock to rent out. Households with migrated members are less likely to <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> and more likely to rent out livestock. Migration reduced the amount of livestock <b>rented</b> <b>in</b> and increased the amount rented out. This indicates that livestock renting is partly driven by land poverty and partly by Maoist war. A bivariate ordered probit model showed a significant positive association between the decision to participate in livestock and land rental markets.
