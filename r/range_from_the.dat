5|$|Because Wells Cathedral was secular {{rather than}} monastic, cloisters {{were not a}} {{practical}} necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction at these two secular cathedrals <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.|$|E
