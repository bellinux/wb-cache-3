GDM causes serious complications in pregnancy, birth (HAPO Study Cooperative Research Group 2008; Coustan et al. 2010) and the longer term (Dyck et al. 2010), for both women and their infants. Compared to non-Indigenous women, Indigenous women have {{a higher risk of}} GDM (Steinhart et al. 1997; Dyck 2005; Young et al. 2002), at a younger age (Yue et al. 1996; Benjamin et al. 1993), and there is a much higher rate of both diagnosed and undiagnosed T 2 DM in pregnancy (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2010 b). Women diagnosed with GDM have a very high risk of developing T 2 DM postpartum, compared to women who do not have GDM (Kim 2002; Bentley-Lewis et al. 2008; Chodick et al. 2010; Bellamy et al. 2009; Heikes et al. 2008), and Indigenous women experience the highest risk (Yue et al. 1996; Kim 2002). The emergence of diabetic disorders among young child-bearing women represents an ominous ‘tipping point’ (Canadian Diabetes Association 2011) in the diabetes epidemic (Yue et al. 1996), as exposure to diabetes in-utero also significantly compounds the health <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation (Dyck et al. 2010; Osgood et al. 2011), and GDM becomes an additional driver for T 2 DM (Bhattarai 2009; Osgood et al. 2011). T 2 DM is a serious metabolic disorder, characterised by hyperglycaemia and, if left undetected and untreated, increases the risk of serious complications in subsequent pregnancies, including congenital abnormalities (Bower et al. 1992; Farrell et al. 2002), and can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, limb amputations and blindness (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2010 a). T 2 DM is a major cause of death and disability among Aboriginal people (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2008) and directly contributes to health disparities in Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2010).|$|E

40|$|The Bouillante {{geothermal}} field, {{located on}} the west coast of Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles), was explored in the 1970 s, developed in the 1980 s, brought into production in 1986, and expanded in 2005 to currently produce up to 15 MWe. In addition to its electricity-producing role, the Bouillante field is an outstanding research laboratory for improving our knowledge of a reference high temperature (260 °C) geothermal system in island-arc environment. A great deal of scientific research and exploration investigation have been carried out on the Bouillante geothermal field for 10 years, including geological investigation (volcanism), structural analysis of the fluid conduits, geophysical investigations both offshore (magnetics and high-resolution shallow seismics, see Calcagno et al.) and onshore (gravimetry, electrical resistivity tomography profile and passive seismic, see Gailler et al.), characterization of the surface and deep hydrothermal manifestations, numeric geological modelling of the developed field, fluid geochemistry and tracer tests (Sanjuan et al.) and hydrogeological modelling. This large range of multidisciplinary data has made it possible to develop an innovative conceptual model of this type of high-temperature geothermal system. The model highlights the major influence of structural control {{on the development of the}} geothermal activity at different scales and especially on the geometry of the reservoir. It also explores new ideas concerning the geothermal system in terms of heat source, fluid circulation and spatio-temporal scenario. This scenario takes into account all events from the early magmatic activity of the Bouillante volcanic Chain (~ 500, 000 y) up to the beginning of the geothermal field some 250, 000 years later, having probably started with a phreatic explosion in the bay of Bouillante (see Patrier-Mas et al., Verati et al.).

40|$|Background: A {{growing body}} of {{research}} identifies the harmful effects that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; occurring during childhood or adolescence; eg, child maltreatment or exposure to domestic violence) have on health throughout life. Studies have quantified such effects for individual ACEs. However, ACEs frequently co-occur and no synthesis of findings from studies measuring the effect of multiple ACE types has been done. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched five electronic databases for cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies published up to May 6, 2016, reporting risks of health outcomes, consisting of substance use, sexual health, mental health, weight and physical exercise, violence, and physical health status and conditions, associated with multiple ACEs. We selected articles that presented risk estimates for individuals with at least four ACEs compared with those with none for outcomes with sufficient data for meta-analysis (at least four populations). Included studies also focused on adults aged at least 18 years with a sample size of at least 100. We excluded studies based on high-risk or clinical populations. We extracted data from published reports. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) using a random-effects model. Findings: Of 11   621 references identified by the search, 37 included studies provided risk estimates for 23 outcomes, with a total of 253   719 participants. Individuals with at least four ACEs were at increased risk of all health outcomes compared with individuals with no ACEs. Associations were weak or modest for physical inactivity, overweight or obesity, and diabetes (ORs of less than two); moderate for smoking, heavy alcohol use, poor self-rated health, cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease (ORs of two to three), strong for sexual risk taking, mental ill health, and problematic alcohol use (ORs of more than three to six), and strongest for problematic drug use and interpersonal and self-directed violence (ORs of more than seven). We identified considerable heterogeneity (I 2 of > 75 %) between estimates for almost half of the outcomes. Interpretation: To have multiple ACEs is a major risk factor for many health conditions. The outcomes most strongly associated with multiple ACEs represent ACE <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation (eg, violence, mental illness, and substance use). To sustain improvements in public health requires a shift in focus to include prevention of ACEs, resilience building, and ACE-informed service provision.

40|$|Background: Male {{infertility}} due {{to severe}} oligozoospermia and azoospermia {{has been associated}} with a number of genetic factors. Chromosomal abnormalities are one of the principle genetic factors in male infertility. Purpose: To detect the frequency and types of chromosomal anomalies in azoospermics and severe oligozoospermics in Western region of India and to compare these with same studies of other regions of India and the world. Method: - To assess the chromosomal aberration, the karyotyping of 44 azoospermics and 68 severe oligozoospermics were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes using standard G-banding technique. Result: Chromosomal anomalies in azoospermics 18. 2 % (n= 8 / 44) and in severe oligozoospermics 7. 35 % (n= 5 / 68) with an over all 11. 6 % (13 / 112) in western parts of India were comparable with studies from Europe, Africa, Asia, South America and other regions of India.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the quality of mother-child interactions {{in a sample of}} mothers with a history of childhood aggression and social withdrawal, and their at-risk children. The relationship between maternal childhood risk status, maternal scaffolding and child developmental competence was also examined. Participants were recruited from the subjects making up the Concordia Risk Project, which commenced in 1977 when children in Grades 1, 4, or 7, from low SES, inner-city neighbourhoods, were classified along the dimensions of aggression and social withdrawal. Interactions of 42 mothers and their children aged 13 to 42 months were videotaped in their homes during a 15 minute free play session. Quality of mother-child interactions was assessed using the Emotional Availability Scales (Biringen & Robinson, 1991). Quality and quantity of physical contact were also coded. Child developmental status was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Second Edition, Bayley, 1993). Findings lent partial support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prediction that the quality of mother-child interactions in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation would be disrupted by maternal risk status. Mothers with higher levels of childhood aggression and social withdrawal were more likely to demonstrate hostile behaviours in interactions with their children.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHeart failure hospitalizations (HFHs) {{cost the}} US {{health care system}} ∼$ 20 billion annually. Identifying {{patients}} at risk of HFH to enable timely intervention and prevent expensive hospitalization remains a challenge. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization devices with defibrillation capability (CRT-Ds) collect a host of diagnostic parameters that change with HF status and collectively {{have the potential to}} signal an increasing risk of HFH. These device-collected diagnostic parameters include activity, day and night heart rate, atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation (AT/AF) burden, mean rate during AT/AF, percent CRT pacing, number of shocks, and intrathoracic impedance. There are thresholds for these parameters that when crossed trigger a notification, referred to as device observation, which gets noted on the device report. We investigated if these existing device observations can stratify patients at varying risk of HFH. MethodsWe analyzed data from 775 patients (age: 69  ±  11 year, 68 % male) with CRT-D devices followed for 13  ±  5 months with adjudicated HFHs. HFH rate was computed for increasing number of device observations. Data were analyzed by both excluding and including intrathoracic impedance. HFH risk was assessed at the time of a device interrogation session, and all the data between previous and current follow-up sessions were used to determine <b>the</b> HFH <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 30 days. Results 2276 follow-up sessions in 775 patients were evaluated with 42 HFHs in 37 patients.

Patients with 3 or more device observations were at 42 × HFH risk compared to patients with no device observation.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} risk communication effectiveness {{on a national level}} in Norway regarding a future pandemic. The consequences of a pandemic influenza will depend partly upon the risk communication strategy effectiveness. Within risk psychology research, such a strategy should fully consider how general and situational factors may influence public perceptions of the pandemic risk, and how public perceptions affect risk communication efficiency and, consequently, the behavior of recipients towards the pandemic. If ignored, communication gaps could result in overall greater consequences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> general public and/or unequal protection <b>for</b> vulnerable <b>risk</b> groups during a future pandemic. The overall aim of the thesis is therefore to help enhance risk communication efficiency, and thereby risk management. To address this area of research the thesis summarizes scientific research on risk perception and risk communication, and reviews experiences from prior situations and cases. The central interest of the thesis has been how public perceptions of a pandemic risk relate to risk communication efficiency and communication strategy. Scientific communication models used to address public perceptions, which may limit or hinder correct health behavior, are presented and their use in potential future pandemic settings are discussed. The thesis argues that risk communication efficiency will be strengthened by use of scientific models of communication. In this context especially models on information processing (i. e. ELM), approaches eliciting mental contents (i. e. mental models), and practical work with communication of risk (i. e. RISCOM). Predictions of future pandemics are extremely hard to make. To cover various possibilities within a future pandemic this thesis discusses risk communication challenges in situations with different combinations of possibility and consequences (severity of the virus). The idea is that different situations demand different amount of, and different approaches to, the management of risk. Lastly, an effective risk communication strategy does not stop when the pandemic risk officially subsides. It is recommended that communicators learn from the "rights and wrongs" encountered in the latest pandemic and thus ensure public trust in <b>risk</b> communication <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> health <b>risk.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|In Central Europe {{spruce and}} pine are {{severely}} {{affected by the}} impacts of climate change. In several regions a significant decline in their distribution is observed. To cope with this threat, the Bavarian State Institute of Forestry produces climate <b>risk</b> maps <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decades. To be effective however, locational information of the two tree species is required. Such basic information is not yet available at the necessary spatial resolution. The {{aim of this study}} is to generate distribution maps for spruce and pine for entire Bavaria (70. 500 km 2) at a resolution of about one hectare. For each hectare cell, the fraction coverage of the two tree species is to be specified as well as associated uncertainties. In order to meet these user-defined requirements, a two-step methodology combining satellite imagery at metric to deca-metric resolution was developed. In a first step, tree species maps with a high level of detail were generated from 8 -band multispectral WorldView- 2 data with 0. 5 to 2. 0 m spatial resolution. As reference, inventory data from the Bavaria State Forest enterprise was used. Where necessary, additional reference samples were derived from stereo interpretation of aerial images. From this data, detailed tree species maps were generated for roughly 40 sites (each about 100 km 2 large) well distributed across Bavaria. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> object-based mapping, spectral information and textural indices were used. The textural measures were generated at several scales with a discrete stationary wavelet transformation (using Red, Near Infrared and NDVI as inputs). The classification itself was performed using Random Forest (RF). Features used in the classification were selected by means of RFâ€™s importance measures. The generated tree species maps were used in a second step as reference information (targets) to generate the fractional coverage maps <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire country using neural nets. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> upscaling, Landsat multi-temporal data complemented by high resolution RapidEye imagery was used as predictor variables. From the sites with detailed tree species maps, data from these two satellite sensors were extracted and used to train a neural network <b>for</b> estimating <b>the</b> fractional coverage of the two tree species.

The 6 th Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR), held in Bangkok in 2014, was a regional preparatory meeting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> WCDRR, and proposed various targets and indicators for DRR in Asia. The AMCDRR recommended inclusion of these goals in the SFDRR. This study focuses on the WCDRR negotiations, particularly outcomes that affect four major groups: local authorities; children and youth; science and technology; and business and industry. An analysis is undertaken of the overlaps and gaps in the outcomes of the 6 th AMCDRR and other preceding conferences that fed into the WCDRR. A set of recommendations has evolved from this examination <b>for</b> consideration at <b>the</b> upcoming 7 th AMCDRR in 2016. The areas that merit consideration in the upcoming AMCDRR 2016 are: (1) development of baseline data and quantitative indicators for monitoring progress in DRR; (2) creation of a common stakeholder platform; (3) construction of city typologies for consideration in all future local level planning; (4) promotion of a culture of safety by linking large enterprises with small and medium enterprises; and (5) exchange and sharing of information and databases between regions at all scales.|$|R
40|$|Credibility {{theory in}} {{insurance}} {{is essentially a}} form of experience-rating that attempts to use the data in hand {{as well as the}} experience of others in determining rates and premiums. Two types of data are used in the process of estimation using models based on the theory of credibility: data about own insurance risk and data about comparable insurance <b>risks.</b> <b>The</b> predictor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year‘s experience that is linear in the claims experience and optimal in the sense of least squares {{turns out to be a}} weighted average of the claims experience of the individual contract and <b>the</b> experience <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole portfolio. The weight factor is the credibility attached to the individual experience, hence it is called the credibility factor, and the resulting premiums are called credibility premiums. In this article we review the Bühlmann-Straub model that is the most important credibility model and has a lot of application in non-life and life insurance as well as in reinsurance. The Bühlmann- -Straub model belongs to the greatest accuracy credibility theory. Credibility estimators produced by this approach are such linear Bayes estimators that minimize the mean squared error (MSE). Credibility estimators compared with Bayes estimators don‘t require the choice of a prior distribu- tion. Bühlmann showed that credibility estimators depend only on first and second moments that are easy to estimate from statistical data. This paper describes the technique of <b>the</b> credibility estimation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> claim frequency under assumptions of the Bühlmann-Straub model.
