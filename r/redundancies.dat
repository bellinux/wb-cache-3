The following day, it set a deadline of 19 January 2009 and clarified that 27 positions were being made redundant, while 29 vacancies would not be filled. The <b>redundancies</b> proceeded as planned, although forced <b>redundancies</b> down the track were not ruled out.|$|E

40|$|Background The <b>redundancy</b> {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} the species <b>redundancy</b> in a plant community enhances community stability. However, numerous studies in recent years questioned the positive correlation between <b>redundancy</b> and stability. Methodology We explored {{the relationship between the}} species <b>redundancy,</b> functional <b>redundancy</b> and community stability in typical steppe grassland in Northern China by sampling grassland vegetation along a gradient of resource availability caused by micro-topography. We aimed to test whether community <b>redundancy</b> enhanced community stability, and to quantify the relative importance of species <b>redundancy</b> and functional <b>redundancy</b> in maintaining com-munity stability. Results Our results showed that the spatial stability of plant community production increases with increased supply of soil resources, and the functional <b>redundancy</b> instead of species diver-sity or species <b>redundancy</b> is correlated with the community stability. Our results supported the <b>redundancy</b> hypothesis and have implications for sustainable grassland management...|$|R

5|$|In 1973 the LPO {{was caught}} up in a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge. On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to <b>redundancies,</b> and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In general <b>redundancy</b> {{allocation}} {{problems the}} <b>redundancy</b> strategy for each subsystem is predetermined. Tavakkoli- Moghaddam presented a series-parallel <b>redundancy</b> allocation problem with mixing components (RAPMC) {{in which the}} <b>redundancy</b> strategy can be chosen for individual subsystems. In this paper, we present a bi-objective <b>redundancy</b> allocation when the <b>redundancy</b> strategies for subsystems are considered as a variable of the problem.

50|$|Two {{kinds of}} <b>redundancy</b> are possible: space <b>redundancy</b> and time <b>redundancy.</b> Space <b>redundancy</b> {{provides}} additional components, functions, or data {{items that are}} unnecessary for fault-free operation. Space <b>redundancy</b> is further classified into hardware, software and information <b>redundancy,</b> {{depending on the type}} of redundant resources added to the system. In time <b>redundancy</b> the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result. The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as 'In Service Fault Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short.|$|R

In this paper, we focus on <b>redundancy</b> policies and introduce the realizing of two different <b>redundancy</b> systems: the basic whole <b>redundancy</b> system, and the Hetero-type whole <b>redundancy</b> system, viz. two different control kernels (the PLC and its corresponding software and network) {{used in the same}} system. These two <b>redundancy</b> control systems are implemented at examination place and the National Stadium individually. These control systems set a successful example of the <b>redundancy</b> system implemented in mechanical control system at important occasions. By analyzing and comparing the reliability of the two <b>redundancy</b> systems, we get the results that the Hetero-type whole <b>redundancy</b> system has higher reliability than the basic whole <b>redundancy</b> system...|$|R

Most of the technicians were socialists, and Livingstone helped found a branch of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs to fight <b>redundancies</b> imposed by company bosses. Livingstone's leftist views solidified upon the election of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in 1964. With a friend from Chester Beatty, Livingstone toured West Africa in 1966, visiting Algeria, Niger, Nigeria, Lagos, Ghana and Togo. Interested in the region's wildlife, Livingstone rescued an infant ostrich from being eaten, donating it to Lagos children's zoo. Returning home, he took part in several protest marches {{as a part of the}} anti-Vietnam War movement, becoming increasingly interested in politics and briefly subscribing to the publication of a libertarian socialist group, Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing <b>redundancies</b> simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath F.C. {{became a}} limited company in 1888; its first share issue {{was to the}} value of £650. The board was made up of local {{businessmen}} and dignitaries until 1965, when the club was sold to Clifford Coombs. By the mid-1980s the club was in financial trouble. Control passed from the Coombs family to former Walsall F.C. chairman Ken Wheldon, who cut costs, made <b>redundancies,</b> and sold off assets, including the club's training ground. Still unable to make the club pay, Wheldon sold it to the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain. Debt was still increasing when matters came to a head; the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars' businesses into receivership. The club continued in administration for four months until Sport Newspapers' proprietor David Sullivan bought the Kumars' 84% holding for £700,000 from BCCI's liquidator in March 1993. Birmingham City plc, of which the football club was a wholly owned subsidiary, was floated on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in 1997 with an issue of 15million new shares, raising £7.5million of new investment. It made a pre-tax profit of £4.3M in the year ending 31 August 2008.|$|E

The new buildings were intended to facilitate the arrival of 800 staff from GCHQ's former site at Oakley. Though it was initially felt that the Doughnut would be adequate for the new staff, 600 contractors working on technical projects for GCHQ were eventually relocated in a secret undisclosed building in the 'Gloucestershire area'. The parking of cars by GCHQ staff on residential roads has caused 'annoyance' among local residents in Benhall.

40|$|Abstract—Structural <b>redundancy</b> is an {{interesting}} point in seismic design of structures. Initially, the structural <b>redundancy</b> is described as indeterminate degree of a system. Although many definitions are presented for <b>redundancy</b> in structures, recently the definition of structural <b>redundancy</b> has been related to the configuration of structural system {{and the number of}} lateral load transferring directions in the structure.

It is obviously declared that the performance of structures will be affected by adding masonry infill walls. In order to investigate the effect of infill walls on the <b>redundancy</b> of the steel frame which constructed with masonry walls, the components of <b>redundancy</b> including <b>redundancy</b> variation index, <b>redundancy</b> strength index and <b>redundancy</b> response modification factor were extracted for the frames with masonry infills.
