40|$|Intended as a {{proposal}} for a fundamental reorientation of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, this document suggests a new model for the federal role in vocational education aimed at program quality and improvement rather than at the distribution of funds and the provision of ancillary services. An introduction explains the scope and aims of the document, and a snort conclusion section argues for viewing vocational education as a system deserving of wholesale reform rather than a piecemeal effort. In between, section 1 notes implications of the state and lo- 31 education reform movement of the 1980 s that are relevant fo: the reform of secondary vocational education, and section 2 describes the proposed model itself. The model recommends that the federal government avoid direct regulation and instead adopt incentive grants for state governments to en 73 age in broad-scale reform) f vocational education under fetfral guidelines; the establishment of a national task force to develop standards and options <b>regulating</b> <b>course</b> selection, course content, indicators of performance, access of special groups, and governance; and establishment of a new agency with authority over the incentive grants and capable of making substantive judgments, under guidelines, about educational quality. The document concludes with a 53 -item bibliography. (CMS...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the process}} of {{mesoderm}} specification inXenopusembryos, cells of the equatorial region are induced to form mesoderm in response to signals from the underlying endodermal cells. One mesodermal cell type resulting from thisin vivoinduction is skeletal muscle, which has a very specific and tightly <b>regulated</b> <b>course</b> of electrical and morphological development. Previously, electrical development could be analyzed only after neurulation, once myocytes could be morphologically identified. In vitro,activin triggers a cascade of events leading {{to the development of}} specific mesodermal tissues, including skeletal muscle; however, the precise role of activinin vivois less clear. Much is now known about the mechanism and control of activin action, but very {{little is known about the}} subsequent time course of differentiation of activin-induced muscle. Such muscle is routinely identified by the presence of a small number of specific markers which, although they accurately confirm the presence of muscle, give little indication of the time course or quantitative aspects of muscle development. One of the most important functional aspects of muscle development is the acquisition of the complex electrical properties which allow it to function normally. Here we assess the ability of activin to drivein vitrothe normal highly regulated sequence of electrical development in skeletal muscle. We find that in most, but not all, respects the normal time course of development of voltage-gated ion currents is well reproduced in activin-induced muscle. This characterization strengthens the case for activin as an agent capable of inducing the detailed developmental program of muscle and now allows for analysis of the regulation of electrical development prior to neurulation...|$|R

40|$|World Cup (WC) {{alpine ski}} racing {{consists}} of four main competition disciplines (slalom, giant slalom, super-G and downhill), each with specific course and terrain characteristics.

However to date, no detailed data on course setting and its adaptation to terrain is available. It is also unknown how course and terrain characteristics influence skier speed. Therefore, the aim {{of the study was to}} characterize course setting, terrain geomorphology and their relationship to speed in male WC giant slalom, super-G and downhill. The study revealed that terrain was flatter in downhill compared to the other disciplines. In all disciplines, variability in horizontal gate distance (gate offset) was larger than in gate distance (linear distance from gate to gate). In giant slalom the horizontal gate distance increased with terrain inclination, while super-G and downhill did not show such a connection. In giant slalom and super-G, there was a slight trend towards shorter gate distances as the steepness of the terrain increased. Gates were usually set close to terrain transitions in all three disciplines. Downhill had a larger proportion of extreme terrain inclination changes along the skier trajectory per unit time skiing than the other disciplines. Skier speed decreased with increasing steepness of terrain in all disciplines except for downhill. In steep terrain, speed was found to be controllable by increased horizontal gate distances in giant slalom and by shorter gate distances in giant slalom and super-G. Across the disciplines skier speed was largely explained by course setting and terrain inclination in a multiple linear mode...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{evolution}} is a naturally occurring phenomenon in {{fields such as}} aviation technology which deal with a multitude and variation of control systems and the complex devices they operate. Prior to the 1980, the concept of aviation electronics or avionics dealt primarily with communication and navigation systems, {{most of which were}} based on radio principles of one form or another. Nowadays, avionics has found its way into virtually every system aboard modern complex aircraft. As traditional steam gauge type instruments are replaced by cathode ray tube and liquid crystal displays, an understanding of these devices has become a necessary addition to many courses in the airframe and powerplant curriculum. While the Federal Aviation Administration (2004) <b>regulates</b> <b>course</b> content in their Part 147 section of the Code of Federal Regulations to a large degree, a substantial portion of this responsibility also rests with the individual aviation technology school. In order to provide students with sufficient knowledge of these advanced systems in addition to the basics, adjustments have to be made to the curriculum from time to time. In the university setting, this responsibility often lays with a curriculum committee working in concert with involved faculty. This combined effort is not always without problems and is especially complicated by the need to satisfy the requirements of both the university and the FAA. The Aviation Technologies Department at Southern Illinois University recently undertook such an effort. In addition to dealing with policies of the university and the FAA, a short timeframe was also placed in the committee necessitating a highly proactive approach to implementing the curricular changes to effect the necessary additions.

At the molecular level, Snail 1 controls bone mass by repressing the transcription of both the osteoblast differentiation factor Runx 2 and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes in osteoblasts. Sustained activation of Snail 1 in transgenic mice provokes deficient osteoblast differentiation, which, together with the loss of vitamin D signalling in the bone, also impairs osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, the mineralisation of the bone matrix is severely affected, leading to hypocalcemia-independent osteomalacia.
