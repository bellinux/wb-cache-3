25|$|On August 28, 2010, Bear Grylls {{and a team}} of {{five were}} the first <b>rigid</b> <b>inflatable</b> <b>boat</b> (RIB) crew to {{complete}} a point-to-point navigation between Pond Inlet on Baffin Island and Tuktoyaktuk in the Northwest Territories. Note: A Northwest Passage requires crossing the Arctic Circle twice, once each in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, {{he led a}} team of five, {{including}} his childhood friend, SAS colleague, and Mount Everest climbing partner Mick Crosthwaite, on an unassisted crossing of the north Atlantic Ocean, in an open <b>rigid</b> <b>inflatable</b> <b>boat.</b> Grylls and his team traveled in an eleven-metre-long boat and encountered force 8 gale winds with waves breaking over the boat while passing through icebergs in their journey from Halifax, Nova Scotia to John o' Groats, Scotland.|$|E

25|$|Comdr. Dennis J. Van Buskirk {{relieved}} Comdr. Coon as {{the commanding}} officer on 22 January 1988. Klakring completed repairs in drydock at Jacksonville Shipyards, Florida (1–22 February). The ship accomplished Interim Readiness Training with Task Group (TG) 43.2 at Guantánamo Bay (21 March–13 April). A variety of training exercises followed, broken by a visit to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida (8–13 May). She carried out further training, refueled at Roosevelt Roads on 18 May, visited St. Thomas (18–21 May), and on 27 May returned to Charleston. Klakring loaded a Coast Guard <b>Rigid</b> <b>Inflatable</b> <b>Boat</b> in preparation for her Caribbean Law Enforcement Operations (CDOPs) on 13 June 1988, setting sail the following day. The ship embarked a helicopter detachment at Mayport, Florida, on 18 June, and the following day the remaining Coast Guardsmen and their equipment boarded at Miami. Klakring participated in CDOPs (22 June–8 July), and returned to Charleston on 13 July.|$|E

500|$|A {{range of}} {{different}} vehicles are used, including the Supacat High Mobility Transporter (HMT) Extenda with 31 purchased in 2007 designated the Special Operations Vehicle – Special Reconnaissance (SOV-SR), named [...] "Nary" [...] after a SASR warrant officer killed during pre-deployment training in 2005. The first Nary was delivered in 2008 {{but due to}} technical problems the vehicles did not enter service until 2011, replacing the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) which had seen extensive service in Afghanistan and Iraq. New SOV-Logistics trucks are being acquired to replace the Mercedes-Benz Unimog for supply, support and recovery of the SOV-SR. A lighter, less protected vehicle, more akin to the LRPV—the Polaris Defense DAGOR (Deployable Advanced Ground Off-road)—was being trialled in 2015. Motorcycles are also used for long range strategic reconnaissance seeing service in Afghanistan. Polaris six-wheel all-terrain vehicles are also used, seeing service in Afghanistan. Heavily modified up-armoured Toyota Land Cruiser four wheel drive vehicles designated SOV-Support are used for domestic counter-terrorism and special recovery. The USMI 11m Naval Special Warfare <b>Rigid</b> <b>Inflatable</b> <b>Boat</b> designated Air Drop Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (ADRHIB) is used for domestic counter-terrorism and special recovery. The Divex Shadow rebreather is used in diving operations.|$|E

2500|$|Coastguard {{monitored}} the ship, which was carrying 150 tonnes of fuel oil. An attempt to refloat her {{was to have}} been made at high tide at 18:00 on 1 February, but it was later announced that no attempt would be made to refloat her that day. A salvage team from Smit International assessed the ship on 2 February,and a [...] exclusion zone was set up. Liverpool Coastguard warned that refloating the ship would take another two or three days, depending on weather and tide conditions, although another source stated the salvage operation could take weeks. It was estimated that refloating would take place in the second week of February, but this proved to be over optimistic. The salvage team assembled the equipment needed to refloat the ship, including a <b>rigid</b> <b>inflatable</b> <b>boat</b> suitable for use in shallow water. They planned to reduce the list of the ship and pump out the fuel on board. Riverdance was reported to be [...] "intact".|$|E
2500|$|On 21 June 2004, eight British {{servicemen}} {{were detained}} for three days, after Iran {{said they had}} entered Iranian territorial waters in somewhat similar circumstances. They were released unharmed after the British and Iranian governments agreed {{there had been a}} misunderstanding. Their equipment was not returned and a <b>rigid</b> <b>inflatable</b> <b>boat</b> (RIB) was put on display in a museum in Tehran. During their detention, according to former detainee Marine Scott Fallon, he believed that they had endured a mock execution in which they were marched into the desert and made to stand blindfolded in front of a ditch while he heard their captors cock their weapons. They also appeared blindfolded on Iranian TV, where they were forced to apologise for their [...] "mistake". There were, however, some differences between these two events. In 2004 the Royal Navy boats were operating much closer to the northern coast of the Persian Gulf in the mouth of the Shatt al Arab waterway which divides southern Iran and Iraq. The weather was bad causing negligible visibility which may have contributed to a potential crossing of the Iranian border by the Royal Navy. After the crew were returned and events analysed the British government affirmed its belief that the personnel were actually still in Iraqi waters, however they consigned the incident to a misunderstanding and requested the return of the equipment. In the 2007 incident the boats were by contrast operating some distance from the Iraqi-Iranian mainland in open water and were (according to the British) 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi territory. Visibility conditions were good and the crew had GPS navigational equipment (installed in part due to the 2004 incident).|$|E
