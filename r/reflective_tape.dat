That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England".

Cameron {{was also one of the}} directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, there are three screens on his control panel displaying wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light, with <b>reflective</b> <b>tape</b> placed along every edge of the model buildings.

40|$|Laser Doppler Vibrometry, LDV, {{is known}} to be a useful tool for {{measuring}} vibration and wave propagation for Non-destructive testing (NDT). Although LDV systems have many advantages, most notably they provide non-contact measurements, they often require surface enhancement [1, 2]. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, <b>reflective</b> <b>tapes</b> are commonly used as a surface enhancement method in LDV applications. While accurate for low frequencies, measured displacements are not reliable once the frequency exceeds a threshold value. In this study, different tapes are mounted on the surface of an aluminum block, and out-of-plane displacements are recorded for frequencies from 0. 5 to 5 MHz. Furthermore, dynamic finite element modeling was conducted, where the effect of <b>reflective</b> <b>tapes</b> on measured displacements {{on the surface of the}} tape is evaluated. Results of the finite element simulations reveal that the effective stiffness of the tape can contribute significantly to error in data acquisition during experiments. Figure 1 shows the harmonic analysis of tape under longitudinal and shear wave excitation. As evident in the figure, discrepancy between the measured displacements from the top and the bottom of the tape is considerably large at some frequencies. Moreover, finite element wave propagation simulation has been done in order to get better understanding of experimental studies...|$|R

2500|$|Reflectors and <b>reflective</b> <b>tape</b> provide {{additional}} visibility (especially {{when applied to}} moving parts of the bicycle) and are mandatory in many jurisdictions. Pedal reflectors in particular are very visible to following traffic as they move up and down; unfortunately they are not compatible with most clipless pedal systems, although adaptors are available for some, mainly older SPD models, and a few single-sided designs are available with built-in reflectors. [...] In the UK, where front and rear pedal reflectors are compulsory after dark, most cyclists with clipless pedals are therefore riding illegally. [...] The law is rarely if ever enforced, but could potentially be used in court to reduce financial compensation if the cyclist were {{to be hit by}} another vehicle. [...] The CTC have suggested that the requirement should be waived if the cyclist fits an additional rear reflector or lighting, but this was not changed in the last revision of the UK vehicle lighting laws (which permitted flashing LEDs). [...] Riders of recumbent bicycles have pointed out that the pedal reflector requirement is nonsensical for them, since the reflectors point straight up and down in use, and are invisible from other vehicles. [...] As of 2008, California law allows white or yellow shoe reflectors (front and back), or reflective ankle bands, in lieu of pedal reflectors.|$|E

The navigation principal is based on measured directions to several identical beacons, consisting of strips of <b>reflective</b> <b>tapes.</b> The angular sensor is a rotating laser for the illumination of the beacons and a highly sensitive electro-optical receiver for detecting the directions to the beacons. A Kalman filter is used to combine the measurements from the odometers with the detected angles to the known position of the beacons. To measure the angle between the robot and the trailer the same laser was used. This was done by placing two reflective beacons on the trailer. The repeatability was within 2 centimetre at low speed. The navigation of these {{two different types of}} vehicles turns out to be, essentially, the same problem. The sensitivities are different.

50|$|Because normal {{paddling}} involves alternately dipping {{and raising}} the paddle blades, the colour of the blades may affect the visibility of the kayaker to powerboats operators under limited visibility conditions. For this reason white or yellow blades may offer a safety advantage over black or blue blades. Of course, kayakers should wear a headlamp or have other lighting on their kayak under conditions of limited lighting. However, if a powerboat operator must look straight into a sun {{low in the sky}} to see a kayaker, the motion of brightly coloured paddle blades may be of more value than lighting on the kayak.

After the camera were adequately calibrated {{and the project}} photos were imported, points could be marked and referenced. Point marking and referencing {{is a process that}} matches the same points in different photos, taken from different locations and angles, so that the relative orientation of the object can be established. As mentioned earlier, several red <b>reflective</b> markers were <b>taped</b> to the objects so that this process would be accelerated by the automated feature in iWitness. After the relative orientation of the model was established by the marking and referencing process, the absolute orientation was set by setting the scale bar distance (or distances) to its 30 ″ calibrated length. Once the scale bars were referenced in each model, accuracy comparisons were made on the models.|$|R

This software is of the type used in maneuvering exploratory robotic vehicles on Martian terrain. The software in question utilizes correlations between portions of the images recorded by two electronic cameras to compute stereoscopic disparities, which, in conjunction with camera models, are used in computing distances to terrain points {{to be included in}} constructing a three-dimensional model of the terrain. The analysis included effects of correlation- window size, a pyramidal image down-sampling scheme, vertical misalignment, focus, maximum disparity, stereo baseline, and range ripples. Contributions of sub-pixel interpolation, vertical misalignment, and foreshortening to stereo correlation error were examined theoretically and experimentally. It was found that camera-calibration inaccuracy contributes to both down-range and cross-range error but stereo correlation error affects only the down-range error. Experimental data for quantifying the stereo disparity error were obtained by use of <b>reflective</b> metrological targets <b>taped</b> to corners of bricks placed at known positions relative to the cameras.

Two families of marker sets were identified with the lowest error. The first family was composed by two anterior and one posterior marker on the thorax (incisura jugularis (IJ), xiphoid process, and T 8). The second family was composed by two posterior and one anterior maker (IJ, T 2 and T 8 or T 10). Even, if these two families of marker sets presented a similar error for marker position, the angles obtained from these marker sets showed large differences especially for the axial rotation movement of the trunk (up to 40. 1 °).

40|$|This {{hermeneutic}} phenomenological {{inquiry is}} {{called by the}} question, What is the lived experience of 'being-with' in the nursing student-teacher relationship? I engage with eight senior baccalaureate nursing students {{in teaching and learning}} together in a psychiatric-mental health nursing course. Text is gathered through their narrative work in <b>reflective</b> journals and <b>taped</b> classroom conversations, as well as through taped individual hermeneutic conversations. The exploration into the phenomenon of 'being-with' is philosophically grounded in the work of Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and David Levin. The framework of activities as identified by Max van Manen (1990) brings the research to a practical possibility. 	As the students and I dwell together through listening, 'being-with' in the context of our pedagogical relationship is opened up for our understanding. Accounts of lived experiences are offered and become opportunities for deep interpretation. Through this hermeneutic work experiential structures of the phenomenon of 'being-with' are brought forward and named in the presence of listening. Students and teacher alike risk vulnerability, enter into silence, and engage in profound meaning making of being in teaching and learning together. 	'Being-with' in the nursing student-teacher relationship unravels as the following dimensions: creating soul space, flowing and blending in community, soul-friendship, hand of comfort in the midst of anxiety, opening an inn-between, and holding eternal echoes. Transformation through the experience and language of 'being-with' offers up possibilities for being in pedagogy and curriculum. This hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry into the phenomenon of 'being-with' in the nursing student-teacher relationship unfolds as a blanket of understanding and necessarily leads toward a pedagogy of 'being-with' the world of nursing education...|$|R
