40|$|The globin gene is {{preferentially}} {{sensitive to}} digestion by DNase I in erythrocyte chromatin {{but not in}} brain, fibroblast, or oviduct chromatin. Elution of the erythrocyte chromatin with 0. 35 M NaCl leads to no detectable change in the gross structure of individual nucleosomes; however, in this depleted chromatin the globin gene is no longer preferentially sensitive to DNase I. <b>Reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> the depleted chromatin with either the entire 0. 35 M NaCl fraction or a subclass from this fraction greatly enriched in two high mobility group proteins (nos. 14 and 17) results in the successful <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> DNase I sensitivity of the globin gene. For all of these preparations, the inactive ovalbumin gene exhibited no preferential sensitivity to DNase I. <b>Reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> the erythrocyte 0. 35 M NaCl fraction with depleted brain chromatin resulted in no preferential sensitivity of the globin gene in brain chromatin; however, <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> the brain 0. 35 M NaCl fraction with depleted erythrocyte chromatin led to successful <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> DNase I sensitivity of the globin gene. Thus, the eluted proteins responsible for conferring DNase I sensitivity are probably not tissue-specific and probably do not recognize specific DNA sequences...|$|R

40|$|Kinetic {{analysis}} of the in vitro <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase [D-glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1. 2. 1. 12] from yeast showed that both oxidized and reduced coenzyme enhance the transconformation reaction, which is rate limiting in the sequential folding-association process at high enzyme concentrations (Krebs, H., Rudolph, R. & Jaenicke, R. (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 100, 359 - 364). In the present study the <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> the enzyme has been analyzed after covalent modification with the coenzyme analog 3 -[(3 -bromoacetylpyridinio) -propyl]adenosine pyrophosphate. <b>Reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> the modified enzyme, {{as determined by the}} regain of the native tryptophan fluorescence, is found to be more then 10 times faster than refolding of the unmodified apoenzyme and more than 5 times faster than that of the unmodified holoenzyme. Various degrees of denaturation and the presence of up to 0. 4 M guanidine. HCl do not affect the rate <b>of</b> <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> the modified enzyme. The kinetic effect of free or covalently bound coenzyme is discussed in terms of a decrease in free energy of the native or native-like structure or in terms of a decreased activation energy of rate-limiting steps in the process <b>of</b> <b>reconstitution.</b> Stabilization <b>of</b> the dimeric intermediate or acceleration of its transformation seems to be the most likely explanation for the observed effect of free or covalently bound coenzyme on the rate <b>of</b> <b>reconstitution...</b>|$|R
