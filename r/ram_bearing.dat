30|$|The {{present study}} is limited in that it focused upon consumers’ attitudes and {{behaviors}} toward a specialty retailer, university-branded merchandise store. As such, findings may not be generalizable to other types of retailers. Similarly, the sample used in the study—college students—limits {{the generalizability of the}} findings to other populations. In the future, researchers may wish to examine the influence exterior store atmospherics upon consumer behavior in other retail settings (e.g., food stores, mass merchandisers) and/or among varied consumer groups (e.g., children, older consumers). Further, this research raises questions about the potential impact of store greeters upon consumers’ attitudes and behaviors. Our findings, which revealed an aversive reaction to the featured store greeter, conflict with prior research suggesting that store greeters may positively impact consumers’ spending, satisfaction, and perceptions (Otterbring et al. 2013). This disparity in findings may be attributed to the fact that in our study, the store greeter did not appear as a “person,” per se, but rather, took the form of a person wearing a university mascot costume that took the form of animal (i.e., a <b>ram)</b> <b>bearing</b> low physical similarity to humans (cf., Connell, 2013). Thus, it would be valuable for researchers to explore the influence of various types of store greeters (e.g., people vs. animal mascots) in differing retail settings.|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli cells bearing certain {{mutations}} in rpsD (coding for the 30 S ribosomal protein S 4) show a ribosomal ambiguity (Ram) phenotype characterized by increased translational error rates. Here {{we show that}} spontaneous mutagenesis increases in <b>Ram</b> cells <b>bearing</b> the rpsD 14 allele, suggesting that the recently described translational stress-induced mutagenesis pathway is activated in Ram cells...|$|R
50|$|The other direct {{offspring}} of Egyptian hieroglyphs was the Meroitic alphabet. It {{began in the}} Napatan phase of Nubian history, Kush (700-300 BCE). It came into full fruition in the 2nd century, under the successor Nubian kingdom of Meroë. The script can be read but not understood, with the discovery at el-Hassa, Sudan of <b>ram</b> statues <b>bearing</b> meroitic inscriptions might assist in its translation.|$|R
