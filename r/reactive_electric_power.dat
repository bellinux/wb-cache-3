It {{is well known that}} when the stator is connected to the electric grid, the rotor voltage can control both mechanical torque and <b>reactive</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power.</b> To guarantee efficient wind energy conversion, it is important to research and design more advanced control schemes. In this thesis, we first review the basic theory behind DFIGs and Adaptive Control. Next we design an adaptive controller for a wind turbine using a DFIG and model and simulate the system. In order to create a valid assessment on the results of this method, we compare the system's performance with a standard control scheme based on proportional integral (PI) controllers as proposed in standard approaches...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAt {{the present}} time, {{reliability}} {{and stability of}} electric power have been very important {{when it comes to}} electrical systems in any plants, especially in terms of distribution. Phoenix Pulp & Paper PCL (PPPC) in Khon Kaen, Thailand, is currently generating electric power about 90 % of its current needed by themselves and buys the rest from Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Nonetheless, the protection system should be installed to protect the electrical bus when electrical generating process trips or breakdown. Otherwise, it would cause the shutdown of electrical system and lose all manufacturing. To protect electrical system, PPPC therefore has to use load shedding system for cutting the connection of the machines from the system within few minutes. Power flow of electric power from 115 kV PEA to 11 kV via 2 transformers of 115 kV/ 11 kV and PPPC's 3 generators are studied in this research by setting the real electric power (P), <b>reactive</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> (Q), current (I) and voltage (V) in the protection relay of load shedding system of 11 kV switchboards. In addition, motor control panel, simulated by SKM Power Tools program, is investigated in this research work. The simulation results: P, Q, I and V will be divided into 4 cases: the trips from TG-PUC, TG 2, TG 3 (in-house generation) and the one from PEA. In the case that there is a trip from PEA electrical distribution, P, only generated from the first three generators in house, will be insufficient to cover the plant's electric need and require around 6, 512 kW more. As a result, the machines would have to be stopped running. However, if there is a trip from its in-house generation (TG-PUC, TG 2 and TG 3) instead, some P can be directly received from PEA. Thus, the load shedding scheme is important to protect the blackout system from electrical system's trip in distribution...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> monoring based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for {{the nuclear power}} plants. The Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and the feed-forward neural network are selected for the plant modeling and anomaly detection {{because of the high}} capability of modeling for dynamic behaviors. Two types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are used. The first one Elman type of RNN which has a feed-back from hidden layer to the input layer neurons while in the Jordan type, from the outputs of the neural net to the inputs of the neural net. Although this approach enables to realize the whole system condition monitoring in operating nuclear power plant (NPP), we are especially focused on active power and reactive power monitoring as well as power factor monitoring. Today, competition in <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> supply industry needs to properly evaluate plant capabilities and produced power quality, so the monitoring of active and reactive power becomes an important issue. Therefore active and reactive power and their variations are monitored taking their signals using the assigned channels and the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> coefficient is simultaneously monitored from these measured <b>reactive</b> and active <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> signals.

40|$|Distributed Capacitance (DC) is an <b>electric</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> source {{connected}} {{directly to}} the distribution network or on the customer site of the meter. It is related {{with the use of}} small capacity units installed in strategic points of electric distribution system and mainly close to the load centres. An optimal placement of DC can minimize the losses in the system, improve voltage profiles and increase load factors of distribution system. This paper proposes an accurate method for optimal allocation of DC in the distribution systems based on intelligent technique namely particle swarm optimization (PSO). The system loss of electrical network is used as an indicator to evaluate the impact of DC location on system reliability and voltage profile. To demonstrate the global optimization power of the presented techniques, the IEEE 30 -bus test system has been used in this study to evaluate the proper location of the DC in the electrical network. The results illustrate a high reduction of system losses when DC is located at the proper location with suitable size compared with the system loss at the base case...|$|R

40|$|In Japan, {{with the}} {{reorganization}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> industry of 1951 the state management introduced in 1939 was abolished, and nine privatelymanaged, regionally intgrated companies were established: Hokkaido <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Tohoku <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Tokyo <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Chubu <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Hokuriku <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Kansai <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Chugoku <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Shikoku <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., and Kyushu <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to trace the process in which the 9 -block plan, adopted in {{the reorganization of}} 1951, was formulated. In other words, that is to specify who the opinion leader of the reorganization of Japan's <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> industry was. There were three candidates for the opinion leader: Nine Haiden Kaisha(electric distributing companies), the General Headquarters/Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers(GHQ/SCAP), and MATSUNAGA Yasuzaemon(the former president of the Toho <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co.). Of the three, Nine Haiden Kaisha completely changed their reorganization plan in 1948 from state management in reality to private management. GHQ/SCAP which made so many plans as 5 -block, 7 -block, 9 -block and 10 -block, also could not keep its own opinion consistently. On the contrary, MATSUNAGA who was the chairman of the <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Industry Reorganization Council from November 1949 to February 1950, kept th 9 -block plan from the beginning to the end. Therefore, it may safely be said that MATSUNAGA was the opinion leader of the reorganization of Japan's <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Industry of 1951, though the commonly accepted theory emphasizes the role of GHQ/SCAP. This paper is based mainly on the GHQ/SCAP Papers in the Washington National Records Center, Suitland, Maryland, U. S. A., and KOIKE Shinzo Papers in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Tokyo, Japan.

Denryoku Renmei (the League of <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Companies) was the cartel organized by five big <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> companies, Tokyo <b>Electric</b> Light Co., Great Consolidated <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Toho <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Nippon <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co. and Ujigawa <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., in April, 1932. Denki Iinkai (the committee on Electricity) was the government agency organized according to revised Electric Industry Law in December, 1932. The commonly accepted theory, which asserts that <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> capital was put under the control of Zaibatsu, is not adequate, because it neglects the independency of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> capital.
