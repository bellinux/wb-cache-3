40|$|AbstractWe have {{reported}} that HT 29 colon cancer cells, which are <b>radiosensitized</b> by fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd), exhibit a greater increase in cyclin E—dependent kinase activity and progress further into S phase {{in the presence of}} FdUrd than do SW 620 colon cancer cells, which are only minimally sensitized by this drug (Cancer Res 56 : 3203, 1996). Although these findings suggested that the ability to progress into S phase in the presence of FdUrd permits cells to be <b>radiosensitized,</b> we wished to test this hypothesis by attempting to drive SW 620 human colon cells into S phase by transducing them with the HPV 16 -E 7 gene.

40|$|Summary. -The x-ray dose {{required}} to cure half the mice bearing first generation transplanted mammary carcinomata 150 days after irradiation was determined. NDPP {{proved to be}} a relatively poor radiosensitizer in mice, for although a maximum enhancement ratio of 1 - 3 was obtained when x-rays produced from a 1. 4 MeVp electron accelerator were given between 10 and 17 min after the administration of NDPP, this was at a drug concentration sufficient to cause marked kidney abnormalities in 5 - 10 % of the mice. IT HAS BEEN suggested that radioresistant hypoxic cells may limit the success of radiotherapy in the local control of tumours (see recent review by Fowler, 1972). We are investigating drugs which will preferentially <b>radiosensitize</b> such cells, one such drug being NDPP (p-nitro- 3 -dimethylaminopropiophenone hydrochloride) (Ro- 03 - 6156) which has been shown in vitro to <b>radiosensitize</b> both bacterial and mammalian cells to give enhancement ratios (ER) of up to 4 3 and 2 - 6 respectively. The compound was synthesized from PNAP (p-nitroacetophenone) by a Mannich type condensation with formaldehyde and dimethylamine hydrochloride (by Roche Products Limited) and, whilst retaining the same phenone moiety as PNAP, NDPP had a greatly enhanced water solubility (Adams et al., 1972). NDPP has also been shown to <b>radiosensitize</b> hypoxic murine skin in vivo to give enhancement ratios of 1 P 3 to 1. 5 (Denekamp and Michael, 1972).

40|$|Summary. -The nitro-aromatic <b>radiosensitizing</b> {{drugs are}} {{selectively}} toxic to hypoxic mammalian cells, and this toxicity can be greatly increased {{by the addition}} of ascorbate. The ascorbate itself is not toxic to either hypoxic or aerobic cells (as long as catalase is present to prevent the formation of significant concentrations of hydro-gen peroxide) and the mixture of ascorbate plus radiosensitizer is not more toxic to aerobic cells. Sulphydryl reducing agents and dithionite have an effect opposite to ascorbate and decrease the toxicity of nitro-aromatic drugs under hypoxic conditions. Sulphydryl reducing agents are also reported to nullify the <b>radiosensitizing</b> properties of nitroaromatic drugs, in contrast to ascorbate which has no effect on the <b>radiosensitizing</b> properties.

Because radiotherapy is frequently used in pancreatic cancer treatment, we assessed the contribution of oncogenic K-ras signaling to pancreatic cancer radiosensitivity. Seven human pancreatic carcinoma lines with activated K-ras and two cell lines with wild-type ras were used to examine clonogenic cell survival after Ras inhibition. Ras inhibition was accomplished by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of K-ras expression and by blocking Ras processing using a panel of prenyltransferase inhibitors of differing specificity for the two prenyltransferases that modify K-Ras. K-ras knockdown by siRNA or inhibition of prenyltransferase activity resulted in radiation sensitization in vitro and in vivo in tumors with oncogenic K-ras mutations. Inhibition of farnesyltransferase alone was sufficient to <b>radiosensitize</b> most K-ras mutant tumors, although K-Ras prenylation was not blocked. These results show that inhibition of activated K-Ras can promote radiation killing of pancreatic carcinoma in a superadditive manner. The finding that farnesyltransferase inhibition alone <b>radiosensitizes</b> tumors with K-ras mutations implies that a farnesyltransferase inhibitor-sensitive protein other than K-Ras may contribute to survival in the context of mutant K-ras.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{examines}} whether activated macrophages may <b>radiosensitize</b> tumor cells through {{the release of}} proinflammatory mediators. METHODS AND MATERIALS: RAW 264. 7 macrophages were activated by lipid A, and the conditioned medium (CM) was analyzed for the secretion of cytokines {{and the production of}} nitric oxide (NO) through inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). EMT- 6 tumor cells were exposed to CM and analyzed for hypoxic cell radiosensitivity. The role of nuclear factor (NF) -kappaB in the transcriptional activation of iNOS was examined by luciferase reporter gene assay. RESULTS: Clinical immunomodulator lipid A, at a plasma-relevant concentration of 3 microg/mL, stimulated RAW 264. 7 macrophages to release NO, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha, and other cytokines. This in turn activated iNOS-mediated NO production in EMT- 6 tumor cells and drastically enhanced their radiosensitivity. Radiosensitization was abrogated by the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine but not by a neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibody. The mechanism of iNOS induction was linked to NF-kappaB but not to JAK/STAT signaling. Interferon-gamma further increased the NO production by macrophages to a level that caused radiosensitization of EMT- 6 cells through the bystanding effect of diffused NO.

Herein, we have described the use of flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) to generate NPs from titanium and gadolinium precursors to produce titania NPs doped with 5 at% gadolinium. The NPs were fully characterized, and their capacity to act as radiosensitizers was confirmed by clonogenic assays. The integrity of the NPs in vitro was also ascertained due to the potentially adverse effects of free gadolinium in the body. The activity of the NPs was then studied under hypoxia since this is often a barrier to effective radiotherapy. In vitro radiosensitization experiments were performed with both the hypoxia mimetics deferoxamine and cobalt chloride and also under true hypoxia (oxygen concentration of 0. 2 %). It was shown that the <b>radiosensitizing</b> NPs were able to cause a significant increase in cell death even after irradiation under hypoxic conditions such as those found in tumors. Subsequently, the synthesized NPs were used to modify polystyrene embolization microparticles. The NPs were sintered to the surface of the microparticles by heating at 230 °C for 15 minutes.

IGF- 1 R inhibitor AZ 12253801 blocked cell survival and <b>radiosensitized</b> IGF- 1 R-overexpressing murine fibroblasts but not isogenic IGF- 1 R-null cells, supporting specificity for IGF- 1 R. IGF- 1 R inhibition enhanced radiosensitivity in DU 145, PC 3 and 22 Rv 1 prostate cancer cells, comparable to effects of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated inhibition. AZ 12253801 -treated DU 145 cells showed delayed resolution of γH 2 AX foci, apparent within 1 [*]h of irradiation and persisting for 24 [*]h. In contrast, IGF- 1 R inhibition did not influence radiosensitivity or γH 2 AX focus resolution in LNCaP-LN 3 cells, suggesting that radiosensitization tracks with the ability of IGF- 1 R to influence DSB repair. To differentiate effects on repair from growth and cell-survival responses, we tested AZ 12253801 in DU 145 cells at sub-SF 50 concentrations that had no early (⩽ 48 [*]h) effects on cell cycle distribution or apoptosis induction. Irradiated cultures contained abnormal mitoses, and after 5 days IGF- 1 R-inhibited cells showed enhanced radiation-induced polyploidy and nuclear fragmentation, consistent with the consequences of entry into mitosis with incompletely repaired DNA. AZ 12253801 <b>radiosensitized</b> DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) -proficient but not DNA-PK-deficient glioblastoma cells, and did not <b>radiosensitize</b> DNA-PK-inhibited DU 145 cells, suggesting that in the context of DSB repair, IGF- 1 R functions in the same pathway as DNA-PK. Finally, IGF- 1 R inhibition attenuated repair by both NHEJ and HR in HEK 293 reporter assays. These data indicate that IGF- 1 R influences DSB repair by both major DSB repair pathways, findings that may inform clinical application of this approach...|$|R
40|$|In the {{transformation}} to a cancerous phenotype, cells often develop resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation used for cancer therapy. The P 13 -K/Akt pathway is a pro-growth, anti-apoptotic pathway downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases that is frequently dysregulated in tumor cells. ^ Our hypothesis was that inhibition of PI 3 -K/Akt by adenoviral-delivery {{of the tumor}} suppressor PTEN would <b>radiosensitize</b> human tumor cell lines in vitro. Three cell lines were <b>radiosensitized</b> by our Ad-PTEN treatment as determined by clonogenic survival. DNA double strand break (DSB) repair was tracked {{in one of the}} sensitized cell lines by counting the number of γ-H 2 AX foci microscopically. The Ad-PTEN treated cells were not as efficient at DNA repair as the controls. We believe this repair inhibition results in a mitotic catastrophe upon attempted cell division, and accounts for the radiosensitive phenotype we observed. ^ The second project targeted the protein Ku 70, an early component of the DNA DSB repair process that tethers damaged DNA ends, and activates DNA-PK. We hypothesized that reduction of Ku 70 protein levels using siRNA would lead to radio sensitization caused by inhibition of the repair of DNA DSBs. We observed a delay in the repair kinetics of cells with partially depleted Ku 70, and conclude that the cells entered mitosis prematurely, with unrepaired DSBs, and either died or senesced. ^ In addition to having a role in DSB repair, the DNA-PK catalytic subunit performs an essential phosphorylation on Akt Ser- 473. Due to the Ku 70 / 80 subunit 2 ̆ 7 s role in activating DNA-PK, we hypothesized that Ku 70 inhibition would result in a decreased phosphorylation of Akt Ser- 473. We observed that levels of phospho-Akt Ser- 473 were decreased when we depleted Ku 70 with siRNA. These data fit a model where Ku 70 is bound to DNA-PKcs and acts as an activator or scaffold protein for DNA-PKcs. We conclude that depletion of Ku 70 levels inhibits Akt activity, and inhibition of Ku 70 and PI 3 -K/Akt signaling may <b>radiosensitize</b> cells by inhibiting DNA DSB repair. ...|$|R
