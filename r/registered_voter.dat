5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a <b>registered</b> <b>voter</b> in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E

The credits are redeemed from the program, which is funded by an annual State general-fund appropriation of $9 per <b>registered</b> <b>voter.</b> The program fund may not exceed $12 million at any time.|$|E

25|$|Tucson {{is known}} for being a {{trailblazer}} in voluntary partial publicly financed campaigns. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33¢ for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64¢ per <b>registered</b> <b>voter,</b> or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by {{the date of the}} primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.|$|E
