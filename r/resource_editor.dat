5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{extensions}} {{was not present}} in the original Macintosh system software, but the system nevertheless had a private patching mechanism that developers soon learned {{to take advantage of}} - the INIT loader.

50|$|As the {{resource}} fork can be edited with a <b>resource</b> <b>editor</b> such as ResEdit, {{it can be}} used to localize and customize software. In addition, most resource editors allow visual editing of data. In macOS, it is possible to use resources when developing an application. However, if the application may need to be used in UFS, it is also possible to configure it so that the entire resource fork is moved to the data fork, using the Raw Resource File setting. The integrated development environments distributed for free by Apple Inc., which include MPW and Apple Developer's Tools, include a compiler called Rez. This uses a dedicated language, also called Rez, which can be used to create a resource fork by compiling source code. A decompiler, DeRez, which can be used to change a resource fork back into Rez code is also included.|$|E
50|$|On 7 April 2008, Microsoft {{released}} an update to the MFC classes as an out-of-band update to Visual Studio 2008 and MFC 9. The update features new user interface constructs, including the ribbons and associated UI widgets, fully customizable toolbars, docking panes which {{can either be}} freely floated or docked to any side and document tabs. The MFC ribbon <b>resource</b> <b>editor</b> allows the developer to design the ribbon graphically {{instead of having to}} use the XML-based declarative markup like the RibbonX API. Optionally, ribbon components may be programmed directly by calling a new set of ribbon class methods. The developer may mix graphical and programmatic ribbon development as is convenient. The MFC application wizard has also been upgraded to support the new features, including a check-box to select whether the application will use the ribbon or the docking panes. The new functionality is provided in new classes so that old applications still continue to run. This update is building on top of BCGSoft’s BCGControlBar Library Professional Edition.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the use of}} simulation models in an e-learning environ-ment. Nowadays, simulation models {{are a part of}} computer-assisted learning and thus an important guide for lifelong education. E-learning systems, com-bined with the use of simulation models as tool for interactivity, are the best way to provide some kind of virtual reality in education. Important techniques for building a usable simulation model are also presented. A good model has to be accompanied by texts, demonstration material, worksheets, teachers ' guides, student manuals, as well as tools for the teacher {{in order to be able}} to make changes in the computer simulation program, like a text-editor, a graphic editor as well as a <b>resource</b> <b>editor.</b> In addition, the paper describes why it is important to follow the building scheme and discusses the problem of credibility. Then, these models are explained as a method of learning dependent on and inde-pendent from the use of computers and a view of its valuable aspects is shown. After presenting various examples from the primary and secondary schools to INFuture 2007 : “Digital Information and Heritage” 470 the university and in lifelong learning, examples of their use in information sci-ences have been presented, as well as need to include the course of building simulation model in the curriculum.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} code {{generating}} software tool, which is one section of the Oregon SpeedCode Universe. The Code Generator automatically generates compilable source code to form working Macintosh applications. This source code provides a prototype for the actual final application. This is done with minimal programmer input. The inputs to the Code Generator are: application shell files, a data file with an encoded sequence of actions and a Control List file. The sequences are specified in a Sequence Command file using the sequence command language and define what takes place when a user performs specified actions within the application. The Control List file contains the ID numbers and types of all windows, dialogs, and alerts contained in the resource file plus a count of the number of items in their dialog item lists. The Oregon SpeedCode Universe is a software tool that provides a system combining a user interface management system with a structured design facility. It is intended for rapid prototyping. The resource file can be generated by the <b>Resource</b> <b>Editor</b> section of the Oregon SpeedCode Universe and the Sequence Command and Control List files by the Graphical Sequencer section. A literature search provided the theoretical justification for software tools such as OSU and the Code generator in particular. The search also provided a comparative study of other automatic code generating tools produced elsewhere. The Code Generator is successful. The tool will generate the source code units for a complete Macintosh application. These can be compiled and linked with a binary resource file to produce a working prototype for an application...|$|E
