25|$|The blade is {{connected}} to a long cylindrical cane handle, {{similar to that of}} a mid-20th-century tennis racquet, by means of a splice. The handle is usually covered with a <b>rubber</b> <b>grip.</b> Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade. The current design of a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a tapered splice was the invention in the 1880s of Charles Richardson, a pupil of Brunel and the first Chief Engineer of the Severn Railway Tunnel. Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break {{at the corner of the}} join. The taper provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat's blade to the handle and avoids this problem.|$|E
500|$|The Human Centipede {{contains}} {{relatively few}} gory images; {{little of the}} surgical procedure is depicted directly, no excrement is shown on screen, and according to Kim Newman in Empire, it is [...] "never quite as outrageous as it threatens to be." [...] Six stated that he wanted the film to be as authentic as possible and claimed to have consulted a Dutch surgeon during the creation and filming process, resulting in the film being [...] "100% medically accurate." [...] Six said that the surgeon initially {{wanted nothing to do}} with his film, as he felt Six was [...] "crazy" [...] and the idea had [...] "nothing to do with medical science." [...] However, the surgeon changed his mind and decided that he in fact liked the idea, and so came up with a method of creating a human centipede. Six has claimed that the central and rear members of the centipede could survive for years by supplementing their diet with an IV drip. The special effects team was led by a father and son team, Rob Hillenbrink and son Erik. They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon. The actors who made up the centipede wore hardened underwear, compared by Yennie to shorts, which had a <b>rubber</b> <b>grip</b> for the actors to wear for the actor behind on which to bite, creating the illusion of the mouth-to-anus connection. Six kept secret how the centipede would be formed as long as possible, and Yennie claimed that even her make-up artist did not know, asking Yennie what kind of [...] "suit" [...] the actors would be wearing.|$|E

50|$|The {{advanced}} {{design of the}} firearm helps in counteracting the recoil felt by the shooter.

50|$|In {{a theater}} fly system, a rope lock is a device {{used to prevent}} a rope, and the line set it controls, from moving. A rope lock is {{controlled}} by a steel handle that engages the lock when vertical and releases it when horizontal. The handle is typically red powder coated or covered by a red <b>rubber</b> <b>grip.</b> A steel, oval-shaped safety ring encircles both the rope and the handle {{to ensure that the}} lock cannot be accidentally released. Rope locks are mounted to a locking rail, which provides structural support and holds them at a convenient level for the stage crew.|$|E

It has a VMU slot, but a rumble pack is unnecessary as it has a built-in vibration function that can be switched off with the 2-position slider button on the right side of the barrel.|$|E
50|$|Ziba's {{designers}} {{determined that}} the traditional T-shape of a squeegee was not the most efficient for a wiping motion in a confined area such as a shower stall. After researching the way window washers and filling-station attendants would put their hands close to the blade and rarely use the handle, Ziba designed a plastic squeegee without a traditional handle; instead, it had a tubular <b>rubber</b> <b>grip</b> running parallel to curved twin blades, which moves across glass or mirrors with a wiping motion to reduce strain to the hand and wrist. The dual blades leave a surface cleaner than a single blade squeegee.|$|E
