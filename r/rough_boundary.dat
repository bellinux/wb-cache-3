5|$|Baltimore {{was home}} to a major doo wop scene {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are {{considered}} one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore {{was home to}} numerous African American vocal groups, and talent scouts scoured the city for the next big stars. Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, Chinese and European {{residents}} {{used to live}} {{separately in}} different neighbourhoods. The street once acts as a <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> between the two groups. The Chinese used to mainly live west {{of the street and}} westerners to the east. An Air-Raid Precaution Tunnel was built beneath the street in 1940-41 but was abandoned after the Second World War and was filled back in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|To many {{residents}} of Atlanta, the Perimeter defines a useful boundary to separate metro Atlanta's core from its surrounding suburbs. People distinguish a location as being {{inside or outside}} the Perimeter, sometimes abbreviated as ITP and OTP, a recent local neologism. This was also the <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> chosen by BellSouth for separating landline telephone exchanges in suburban area code 770 from the existing area code 404 in 1995.|$|E
50|$|The river {{has a low}} {{gradient}} with {{a gentle}} flow along much of its course. It forms a <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> between the Shawnee Hills physiographic region to the northeast and the Pennyroyal physiographic region to the southwest. The Shawnee Hills region is underlain by Pennsylvanian limestone, sandstone, and shale which contain deposits of coal. The Pennyroyal region, which is drained by tributaries of the upper Tradewater, is a dissected upland plateau underlain by Mississippian limestone bedrock.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} an {{electromagnetic}} wave scattered from a random medium layer with <b>rough</b> <b>boundaries</b> is formulated using integral equations which involve {{two kinds of}} Green functions. The first one describes the wave scattered by the random medium and the <b>rough</b> <b>boundaries,</b> and the second one which corresponds to the unperturbed Green functions describes the scattering by an homogeneous layer with the <b>rough</b> <b>boundaries.</b> As these equations are formally similar to classical equations used in scattering theory by an infinite random medium, {{we will be able}} to apply standard procedures to calculate the coherent field. We will use the coherent potential approximation where the correlations between the particles will be taken into account under the quasi-crystalline approximation. Comment: 33 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

50|$|As {{with all}} stylistic eras, no {{definite}} dates {{exist for the}} rise and fall of postmodernism's popularity. 1941, the year in which Irish novelist James Joyce and English novelist Virginia Woolf both died, is sometimes used as a <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> for postmodernism's start.Irish novelist Flann O'Brien completed The Third Policeman in 1939. It was rejected for publication and remained supposedly lost until published posthumously in 1967. A revised version called The Dalkey Archive was published before the original in 1964, two years before O'Brien died. Notwithstanding its dilatory appearance, the literary theorist Keith Hopper regards The Third Policeman as one of the first of that genre they call the postmodern novel.|$|E
50|$|The Upper Penitencia Creek {{watershed}} drains {{an area of}} 24 sq mi {{and runs}} approximately 11 mi from to its confluence with Coyote Creek, the latter being about 10 mi from San Francisco Bay.The source of Upper Penitencia Creek is on Poverty Ridge in the Diablo Range. It plunges into Cherry Flat Reservoir and then flows through Alum Rock Park, where it is joined by Arroyo Aguague. Arroyo Aguague discharges to Penitencia Creek from the south, but summer inflow is very low; however, the stream flows in the Calaveras Fault zone and does not go completely dry, even in severe droughts. Lower down it forms the <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> between the Berryessa and Alum Rock districts of San Jose.|$|E

50|$|In {{the central}} Great Plains, the {{meridian}} roughly marks the western {{boundary of the}} normal reach of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and the approximate boundary (although some areas do push the boundary slightly farther east) between the semi-arid climate {{to the west and}} the humid continental (north of about 37°N) and humid subtropical (south of about 37°N) climates to the east. The type of agriculture west of the meridian typically relies heavily on irrigation. Historically the meridian has often been taken as a <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> between the eastern and western United States. White settlement, spreading westward after the American Civil War, settled the area around this meridian during the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|The {{cradle of}} the {{architectural}} style {{known as the}} First Bay Region Tradition, Daley's Scenic Park lost hundreds of buildings in the September 17, 1923, Berkeley Fire. The fire survivors are concentrated in a triangle along the southeastern slopes of the tract, where one can find houses designed by Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Ernest Coxhead, and A.C. Schweinfurth — influential architects of this movement. The that houses burned in 1923, most of them clad in brown shingles, were typically replaced with stucco apartment buildings {{in the southern part}} of the fire area while many single-family homes were rebuilt in the northern parts. Hilgard Avenue is the <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> between these two regions on the eastern side of Euclid Avenue while the single-family home zone extends further south on the western side of Euclid Avenue.|$|E
5000|$|The native {{plant life}} of Central Oregon {{can be divided}} between the Ponderosa forests {{at the foot of}} the Cascades, and the smaller Western Juniper forests to the east, with the Deschutes River being a <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> between the two. Because of the lack of precipitation, high temperatures, and {{lightning}} storms during the late summer, wildfires are a common occurrence. Small fires are essential, as they burn away detritus. With the arrival of European settlers, fire suppression became common. However, due to decades of fire suppression, several major wildfires have broken out and threatened large settlements. Major wildfires are becoming less common as the practice of controlled burns by local officials are more frequent. [...] The Oregon Badlands Wilderness preserves the indigenous character, flora, and fauna of the desert basin and is located about 20 mi east of Bend.|$|E

50|$|The {{population}} {{is estimated to}} be near 80 000 (2011) with around 30 000 in the urban centre (previous figures near 57 000 in 2008 and near 7300 in 1966). The {{population is}} spread over 11 town districts, 17 villages lying 5 to 30 km from the centre and 5 Fula tribes. The ethnic groups are by order of numerical importance, the Hausa, the Fula, the Tuareg and the Djerma. Dogondoutchi is the common western border of the Hausa population, who form a majority of the population in an arc stretching from this area towards the east (Zinder). The Djerma who form the majority of the sedentary population of Niger are mostly settled towards the west whereas Dongondoutchi is the southern limit for the Fula who are pastoralists with semi-nomadic villages. Dogondoutchi marks the <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> between the Wodaabe (Central-Eastern Niger) Fula people and the Dallol and Bitinkoore Fulfulde dialect speaking Fula people of the west. Some of the older members of the Fula are settled. The Hausa and the Djerma are settled farmers mostly cultivating pearl millet and cowpea (small bean). The Tuareg initially from the north are also settled but continue to raise cattle in the traditional manner. Some also grow crops or are involved in commerce.|$|E
5000|$|Physically, the {{location}} identified today as Machame forms several of 10 wards of the Hai District, in Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania. Historically, {{the formation of}} Hai {{as one of the}} three divisions of the Chagga states by the British rule in 1946 with the recognition of Chief M.H. Abdiel Shangali of Machame as the divisional chief, could have been none other than tracing back the Chagga politics to its old pre-German colonial rule where the then King of Machame extended his influence. The Hai division comprised Chagga states from Siha in the Western-end of Chagga to river Nanga, forming a <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> within Vunjo to the further Eastern Chagga states of Rombo. By 1920's however, due to successive political instability and confusion in the obscure state of Siha, supposedly instigated by the Machame political aristocrats, Chief Abdiel Shangali of Machame re-claimed Siha by implying that [...] "the efforts to make it independent from Machame have failed". Since the 1880s to 1946, Machame had lost 'for good' its influence over all the Chagga states from Weruweru river Eastwards. It was therefore the formation of the Hai division in 1946 that brought back the influence of the Chief of Machame to the Eastern Chagga states beyond Weruweru river. However, the redefinition of Chagga politics revived by the formation of divisions by the British rule would soon escalate to set the Chagga politics into the edge, the saga of which is discussed later in this article.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} perturbative {{approach}} that {{allows one to}} study the surface scattering in quasi- 1 D waveguides with <b>rough</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Our approach {{is based on the}} construction of an effective ``bulk'' potential of a very complicated structure. The detailed analysis of this potential reveals that apart from the well known terms considered in the previous studies, one should keep specific terms that depend on the square of the derivative of the boundaries. As was found, in spite of an apparent smallness of these square-gradient scattering (SGS) terms, there is a physically important region of parameters, in which they can not be neglected. Our approach also demonstrates that the contribution of the SGS-mechanism of scattering strongly depends on the type of the <b>rough</b> <b>boundaries</b> (uncorrelated, symmetric or antisymmetric) Comment: 18 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

5000|$|As of 918, Later Liang {{was ruled}} by Zhu Quanzhong's son and {{successor}} Zhu Youzhen, and was steadily losing territory to Jin. It was {{also said that}} Zhu Youzhen's close associates often demanded bribes from regional governors, including Zhang Wanjin. In fall 918, when Zhang heard (incorrectly) {{that there was going}} to be a major Jin invasion into Later Liang territory south of the Yellow River (which, then, served as the <b>rough</b> <b>boundary</b> of the two states), he sent messengers to Jin, offering to submit to its prince Li Cunxu, and seeking aid. When this became known to Zhu Youzhen, he sent the general Liu Xun against Zhang. Liu Xun quickly put Taining's capital Yan Prefecture (兗州) under siege. [...] By winter 919, the city was in desperate situation, but as the Jin and Later Liang forces were battling intensely on the Yellow River border, Jin was unable to send a relief force deep into Later Liang territory to save Zhang. Zhang sent Liu Churang to Li Cunxu's camp to beg relief. Li initially did not agree. Liu Churang went to the threshold of Li's tent and cut off one of his own ears, wailing, [...] "If my request is not listened to, to live is worse than to die!" [...] Li was impressed and was set to, despite the dangers, launch an army to try to save Zhang, but news arrived at that time that Liu Xun had already captured Yan and slaughtered Zhang's household, so the Jin army was never launched. Still, impressed with Liu Churang, Li made him a general in the Jin army. [...] Shortly after, he was made the deputy protocol officer.|$|E
