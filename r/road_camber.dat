50|$|As {{the race}} is over public roads, the cars have {{to adhere to the}} normal traffic regulations; however, there is a special note in the {{official}} regulations remarking on the tendency of drivers {{to take advantage of a}} favourable <b>road</b> <b>camber</b> in order to capture the maximum amount of solar energy. After midday when the sun is in the west, it would be advantageous to drive on the right side of the highway, provided, of course, there is no traffic in opposite direction.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of <b>road</b> <b>camber</b> on the stability of single-track road vehicles. <b>Road</b> <b>camber</b> changes the magnitude {{and direction of the}} tire force and moment vectors relative to the wheels, as well as the combined-force limit one might obtain from the road tires. Camber-induced changes in the tire force and moment systems have knock-on consequences for the vehicle’s stability. The study makes use of computer simulations that exploit a high-fidelity motorcycle model whose parameter set is based on a Suzuki GSX-R 1000 sports machine. In order to study camber-induced stability trends for a range of machine speeds and roll angles, we study the machine dynamics as the vehicle travels over the surface of a right circular cone. Conical road surfaces allow the machine to operate at a constant steady-state speed, a constant roll angle, and a constant <b>road</b> <b>camber</b> angle. The local road-tire contact behavior is analyzed by approximating the cone surface by moving tangent planes located under the road wheels. There is novelty {{in the way in which}} adaptive controllers are used to center the vehicle’s trajectory on a cone, which has its apex at the origin of the inertial reference frame. The results show that at low speed both the weave- and wobble-mode stabilities are at a maximum when the machine is perpendicular to the road surface. This trend is reversed at high speed, since the weave- and wobble-mode dampings are minimized by running conditions in which the wheels are orthogonal to the road. As a result, positive camber, which is often introduced by road builders to aid drainage and enhance the friction limit of four-wheeled vehicle tires, might be detrimental to the stability of two-wheeled machines...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the tracking {{performance of a}} path-following steering system when operating off-highway. Simulation studies were conducted on three types of vehicle models: tractor-semitrailer, B-double and A-triple. The vehicles were simulated for a straight-line and a 450 roundabout with various <b>road</b> <b>camber,</b> grade and adhesions. Results indicated that the path-following steering system was unable to provide good tracking performance under those conditions due to longitudinal and lateral wheel slip interfering with its estimation of trailer location and orientation...|$|E

50|$|Of course {{things should}} be the same, left and right, for <b>road</b> cars. <b>Camber</b> affects {{steering}} because a tire generates a force towards the side that the top is leaning towards. This is called camber thrust. Additional front negative camber is used to improve the cornering ability of cars with insufficient camber gain.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTTire rolling {{resistance}} {{has a major}} impact on vehicle fuel consumption. Rolling resistance is the loss of energy due to the interaction between the tire and the pavement surface. This interaction is a complicated combination of stresses and strains which depend on both tire and pavement related factors. These include vehicle speed, vehicle weight, tire material and type, <b>road</b> <b>camber,</b> tire inflation pressure, pavement surfacing texture etc. In this paper the relationship between pavement surface texture depth and tire/surfacing contact stress and area is investigated. Texture depth and tire/surfacing contact stress were measured for a range of tire inflation pressures on five different pavement surfaces. In the analysis the relationship between texture and the generated contact stresses as well as the contact stress between the surfacing and base layer are presented and discussed, and the anticipated effect of these relationships on the {{rolling resistance}} of vehicles on the surfacings, and subsequent vehicle fuel economy discussed...|$|E
50|$|Trésaguet had {{recommended}} a roadway consisting of three layers of stones laid on a crowned subgrade with side ditches for drainage. The first two layers consisted of angular hand-broken aggregate, maximum size 3 in, {{to a depth}} of about 8 in. The third layer was about 2 in thick with a maximum aggregate size of 1 in. This top level surface permitted a smoother shape and protected the larger stones in the road structure from iron wheels and horse hooves. To keep the running surface level with the countryside, this road was put in a trench, which created drainage problems. These problems were addressed by changes that included digging deep side ditches, making the surface as solid as possible, and constructing the road with a difference in elevation (height) between the two edges, that difference being referred to interchangeably as the <b>road's</b> <b>camber</b> or cross slope.|$|R
25|$|The road {{began as}} a leveled dirt road upon which small stones and mortar were laid. Gravel was laid upon this, which was finally topped with tight fitting, {{interlocking}} stones to provide a flat surface. The historian Procopius said that the stones fit together so securely and closely that they appeared to have grown together rather than to have been fitted together. The <b>road</b> was <b>cambered</b> in the middle (for water runoff) and had ditches {{on either side of}} the road which were protected by retaining walls.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} engineered roads {{dates back to}} the 1st century BC. A metalled and <b>cambered</b> <b>road,</b> 1.5 metres high and six metres wide, was unearthed at Bayston Hill quarry, near Shrewsbury. A timber road was preserved in peat in Geldeston, Norfolk, with tree rings suggesting a date of 75 BC, probably built by the Iceni tribe.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of residential {{properties in the}} area are late Victorian and Edwardian back-to-back brick terraces or face onto wide streets with communal access alleyways at the rear. A small area of 1980s council housing lies between Hyde Park Road and Woodsley Road, these replaced terrace housing demolished due to slum clearance. Main <b>roads</b> are <b>cambered</b> and some still retain original Yorkstone pavements and iron guttering. However, Leeds City Council have been removing much of the stone paving and granite kerbs to be replaced by modern tarmac and concrete. A large number of houses in Hyde Park are owned by private landlords who rent to students.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} results of {{benchmark}} testing a new inertial formulation of the de St. Venant equations, implemented within the LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model, using different high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data (10 cm, 50 cm and 1 m) and roughness conditions (distributed and composite) in an urban area. To examine these effects, the model is applied to a hypothetical flooding scenario in Alcester, UK, which experienced surface water flooding during summer 2007. The sensitivities of simulated water depth, extent, arrival time and velocity to grid resolutions and different roughness conditions are analysed. The results indicate that increasing the terrain resolution from 1 m to 10 cm significantly affects modelled water depth, extent, arrival time and velocity. This is because hydraulically relevant small scale topography that is accurately captured by the terrestrial LIDAR system, such as <b>road</b> <b>cambers</b> and street kerbs, is better represented on the higher resolution DEM. It is shown that altering surface friction values within a wide range has only a limited effect and {{is not sufficient to}} recover {{the results of}} the 10 cm simulation at 1 m resolution. Alternating between a uniform composite surface friction value (n = 0. 013) or a variable distributed value based on land use has a greater effect on flow velocities and arrival times than on water depths and inundation extent. We conclude that the use of extra detail inherent in terrestrial laser scanning data compared to airborne sensors will be advantageous for urban flood modelling related to surface water, risk analysis and planning for Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) to attenuate flow. <br/...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>roads</b> are <b>cambered</b> (crowned), that is, made so {{that they}} have rounded surfaces, to reduce {{standing}} water and ice, primarily to prevent frost damage but also increasing traction in poor weather. Some sections of road are now surfaced with porous bitumen to enhance drainage; this is particularly done on bends. These {{are just a few}} elements of highway engineering. As well as that, there are often grooves cut into the surface of cement highways to channel water away, and rumble strips at the edges of highways to rouse inattentive drivers with the loud noise they make when driven over. In some cases, there are raised markers between lanes to reinforce the lane boundaries; these are often reflective. In pedestrian areas, speed bumps are often placed to slow cars, preventing them from going too fast near pedestrians.|$|R
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{location of}} the cross beam controls important parameters of the suspension's behaviour, such as the roll steer curve and toe and camber compliance. The closer the cross beam to the axle stubs the more the camber and toe changes under deflection. A key difference between the camber and toe changes of a twist beam vs independent suspension is the change in camber and toe {{is dependent on the}} position of the other wheel, not the car's chassis. In a traditional independent suspension the camber and toe are based on the position of the wheel relative to the body. If both wheels compress together their camber and toe will not change. Thus if both wheels started perpendicular to the road and car compressed together they will stay perpendicular to the <b>road.</b> The <b>camber</b> and toe changes are the result of one wheel being compressed relative to the other.|$|R

5000|$|Mount Camber (...) is a mainly snow-covered mountain, 1,400 m high, 1 nmi km {{northeast}} of Molar Peak in the Osterrieth Range of Anvers Island, in the Palmer Archipelago. It was first {{seen by the}} Belgian Antarctic Expedition, 1897-99, under Gerlache. The name High Peak was probably given to the feature by Lieutenant Commander J.M. Chaplin, Royal Navy, during a sketch survey in 1927 on the RRS Discovery. A resurvey in 1955 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey found this descriptive name to be unsuitable. The new name, given by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee, is descriptive of the summit, which is long and gently sloping like a <b>cambered</b> <b>road</b> surface.|$|R
50|$|In Africa, {{parts of}} Asia, {{and parts of}} America, {{laterite}} soils are used to build dirt roads. However laterite, called murram in East Africa, varies considerably to earth and sand.

50|$|Lowside crashes do {{not usually}} occur through braking in a {{straight}} line in dry conditions. It's more likely that the rider will go over the handlebars through too much front wheel brake force or will lock the rear wheel resulting {{in a straight}} skid.

A rider braking {{in a straight line}} on a <b>cambered</b> <b>road</b> could still experience a lowside crash if either of the wheels lock through braking as the bike will slide sideways with gravity down the camber.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{dynamics}} of the accelerating bicycle. It is shown that time-scale separation can be used to study the oscillatory characteristics of the accelerating machine using time-invariant models. These models are used to explain practically observed wobble-mode bursting oscillations that are associated most frequently with down-hill riding. If the vehicle is cornering under constant acceleration, at a fixed roll angle, it is shown that for low values of acceleration (and braking), it follows closely a logarithmic spiral shaped trajectory. The studies presented are facilitated by a novel adaptive control scheme that centers the machine's trajectory on any arbitrary point in the ground plane. The influences of <b>cambered</b> <b>road</b> surfaces are also investigated. The bicycle model employed is an extension of that originally developed by Whipple, and comprises two road wheels and two laterally-symmetric frame assemblies that are free to rotate relative to each other along an inclined steering axis. For the most part, the front frame is treated as being flexible and the bicycle is fitted with force generating road tires, rather than classical nonholonomic rolling constraints. This research provides the ground work required for generating more complex dynamic models for high-performance motorcycle studies. © 2010 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental {{evaluation of the}} road grip estimator RT 3 Curve manufactured by Halliday Technologies Inc. RT 3 Curve can be pictured as a small trailer that is coupled behind a car. It measures the friction between two surfaces by two measuring wheels mounted with fixed slip angles. The vehicle dynamic term slip angle is the angle between a rolling wheel's actual direction of travel and the direction at which it is pointing. The slip angle causes side forces when the trailer is pulled behind the car. Mounted in the wheel center axis is a load cell mounted that measures {{the changes in the}} side forces that arise due to friction between the tire and the road surface. RT 3 Curve is among other things intended to be used for measurement of winter maintenance processes. RT 3 Curve is capable of measuring road grip at all kinds of road conditions as well as on straight, curved or <b>cambered</b> <b>roads.</b> It has, however, a limitation when it comes to curves where the minimum radius as specified by the manufacturer is 50 m. In this experimental study the relationship between road grip and curve radius has been investigated. The main question was how the road grip changes when turning compared with driving on a straight road. It has been found that the road grip differs from the reference value at a radius of about 20 m. The reference value is determined from runs on a straight section adjacent to the curve/roundabout where the measurement was made. An empirical function is formulated from the experimental data. This relationship allows us to compensate for the deviations in road grip that occurs when cornering. The model is validated only for surfaces with high friction such as asphalt. Road grip is very difficult to measure and it depends on both the tire and the road characteristics. The resulting model has to be developed and more extensive measurements has to be carried out on different surfaces such as dry asphalt, wet asphalt, snow, ice, etc. Validerat; 20150609 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
