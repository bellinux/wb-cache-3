Both of these categories set new records until surpassed in 2016. Athletes from China won the most gold medals, with 48 gold medals. Athletes from the United States won the most total medals, with 111. Afghanistan, Mauritius, Sudan, Tajikistan and Togo won their first Olympic medals. Athletes from Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold) and Panama won their first gold medals.

5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. <b>Retesting</b> the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} a test-retest {{paradigm}} to investigate change/stability in Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised scores of 16 and 17 year olds. Both short (3 month) and long (18 month) <b>retest</b> intervals were investigated with 26 subjects in each group. The {{results of this}} study were quite consistent in showing that WAIS-R <b>retest</b> gains for young 16 year olds were greater over an 18 month <b>retest</b> period than over a 3 month <b>retest</b> period. This general finding was true for males and females on mean Verbal IQ and Full Scale IQ. Mean Performance IQ also showed this differential <b>retest</b> effect but only for males. Verbal IQ gain for the long term <b>retest</b> group seems largely the result of the Vocabulary and Comprehension subtests. Some of the results varied by gender. Although absolute <b>retest</b> gains were different for the long versus short term <b>retest</b> groups, test-retest reliability was high for both groups. Absolute IQ gains for Performance and Full Scale were significantly, but not highly correlated with initial IQ score. Clinical and theoretical implications of these results were discussed.

25|$|The Benton Test {{has been}} criticized by test's {{requirement}} of the examinee's IQ or estimated IQ, which {{can be difficult to}} obtain if the examinee is in a poor condition. In addition, data from studies that look at the viability of <b>retesting</b> a patient have shown conflicting results; some studies show no difference in scores after time has passed between two tests, while other studies show a difference. Despite these reports, the Benton Test has several advantages over other tests of visual memory. These include: a more explicit scoring system than other tests, parallel-forms reliability due to the presence of multiple form sets, and short administration time. Because of this, the BVRT is still widely used today for a large number of clinical conditions.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The Wechsler Memory Scale - Fourth Edition (WMS-IV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used memory batteries. We {{examined}} the test–retest reliability, practice effects, and standardized regression-based (SRB) change norms for the Dutch version of the WMS-IV (WMS-IV-NL) after both short and long <b>retest</b> intervals. Method: The WMS-IV-NL was administered twice after either a short (M = 8. 48 weeks, SD = 3. 40 weeks, range = 3 – 16) or a long (M = 17. 87 months, SD = 3. 48, range = 12 – 24) <b>retest</b> interval in a sample of 234 healthy participants (M = 59. 55 years, range = 16 – 90; 118 completed the Adult Battery; and 116 completed the Older Adult Battery). Results: The test–retest reliability estimates varied across indexes. They were adequate to good after a short <b>retest</b> interval (ranging from. 74 to. 86), with the exception of the Visual Working Memory Index (r =. 59), yet generally lower after a long <b>retest</b> interval (ranging from. 56 to. 77). Practice effects were only observed after a short <b>retest</b> interval (overall group mean gains up to 11 points), whereas no significant change in performance was found after a long <b>retest</b> interval. Furthermore, practice effect-adjusted SRB change norms were calculated for all WMS-IV-NL index scores. Conclusions: Overall, this study shows that the test–retest reliability of the WMS-IV-NL varied across indexes. Practice effects were observed after a short <b>retest</b> interval, but no evidence was found for practice effects after a long <b>retest</b> interval from one to two years.
