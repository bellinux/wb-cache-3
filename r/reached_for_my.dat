Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: You get used {{to the fact that it}} can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|E

60|$|With an {{involuntary}} jerk at the reins I brought my team to its haunches and <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> revolver. Quite needless: with the quickest movement that I {{had ever seen}} in anything but a cat--almost before the words {{were out of the}} horseman's mouth--May had thrown himself backward across the back of the seat, face upward, and the muzzle of his rifle was within a yard of the fellow's breast! What further occurred among the three of us there in the gloom of the forest has, I fancy, never been accurately related.|$|E

60|$|The man responded, {{and behind}} him came two {{more of the}} same feather, and {{suddenly}} I found myself surrounded by an ill-smelling crowd of flashy men and tawdry women. They jostled me, and I <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> sword, to make the discovery that I had forgotten it. Regaining my full senses, I struck the man nearest me a blow that sent him sprawling in the dirt. A blade gleamed under the sickly light of the fish-oil lamp overhead, but a man crashed through from behind and caught the ruffian's sword-arm and flung him back in the kennel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had a dim {{notion of}} escaping, and I crawled {{on hands and}} knees to the winch, where I managed to drag myself to my feet. From there I could look aft and see three heads on top the cabin--the heads of three sailors I had given orders to for months. The niggers saw me standing, and started for me. I <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> revolver, and found they had taken it. I can't say that I was scared. I've been near to death several times, but it never seemed easier than right then. I was half-stunned, and nothing seemed to matter.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was about}} eighteen, or {{possibly}} nineteen; slender and of medium height; open, frank, happy face; a restless but independent eye; a snub nose, {{which had the}} air of drawing back with a decent reserve from the silky new-born mustache below it until it should be introduced; a loosely hung jaw, calculated to work easily in the sockets. He wore a low-crowned, narrow-brimmed straw hat, with a broad blue ribbon around it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front; nobby short-tailed coat, pantaloons, vest, all trim and neat and up with the fashion; red-striped stockings, very low-quarter patent-leather shoes, tied with black ribbon; blue ribbon around his neck, wide-open collar; tiny diamond studs; wrinkleless kids; projecting cuffs, fastened with large oxidized silver sleeve-buttons, bearing the device of a dog's face--English pug. He carried a slim cane, surmounted with an English pug's head with red glass eyes. Under his arm he carried a German grammar--Otto's. His hair was short, straight, and smooth, and presently when {{he turned his head}} a moment, I saw that it was nicely parted behind. He took a cigarette out of a dainty box, stuck it into a meerschaum holder which he carried in a morocco case, and <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> cigar. While he was lighting, I said: ...|$|E

60|$|My first motion {{broke up}} the pretty tableau. Before I could <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> rifle the deer whirled and {{vanished}} like three winks, leaving the heavy evergreen tips nodding and blinking behind them {{in a shower of}} snow.|$|R

5000|$|Anick Jesdanun of The Detroit News gave a {{positive}} review to the episode saying that [...] "The digital medium offered a fresh, clever way of storytelling — with jokes and plot twists not {{possible with the}} documentary-style approach that [...] "Modern Family" [...] typically uses". Jesdanun closed their review by claiming [...] "The graphics were so realistic that I <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> mouse once or twice to try to move a window — before remembering I was watching TV on my computer. I caught a lot more on repeat viewings".|$|E
50|$|I had {{my first}} bad {{experience}} in the problem of delegating authority. Leo Crowley, Foreign Economic Administrator, and Joseph C. Grew, Acting Secretary of State, came into my office after the Cabinet meeting on May 8 and said they had an important order in connection with Lend-Lease which President Roosevelt had approved but not signed. It was an order authorizing the FEA and the State Department to take joint action to cut back the volume of Lend-Lease supplies when Germany surrendered. What they told me made good sense to me; with Germany out of the war, Lend-Lease should be reduced. They asked me to sign it, I <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> pen and, without reading the document, I signed it.|$|E
5000|$|The famous line is {{frequently}} misattributed, sometimes to Hermann Göring and sometimes to Heinrich Himmler. In December 2007, historian David Starkey misattributed it to Joseph Goebbels in comments criticizing Queen Elizabeth II for being [...] "poorly educated and philistine". It {{has also been}} adapted by, for example Stephen Hawking as [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, I <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> pistol" [...] and by filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard in his 1963 film Le Mépris, when a producer says to Fritz Lang: [...] "Whenever I hear the word culture, I bring out my checkbook." [...] Lang evokes the original line when he answers [...] "Some years ago—some horrible years ago—the Nazis used {{to take out a}} pistol instead of a checkbook." [...] Songwriter Roger Miller of Mission of Burma titled a song he wrote in 1981 [...] "That's When I <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Revolver".|$|R
5000|$|Catherine Wheel {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "That's When I <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Revolver" [...] <b>for</b> their 1992 EP 30 Century Man.

5000|$|... "Oochy Woochy" [...] {{is a song}} by Graham Coxon and was {{featured}} on his second solo album, The Golden D. In late 2000 the song was released as a promotional single from that album in the United Kingdom with another album track, [...] "That's When I <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Revolver", serving as the B-side (see 2000 in British music).|$|R
5000|$|Bogarde {{was most}} vocal, {{towards the end}} of his life, on {{voluntary}} euthanasia, of which he became a staunch proponent after witnessing the protracted death of his lifelong partner and manager Anthony Forwood (the former husband of actress Glynis Johns) in 1988. He gave an interview to John Hofsess, London executive director of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society:"My views were formulated as a 24-year-old officer in Normandy ... On one occasion the jeep ahead hit a mine ... Next thing I knew, there was this chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only.

40|$|When I saw my {{face on a}} body no {{more than}} two feet long, pumping its legs and {{crawling}} towards me, I knew the depths of their hatred: nobody cared enough about me to tell me. It had <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> leg. I watched it reach for my knee in an effort to stand. I froze. At that moment Miss Cecilly, the dried up one, rushed into the dark gallery and snatched it up. God is good. I let myself out. Nobody should have me for a father...|$|E

5000|$|He is {{probably}} {{best known as a}} co-founder of Mission of Burma. He played bass guitar and occasional guitar, and wrote and sang some of the group's best-known songs, such as [...] "That's When I <b>Reach</b> <b>For</b> <b>My</b> Revolver" [...] and [...] "Academy Fight Song"—songs that often had an anthemic sing-along quality. Conley's bass work often featured double stops and chords.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} version of [...] "That's When I <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Revolver" [...] had a substantially different lyric. Among which is [...] "Tonight {{the sky is}} empty/But that is nothing new/Its dead eyes look upon us/And they tell me we're nothing but slaves." [...] Moby changed the lyrics, and the change most noticeable is the third line ("Instead they look upon us").|$|R
60|$|Then he {{was upon}} me, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> throat, and {{precisely}} as I {{had done that}} day in the courtyard of the Temple of Issus I did here in the garden of the palace of Salensus Oll. I ducked beneath his outstretched arms, and as he lunged past me I planted a terrific right upon the side of his jaw.|$|R
5000|$|Kruger's first dealer was Gagosian Gallery, {{with which}} she did two shows in Los Angeles in the early 1980s. In 1986, {{she was the first}} woman to join the {{prominent}} contemporary art gallery of Mary Boone and has had nine solo shows there since. Kruger is also represented by Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago; and Sprüth Magers Berlin London and L&M Arts in Los Angeles. In late 2011, her 1985 photo of a ventriloquist's dummy, Untitled (When I Hear the Word Culture I Take Out My Checkbook), which is quoted from Jean-Luc Godard's 1965 film Le Mepris and possibly paraphrased from The Monkey Wrench Gang by Edward Abbey, '"When I hear the word culture," [...] said Dr. Sarvis [...] "I <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> checkbook."' (alluding to the phrase [...] "when I hear the word culture, I <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> gun" [...] in Hanns Johst's play Schlageter, a line often attributed to Nazi minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels), was sold at Christie's for a record $902,500.|$|R
50|$|Hanns Johst (8 July 1890 - 23 November 1978) was a German {{poet and}} playwright, {{directly}} aligned with Nazi philosophy, {{as a member}} of the officially approved writers’ organisations in the Third Reich. The statement “When I hear the word culture, I <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> gun”, variously misattributed to Himmler, Goebbels and Göring, was in fact a corrupted version of a line in his play Schlageter.|$|R
5000|$|Browning was {{the make}} of pistol {{originally}} {{depicted in the}} Nazi propaganda play Schlageter, from which the quote [...] "when I hear the word culture, I <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> gun", often associated with Nazi leaders, originates. The actual line from the play is slightly different: [...] "Wenn ich Kultur höre ... entsichere ich meinen Browning!" [...] "Whenever I hear of culture... I unlock my Browning!" [...] (Act 1, Scene 1).|$|R
50|$|Sister Bliss (born Ayalah Deborah Bentovim; 30 December 1971) is an English keyboardist, record producer, DJ, {{composer}} and songwriter.

In 1996 she teamed up Faithless bandmate Rollo for a successful remix of Moby's song That's When I <b>Reach</b> <b>For</b> <b>My</b> Revolver. Moby was so pleased they were asked to remix another song - Honey.|$|R

5000|$|The {{lyrics are}} {{a mixture of}} gangsta rap topics, science topics and Stephen Hawking {{quotations}} (such as the famous [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, I <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> gun", which became [...] "Every time I think of them my trigger finger itches", referring to creationists).
