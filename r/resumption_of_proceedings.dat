500|$|The innings was {{interrupted}} by bad light and upon the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> poor visibility intervened {{for a second time}} with Compton on 97. After 55 minutes of delay, the umpires called the players back onto the field. Wisden said: [...] "rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day." [...] Fingleton said the conditions were [...] "pitiable" [...] and lamented the [...] "utmost gloom in which batsmen and fieldsmen had intense difficulty in sighting the ball". O'Reilly said it was [...] "without doubt the worst light" [...] under which he had seen a first-class match proceed. Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge by hitting a single to square leg, a [...] "lovely century of stroke-play and patience" [...] according to Fingleton. The innings had taken 227 minutes and included 12 fours, and Compton had regularly hit the ball {{in the middle of his}} bat despite the poor visibility, which meant the batsmen could not see the ball once it was close to the boundary. O'Reilly described the innings as [...] "one of the greatest batting efforts in the story of Anglo-Australian Tests", adding that [...] "his hundred runs was but a poor measure by which to estimate the value of his magnificent innings", deeming Compton's innings equivalent to a double century under normal conditions. Arlott said [...] "In its manner, its style and its context it must rank with any innings he has ever played...his innings will remain a Test classic." ...|$|E

50|$|Carl von Ossietzky (3 October 1889 - 4 May 1938) was a German pacifist and the {{recipient}} of the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in exposing the clandestine German re-armament. He was convicted of high treason and espionage in 1931 after publishing details of Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles by rebuilding an air force, the predecessor of the Luftwaffe, and training pilots in the Soviet Union. In 1990, his daughter, Rosalinde von Ossietzky-Palm, called for a <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> but the verdict was upheld by the Federal Court of Justice in 1992.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the association between}} breast feeding after <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation and the duration from <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menses to the next conception. Data from a survey, “Breast-Feeding and Its Effect on Fertility,” conducted in 1987 {{under the auspices of}} the Centre of Population Studies, Banaras Hindu University, India, were used. We used hazard models of conception rates after the return of menstruation with breast-feeding duration as a time-dependent covariate. The interaction of breast-feeding duration after <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menses and postpartum amenorrhea have a significant effect on the rate of conception after return <b>of</b> menses. After <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation, when there is no breast feeding, the risk of conception increases with the increase in postpartum amenorrhea. However, breast feeding attenuates the effects of postpartum amenorrhea. These results suggest that breast feeding beyond the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation plays a significant role in the proximate determinants to reduce fertility...|$|R
