25|$|The Manx shearwater, {{like many}} other seabirds, visits its {{breeding}} colonies at night to reduce the chances of attack by aerial predators. Two aspects of its optical structure suggest that the eye of this species is adapted to vision at night. In the shearwater's eyes the lens {{does most of the}} bending of light necessary to produce a focused image on the retina. The cornea, the outer covering of the eye, is relative flat and so of low <b>refractive</b> <b>power.</b> In a diurnal bird like the pigeon, the reverse is true; the cornea is highly curved and is the principal refractive component. The ratio of refraction by the lens to that by the cornea is 1.6 for the shearwater and 0.4 for the pigeon; the figure for the shearwater is consistent with that for a range of nocturnal birds and mammals.|$|E

In myopia (nearsightedness), the image appears focused anterior to the retina, producing a sharp image at near and a blurred image at distance. The inverse is true in hypermetropia (farsightedness), where the image is projected posterior to the retina, producing a blurred image at near and a sharper image at distance. Astigmatism (cylindrical error) is the result of two different <b>refractive</b> <b>powers</b> between two perpendicular meridians.

All cases and controls were unrelated. Results: Sequencing VSX 1 revealed {{the presence of}} five nucleotide changes, 3 of which were non-coding (g. 8326 G>A, g. 10945 G>T, and g. 11059 A>C) and 2 were synonymous-coding sequence changes (g. 5053 G>T and g. 8222 A>G).

As I have said, I am {{convinced}} that it opens only in obedience to some principle of light, or the exercise {{of some of its}} forces at present unknown to us. There is here much ground for conjecture and for experiment; for as yet the scientists have not thoroughly differentiated the kinds, and powers, and degrees of light. Without analysing various rays we may, I think, take it for granted that there are different qualities and powers of light; and this great field of scientific investigation is almost virgin soil. We know as yet so little of natural forces, that imagination need set no bounds to its flights in considering the possibilities of the future. Within but a few years we have made such discoveries as two centuries ago would have sent the discoverer's to the flames. The liquefaction of oxygen; the existence of radium, of helium, of polonium, of argon; the different powers of Roentgen and Cathode and Bequerel rays. And as we may finally prove that there are different kinds and qualities of light, so we may find that combustion may have its own powers of differentiation; that there are qualities in some flames non-existent in others. It may be that some of the essential conditions of substance are continuous, even in the destruction of their bases. Last night I was thinking of this, and reasoning that as there are certain qualities in some oils which are not in others, so there may be certain similar or corresponding qualities or powers in the combinations of each. I suppose we have all noticed some time or other that the light of colza oil is not quite {{the same as that of}} paraffin, or that the flames of coal gas and whale oil are different. They find it so in the light-houses! All at once it occurred to me that there might be some special virtue in the oil which had been found in the jars when Queen Tera's tomb was opened. These had not been used to preserve the intestines as usual, so they must have been placed there for some other purpose. I remembered that in Van Huyn's narrative he had commented on the way the jars were sealed. This was lightly, though effectually; they could be opened without force. The jars were themselves preserved in a sarcophagus which, though of immense strength and hermetically sealed, could be opened easily. Accordingly, I went at once to examine the jars. A little--a very little of the oil still remained, but it had grown thick in the two and a half centuries in which the jars had been open. Still, it was not rancid; and on examining it I found it was cedar oil, and that it still exhaled something of its original aroma. This gave me the idea that it was to be used to fill the lamps. Whoever had placed the oil in the jars, and the jars in the sarcophagus, knew that there might be shrinkage in process of time, even in vases of alabaster, and fully allowed for it; for each of the jars would have filled the lamps half a dozen times. With part of the oil remaining I made some experiments, therefore, which may give useful results. You know, Doctor, that cedar oil, which was much used in the preparation and ceremonials of the Egyptian dead, has a certain <b>refractive</b> <b>power</b> which we do not find in other oils. For instance, we use it on the lenses of our microscopes to give additional clearness of vision. Last night I put some in one of the lamps, and placed it near a translucent part of the Magic Coffer. The effect was very great; the glow of light within was fuller and more intense than I could have imagined, where an electric light similarly placed had little, if any, effect. I should have tried others of the seven lamps, but that my supply of oil ran out. This, however, is on the road to rectification. I have sent for more cedar oil, and expect to have before long an ample supply. Whatever may happen from other causes, our experiment shall not, at all events, fail from this. We shall see! We shall see!" ...|$|E

In a variety of vertebrates, multifocal optical systems compensate for longitudinal chromatic aberration by concentric zones of different <b>refractive</b> <b>powers.</b> Since a constricting circular pupil blocks peripheral zones, eyes with multifocal optical systems often have slit pupils that allow light to pass through all zones, irrespective {{of the state of}} pupil constriction. Birds have circular pupils and were therefore assumed to have monofocal optical systems. We examined the eyes of 45 species (12 orders) of bird using videorefractometry, and the results are surprising: 29 species (10 orders) have multifocal systems, and only five species (five orders) have monofocal systems. The results from 11 species (four orders) are inconclusive. We propose that pupils;switching' between being fully opened (multifocal principle) to maximally closed (pinhole principle) can make multifocal optical systems useful for animals with circular pupils. Previous results indicate that mice have both multifocal optical systems and switching pupils. Our results suggest that parrots may use a similar mechanism. By contrast, owl pupils responded weakly to changes in illumination and stayed remarkably wide even in full daylight. Moreover, the parrots opened their pupils at higher light levels than owls, which correlates with the differences in sensitivity between diurnal and nocturnal eyes...|$|R
40|$|Refractive {{errors are}} the most {{frequent}} disorders of the eye. In the ideal refractive state, emmetropia, an image is focused directly on the retina, resulting {{in the perception of}} a sharp image in a healthy visual system. Such eyes do not require glasses or contact lenses to see sharply. Most eyes, however, have some degree of refractive error, although correction is not always required. In myopia (nearsightedness), the image appears focused anterior to the retina, producing a sharp image at near and a blurred image at distance. A concave lens (minus Diopter) is required to sharpen the image. The reverse is true in hypermetropia (also known as hyperopia or farsightedness), where the image is projected posterior to the retina, producing a blurred image at near and a sharper image at distance. A convex lens (plus Diopter) is required to produce a clear image. Astigmatism (cylindrical error) is the result of two different <b>refractive</b> <b>powers</b> between two perpendicular meridians. A cylindrical correction can correct this problem. Extreme cases of all these refractive errors can cause severe visual loss. Anisometropia is the presence of two significantly different refractive errors. In these situations, simple spectacle correction is not always suitable due to aniseikonia (different sized images) resulting from the different powers in the lenses; other options such as contact lenses or surgery can then be considered.
