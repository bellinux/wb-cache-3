40|$|This paper {{examines}} the various {{different types of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems, and distinguishes between <b>electronic</b> machine <b>voting</b> and <b>electronic</b> distance <b>voting.</b> The prospects of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems are unclear; this paper observes some of the risks and the costs {{that are associated with}} <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems. This paper discusses security requirements when using information communications technologies in an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system. This paper uses computer security requirements to develop a voter trust model that helps to identify weaknesses in <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems. This paper observes the security threats that may affect an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system and that can compromise such a system. Diebold’s <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems highlight security concerns of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting.</b> To develop <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system governments must make considerations regarding the system and its characteristics, as these will inevitably affect its future...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is {{research}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> topics applied to conditions of University of Economics, Prague and the Czech Republic. It therefore consists of not only theoretical research but also of applied work. First goal of this paper was to provide information base both about (especially <b>electronic)</b> <b>voting</b> and significant <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> projects realized throughout the world. Consequent second goal was analysis and design of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> solution for chosen elections type at the University of Economics, Prague and proposal of possible process changes in chosen type of elections in the Czech republic should <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> be implemented. In it's first part the paper gathers, summarizes and presents information about (especially <b>electronic)</b> <b>voting</b> and chosen <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> implementations. The second part then describes chosen types of elections at the University of Economics, Prague and in the Czech Republic and analyzes their processes. In former case the analysis is followed by proposition and evaluation of possible <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> implementation variants of chosen elections type and detailed elaboration of the most suitable one. In latter case the paper goes on to describe possible process changes that could arise should <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> be implemented for chosen elections type in the Czech Republic. Author's contribution lies in fulfilling the goals of this thesis and performing the necessary activities leading to them. Following the (<b>electronic)</b> <b>voting</b> research the author has provides the reader with information base needed to quickly orientate tehmselves in the field of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting.</b> The author then leverages this information to research and process-analyze chosen types of elections at the University of Economics, Prague and in the Czech Republic, propose changes in mapped processes needed for eventual <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> implementation, present alternatives of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> implementation of chosen elections type at the University of Economics, Prague and elaborate on the chosen most suitable one...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems, {{classified}} {{mainly as}} homomorphic cryptography based, mix-net based and blind signature based, appear after the eighties when zero knowledge proofs were introduced. The common ground {{for all these}} three systems {{is that none of}} them works without real time cryptologic calculations that should be held on a server. As far as known, the agent-based approach has not been used in a secure <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system. In this study, an agent-based <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> schema, which does not contain real time calculations on the server side, is proposed. Conventional cryptologic methods are used in the proposed schema and some of the requirements of an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system are constructed within the schema. The schema seems quite secure if the used cryptologic methods and agents are secure. In this paper, proposed schema will be explained and compared with already known <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems.

The goal {{of this study was to}} measure the effects of the inclusion of an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system within a small group tutorial. Method A prospective randomised controlled trial was run at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, a teaching hospital in Adelaide, Australia. 102 students in their first clinical year of medical school participated in the study where an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system was introduced as a teaching aid into a standard tutorial. Long-term retention of knowledge and understanding of the topics discussed in the tutorials was measured and student response to the introduction of the <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system was assessed.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Electronic</b> <b>voting</b> {{should offer}} {{at least the}} same {{guarantees}} than tra-ditional paper-based voting systems. In order to achieve this, <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> protocols make use of cryptographic primitives, as in the more traditional case of authentication or key exchange protocols. All these protocols are notoriously difficult to design and flaws may be found years after their first release. Formal models, such as process algebra, Horn clauses, or constraint systems, have been successfully applied to automatically analyze traditional protocols and discover flaws. <b>Electronic</b> <b>voting</b> protocols however significantly increase {{the difficulty of the}} analysis task. Indeed, they involve for example new and sophisticated cryp-tographic primitives, new dedicated security properties, and new execution struc-tures. After an introduction to <b>electronic</b> <b>voting,</b> we describe the current techniques for e-voting protocols analysis and review the key challenges towards a fully automated verification. 1 Context <b>Electronic</b> <b>voting</b> promises a convenient and efficient way for collecting and tallying votes, avoiding human counting errors.

50|$|In 2004, a {{total of}} 28,169 <b>electronic</b> <b>votes</b> were {{recorded}} at four pre-poll voting centres and at eight polling places on polling day. This number of <b>electronic</b> <b>votes</b> represented a 70 per cent increase on the 16,559 <b>electronic</b> <b>votes</b> cast at the 2001 election. The proportion of <b>electronic</b> <b>votes</b> in relation to all votes counted increased from 8.3 per cent in 2001 to 13.4 per cent in 2004. At each electronic polling place the number of voting machines was increased from ten in 2001 to at least fifteen in 2004 to ensure that those that wished to use computers to vote could do so with minimal queues. The ACT Electoral Commission claims that interim results for 20,722 <b>votes</b> using the <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system were available through the Commission's website by ten minutes after the close of polls on polling night. Later in the night, a further 7,447 <b>electronic</b> <b>votes</b> cast were made available. Before 10:00pm, interim preference results from all formal <b>electronic</b> <b>votes</b> cast were available, representing 13.6 per cent of all formal votes. Based on these, and other results, the Commission claims that commentators were able to accurately predict the election outcome. Of the seventeen candidates indicated as elected on election night using the 27,849 formal <b>electronic</b> <b>votes,</b> sixteen were ultimately elected. Only one candidate indicated as elected on election night was not ultimately successful - Labor candidate Andrew Barr was the last candidate indicated as elected in Molonglo on election night.

These are voter identification and authentication techniques, client-side voting software used to cast the vote and secure platform mechanisms to overcome vulnerabilities of the client used by the voter to cast her vote. We describe and analyze different implementations of each of these in the context of remote Internet voting, and assess their performance based on usability, security, costs, and maintenance issues. We identify combinations that cannot be applied {{at the same time and}} make recommendations for the application of particular implementations for specific types of elections...|$|R
