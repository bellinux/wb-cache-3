50|$|<b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> is also soluble {{in lower}} {{molecular}} weight oils. Using an oil {{to dissolve the}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> first can render it more soluble to solvents and soaps that would not dissolve pure <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly.</b> Vegetable oils such as canola and olive oil are commonly used {{to aid in the}} removal of <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> from hair and skin.|$|R
25|$|<b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly,</b> {{petrolatum}} or soft paraffin is a semi-solid {{mixture of}} hydrocarbons originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing properties. The raw material for <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> was discovered in 1859 by Robert Chesebrough, a chemist from New York. In 1870, this product was branded as Vaseline <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Jelly.</b>|$|R

During World War II, a variety of <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> called red veterinary petrolatum, or Red Vet Pet for short, was often included in life raft survival kits. Acting as a sunscreen, it provides protection against ultraviolet rays.|$|R
50|$|<b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> is {{slightly}} soluble in alcohol. To avoid damage to plastics {{as well as}} minimize ventilation issues, isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol {{can be used to}} remove <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> from most surfaces. Isopropyl alcohol is inert to most household surfaces, including almost every plastic, and removes <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> efficiently. While alcohol causes fewer ventilation problems than petroleum solvents, ventilation is still recommended, especially if large surface areas are involved.|$|R
50|$|<b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> {{is put on}} {{the cuts}} and most likely areas of impact to make the skin more elastic and slippery, and hence less likely to tear. Some cutmen cover cuts with {{homemade}} salve containing a mix of <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> and adrenaline chloride, so that adrenaline keeps getting applied to the wound during the bout. Also, perspiration from above the eyes will be prevented from reaching the eyes by applying <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> to the eyebrows.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{specific}} application of <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly,</b> it may be USP, B.P., or Ph. Eur. grade. This pertains to the processing and handling of the <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> so it is suitable for medicinal and personal care applications.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they feel}} similar {{when applied to}} human skin, {{there is a common}} {{misconception}} that <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> and glycerol (glycerine) are physically similar. <b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> is a non-polar hydrophobic (water-repelling) hydrocarbon and insoluble in water. Glycerol is an alcohol that is strongly hydrophilic (water-attracting): by continuously absorbing moisture from the air (humectant), it produces the feeling of wetness on the skin. This feeling of wetness is similar to the feeling of greasiness produced by <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> is {{insoluble}} {{in water}} and can only be dissolved with products that cannot be used into the root canal such as ether, benzene, chloroform, carbon sulfide, benzene and essence of turpentine. This is important because unlike hydrosoluble gel, the etch-and-rinse steps of the adhesive technique for post cementation {{is not able to}} completely remove the <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> remnants of the root canal walls. The use of paper points for the <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> groups seems to be insufficient to remove all the substance from the root canal walls and the use of a substance that dissolves <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> could provide higher values of bond strength, but this substance remains to be tested.|$|R
50|$|There is {{one case}} report {{published}} in 1994 indicating <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> {{should not be}} applied {{to the inside of the}} nose due to the risk of lipid pneumonia, but this was only ever reported in one patient. However, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> is used extensively by otolaryngologists - ear, nose, and throat surgeons - for nasal moisture and epistaxis treatment, and to combat nasal crusting. Large studies have assessed <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> applied to the nose for short durations to have no significant side effects.|$|R
50|$|<b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> {{is used by}} tattoo {{artists to}} {{lubricate}} the area being tattooed.

As well as providing a layer to stop bacteria from entering and infecting the newly opened skin surface.|$|R
50|$|Many salons and stylists {{advocate}} {{the use of}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> to prevent stains. Placing a rim of <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> around the hairline creates a physical barrier to prevent the dye from running down onto {{the skin of the}} forehead and neck, and fills the pits and recesses within the epidermal layer.|$|R

40|$|A <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> product {{containing}} sisal extract (Agave sisalana) used {{to improve}} the skin integrity has been claimed to have antimicrobial properties, however, these claims have not been scientifically proven. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the antimicrobial properties of the Agave sisalana containing <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly.</b> A microbial inhibition test using disc assays and a Delvo test w ere used to determine the antimicrobial properties of sisal extract. The results indicated that sisal has anti-microbial substances. The sisal extract inhibited growth of Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus. Results have also shown that the sisal’s antimicrobial active ingredient is oil soluble. It was concluded that the <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> product contain antimicrobial properties but the sisal concentration in the product may not be sufficient for a com plete growth inhibition of microorganisms...|$|R

25|$|The {{principle}} {{outlined above}} under polarity, that like dissolves like, {{is the usual}} guide to solubility with organic systems. For example, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> will dissolve in gasoline because both <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> and gasoline are non-polar hydrocarbons. It will not, on the other hand, dissolve in ethyl alcohol or water, since the polarity of these solvents is too high. Sugar will not dissolve in gasoline, since sugar is too polar in comparison with gasoline. A mixture of gasoline and sugar can therefore be separated by filtration, or extraction with water.|$|R
50|$|Chesebrough Manufacturing Company was an oil {{business}} which produced <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> or vaseline, which was marketed with {{the brand name}} Luxor. It was founded in 1859. Robert Augustus Chesebrough, a chemist who started the company, was interested in marketing oil products for medicinal needs. He produced the first <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> by <b>refining</b> rod wax {{through the use of}} heat and filtration. He named Vaseline from the German language word for water (Wasser) and the Greek language word for oil (olion). Vaseline was patented in the United States in 1872 and England in 1877.|$|R

5000|$|Chesebrough {{began his}} career as a chemist {{clarifying}} kerosene from the oil of sperm whales. The discovery of petroleum in Titusville, Pennsylvania, rendered his job obsolete, so he traveled to Titusville to research what new materials might be created from the new fuel. This led to his discovery of <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly,</b> which he trade-named as Vaseline. In 1875, he founded the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company that in 1955 became Chesebrough-Ponds, a leading manufacturer of personal-care products.
