5|$|Bernier {{went on to}} win his {{election}} in Beauce with 62% of the vote. Harper won re-election as prime-minister; he did not appoint Bernier to a cabinet position. Bernier would eventually return to the cabinet following the 2011 election, in which the Conservatives won a majority government, as Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism. Bernier continues to sit as an MP, and is currently a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership. Stemming from Couillard's actions during the entire affair, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched investigations on how she obtained the secret documents; on whether Couillard's mother was offered a patronage appointment by a Conservative Party official to the Immigration and <b>Refugee</b> <b>Board</b> of Canada; and on whether there was influence peddling during the land sale between the Kevlar Group and Public Works.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} to admit more refugees was {{ratified by the}} United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and, {{in response to the}} pressure, President Roosevelt subsequently issued an administrative order {{for the establishment of a}} special national authority, the War <b>Refugee</b> <b>Board</b> (WRB) to deal with Jewish and non-Jewish war refugees. An official government emissary sent to Turkey was of considerable assistance in the rescue of Romanian Jewry. The WRB saved about 200,000 Jews. Those rescued through the WRB were probably mostly in Hungary, in part through the Raoul Wallenberg mission which was sponsored by the WRB.|$|E

25|$|Once {{confronted by}} the Holocaust, the Allied Powers reacted slowly. In 1943, Morgenthau's Treasury Department {{approved}} the World Jewish Congress' plan to rescue Jews {{through the use of}} blocked accounts in Switzerland, but the State Department and the British Foreign Office procrastinated further. Morgenthau and his staff persisted in bypassing State and ultimately confronting Roosevelt in January 1944. He obtained the presidential creation of the US War <b>Refugee</b> <b>Board</b> in January 1944. The Board sponsored the Raoul Wallenberg mission to Budapest and allowed an increasing number of Jews to enter the U.S. in 1944 and 1945; as many as 200,000 Jews were saved in this way.|$|E
25|$|As {{of the end}} of 2003 {{there were}} up to 200,000 illegal {{immigrants}} in Canada (most residing in Ontario). Most are refugee claimants whose refugee applications were rejected by the Immigration and <b>Refugee</b> <b>Board</b> of Canada. There are very few illegal immigrants who enter the country without first being examined by the CBSA. The {{reason for this is that}} Canada is physically very difficult to get to, with the exception of crossing the Canada/U.S. border. As the U.S. is itself a prime destination for illegal immigrants, not many illegal immigrants then attempt to cross the border into Canada in the wild. This differs significantly from the illegal immigration patterns in the U.S., which stem from illegal border crossings.|$|E

Zehaf {{is reported to have}} fought in the 2011 Libyan Civil War; the Washington Times reported that Mr. Zehaf had returned to his hometown of Zawiyah in Libya to join the uprising against the Muammar Gaddafi regime. The couple split up before Zehaf-Bibeau's birth, but reconciled a short while after and were married. Zehaf and Bibeau divorced in 1999. After the divorce, Zehaf-Bibeau was removed from a private school with strict discipline and put in a secondary school known for pupils fighting with other students from local schools. Zehaf-Bibeau continued to live in the Montreal area until 2007, when he spent time in Libya before moving to Western Canada to become a miner and labourer.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, some historians have {{attempted}} to re-examine and evaluate the significance of his activities during World War II and {{his role as a}} political opponent of Begin. One allegation is that Kook's adversaries in Israel and America downplayed some of his accomplishments and minimized their own role in curtailing his activities. David Wyman and Rafael Medoff, co-authors of a 2002 Kook biography, suggested that despite the frequent obstruction by the modern American Jewish establishment Kook's rescue group's activism was the major factor in establishment of the War <b>Refugee</b> <b>Board</b> and that it was an instrument rescuing approximately 200,000, partly by means of the [...] Raoul Wallenberg mission.|$|E

[...] The fifty-two-year-old defector has been denied political asylum and ruled ineligible to remain in Canada, because the federal Immigration and <b>Refugee</b> <b>Board</b> found him a [...] "willing accomplice" [...] in prior human rights abuses.

2500|$|After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt helped {{expedite}} Jewish {{immigration from}} Germany and allowed Austrian and German citizens {{already in the}} United States to stay indefinitely. He was prevented from accepting more Jewish immigrants by the restrictive Immigration Act of 1924, the prevalence of nativism and antisemitism among voters and members of Congress, and some resistance in the American Jewish community to the acceptance of Eastern European Jewish immigrants. Hitler chose to implement the [...] "Final Solution"–the extermination of Jewish population–in January 1942, and American officials learned of {{the scale of the}} Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which condemned the ongoing Holocaust and promised to try its perpetrators as war criminals. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the War <b>Refugee</b> <b>Board</b> to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed {{that the best way to}} help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort.
