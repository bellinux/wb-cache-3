[...] "We're really just trying to show {{that that kind of}} thing is inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world {{is becoming more and more}} populated by zombies. Our thinking is that large population centers like Atlanta are <b>really</b> <b>where</b> the heart of this began and as [...] moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because they are moving out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population. And that zombie population is starting to catch up with them. The area is starting to become more and more dense with walkers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, {{after serving}} {{six months in}} jail on {{residential}} burglary charges, YG signed a deal to Def Jam Recordings. While he was still in jail, his music had been getting some buzz off of his Myspace account and when he was released from jail, he began going into meetings from Atlantic Records to Def Jam, where they just chose him to sign with the latter due to brand recognition. The majority of label attention had come from his collaboration with Ty Dolla Sign on his song [...] "Toot It and Boot It", which ended up peaking on the US Billboard Hot 100, after being re-released by Def Jam. After he revealed that his debut album would be named I'm From Bompton. He explained that title saying, [...] "I changed the C to a B because it's where I'm from and it's also bringing something new. It's drawing more attention, you feel me? And it's, like, I'm not doing it to draw attention. I'm doing it to because that's really what I say and that's <b>really</b> <b>where</b> I'm from.

2500|$|Collins {{adapted the}} novel for film herself, in {{collaboration}} with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he [...] "felt {{the only way to}} make the film really successful was to be totally subjective", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, [...] "In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game center and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was tonally important." [...] Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that [...] "I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [...] who knew that [...] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's <b>really</b> <b>where</b> the tension is".|$|E

The same set meet every night at supper: there are seldom any ladies; those who come are chiefly French ladies, members of the corps de ballet. He wins often, but not always. Lord Deuceace is a very fine player. The Chevalier Elliot, the English Minister, sometimes comes, on which occasion the secretaries do not play. Monsieur de Balibari dines at the missions, but en petit comite, not on grand days of reception. Calsabigi, I think, is his confederate at play. He has won lately; but the week before last he pledged his solitaire for four hundred ducats.' ...|$|E
