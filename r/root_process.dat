Since the random walk component can have arbitrarily small variance, tests for unit roots or trend stationarity have arbitrarily low power in finite samples.

40|$|Hydrology is the {{dominant}} forcing function in wetland ecosystems (Gosselink and Turner 1978). Through its direct effect on soil waterlogging, the dynamic hydrologic environment controls soil physicochemical status, sedimentation rates, salinity, nutrient cycling, decomposition, and faunal and microfloral activities. Thus soil waterlogging controls the interaction of soil and <b>root</b> <b>processes</b> which, in turn, influence growth (Figure 34. 1). Although wetland vegetation is highly productive, the roots of these plants often experience severely reduced soil conditions, lack of oxygen, and toxic compounds {{as a result of}} soil waterlogging. This chapter emphasizes the linkage between growth responses and waterlogging-induced changes in <b>root</b> <b>processes</b> of wetland vegetation. While not exhaustive, the examples in Tables 34. 1 - 34. 5 illustrate the major soil-root interactions which influence growth. In addition, we present a case study describing how hydrologically induced changes in soil parameters affect <b>root</b> <b>processes</b> and ultimately growth and productivity of Spartina alterniflora {{the dominant}} intertidal salt marsh angiosperm of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States...|$|R

50|$|Some {{operating}} systems handle a child process whose parent process has terminated {{in a special}} manner. Such an orphan process becomes a child of a special <b>root</b> <b>process,</b> which then waits for the child process to terminate. Likewise, a similar strategy is used {{to deal with a}} zombie process, which is a child process that has terminated but whose exit status is ignored by its parent process. Such a process becomes the child of a special parent process, which retrieves the child's exit status and allows the operating system to complete the termination of the dead process. Dealing with these special cases keeps the system process table in a consistent state.|$|E

Using Monte Carlo analysis, problematic behaviour of cointegration analysis is found in detecting the true underlying form {{of the connection between}} the near unit <b>root</b> <b>processes.</b> Furthermore the connecting vector is imprecisely estimated, resulting in problematic inference for error correction models. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} Miva Script began in 1993 when David Haldy and Joseph Austin {{built the first}} version of HTMLScript. The first version was written in the {{programming}} language Perl, which was called Logic Enhanced HTML (LEHTML). Joseph Austin wrote a wrapper for it in the programming language C that let it start off as a <b>root</b> <b>process</b> and then downgrade itself immediately to the ownership and permissions of the owner of the script file. This wrapper made it suitable for use with his hosting service which was called Volant Turnpike at the time. Joseph Austin eventually sold Volant Turnpike to Dave Haldy. Perl allowed self-executing code, so LEHTML did not have its own expression analyzer and just parsed the expression into Perl syntax and then passed it into Perl. Volant Turnpike users liked using LEHTML, so Joseph Austin and Ron Ahern wrote an expression analyzer and re-implemented the LEHTML syntax in the C language. Joseph Austin called the end result HTMLScript and registered the name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Joseph Austin, Troy McCasland and Derek Finley were the founders of the company called HTMLScript Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|... where [...] is a zero-long-run-mean {{stationary}} random variable; here c is a non-stochastic drift parameter: {{even in the}} absence of the random shocks ut, the mean of y would change by c per period. In this case the non-stationarity can be removed from the data by first differencing, and the differenced variable [...] will have a long-run mean of c and hence no drift. But {{even in the absence}} of the parameter c (that is, even if c=0), this unit <b>root</b> <b>process</b> exhibits drift, and specifically stochastic drift, due to the presence of the {{stationary random}} shocks ut: a once-occurring non-zero value of u is incorporated into the same period's y, which one period later becomes the one-period-lagged value of y and hence affects the new period's y value, which itself in the next period becomes the lagged y and affects the next y value, and so forth forever. So after the initial shock hits y, its value is incorporated forever into the mean of y, so we have stochastic drift. Again this drift can be removed by first differencing y to obtain z which does not drift.|$|E

Another exception is that the old Disk type has been kept as the Removable Disk type, because some Retrospect Windows administrators continue to backup to [...] "superfloppies"—but the Removable Disk type should not be specified for RDX cartridges.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{the sum of the}} {{exponential}} of a unit <b>root</b> <b>process</b> converges in distribution, after rescaling by the exponential of the maximum value of a Beveridge-Nelson approximation to the unit <b>root</b> <b>process.</b> The increments of the unit <b>root</b> <b>process</b> are assumed to be linear processes, and the limit distribution that is derived depends on the structure of the linear process and on its innovation distribution. This analytical result is relevant to empirical work because macroeconomic time series are often assumed to have a unit root in their logarithms, implying that the levels of such series are the exponential of a unit <b>root</b> <b>process.</b> This new piece of econometric methodology is applied to analyzing the limit distribution of the Dickey-Fuller test under the assumption that the data are the exponential of a unit <b>root</b> <b>process,</b> and to the KPSS test. The limit distribution of the KPSS test applied to data that are the exponential of a unit <b>root</b> <b>process</b> turns out to be pivotal, and the KPSS test converges {{at the same rate as}} when the data are stationary. The analytical results on the limit behavior of the KPSS test seem to pose an empirical puzzle, since the KPSS test rejects in many instances for the level series when one might expect a unit root in the logarithm of the series. ...|$|E
40|$|Heartbeat {{protocols}} {{are used}} by distributed programs to ensure that if a process in a program terminates or fails, then the remaining processes in the program terminate. We present a class of heartbeat protocols that tolerate message loss. In these protocols, a <b>root</b> <b>process</b> periodically sends a beat message to every other process then waits to receive a reply beat message from every other process. If the <b>root</b> <b>process</b> does not receive a reply (possibly due to message loss), the <b>root</b> <b>process</b> reduces by half the period for send-ing beat messages. We show that in practical situations, the parameters of these protocols can be chosen to achieve a good compromise between three contradictory objectives: reduce the rate of sending beat messages, reduce the de-tection delay, and still keep the probability of premature termination small. ...|$|E

40|$|The mean-reverting square <b>root</b> <b>process</b> is a {{stochastic}} {{differential equation}} (SDE) that has found considerable {{use as a}} model for volatility, interest rate, and other financial quantities. The equation has no general, explicit solution, although its transition density can be characterized. For valuing path-dependent options under this model, it is typically quicker and simpler to simulate the SDE directly than to compute with the exact transition density. Because the diffusion coefficient does not satisfy a global Lipschitz condition, there is currently a lack of theory to justify such simulations. We begin by showing that a natural Euler-Maruyama discretization provides qualitatively correct approximations to the first and second moments. We then derive explicitly computable bounds on the strong (pathwise) error over finite time intervals. These bounds imply strong convergence in the limit of the timestep tending to zero. The strong convergence result can be used to justify the method within Monte Carlo simulations that compute the expected payoff of financial products. We spell this out for a bond with interest rate given by the mean-reverting square <b>root</b> <b>process,</b> and for an up-and-out barrier option with asset price governed by the mean-reverting square <b>root</b> <b>process.</b> We also prove convergence for European and up-and-out barrier options under Heston's stochastic volatility model - here the mean-reverting square <b>root</b> <b>process</b> feeds into the asset price dynamics as the squared volatility...|$|E
