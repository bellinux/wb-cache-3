The aim {{of this study was to}} provide solid and healthy area with application of Bio-Oss in the defect. Materials and methods: Based on the clinical diagnosisestablished by previously taken history, clinical examination and radiographic images oral-surgery interventions was made. To realize the aim of this work, augmentative material was implicated in the bone defects made in the patients after removal of follicular cyst, chronic periapical lesion, and parodontopathia. During the first and seventh day of the interventions, the patients have been followed through from aspect of possible development of local and general complications after the oral-surgery intervention. After period of one, three and six mount control x-ray was made. Results: Obtained results confirmed that: volume of the socket and defect of the bone was kept, fast revascularization was achieved, bone formation and slow resorption of the augmentative material was achieved, and period of normal healing without infection was also achieved. Conclusions: The augmentative materials used for treatment of bone defects besides their basic chemical and physical characteristics referring to their solubility in the body fluids, the transformation, modulation and resorption must be completely safe or secure, i. e. not to bring any risk of infection, immunological risk, physiological intolerance or inhibition of the process of <b>restitutio</b> ad <b>integrum.</b> <b>In</b> our study Bio-Oss was confirmed as augmentative material who had this characteristics.

40|$|Introduction. Urea is {{the final}} product of protein {{degradation}} secreted in saliva. It has low molecular weight and neutral molecule that can freely diffuse through bacterial wall, mature plaque and extracellular polysaccharides exerting a buffering effect. In the presence of urease, urea is broken down into one molecule of ammonia and two molecules of weak carbonic acid, causing alkalization of the substrate and pH increase. Hydrolysis of urea begins at pH 4 - 6. In mature plaque with low pH, urea hydrolysis is a compensatory mechanism that opposes pH decrease trying to keep an optimal acidbase balance. This mechanism explains the role of urea in controlling plaque, caries and gingivitis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of urea on the quality and speed of epithelialisation of thermally wounded gingiva in rats. Material and Methods. The study included 36 Wistar albino rats, 3 - 4 months old, divided in three groups (12 in each group). According to the protocol thermal wounding of gingiva was performed in all animals. Wounded gingival epithelial tissue was treated with: 10 % urea solution (experimental group), 3 % hydrogen peroxide and saline (control groups). The extent and quality of epithelialisation was verified histologically after 3, 5, 8, 11 and 14 days. Results. There was a strong cellular infiltration and stromal edema with no significant morphological differences between groups in the samples analyzed after 3 days. The acceleration of epithelialisation in the experimental group observed in samples obtained after 5 days was evidenced by rapid mitotic division of epithelium and initial covering of defects in both directions. In samples obtained after 8 days, in the experimental group, epithelial defect was covered and in some areas cells were differentiated in vertical direction. After 11 days horizontal coverage of defects as well as accelerated cell differentiation in the vertical direction were noted. <b>Restitutio</b> ad <b>integrum</b> <b>in</b> the experimental group and significant delay in wound healing in the control groups was demonstrated in 14 -day samples. Conclusion. Complete epithelialisation of gingiva occurred significantly faster in the group treated with 10 % urea solution, than in the control groups treated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution and saline...|$|R

30|$|The most {{important}} changes {{of that period}} appeared in the space dynamics of the main land use/cover categories and their quality, {{a new type of}} land property and exploitation (Popovici 2008, 2010). The permanent expansion of private property during the transition period was the direct outcome of the decollectivization and privatisation of agriculture, a process that had begun in 1990 (Law 18 / 1991, completed and modified by Law 169 / 1997 and Law 1 / 2000) (Popescu 2001; Bălteanu et al. 2004, 2005). This set of laws stipulated the retrocession of agricultural and forest land to their former owners or their heirs; initially, it was to be 10  ha equivalent arable land/family, Law 247 / 2005 eventually providing for restitution <b>in</b> <b>integrum.</b> <b>In</b> 2013, 93.6  % of the agricultural terrains and 39.6  % of the forest lands were privately owned, while under communism (1945 – 1989) all land-use categories, except for hayfields, were collective property, the state possessing the largest high-grade land uses – vineyards and orchards.

50|$|Where {{a person}} enters into a {{contract}} {{on the strength}} of a misrepresentation made to him, or as a result of duress or undue influence by the other party, the agreement is nevertheless valid because there is no dissensus.

The remedy used to set aside a voidable contract is rescission coupled with restitution (known as <b>restitutio</b> <b>in</b> <b>integrum),</b> and is available as both an action and a defence. Of course, the innocent party may also elect to uphold the contract.|$|E
50|$|Restitutio ad integrum or <b>restitutio</b> <b>in</b> <b>integrum</b> is a Latin term {{which means}} {{restoration}} to original condition. It {{is one of}} the primary guiding principles behind the awarding of damages in common law negligence claims. The general rule, as the principle implies, is that the amount of compensation awarded should put the successful plaintiff in the position he or she would have been had the tortious action not been committed. Thus the plaintiff should clearly be awarded damages for direct expenses such as medical bills and property repairs and the loss of future earnings attributable to the injury (which often involves difficult speculation about the future career and promotion prospects).|$|E

So three degrees of miracle are to be distinguished. The first degree is represented by resurrection from the dead (quoad substantiam). The second concerns the subject (quoad subiectum): the sickness of a person is judged incurable, in its course it can even have destroyed bones or vital organs; in this case not only is complete recovery noticed, but even wholesale reconstitution of the organs (<b>restitutio</b> <b>in</b> <b>integrum).</b> The third degree (quoad modum) involves instantaneous recovery from an illness that treatment could only have achieved after a long period.|$|E
5000|$|In England and Wales an [...] "indemnity" [...] {{monetary}} award may {{form part}} of rescission during an action of <b>restitutio</b> <b>in</b> <b>integrum.</b> The property and funds are exchanged, but indemnity may be granted for costs necessarily incurred to the innocent party pursuant to the contract. The leading case is Whittington v Seale-Hayne, in which a contaminated farm was sold. The contract made the buyers renovate the real estate and, the contamination incurred medical expenses for their manager, who had fallen ill. Once the contract was rescinded, the buyer could be indemnified {{for the cost of}} renovation as this was necessary to the contract, but not the medical expenses as the contract did not require them to hire a manager.

On one hand, legal recognition of Baltic incorporation {{on the part of}} other sovereign nations outside the Soviet bloc was largely withheld based on the fundamental legal principle of ex injuria jus non oritur, since the annexation of the Baltic states was held to be illegal. On the other hand, de facto interruption of statehood due to foreign occupation for a period of fifty years did indeed occur, giving a place to the legal principle of ex factis jus oritur, as well as irrevocable territory and demographic changes that make the Baltic case much more complex than mere <b>restitutio</b> <b>in</b> <b>integrum</b> (a restoration of - in this case - territorial integrity).|$|E
50|$|Colombo {{made several}} {{important}} advances in anatomy, including {{the discovery of}} the pulmonary circuit which paved the way for William Harvey's discovery of circulation years later. In the Galenic tradition, blood passed between the ventricles of the heart through micropores in the heart's septum and venous blood became arterial blood in the left ventricle of the heart where air was supplied by the pulmonary vein. During vivisections of dogs and other animals, Colombo repeatedly found only blood, and no air, in the pulmonary vein. In his model, venous blood travelled from the heart to the lungs where it was mixed with air and then returned to the heart. The permeability of the septum was questioned by Michael Servetus <b>in</b> Christianismi <b>Restitutio</b> <b>in</b> 1553 and by Ibn al-Nafis in the 12th century and both proposed that the blood was pushed from the right ventricle to the left via the lungs, however, both of these accounts were largely forgotten. Colombo was the first to propose the pulmonary circuit in an intellectual climate that could expand on his theory. In addition to the pulmonary circuit, Colombo also discovered that the main action of the heart was contraction, rather than dilation as had previously been thought. Both of these discoveries were later confirmed by William Harvey.|$|R
2500|$|Michael Servetus was {{the first}} European to {{describe}} the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons.

And later he published [...] this description, but in a theological treatise, Christianismi <b>Restitutio,</b> not <b>in</b> a book on medicine.

Together, they published some polemical writings against Trinitarian belief, particularly De falsa et vera unius Dei Patris, Filii et Spiritus Sancti cognitione, which is largely a summarized version of Servetus's Christianismi <b>Restitutio.</b> But <b>in</b> 1578 two circumstances broke the connection.
