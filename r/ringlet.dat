5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} ice age, small populations of arctic-alpine plants have survived in {{favourable}} spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the mountain <b>ringlet,</b> also live on and around Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain <b>ringlet</b> butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|In February–March 2007 New Horizons {{spacecraft}} {{conducted a}} deep {{search for new}} small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5km were found, the cameras of the spacecraft detected seven small clumps of ring particles. They orbit just inside the orbit of Adrastea inside a dense <b>ringlet.</b> The conclusion, that they are clumps and not small moons, is based on their azimuthally extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to 1000–3000km. The clumps are {{divided into two groups}} of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.|$|E

25|$|The Huygens Gap {{is located}} at the inner edge of the Cassini Division. It {{contains}} the dense, eccentric Huygens <b>Ringlet</b> in the middle. This <b>ringlet</b> exhibits irregular azimuthal variations of geometrical width and optical depth, which may be caused by the nearby 2:1 resonance with Mimas and the influence of the eccentric outer edge of the B-ring. There is an additional narrow <b>ringlet</b> just outside the Huygens <b>Ringlet.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Maxwell Gap {{lies within}} {{the outer part}} of the C Ring. It also {{contains}} a dense non-circular <b>ringlet,</b> the Maxwell <b>Ringlet.</b> In many respects this <b>ringlet</b> {{is similar to the}} ε ring of Uranus. There are wave-like structures in the middle of both rings. While the wave in the ε ring is thought to be caused by Uranian moon Cordelia, no moon has been discovered in the Maxwell gap as of July 2008.|$|E

40|$|The {{utility of}} the {{phase-space}} fluid method {{for the study of}} planetary ring dynamics is presently demonstrated through the numerical solution of a model kinetic equation for a flattened Keplerian disk. Attention is given to <b>ringlets</b> composed of single-sized particles, as well as to <b>ringlets</b> composed of two different-sized particles; in the latter case, the <b>ringlets</b> evolve {{in such a way that}} the lighter particles are confined by the heavier ones. The results obtained indicate that some natural process may sharpen the optical depth profile of edges even without an external forcing mechanism, and that intermediate optical depths are dynamically preferred in some cases...|$|R
25|$|The rings have {{numerous}} gaps where {{particle density}} drops sharply: two opened by known moons embedded within them, {{and many others}} at locations of known destabilizing orbital resonances with Saturn's moons. Other gaps remain unexplained. Stabilizing resonances, on the other hand, {{are responsible for the}} longevity of several rings, such as the Titan <b>Ringlet</b> and the G Ring.|$|E
25|$|The D Ring is the {{innermost}} ring, {{and is very}} faint. In 1980, Voyager 1 detected within this ring three ringlets designated D73, D72 and D68, with D68 being the discrete <b>ringlet</b> nearest to Saturn. Some 25 years later, Cassini images showed that D72 had become significantly broader and more diffuse, and had moved planetward by 200km.|$|E

The portrait of the older girl, probably the middle one among the three daughters of Aline and her husband, resembles that of her mother. Since it is still attached to her mummy, it is less clearly visible at present; additionally, it has been attached somewhat {{too far to the}} right of the window-like opening in the wrapping. As with the other children and the man, her name is unknown. She wears valuable but simple jewellery and has a <b>ringlet</b> hairstyle.|$|E
25|$|The Back common, {{although}} not as species-rich as the Site of Special Scientific Interest {{to the south of}} the Cromer Road (AI49) is home to a great many plants and insects. Around the damper fringes spotted orchids can be found and in some years bee orchids are present along with the occasionally appearance of the southern marsh orchid. In the late spring and early summer the common is as mass of buttercups. Along the edges of Beeston Beck and Sheringham Loke, monkey musk grows in abundance and until to a few years ago dittander, a rare plant, was present, although this may have since been lost due to the mowing regime. On the drier areas of the common, trefoils and clovers are present which attract common blue butterflies and the longer grass areas and buttercups are frequented by meadow brown and <b>ringlet</b> butterflies.|$|E
500|$|In back-scattered {{light the}} {{situation}} is different. The outer boundary of the main ring, located at , or slightly beyond the orbit of Adrastea, is very steep. The orbit of the moon {{is marked by a}} gap in the ring so there is a thin <b>ringlet</b> just outside its orbit. There is another <b>ringlet</b> just inside Adrastean orbit followed by a gap of unknown origin located at about [...] The third <b>ringlet</b> is found inward of the central gap, outside the orbit of Metis. The ring’s brightness drops sharply just outward of the Metidian orbit, forming the Metis notch. Inward of the orbit of Metis, the brightness of the ring rises much less than in forward-scattered light. So in the back-scattered geometry the main ring appears to consist of two different parts: a narrow outer part extending from [...] to , which itself includes three narrow ringlets separated by notches, and a fainter inner part from [...] to , which lacks any visible structure like in the forward-scattering geometry. The Metis notch serves as their boundary. The fine structure of the main ring was discovered in data from the Galileo orbiter and is clearly visible in back-scattered images obtained from New Horizons in February–March 2007. The early observations by Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Keck and the Cassini spacecraft failed to detect it, probably due to insufficient spatial resolution. However the fine structure was observed by the Keck telescope using adaptive optics in 2002–2003.|$|E

The strands of cloud sometimes appear in tufts of a distinctive form referred to by the common name of [...] "mares' tails".|$|E
500|$|It {{seems that}} Adrastea {{is the most}} copious source of this ring material, as {{evidenced}} by the densest ring (the Main Ring) being located at and within Adrastea's orbit. More precisely, the orbit of Adrastea lies near the outer edge of Jupiter's Main Ring. [...] The exact extent of visible ring material depends on the phase angle of the images: in forward-scattered light Adrastea is firmly outside the Main Ring, but in back-scattered light (which reveals much bigger particles) there appears to also be a narrow <b>ringlet</b> outside Adrastea's orbit.|$|E
500|$|Neptune {{possesses}} five distinct rings named, {{in order}} of increasing distance from the planet, Galle, Le Verrier, Lassell, Arago and Adams. In addition to these well-defined rings, Neptune may also possess an extremely faint sheet of material stretching inward from the Le Verrier to the Galle ring, and possibly farther in toward the planet. Three of the Neptunian rings are narrow, with widths of about 100km or less; in contrast, the Galle and Lassell rings are broad—their widths are between 2,000 and 5,000km. The Adams ring consists of five bright arcs embedded in a fainter continuous ring. Proceeding counterclockwise, the arcs are: Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The first three names come from [...] "liberty, equality, fraternity", the motto of the French Revolution and Republic. The terminology was suggested by their original discoverers, who had found them during stellar occultations in 1984 and 1985. Four small Neptunian moons have orbits inside the ring system: Naiad and Thalassa orbit in {{the gap between the}} Galle and Le Verrier rings; Despina is just inward of the Le Verrier ring; and Galatea lies slightly inward of the Adams ring, embedded in an unnamed faint, narrow <b>ringlet.</b>|$|E
