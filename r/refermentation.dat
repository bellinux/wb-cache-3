40|$|Bottle {{conditioning}} of beer, i. e. {{the additional}} fermentation of {{beer in the}} bottle, or simply refermentation, consists of the addition of small amounts of sugar and yeast to mature beerbefore bottling. Hereafter, the beer is incubated in heated chambers at ca. 25 &# 176;C and refermented in preferably less than two weeks, ideally resulting in a fully carbon dioxidesaturated beer with an enriched flavour perception and prolonged flavour stability. In fact, the process seems rather simple, although many problems encountered in the industrial situationconfirm the opposite. The main problem resides in incomplete refermentations, in which the resulting beer contains a substandard carbon dioxide content, highly undesired by consumersall over the world. Despite {{the widespread use of}} bottle conditioning, in Belgium as well as the UK or USA, no extensive research on the process has yet been performed. Hence, the lack of in-depthknowledge hinders optimal process control. Therefore, the main objectives of this study consisted of elucidating the impact of both yeast and beer related parameters on therefermentation process, as well as the impact of various yeast propagation strategies in view of an improved <b>refermentation</b> performance of yeast. Firstly, a screening of industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains was performed during <b>refermentation</b> of a high alcohol beer, to distinguish between poor and superiorrefermenting strains. The ethanol tolerance of yeast was demonstrated to largely correlate with yeast <b>refermentation</b> performance. Furthermore, constant oxygen availability duringyeast cultivation was shown to result in reduced viability loss of the yeast culture in the bottle, although <b>refermentation</b> performance was the highest in case of oxygen-poor propagatedyeast. In a second experiment, the refermentability of several Belgian beers was evaluated, with special attention paid to the initial beer alcohol content and beer nutrient levels. Especially when dealing with a less ethanol tolerant yeast strain, high alcohol content of beer was demonstrated to severely hinder <b>refermentation</b> performance of yeast. Nevertheless, wheninitial alcohol levels of all tested beers were increased to 10 v/v%, a discrepancy regarding <b>refermentation</b> performance still existed between beers originally low, or high in alcoholcontent. Hence, ethanol is not the sole determining factor regarding the refermentability of a particular beer type. Furthermore, it was established that cell multiplication is no prerequisitefor a complete <b>refermentation</b> process, but could be beneficial due to an overall increased activity, as was observed when applying increased pitching rates. Since the employed beer type and yeast strain are usually fixed parameters in the industrial situation, the feasibility of altering yeasts <b>refermentation</b> characteristics through a variety ofpropagation strategies was evaluated in further experiments. It was demonstrated that the preconditioning of yeast toethanol (2. 5; 5 or 7. 5 w/v%) during propagation, prior to beerinoculation, greatly enhanced yeast <b>refermentation</b> performance. The adaptation process conferred increased ethanol tolerance to yeast cells, which was expressed through increasedaccumulation of trehalose, unsaturated fatty acids and ergosterol, likely positively contributing to the performance and viability of yeast in the bottled beer. To differentiatebetween exogenously added and endogenously produced alcohol, the switch was made from low density (LD; 5 w/v% glucose) to high density (HD; 15 w/v% glucose) growth media. Compared to non-adapted LD propagated yeast, propagation of yeast in HD media positively contributed to the <b>refermentation</b> performance of yeast. The increased ethanol toxicity, as wellas the increased osmotic stress encountered by yeast in HD media confer an increased general stress resistance to yeast, facilitating the <b>refermentation</b> process. Nevertheless, the beneficialeffect of adaptation to 5 or 7. 5 w/v% ethanol could not be exceeded through the use of HD media. When switching from synthetic YPD to brewery wort medium, no improvementregarding <b>refermentation</b> performance of propagated yeast was observed, presumably due to decreased yeast activity during wort, compared to YPD propagation. The replacement ofglucose by maltose in the LD synthetic medium resulted in an improved <b>refermentation</b> performance of yeast, presumably due to the increased stress resistance of yeast cultivated inglucose-free medium. Altogether, the selection of an appropriate propagation strategy is a highly promising technique to improve the <b>refermentation</b> performance of a particular yeast strain, avoiding theneed to introduce an unfamiliar strain in the brewery with enhanced <b>refermentation</b> characteristics. More specifically, the pre-conditioning of yeast to ethanol prior to beerinoculation results, in less than ten days, in the complete <b>refermentation</b> of a very high alcohol beer, difficult to referment in the industrial brewery situation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Bottle <b>refermentation</b> which imparts beer {{effervescence}} {{and resistance}} against infection and oxidation {{is also known}} to improve flavor profile and stability.

The thiols profile of refermented beer has been little studied.

40|$|Herein, we {{evaluate}} {{the applicability of}} previously characterized commercial and indigenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and non-S. cerevisiae species for the deacidification of white and red wines at a pilot scale. The effect of the <b>refermentation</b> process (mixture of acidic wine with musts from freshly crushed grapes or with residual marc) as well as MO (MO) on acetic acid removal efficiency and wine aromatic composition was also assessed in a red wine. The commercial strains S 26 and S 29 efficiently reduced both acetic acid (43 and 47 %, respectively) and sugar (100 %) after 264 hours of <b>refermentation</b> of an acidic white wine that was supplemented with grape must. Similar results (60 - 66 % of acetic acid removal) were observed for red wine deacidification using grape must, independently of MO. When residual marc was used for deacidification, strain S 26 removed 40 % of acetic acid, whereas strain S 29 did not initiate <b>refermentation</b> with or without MO. Wines obtained by <b>refermentation</b> with the must had significantly lower acetic acid and a higher total SO 2 concentration {{in comparison to the}} wines deacidified by the grape marcs.

40|$|Although beer <b>refermentation</b> {{in bottles}} is {{essentially}} a simple process, mixing mature beer with yeast and sugar before bottling, <b>refermentation</b> {{is often difficult to}} control in industrial practice. This can result in variable batch-to-batch quality, especially in small-scale breweries. In this study, industrial top-fermented beers were mixed with freshly propagated yeast and fermentable extract. The extract consisted of glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, or one of several commercially available sugar syrups. Glucose, fructose, and sucrose were fermented at comparable rates, reaching final attenuation within two weeks. Maltose was only partially fermented or not fermented at all, depending mainly on the yeast strain used. Several factors that may affect sugar uptake were examined. Carbon dioxide pressure in the bottled beer accounted for most of the loss in the capacity of the yeast to ferment maltose, while it had only a minor influence on the uptake of glucose and fructose. This difference is probably due to the different mechanisms by which these sugars are transported into the cell. Although maltose is the main sugar in brewing wort, its use is not appropriate for bottle <b>refermentation.</b> The use of sugar syrups with high maltose content may lead to irreproducible or stuck fermentations.

Both <b>refermentation</b> processes were carried out at a pilot scale (30 l), with an acidic wine with 2. 80 gl− 1 acetic acid and applying micro-oxygenation (20 mg. l- 1. h- 1 of O 2). Our data show that oxygen availability is not a key parameter for glucose and acetic acid consumption, but increased the final biomass for both commercial yeast strains tested. Volatile acidity of the final wines decreased to 0. 38 gl- 1 up to 0. 68 gl- 1, depending on the strain used. Combining analytical data (SPME coupled to GC-MS) with the sensorial analysis performed by a trained panel of 5 judges, the wines treated with micro-oxygenation revealed a vegetable character and mouth hardness in comparison to the more floral notes that predominated in wines obtained without micro-oxygenation. Currently, the efficiency of volatile acidity removal by S. cerevisiae S 26 entrapped cells in one layer alginate beads or in double layer alginate – chitosan beads is being evaluated.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND Recently, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase in the number of microbreweries. Usually, craft beers are bottle conditioned; however, few studies have investigated beer <b>refermentation.</b> One of the objectives of this study was to evaluate the impacts of different experimental conditions, specifically yeast strain, priming solution and temperature, on the standard quality attributes, the volatile compounds and the sensory profile of the bottle-conditioned beer. The other aim was to monitor the evolution of volatile compounds and amino acids consumption throughout the <b>refermentation</b> process to check if it is possible to reduce the time necessary for bottle conditioning. RESULTS The results indicate that the volatile profile was mainly influenced by the strain of yeast, and this may have obscured the possible impacts of the other parameters. Our results also confirm that the two yeast strains showed different metabolic activity, particularly with respect to esters production. Moreover, we found the Safbrew S- 33 ® strain when primed with Siromix® and refermented at 30 [*]°C yielded the fastest formation of higher alcohols while maintaining low production of off-flavours. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest a formulation that may reduce the time needed for bottle conditioning without affecting the quality of the final beer which may simultaneously improve efficiency and economic profits. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to isolate and {{characterize}} wine yeasts with ability to reduce volatile acidity of wines, using a <b>refermentation</b> process. This enological practice consists in mixing the acidic wine with freshly crushed grapes or musts in a proportion of no more than 20 - 30 % (v/v) or, alternatively, in the incubation of the acidic wine with the residual marc from a finished wine fermentation. From a set of 135 yeast isolates, four strains revealed ability to use glucose and acetic acid simultaneously. Three of them were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and one as Lachancea thermotolerans by sequencing the D 1 /D 2 domain of the 26 S ribosomal DNA large subunit. Microsatellite analysis shows, that S. cerevisiae strains 30 C and 45 C are genetically very similar. With the purpose to further evaluate whether the ability to degrade acetic acid in the presence of glucose was a characteristic of the isolated strains, nine commercial S. cerevisiae strains were chosen for further analysis. From this group, the strains S 26, S 29 and S 30 display a most similar glucose and acetic acid initial simultaneous consumption pattern and therefore were assessed in simulated <b>refermentation</b> assays. In a medium containing an acidic wine with high glucose/low ethanol initial concentrations, under low oxygen availability, the S. cerevisiae strain S 29 is the most efficient one. Comparatively, in the same medium, L. thermotolerans 44 C is able to decrease significantly acetic acid similarly to the control strain Zygosaccharomyces bailii, but only under aerobic conditions. On the other hand, in a medium containing an acidic wine and low glucose/high ethanol initial concentrations, under aerobic conditions, the S. cerevisiae strain S 26 is the most efficient acid degrading strain. Notably, with the same medium, but under limited-aerobic conditions, all the S. cerevisiae strains studied display acetic acid degradation efficiencies identical to Z. bailii ISA 1307. Moreover, S. cerevisiae strains S 26 and S 29 also reveal capacity to decrease volatile acidity of wines with an elevated content of acetic acid under limited aerobic conditions, and even without the addition of a sugar source.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to isolate and characterize wine yeasts able to reduce volatile acidity of wines. From a set of 135 yeast isolated during a <b>refermentation</b> wine procedure, four strains revealed ability to use glucose and acetic acid simultaneously. The strains were tested regarding their growth patterns in a differential medium containing glucose (0. 2 % w/v) and acetic acid (0. 5 % v/v), at pH 4. 0 or 6. 0. The selected strains displayed growth associated to color change of the pH indicator of the medium indicative of simultaneous glucose and acetic acid consumption. Three of them were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and one as Lachancea thermotolerans by sequencing the D 1 /D 2 domain of the large subunit (26 S) ribosomal DNA. In two culture media containing acidic wines with high glucose/low ethanol or low glucose/high ethanol concentrations, the S. cerevisiae strains showed an initial simultaneous consumption pattern of glucose and acetic acid under both aerobic and limited aerobic conditions, independently of the relative amounts of glucose and ethanol. This results show a high physiological diversity among strains of this species, validating our approach to search for interesting strains among indigenous yeasts. Comparatively, the isolated L. thermotolerans 44 C and Zygosaccharomyces bailii ISA 1307 were able to exhaust acetic acid only when grown under aerobic conditions.

In the present work, phenol-specific extracts of 14 Belgian special beers were investigated by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O/AEDA methodology) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Different profiles were highlighted according to the raw materials used (special malt, organic malt, wheat), yeast strain, or maturation vessel. 4 -Vinylphenol, 4 -vinylguaiacol, and vanillin were found well above their respective thresholds in beers produced with highly Pof+ yeast. On the other hand, a low ethyl/vinyl ratio was found in brands where Brettanomyces strains are used for secondary fermentation, bottle <b>refermentation,</b> or cask maturation. Finally, two original phenols emerged as interesting markers, allowing us to authenticate the use of torrefied/chocolate malts...|$|E
30|$|High {{throughput}} {{screening of}} diverse microbial metabolite extract library was conducted for detecting glucose uptake inducers in rat skeletal muscle cells. The extract library is prepared from diverse microbes isolated from variety of ecological units in India. 880 extracts representing Actinomycetes strains yielded eight actives. These could stimulate glucose uptake in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The extract of an actinomycetes strain PM 0324667 {{of the genera}} Streptomyces showed reproducible glucose uptake activity through several <b>refermentation</b> generations. Using fermented broth of this strain, bioactivity guided fractionation was conducted to isolate the active principle. We isolated the compound NFAT- 133, which was earlier, reported as an immunosuppressive agent. This compound induced significant glucose uptake in rat skeletal muscle in presence of insulin. The activity was possibly mediated through a PPAR-γ independent mechanism. Further, the compound showed {{a significant reduction in}} plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels in diabetic (db/db) mice as compared to vehicle treated animals. In this paper, we report the antidiabetic activity of NFAT- 133 along with isolation of its producer microorganism, identification, fermentation, and structure elucidation.|$|E
40|$|Brewers try {{to offer}} to the {{consumer}} a larger variety of quality beers made after new or old recipes. For the obtaining of various types of beers brewers use diverse adjuvant or modify the fermentation parameters of beer. One of the aromatisation methods consists in adding fruits or fruit aroma in the wort prepared for fermentation. Sometimes, sugars may be added to wort, for the saturation of the beverage after <b>refermentation.</b> In this paper we compare two methods for the obtaining of beer with cherries aroma analyzing the main aroma substances found in this beer (diacetyl, 2, 3 pentanedione, acetaldehyde, etylacetate, propanol, isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, isoamyl acetate). The aroma substances were determinated by head space gas-chromatography. The fermentation methods used were with added sugar and without sugar. We found that etylacetate; isoamyl acetate and isoamyl alcohol contents {{were higher in the}} sample with added sugar. Pentanedione, diacetyl, acetaldehyde, propanol and isobutanol contents were higher in the sample without sugar. For flavour improvement of beers fruits may be added before fermentation...|$|E
40|$|Fruits, {{flowers or}} other plant parts, possess a {{characteristic}} aroma which is {{formed by the}} presence of flavour-active volatile compounds. Besides volatiles in a free form, volatiles also occur in a glycosidic boundform. Conjugation of volatile compounds to sugar substances like β-D-glucose results in water soluble, non-volatile and odourless compounds. Physiologically, this glycoconjugation plays a role in the accumulation, storage and transport of different types of compounds in the plant. Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) and sour cherries (Prunus cerasus L.) contain glycosidically bound flavour compounds as well. Hence, when adding these raw materials during the production of beverages like beer, free volatiles as well as glycosidically bound volatiles are extracted into the medium. Although the bound fraction is not readily perceivable as aroma, it forms a pool of flavour precursors. This work aimed at the exploitation of the flavour potential through enzymatic hydrolysis ofthese glycosidically bound volatiles. The global enzymatic activity responsible for hydrolysis of glycosidically bound volatile compounds is referred to as glycoside hydrolase activity. In fermented beverages, a method for introducing this glycoside hydrolase activity into the medium is the use of an appropriately selected yeast strain. Hence, the aim of this work was to acquire insight in the hydrolase activity of yeast towards glycosidically bound flavour compounds from hops and sour cherry. To that end, enzymatically released flavour compounds from hop and sour cherry glycosides were examined and a characterization of the glycoside hydrolase activity in Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces brewing yeasts was carried out, both on model substrates and onglycosides from hops and cherry. Hop and sour cherry glycoside extracts were obtained by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Enzymatic hydrolysis of the hop glycoside extract released well-known (e. g. linalool) and less typical (e. g. methyl salicylate) hop volatiles. Dihydroedulan I & II and theaspiranes A & B levels increased after enzymatic hydrolysis and were identified {{for the first time in}} hops and in beer. After enzymatic hydrolysis of the sour cherry glycoside extract, important cherry flavour contributors like benzaldehyde, linalool and eugenol were released. The compounds cis- and trans-isoeugenol and αionol were identified for the first time in sour cherry. To examine the glycoside hydrolase activity in yeast, different screening methods were tested on 41 Saccharomyces and 18 Brettanomyces yeasts. The studied Saccharomyces yeasts did not show 1, 4 -β-glucosidase activity, but a strain dependent exo- 1, 3 -β-glucanase activity was found which is responsible for a limited glycoside hydrolysis. Among Brettanomyces species with 1, 4 -β-glucosidase activity, the most pronounced 1, 4 -β-glucosidase activity was found in Brettanomyces custersii LD 72. Fermentations with this strain as pure culture or as co-culture with S. cerevisiae led to the highest release of flavour compounds from hop glycosides. Hence, the glycoside hydrolase activity of Brettanomyces custersii LD 72 was further characterized. The 1, 4 -β-glucosidase activity was found to be mainly cellassociated and localized for the most part in the cell wall and cytosolfractions. The extracellular fraction consisted mainly of an exo- 1, 3 -β-glucanase activity. Besides β-glucosidase and exo- 1, 3 -β-glucanase activities, a β-xylosidase activity was found. The requirement of Brettanomyces species in the production of lambic and gueuze beer is already well-known. <b>Refermentation</b> of sour cherry supplemented beer by Brettanomyces custersii led to higher concentrations, compared to <b>refermentation</b> by S. cerevisiae, of important cherryflavour contributors like benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, eugenol and linalool. From these results, it seems that Brettanomyces species may play a crucial role in the flavour development of fruit lambic beers like Kriek. Finally, the influence of the glycoside hydrolase activity was examinedon hop glycosides extracted during a dry hopping process. Treatment of the dry hopped beers with an enzyme preparation with glycosidase activities led to the highest increase of volatiles like cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, methyl salicylate, α-terpineol and theaspirane B. Among different yeast treatments, Brettanomyces custersii led to the highest hydrolase activity on a synthetic substrate, but release of glycosidically bound hop volatiles was less pronounced. However, theaspirane B was always found in higher concentrations. Additional researchis required to determine the impact of theaspiranes on the overall flavour. At higher dry hopping ratios (15. 0 g/l), an increase in the levels of the aglycones cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and αterpineol was also observed after treatment with B. custersii. Further, an unknown enzyme activity was noticed in Brettanomyces, especially in B. custersii, catalyzing the transformation of β-ionone to yet undetected compounds. In conclusion, this work provides new insights into the glycoside hydrolase activities of Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces brewing yeasts on glycosidically bound flavour compounds from hops and sour cherry. The acquired knowledge can be applied in methods to exploit the flavour potential of raw materials more efficiently, especially during fermentation and <b>refermentation,</b> to obtain beverages with an improved and refined flavour and to create new types of beverages. nrpages: 177 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|All {{over the}} world many types of beer are produced. The most {{abundant}} are lagers, but depending on the country, the so-called specialty beers are highly appreciated. Although flavors are important {{for all types of}} beer, for specialty beers, special and subtle fl avors make the difference. Such flavors are mainly produced by using special brewers yeasts, which use several enzymes to perform the “ biofl avoring ” of beer. Besides yeast ’ s flavor rich metabolites, other natural flavors fi nd their way into beer, by incorporating plant parts into the brewing or the fermentation process. In the fi rst part of this chapter, several yeasts and bacteria are discussed, with special emphasis on their enzymatic potential to introduce new fl avors into beer or to alter known fl avors. A large attention is then given to the possibilities to introduce fl avors into beer, by adding at a particular step in the brewing process, plant parts: flowers, fruits, roots or seeds. In the third part, there is an overview of different beer types, which can be subjected to biofl avoring: lagers, ales, wheat beers and sour beers. One of the very interesting methods to introduce or to change the flavors of beer, is the <b>refermentation</b> of beers, a method particularly used and appreciated in Belgium. This is described in the last part. Finally a diagram is presented, which summarizes the different approaches a brewer can consider for the production of a new beer or for an improvement of an existing brand. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{fermentation}} process is of major importance in beer production. During fermentation, yeast cells use the available nutrients in wort {{for growth and}} maintenance metabolism. In order to grow during the first fermentation phase, yeast cells need to synthesize appropriate levels of essential membrane compounds. Hence, one major role of dissolved oxygen is to promote the biosynthesis of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids in brewery fermentations. Traditionally, oxygen is provided through wort oxygenation but this technique has several disadvantages. In order to avoid those, yeast cells can be directly exposed to oxygen before fermentation in a controlled process known as preoxygenation, thereby removing the requirement for subsequent wort oxygenation. However, industrial applications of this technique are scarce, due to the inconsistent and limited scientific studies {{and the lack of}} knowledge regarding the biochemical background of the preoxygenation of yeast cells. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to examine the influence of preoxygenation on beer production parameters and to gain better insight in the yeast’s metabolism during both processes. First of all, the preoxygenation ability of different ale and lager yeast strains was studied. Despite the different response of the yeast strains tested, successful results have been achieved. Large variations in sterol and UFA synthesis during preoxygenation were observed. Though, the fermentation performance of preoxygenated yeast cells in de-aerated wort was a good indication for the success of the treatment. In a next series of experiments, the possibility to use yeast preoxygenation {{as an alternative to the}} conventional wort aeration process in normal brewing practice has been studied on pilote scale. This demonstrated that the use of the preoxygenation technique enables us to produce beers with similar characteristics as the traditionally brewed beers. Yeast fermentation performance, yeast growth and aroma compound formation were comparable. Profiles of sterols and unsaturated fatty acid levels during preoxygenation and subsequent fermentation or during the traditional fermentation also seemed to be very similar. Moreover, cropping of the yeast cells and reuse of them after preoxygenation has proven to be possible without loss of quality. It could also be concluded that preoxygenation can be used successfully for <b>refermentation</b> processes. Though, since preoxygenated yeast cells seem to be more sensitive to the storage conditions than untreated yeast cells, it is recommended to use fresh yeast cells, as stored cells are generally of inferior physiological condition. In general, it is suggested to minimize the yeast storage time at temperatures as low as possible. We also performed a comparative genome-wide expression analysis on yeast samples harvested during the exponential phase of the fermentation in order to compare yeast behavior during fermentation after preoxygenation or wort aeration. No major differences in gene expression halfway fermentation were obtained, proving once again that preoxygenation and wort aeration lead to similar results. However, aeration of both yeast and wort resulted in a slightly shorter exponential phase, bringing the yeast faster into stationary phase. This resulted in biosynthetically more active yeast cells, with an enhanced yeast growth and an overall increased fermentation performance (14 %). Microarray analyses demonstrated that the expression of yeast genes involved in amino acid metabolism, reserve carbohydrate metabolism and stress resistance were accordingly affected. Next, a first attempt was made to better characterize the oxygen need of yeast cells. Yeast cells must be capable of responding rapidly at the physiological level to changes in their oxygen environment, for example to protect themselves against potential oxidative stress. Using real-time PCR, genes involved in transcriptional control, respiration, detoxification, stress response and lipid metabolism were examined during preoxygenation. This experiment showed that, during preoxygenation, the yeast cells seem to acquire stress resistance as they accumulate the stress-protectant trehalose and induce the expression of genes involved in detoxification processes and of stress-responsive genes. Finally, the general belief is that wort aeration has a negative impact on wort quality, which could result in more rapid beer staling. Since this study showed that almost identical beers could be produced with the preoxygenation as with the wort-aeration technique, preoxygenation proved to be the ideal tool to investigate the effect of wort aeration on beer flavor stability. GC-MS analyses and sensory analysis did not reveal significant differences in beer staling between the wort aeration and the preoxygenation treatment, for pilsner as well as for ale type beers. Therefore it can be stated that the classical wort aeration process does not have a negative impact on beer ageing. It can be concluded that yeast preoxygenation is a worthy alternative to wort aeration. Moreover, our study has provided several new insights into the behavior of yeast cells during the preoxygenation and {{fermentation process}} in normal brewing practice. status: publishe...|$|E
