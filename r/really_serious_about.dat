500|$|Goffman {{explains}} that the way a conversation is keyed is critical to understanding the intent behind many utterances in everyday speech. Key is probably best understood as {{the tone of the}} dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction. Signaling a change in key is one way that framing often takes place, “special brackets will have to be introduced should he want to say something in a relatively serious way: [...] "Kidding aside," [...] "Now, I'm <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> this," [...] and other such tags become necessary as a means of momentarily down keying the flow of words.” ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title is}} derived from Big Boi's long-time moniker [...] "Sir Lucious Left Foot". In several interviews, he has {{explained}} part {{of it as a}} reference to the Southern slang phrase [...] "gettin’ out on the good foot", while describing the entire moniker as an indication of maturity, noting it as [...] "my real grown-man persona" [...] and [...] "like my Luke-Skywalker-becoming-a-Jedi persona. Like, I'm just <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> my craft, I've mastered it, and I'm very skilled at it, and I take pride in making this music". He incorporated the nickname [...] "Chico Dusty" [...] to the album's title as a dedication to his late father, Tony Kearse, who gained it while serving as a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force and Marines. The spelling of luscious in the album's title, Big Boi's moniker, is intended to reflect on its distinctive pronunciation [...] "loo-shuss", which according to Big Boi, is not [...] "the girl name; you call a girl luscious, along the lines of voluptuous".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the sessions, {{recording}} engineer Jaques Kralian reportedly asked Allin (who co-engineered the recording) and Cosloy if they <b>really</b> were <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> releasing the sessions.

6000|$|I told Polly what Harry had said, as a {{very great}} joke. Polly laughed too, but she {{coloured}} a little, and said, [...] "What ridiculous nonsense, Agnes;" [...] altogether she was not so amused at the idea as I had thought she would be. After this I watched them closely, and at last {{came to the conclusion}} that Harry was right, and that Charley <b>really</b> was <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> it. About Polly I could not tell at all; she was just as teazing as ever with him, and I could not see the least change in her manner.|$|R

But if you go over as Lord Dawlish you won't even get that. Lords are popular socially in America, but are not used to any great extent in the office. If you try to break in under your right name you'll get the glad hand and be asked to stay here and there and play a good deal of golf and dance quite a lot, but you won't get a job. A gentle smile will greet all your pleadings that you be allowed to come in and save the firm.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Toms has {{received}} {{criticism from the}} international development community [...] who have stated that Toms' model is designed to make consumers feel good rather than addressing {{the underlying causes of}} poverty. Criticisms have also included whether or not the shoe donation is as effective as a monetary donation to other charities. Mycoskie responded to these criticisms in November 2013, saying [...] "If you <b>really</b> are <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> poverty alleviation, our critics said, then you need to create jobs. At first I took that personally, but then I realized that they were right... using our model to create jobs is the next level." [...] The company has announced its plans to have one-third of all its shoes produced in countries receiving aid by 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The FFWHC member clinics {{stood out}} from others in the women’s health {{movement}} because they adopted a more hierarchal model when other feminist clinics were operating as collectives. The debate and dispute over the FFWHC’s mode of operation {{reached a point where}} some women’s health centers refused to refer clients to FFWHC clinics for abortions. In 1990, Carol Downer, founder of the Los Angeles FWHC and leader in the women’s health movement, responded to the controversy: “Most of the criticisms I’ve heard revolve around hierarchy… I might say it was the difference between being organized and disorganized… It’s hard for me to understand why anyone who goes into a political arena doesn’t want to be as organized as they can possibly be… if you <b>really</b> are <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> what you are doing. Because otherwise you are the mercy of these larger forces which are organized.” ...|$|R
5000|$|For Stuart Macintyre, Windschuttle's {{book was}} not [...] "so much counter-history as an {{exercise}} in incomprehension". He finds Windschuttle's method of calculating Aboriginal losses flimsy, and the figures he allocates to each incident [...] "no more reliable than those, which he dismissed as guesswork, of mainstream frontier historians". He concludes that the first volume is [...] "a shocking book, shocking in its allegation of fabrication and also in its refusal of the interpretive framework that earlier historians employed, and that its author [...] "fails to register the tragedy of what was a fatal encounter". When challenged on his lack of compassion, Windschuttle is reported as replying: [...] "You can't <b>really</b> be <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> feeling sympathy for someone who died 200 years ago". For Macintyre, [...] "It {{is the absence of}} any sense of this tragedy, the complete lack of compassion for its victims, that is surely the most disturbing quality of Windschuttle's rewriting of Aboriginal history".|$|R

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need {{to bring about a}} {{revolution}} in the overall aims and methods of academic inquiry, its whole character and structure, so that it takes up its proper task of promoting wisdom rather than just acquiring knowledge. We need to put right a philosophical blunder – a philosophical disaster one should perhaps say – that has overtaken academia, and is built into its structure. It is a blunder about what the overall aims and methods of academic inquiry ought to be. The responsibility to make clear what is wrong, and {{what needs to be done}} to put things right, lies above all with philosophers. This indeed, in my view, is the fundamental task for philosophy today: to shout out, loud and clear, that we urgently need to bring about an intellectual and institutional revolution in the aims and methods, the whole structure and character, of academic inquiry, so that it takes up its proper task of helping humanity learn how to create a wiser world. This, if philosophers <b>really</b> were <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> their subject and really did love wisdom, is what they would do. -/-...|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of his role from turntablist to keyboardist on Light Grenades (2006), Chris Kilmore stated that, during the band's hiatus, he [...] "took a lot of piano lessons and {{did a lot of}} learning keyboards. I made a lot of music, but it just sits at home, it’s not for everybody, it’s just for me as a learning process. A lot of practicing, I’d be playing music every single day, keys every single day. I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> and focused <b>about</b> it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes.

40|$|The {{dominance}} of the political drama in the media {{seemed to be the}} evidence of a democratic process in which the political actors are always racing to win popularity or good imaging of themselves either individually or collectively (political party). However, the political drama is increasingly showing an interest gap, where the people actually crave affairs and social developmen. This is the rare serious discussion covered by the mass media, because it is less interesting than the debate of political and legal problems, or that reality is <b>really</b> no <b>serious</b> struggle <b>about</b> the fate of the people 2 ̆ 7 s welfare. Democracy is not for any political and legal issues as well as press freedom, but democracy is to answer how people could be prospered by the government and the representatives (political elites) who carry out the mandate of the people through elections...|$|R

2500|$|Years {{passed and}} Richter became a {{successful}} screenwriter. Mac Rauch took Richter {{up on his}} offer and arrived in L.A. Richter proceeded to introduce the writer to producer/director Irwin Winkler who gave Mac Rauch rent money {{for the next six}} months. Over several dinners, Mac Rauch told Richter and his wife about a character named Buckaroo Bandy about whom he was thinking of writing a screenplay. Richter and his wife liked the idea and paid Mac Rauch $1,500 to develop and write it. According to Mac Rauch, his script was inspired by [...] "all those out-and-out, press-the-accelerator-to-the-floor, non-stop kung fu movies of the early '70s". Richter remembers that Mac Rauch wrote several Banzai stories and that he [...] "would get thirty or forty pages into a script, abandon its storyline and write a new one". Mac Rauch recalled, [...] "It's so easy to start something and then—since you're <b>really</b> not as <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> it as you should be—end up writing half of it ... You shove the hundred pages in a drawer and try to forget about it. Over the years, I started a dozen Buckaroo scripts that ended that way".|$|R
