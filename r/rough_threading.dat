40|$|The {{most popular}} tools for {{generating}} the gears are hobs, whose materials are the High Speed Steel (HSS) {{in the many}} case. Because the HSS contains such the rare components as W, Mo, Co and V, the material cost is expensive. A sequence for manufacturing the hobs consists of (1) hob-thread roughing, (2) flute milling (3) normalizing the body, (4) backing-off hob thread, (5) quenching and tempering and (6) grinding. Thus the sequence is very complicated and the machinability of HSS also is very poor due to the alloy elements above mentioned. Therefore the manufacture cost is higher too. In this paper the cost-down methods are developed in <b>rough</b> <b>threading</b> the large-sized hobs {{and the availability of}} these methods are checked by exprimenting with two typical end mills on the backing-off lathe. In order to decrease the rough machining times, the above operations (1) and (4) among the above operations are simultaneously worked on the backing-off lathe. Thus, in case of module 20 hob, the <b>rough</b> <b>threading</b> and backing time 33 hours required in the ordinary way can be shortened up to 24 hours. Through these results, it is cleared that the threading in backing with the tapered surfy end mill is hopeful for decreasing the manufacture prices...|$|E
5000|$|In 715, Prince Hozumi died, leaving Maro as {{the highest-ranking}} retainer. On March 3, 717, Maro {{died at the}} age of 78. Empress Genshō lamented his loss deeply, sending Prince Nagaya and Tajihi no Miyakemaro (多治比三宅麻呂) on a condolence call to his home and {{granting}} him the posthumous rank of [...] (ju ichi-i). Condolences were presented by representatives of the daijō-kan, nobles above the fifth rank, and nobles below the sixth rank. The Shoku Nihongi records that there was none among the people who did not mourn his loss (追慕し痛惜しない百姓はなかった). Eight months later additional presents were made to him, of <b>rough</b> silk, <b>thread,</b> cotton, and cloth.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{were performed to}} study the mechanical behaviours of newly developed high strength rock bolt components, including rebar, thread, plate, and domed washer. The characteristics of deformation and damage of each component were presented. The stress distribution of plate and domed washer was investigated through finite element modelling. The numerical {{results show that the}} yield and tensile strengths of the developed high strength rebar are 33. 6 %– 58. 3 % and 17. 2 %– 28. 7 % greater than those of the conventional rebar, respectively. The increase in yield strength was higher than that in tensile strength, suggesting an increase in yield to tensile strength ratio and a decrease in elongation. It is well-known that the thread processing may not be of high precision and accuracy as expected, which is characterised as <b>rough</b> <b>thread</b> surface, non-identical tooth height, toe stripping, and cracks in the surface. Hardening during thread processing tends to increase the thread yield and tensile strengths. In this paper, the typical deformation process of arch-shaped plate is classified into five stages. The tested plates exhibited distinct deformation characteristics and bearing capacities due to variations in shape, size, material and presence of washer. It was observed that uneven bottom surface, low bearing arch and large radius of the transitional arc connecting bearing arch and bottom surface were the major reasons accounting for low load-bearing capacity of plates. The performance of domed washer has a close relation with the shape, size, strength, and deformation compatibility with plate. Stress concentration was observed {{on the periphery of the}} contact surface between domed washer and plate, which is significantly influenced by the strength of domed washer and is considered to be 20 %– 30 % higher than that of plate. Finally, a case study in the Datong coal mining district was presented, and the support pattern and effect of the developed rock bolt were described...|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} render the {{appearance}} of his followers as imposing as possible, Mr. Goodenough furnished each of the Houssas {{with a pair of}} trousers made of New Zealand flax, reaching to their knees. These he had brought from England with him. They were all found to be too large, but the men soon set to work with <b>rough</b> needles and <b>thread</b> and took them in. In addition to these, each man was furnished with a red sash, which went several times round the waist, and served to keep the trousers up and to give a gay aspect to the dress. The Houssas were much pleased with their appearance. All of them carried swords in addition to the guns, as in their own country they are accustomed to fight with these weapons.|$|R
30|$|Microplastic {{particles}} {{are used as}} exfoliants in certain product segments of specific personal care products, such as hand cleaners, facial cleaners and toothpaste [51]. In the US patent for skin cleaners containing plastic microparticles, polyolefin particles with a size of 74 – 420  µm and an amorphous shape without sharp edges were described as appropriate for use as exfoliants [52]. The used polyolefins include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS; for abbreviations for the plastic resins see also Table  1). Gouin et al. [53] estimated that in 2012, approx. 6  % of the liquid skin cleaning products marketed in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland contained microplastics. Based on a survey conducted by Cosmetics Europe, PE accounted for 93  % of the microplastics used in skin cleaning products in these countries in 2012. The products typically contained between 0.05 and 12  % of microplastic particles, {{with the size of}} most particles ranging from 450 to 800  µm [53]. When analysing skin cleaners, spherical particles (mostly with a <b>rough</b> surface), <b>threads</b> and irregularly shaped particles consisting of PE and PS, and mainly having a blue or white colour were identified [45, 51, 54 – 56]. Microplastics are also used in medical applications, e.g. in dentist tooth polish, and as carriers to deliver active pharmaceutical agents [51, 57]. After use, microplastics from personal care products and such medical products can reach the environment via wastewater.|$|R
5000|$|... (Original description) The very coarse and strong, long, narrow shell {{has with}} a concave conical base. It shows huge hunchy ribs, and coarse spiral threads. Its {{longitudinal}} sculpture {{is characterized by}} six enormous bunchy oblique ribs on each whorl, which die out on the base and at the sinus below the suture, but reach the suture {{at the bottom of}} the upper whorls. They are parted by broad open furrows, which run obliquely to the left and more or less continuously down the spire. These ribs and furrows are roughened by coarse unequal lines of growth. The surface is scored by strong <b>rough</b> spiral <b>threads</b> parted by wider furrows. These threads are absent in the deep, strong, shallow, sinus-furrow below the suture, in which, however, a few feeble spiral threads are found. Two, a little stronger, marginate the underside of the suture. The shell of the holotype is weathered, but seems to have been of a uniform pale tint. The spire is very tall, narrow, and conical. The apex broken. There remain 11 convex whorls of slow increase. The last is hunchy but not large, and is drawn out into a concave base with a broad snout. The suture is small, very much distorted by the longitudinal ribs. The aperture is small, elongately and gibbously pear-shaped. The outer lip is immensely but remotely thickened outside by the last rib, from which it is bevelled off to a narrow edge. The U-shaped sinus is deep, broad, and strong, close up to the suture but parted from it by a big triangular shelf. Below it the lip edge advances very much and then retreats again in front. The inner lip shows a thin broad glaze on the columella, which is very strong, oblique to the left, slightly cut off in front, where alone it is twisted with a thin rounded edge ...|$|R
