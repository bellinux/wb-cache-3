50|$|In 1955, {{the first}} {{comfortable}} mass-produced monocoque all-wheel drive vehicle appeared, the M72, with a four-wheel drive system {{adapted from the}} contemporary Soviet GAZ-69.

It used a standard Pobeda transmission, mated to the GAZ-69 front axle, leaf spring suspension, and transfer case, with a brand-new rear axle (used on no other vehicle, a rarity for Soviet car production). The body had fourteen panels added to strengthen the floor, frame, doors, and <b>roof.</b> <b>Trim</b> and interior were otherwise the same as the M20, and in all, 4,677 were built by end of production in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Leather seating {{areas and}} vinyl <b>roof</b> <b>trim</b> were {{available}} on the De Ville, {{but not on the}} Calais (although a high-grade cloth-and-vinyl, similar to what was seen on top-line Buick Electras and Oldsmobile 98s, was).

Both the high-end Buick and Oldsmobile models shared the GM C platform with Cadillac. Cadillac, always General Motors' technology leader, offered most De Ville options on the Calais, such as Twilight Sentinel and the GuideMatic headlight dimmer. In 1965, the new Turbo-Hydramatic, standard on the 1964 De Ville, but not the lower-priced Series 62, became standard throughout the Cadillac range - even the Calais. The [...] 429 cid L V8 also remained the standard engine.|$|E
50|$|As {{the planned}} {{structure}} was {{to reflect the}} finest of Thai Temple architecture, the Fine Arts Department of Thailand in Bangkok was commissioned to draw up the architectural plans and to oversee {{the construction of the}} Temple building.

The structure, heavily gilded in gold leaves, intricately decorated with multi-coloured glass tiles, and crowned with a multi tiered <b>roof</b> <b>trimmed</b> with chor fahs, represented the most stunning Thai temple architecture in the Klang Valley. His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand had granted Royal Consent for His Majesty’s Royal Insignia to be mounted on the front gable of the building and also donated the main shrine Buddha image named Phra Buddha Thammeen, a rare honour that reflected His Majesty’s special consideration and compassion towards Wat Chetawan.|$|R

5000|$|In 1968, {{after one}} year of production, the GTX was given a {{completely}} new look. A new hourglass body replaced the more box-like body of 1967. The Road Runner was introduced by Plymouth as a budget performance version of the Belvedere. There were major changes made {{in the design of}} all the Plymouth B-bodies. The Road Runner's base engine was the new 383 cuin L [...] "Super Commando" [...] V8 (renamed the [...] "Road Runner 383"), while the high performance 440 was still standard in the GTX. The TorqueFlite automatic transmission was standard on the GTX, with it being a US$206 option in the Road Runner. The GTX used the Sport Satellite trim and was offered in two models, the two-door convertible and the two-door hardtop. The Road Runner used the Belvedere trim, and had less insulation and comfort items (padding, vinyl <b>roof,</b> <b>trim),</b> which reduced weight, helped produce better track times, and kept it in the low price field.|$|E
