40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to establish the satisfaction degree of the heavy commercial vehicles market customers. This scientifical endeavour is justified by the major importance given by the producers and distributors of such vehicles to the beneficiaries’ satisfaction, a hich importance factor in the product development, customer relations inprovement and market share growth. After the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, when the Romanian heavy commercial vehicles market collapsed, the growth trend was linear and moderat, but the market structure changed significantly. Having on one hand high technological costs, generated by the European legislation on pllution reduction and road safety and, on the other hand, the beneficiaries’ price pressure, the top producers from the deveoped countries focused on the optimization of the cutomers’ satisfaction degree and the development of their loyalty towards the brand. In order to achieve this, there has been developed a selective qualitative research, {{in the form of a}} questionnaire, among the most important customers of MHS Truck & Bus SRL – the importer of MAN trucks in Romania. The questions were directed towards obtaining informations regarding the customers’ product perception, identifying the main acquisition motivations and finding the main issues in successfully implementing the main politics of the relational maketing.

40|$|Background: Traffic {{collisions}} are {{an important}} public health problem worldwide, in terms of mortality, morbidity, and economic burden. The goal {{of this study is}} to estimate the social cost of injured people in traffic collisions in Catalonia in the year 2007. Methods: We performed a cost-of-illness analysis, under the perspective of the healthcare system, the public sector, and the society, using a 1 -year time horizon. In Catalonia, during 2007, there were a total of 26, 063 collisions with victims, which translates into 34, 565 non-mortal victims and 521 deaths. As direct costs, all healthcare costs (primary care, acute hospital care, emergency care, ambulances and transport, long-term care, and specialized care); costs of adaptation to disability, disability benefits, material costs, and administrative costs; and costs of police, fire-fighters, and <b>road</b> <b>assistance</b> have been included. As indirect costs, productivity losses as a result of hospital and long-term institutionalization as well as productivity losses from work sick leave and productivity losses of carers have been taken into account. Results: From the perspective of the healthcare system, the cost of the injured people in traffic collisions was 31, 803, 024. 03 € in 2007; from the perspective of the public sector, it was 134, 047, 059. 27 € (up to 1, 463, 645, 407. 13 € in the sensitivity analysis) and 144, 043, 238. 88 € (up to 1, 558, 926, 995. 12 € in the sensitivity analysis) from the perspective of the society. The cost per injured person ranged from 3, 855. 38 € from the perspective of the healthcare system to 17, 461. 90 € from the perspective of the society (up to 188, 983. 76 € in the sensitivity analysis). Conclusions: The importance of the costs of injured people in traffic collisions is an argument more—besides the epidemiologic and social impact—to start off preventive policies...|$|E
