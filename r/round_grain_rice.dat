50|$|Different {{varieties}} of rice need different cooking times, {{depending on their}} grain size, grain shape, and grain composition. There are three main types of Asian rice: Oryza sativa subsp. indica, i.e., Indian <b>rice</b> (long <b>grain</b> <b>rice,</b> e.g., basmati rice and Thai jasmine rice), O. sativa subsp. javanica, i.e., Java <b>rice</b> (large <b>grain</b> <b>rice)</b> and O. sativa subsp. japonica, i.e., Japanese <b>rice</b> (medium <b>grain</b> <b>rice,</b> e.g., Calrose <b>rice,</b> short <b>grain</b> <b>rice,</b> e.g., most Japanese rice and risotto rice).|$|R
50|$|In California, {{production}} {{is dominated by}} short and medium grain japonica varieties, including cultivars developed for the local climate such as Calrose, which makes {{up as much as}} 85% of the state's crop. The broad classification of rice grown includes Long <b>Grain</b> <b>Rice,</b> Medium <b>Grain</b> <b>Rice</b> and Short <b>Grain</b> <b>Rice.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{now more}} than 100 {{varieties}} of rice are grown in the world, in the US 20 varieties of rice are commercially produced, primarily in the states of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and California. Primary classification of rice grown are the long, medium or short grain type. The Long <b>Grain</b> <b>Rice</b> is slender and long, the Medium <b>Grain</b> <b>Rice</b> is plump but not round, and the Short <b>Grain</b> <b>Rice</b> is <b>round.</b> The forms of rice are Brown Rice, Parboiled Rice and Regular-Milled White Rice.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{evaluated}} {{total and}} inorganic arsenic levels in long <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> and rice based baby foods on Finnish market. Inorganic arsenic was analysed with an HPLC–ICP-MS system. The total arsenic concentration was determined with an ICP-MS method. In this study, the inorganic arsenic levels in long <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> varied from 0. 09 to 0. 28 mg/kg (n= 8) {{and the total}} arsenic levels from 0. 11 to 0. 65 mg/kg. There was a good correlation between the total and inorganic arsenic levels in long <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> at a confidence level of 95 %. The total arsenic levels of rice-based baby foods were in the range 0. 02 – 0. 29 mg/kg (n= 10), however, the level of inorganic arsenic could only be quantitated in four samples, on average they were 0. 11 mg/kg. Our estimation of inorganic arsenic intake from long <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> and rice-based baby food in Finland indicate that in every age group the intake {{is close to the}} lowest BMDL 0. 1 value 0. 3 μg/kg bw/day set by EFSA.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{the effects of}} three rice cultivars on postprandial glycemic control and appetite. A single-blind, randomized, crossover clinical trial was performed with 18 healthy subjects, nine males and nine females. Three treatments were administered at three separate study visits: commercially available conventional white <b>rice</b> (short <b>grain),</b> specialty high amylose white rice 1 (Dixiebelle), and specialty high amylose white rice 2 (Rondo). Postprandial capillary blood glucose, venous blood glucose and insulin measurements, and appetite visual analog scale (VAS) surveys were done {{over the course of}} two hours. The capillary blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower for Rondo compared to short <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> at 30 min, and for Dixiebelle and Rondo compared to short <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> at 45, 60, and 120 min. Capillary blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) was significantly lower for Dixiebelle and Rondo compared to short <b>grain</b> <b>rice.</b> Subjects were significantly more hungry at 30 min after Dixiebelle intake than Rondo intake, but there were no other significant effects in appetite ratings. The present study determined that intake of high amylose rice with resistant starch (RS) can attenuate postprandial blood glucose and insulin response in comparison to short <b>grain</b> <b>rice...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rice {{cultivar}} starch composition differences do {{not completely}} explain variation in rice cooking and eating quality. <b>Rice</b> <b>grain</b> storage proteins possess divergent solubility properties suggesting they {{may contribute to}} cultivar differences in <b>rice</b> <b>grain</b> quality. Application of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to protein extracts derived from medium and long <b>grain</b> advanced <b>rice</b> breeding lines revealed <b>rice</b> <b>grain</b> protein composition differences which were associated with instrumental measures of grain quality. Globulin content displayed little variation in both grain types. The mean glutelin content was higher in long <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> lines than medium grains. Although the mean content of prolamins in medium and long <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> were similar, the prolamin content of medium grains was more variable. Individual medium grain prolamin HPLC peaks, total prolamin content and the prolamin:glutelin + prolamin ratio were positively correlated with several rapid visco analyser (RVA) parameters. The long grain HPLC data displayed a similar pattern of correlations with RVA parameters but of reduced magnitude. Protein composition was associated with instrumental measures of grain quality in this set of germplasm and although the textural properties of rice are complex, these data suggest consideration of <b>rice</b> <b>grain</b> protein composition could contribute to breeding high quality rice...|$|R

Temperatures of 50 °C, 70 °C and 90 °C {{were used for}} both long and short <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> paddy. Each treatment had three replicates of 12, 18 and 24 h of soaking durations.

30|$|As {{discussed}} above, all particles {{returned by}} Hayabusa thus far investigated have relatively young CRE ages. We have discussed a potential mechanism {{that could have}} produced <b>rounded</b> <b>grains.</b> It would be remiss of us {{if we did not}} also apply our reasoning to the production of angular grains. Angular regolith grains could have been produced from a number of mechanisms: (1) impacts, (2) YORP-driven processes, (3) tidal forces, and/or (4) thermal fatigue (Murdoch et al. 2012; Delbo et al. 2014). Constraining which one (or combination of processes) was the dominant mechanism may require a data set that carefully compares the CRE ages of <b>rounded</b> <b>grains</b> with those that are angular. We predict {{that there should be a}} higher abundance of <b>rounded</b> <b>grains</b> with slightly older CRE ages than angular grains due to the fact that time is needed to produce the physically weathered <b>rounded</b> <b>grain</b> from an angular one.|$|R
