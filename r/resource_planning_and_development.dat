50|$|In April 2007, {{allegations}} were made that a Gunns lawyer {{was involved in}} preparing new legislation introduced by then Premier Paul Lennon which bypasses the <b>Resource</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> Commission and replaces it with a government-appointed consultant which raised questions about Gunns influence over the current State Labor government. There are other allegations of collusion and co-operation between the company and Tasmania's political leaders.

5000|$|The {{proposal}} {{had been}} criticised for not using accepted {{technology for the}} bleaching process and instead involved the presence of elemental chlorine at an intermediate stage (rather than hydrogen peroxide or methanol) {{in the production of}} the main bleaching chemical chlorine dioxide. This particular criticism could only refer to Gunns' original preferred chemical plant design termed and 'integrated' chemical plant, which was one of three chemical plant designs presented for assessment. The integrated process as then described by Gunns had not been approved by the United Nations Environment Programme as Accepted Modern Technology (AMT) for this purpose and therefore was inconsistent with Tasmanian guidelines. By comparison, the two alternative chemical plant designs, presented by Gunns as [...] "merchant chemical plant alternative 1" [...] and [...] "2" [...] were AMT. According to, Dr Warwick Raverty, a chemist with over 20 years experience in the Kraft pulping and paper, a hiccup with a waterspray within an [...] "integrated" [...] process could cause the bleaching chemical chlorine dioxide to be contaminated with elemental chlorine. Elemental chlorine contamination of the chlorine dioxide bleaching chemical could in turn lead to the release of persistent organic pollutants (dioxins), potentially causing environmental harm and a subsequent breach of the Stockholm Convention. The [...] "integrated" [...] design for chlorine dioxide generation was not selected by Gunns to proceed as it was effectively prevented from implementation by the State Permit (Condition 3GN9.1). Gunns has subsequently indicated it will move from [...] "ECF" [...] to [...] "ECF-Light" [...] bleaching, which is facilitated by moving from [...] "Merchant alternative 1" [...] to [...] "Merchant alternative 2" [...] within the final design of the chemical plant described above. Raverty resigned from the now defunct <b>Resource</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> Commission (RPDC) panel on the mill, citing undue political interference. In July 2007, The Wilderness Society launched a legal case against the federal government, claiming the Federal Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Malcolm Turnbull, acted illegally by allowing the pulp mill to escape proper assessment by the independent RPDC. Turnbull agreed to withhold a decision on the approval of the mill until after the 6 August conclusion of the case. The case was dismissed in August 2007.|$|E

This article evaluates the RPDC and the PMAA assessment processes using a ‘good environmental governance’ framework composed of eight criteria—transparency, accountability, openness, balance, deliberation, efficiency, science and risk. The comparison reveals that although the RPDC process fell short of the ideal, it was markedly superior to the PMAA process that replaced it.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how effectively marine {{issues have been}} assessed in the proposed Tamar Valley pulp mill policy process. The levels of dioxins in the effluent, their long term effects on marine life, and the ‘backwash’ of effluent back into the coastal regions and the Tamar River, are some marine issues that have {{become a source of}} contention amongst marine/fisheries lobbyists and pulp mill supporters. These issues were assessed in various degrees through the <b>Resource</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> Commission (RPDC), Pulp Mill Assessment Act (PMAA) and Commonwealth Pulp Mill Review (under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act) processes since 2003. This paper analyses the Tasmanian and Commonwealth government’s policy approaches to deal with the impact of the pulp mill on the marine ecosystem. It is argued that after the RPDC process was abandoned, the marine issues have not been a priority for the Tasmanian government. While the Commonwealth is currently reviewing the pulp mill’s impact on the marine ecosystem, it is limited to assessing the impacts under the EPBC Act. The Commonwealth review has so far not prevented the pulp mill from being built...|$|E

Nowadays, agriculture has become just one of the activities of the rural world.

When we speak about multifunctionality in agriculture, we are considering that the agricultural activity comprises other functions other than the production of agricultural and agro-industry goods. This activity is not just directed at the pure competitiveness of the production but rather plays an essential role for the development of rural areas by preserving, for instance, the culture and traditions of the people.

In Minnesota, inter-agency support is being sought for a unified impact forecasting system for government operations and planning. A first-stage effort in developing and implementing an extensive regional input-output modeling capability for state and local government impact analysis and forecasting is being completed. The energy-economic impact forecasting system presented here is a modular approach to both economic modeling and information systems develop-ment. A set of eleven modules [...] market, investment, demand, production, (input-output),employment, value added, labor force, population, household, fiscal, and ecologic [...] provides the data base and programming routines for simulating the state (or a subatate regional) economy. An additional set of government function modules, including energy and environmental management, provides an auxiliary data base and forecasts for state and local government agencies.

The specific objectives of this research were to identify different types of motivation applied by the Government Procurement Services Agency, to examine employee’s involvement in decision making, and to assess motivation practices applied by the organization. The case study approach was used to conduct this study. A sample of forty seven (47) employees from different levels was selected and data collection was undertaken through questionnaires, interviews, observation and documentary review. Content analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. The main findings from the research show that level of education, age of majority employees, participation in decision making, working environment, salary and promotion and training predict their intention to leave, while job security did not. In addition the level of education, age of majority employees, ability to participate in decision making, working environment, salary and promotion and training significantly predicted the situation of motivation level. Furthermore, the study revealed that job security is the only variable which play major role in motivating employees.

A cross-sectional quantitative design was used to answer the research objectives. A Questionnaires with three sections- a 36 – item scale designed to capture various aspects of job satisfaction, 4 – item scale to capture employees’ intention to leave and a number of demographic and job characteristics, were used to collect data from employees of 17 NBC bank branches situated in the city of Dar es Salaam. With 107 useful questionnaires, descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression analysis techniques were used to analyze the data. The findings of the study show that the age, education, job position and length of service categories of the employees, significantly predicted their intention to leave, while gender did not. In addition, age, job position and length of service categories of the employees significantly predicted their level of job satisfaction. Furthermore, the study revealed that job satisfaction and some of the demographic variables specifically gender and length of services has a significantly negative relationship with intention to leave. The findings of the study imply that, the greater the job satisfaction the less likely is the turnover intention. Accordingly, employees who are satisfied with their job will have less or no intention to leave.

40|$|Modern society {{continues}} to change dramatically as humankind {{steps into the}} 21 st century (Toffler, 1980). Likewise, social change has shaped the new structure of Taiwanese enterprises. Visible changes include the lack of balance between labor supply and demand, increased labor costs, and the outdated character of labor organizations. To cope with these changes, enterprises {{are being forced to}} upgrade their training methods and to provide better training curricula for their workers (Stern, 1988, 1990 a). Recently, some Taiwanese companies that once created economic miracles have closed their businesses in local markets and moved to eastern Asian countries such as Mainland China, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The change is due to their inability to pay ever-rising wages and salaries (Kuo, 1990). Furthermore, industries with a high amount of pollution, such as chemical companies, and labor-intensive industries, such as electronic and shoe manufacturers, are facing new challenges (Japan Management Association, 1989). Obviously, if no action is taken to refine production processes, to adopt high-technology equipment, or to enhance workers ' skills, the traditional Taiwanese companies will soon be phased out of the international market (Stern, 1986, 1990 b; Stern & Muta, 1989).
