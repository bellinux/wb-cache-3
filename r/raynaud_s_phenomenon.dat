Material and methods: Tlxe study was conducted basing of questionner of pts and analysis of ycases by randomized sampling among 103 consequent pts (M:F= 13 : 90) with reliable RA (ARA, 1987) in rheumatologic department of Clinical Hospital Nol in Ekaterinburg. 74 % of pts under study demonstrated systemic manifestations: anemia (in 47 pts), lymphadenopathy (in 34), rheumatoid nodules (in 15), Sjogren s syndrome (in 4), nephropathy (in 4), vascular disturbances including <b>Raynaud</b> <b>s</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> capillarites (by 1 pt). Results: In the course of disease basic therapy was prescribed to 88 out of 103 (85. 4 %) pts and {{one and the same}} patient could take different basic drugs. Aminochinoline drugs prevailed, after them more frequent were immunodepressants and gold preparations. More rarely pts had sulfasalazin, cuprenil and wobenzym. In general, in 133 out of 184 cases of prescribing basic drugs they were canceled. The reason for cancellation were: prevalently absence of the drug in the pharmaceutical stores (in 48 cases) averagely in 8 months of taking the drug; then they insufficient efficacy (44 cases) averagely in 1. 3 year. In 18 cases pts themselves stopped treatment averagely in 3. 5 months of drug taking. Conclusion: In the majority of cases of basic drugs cancellation in RA the cause is their absence in sail especially on free of charge prescription. Cases ofself-cancellation of the drug demonstrate the need of explaining to pts the necessity> of long-term taking disease-modifying drugs...|$|E

These effects may be exacerbated by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or the presence of primary <b>Raynaud</b> 73 <b>s</b> <b>phenomena.</b> The goal of these studies was to use an established model of vibration-induced injury in Zucker rats. Lean Zucker rats have a normal metabolic profile, while obese Zucker rats display symptoms of metabolic disorder or Type II diabetes. This study examined the effects of vibration in obese and lean rats. Zucker rats were exposed to 4 h of vibration for 10 consecutive days at a frequency of 125 Hz and acceleration of 49 m/s(2) for 10 consecutive days. Sensory function was checked using transcutaneous electrical stimulation on days 1, 5 and 9 of the exposure. Once the study was complete the ventral tail nerves, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord were dissected, and levels of various transcripts involved in sensorineural dysfunction were measured. Sensorineural dysfunction was assessed using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Obese Zucker rats displayed very few changes in sensorineural function. However they did display significant changes in transcript levels for factors involved in synapse formation, peripheral nerve remodeling, and inflammation. The changes in transcript levels suggested that obese Zucker rats had some level of sensory nerve injury prior to exposure, and that exposure to vibration activated pathways involved in injury and re-innervation.

5000|$|The {{pseudonym}} 'idiot' {{need not}} be understood in the ordinary sense as now used. According to the original Greek, idiota means private (also as a soldier), simple, or peculiar, and {{it is probable that}} the writer in question employed it in this sense to signify that he was a person of no consequence. Father Theophilus <b>Raynaud,</b> <b>S.</b> J.,(also known as [...] "The Idiot") discovered that Raymundus Jordanus was the author of the works found in the library of the Fathers under the name Idiota. In his preface to one of the works of Idiota, the [...] "Oculus Mysticus", which he published in 1641, he accounts for this discovery by the testimony of idiotic writers, and by {{the fact that some of}} the original Manuscripts had been signed by Raymundus. Biographical writers have, in general, accepted Raynaud's theory since 1654, when, under his editorship, a complete edition of the works of Idiota was published in Paris under the name of Raymundus Jordanus. It is known for certain that this Raymundus was a Frenchman, a Canon Regular of St. Augustine, prior of the house of his order at Uzès, in southern France, and afterwards Abbot of Selles-sur-Cher, France where he lived and died. Selles, it appears, was not then a Cistercian monastery. Raymundus wrote about the year 1381. In an account of a transaction between the Canons Regular and the Bishop of Uzès in the year 1377, Raymundus is styled licentiate, and it is stated that he was elected by the chapter of his order to present and conduct its cause before an ecclesiastical tribunal presided over by Cardinal Sabinensi, which he did with ability and success. Whether Raynaud is right in his theory that Raymundus Jordanus is Idiota, or whether Idiota is to remain unknown like the Auctor operis imperfecti, so often quoted by Christian writers, may still be regarded by many as an open question.|$|R

In the realm of legal theory, the article suggests, convergence advanced to the extent that Habermas’ discourse theory may be characterised as a normative superstructure to Luhmann’s descriptive theory of society. It is further shown that the debate’s result was an almost complete absorption of Habermas’ theory by Luhmann’s systems theoretical complex – an outcome facilitated by Luhmann’s deliberate translation of central Habermasian concepts into systems theoretical concepts. The article argues that both the debate and Habermas’ conversion were made possible because not only Habermas’ but also Luhmann’s work can be considered a further development of the German idealist tradition. What Luhmann did not acknowledge was that this manoeuvre permitted the achievement of Habermas’ normative objectives; nor did he notice that it could eradicate a central flaw in the system theoretical construction, by allowing the context within which distinctions are drawn to be mapped ‐ an issue of pivotal importance for grasping relationships between different social systems, and coordinating them, via the deployment of legal instruments...|$|R
