25|$|The {{operation}} of the Routemaster gradually contracted to central areas only, with RMLs replacing RMs, where {{it was felt that}} the Routemaster still provided an efficient means of transporting large enough numbers of people to justify the economics of two-person operation. The rapid acceleration and <b>rugged</b> <b>construction</b> of the Routemaster proved to be more suited to urban conditions than some more modern designs.|$|E
25|$|Engineer {{boots are}} {{typically}} made from thick, stiff, full-grain bull hide. The leather is often oiled to add durability and flexibility, {{and may be}} brown or black in color. The double-layered shafts may be anywhere between 7 inches to 17 inches in height, and are gusseted {{at the top and}} relatively loose, though they can be tightened by a steel-buckled strap. Another steel-buckled strap is placed at the instep of each boot. As per their <b>rugged</b> <b>construction,</b> the footwear is relatively heavy and weighs approximately a pound-mass each.|$|E

50|$|MidSTAR is {{designed}} for use on the EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) Ring developed by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) for placement on Delta IV or Atlas V expendable launch vehicles. MidSTAR is a Class D spacecraft, produced at minimum cost with a correspondingly higher technical risk in production and operation. It is intentionally simple in design and <b>rugged</b> in <b>construction,</b> using commercial off-the-shelf “plug-and-play” components to the greatest extent possible. Component development and circuit-board level design are accomplished only when necessary.|$|R
25|$|The {{intended}} role of {{this design}} {{turned out to}} be uncertain. While its <b>rugged</b> <b>construction</b> was capable of withstanding high g-forces, it weighed in at 3,704 pounds (700 pounds more than the F4B), and did not have the maneuverability needed in a fighter aircraft. It was, however, suitable as a fighter-bomber, and in March 1934 the prototype was redesignated XBFB-1 in recognition of its qualities. Even so, various ideas were tried to improve its fighter qualifications, such as an improved engine cowling, streamlining around the landing gear, and even a three-bladed propeller (two-bladed props being standard).|$|E
25|$|Engineer boots, {{also known}} as engineer's boots or {{engineering}} boots, are an American type of leather boots. Their lace-less, <b>rugged</b> <b>construction</b> has made them popular among motorcycle riders. Originally developed in the 1930s for firemen working on steam locomotives, the boots gained substantial popularity in the post–World War II era among a burgeoning motorcycling culture. They became popular symbols of teenage rebellion in the 1950s and a common component of greaser wear. They were later adopted by skinheads and punks in the 1970s. By the 2010s, engineer boots were being popularly worn for fashion purposes, especially by non-traditional customers such as women, young urban professionals, and hipsters.|$|E
25|$|Salvor is {{the third}} ship of the {{auxiliary}} rescue and salvage class of vessel constructed for the US Navy. The <b>rugged</b> <b>construction</b> of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make Salvor well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world. The hull below the waterline is ice-strengthened. Her propulsion plant can develop 4200 shaft horsepower with four Caterpillar399 diesel engines coupled in pairs to two shafts. She is fitted with a Controllable Reversible Pitch (CRP) propeller within a Kort nozzle on each shaft. The CRP propeller/Kort nozzle combination produces greater thrust and more maneuverability control than conventional propellers. Salvor is also configured with a bow thruster which provides athwartship thrust for additional control of the bow when the ship's speed is less than five knots (9km/h).|$|E
50|$|The Air Force {{built the}} White Alice Communications System with {{numerous}} support facilities {{around the state}} to provide reliable communications to far-flung, isolated, and often <b>rugged</b> locales. <b>Construction</b> began in 1955 and the system was dedicated in 1958. In the end, 71 systems were installed throughout Alaska. White Alice was designed by Western Electric, and civilian contractors maintained it. In 1976, the WACS was leased to RCA Alascom. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, most of the system was deactivated.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the area's <b>rugged</b> terrain, <b>construction</b> of {{the line}} {{required}} numerous retaining walls and demolition of numerous cliffs. A 35 ft high, 224 ft long timber trestle was constructed over Glade Creek on a sharp horseshoe curve where the line deviated from the Mann's Creek {{in order to gain}} elevation. [...] At Clifftop were the Babcock Coal and Coke Company's coal mines, which the railroad served by hauling coal down to 193 beehive coke ovens along the C&O mainline at Sewell.|$|R
5000|$|Hest Bank station {{itself was}} of <b>rugged</b> stone <b>construction,</b> a two-storey station {{house with a}} booking hall below on the up (southbound) platform. It was next to a level {{crossing}} over a minor road linking the A589 with houses, a water treatment works and a caravan park further along the foreshore. A small cottage for the crossing keeper was provided on the down (coastal-facing) side along with a footbridge to connect the platforms. The down side also had two sidings, one providing a bay platform.|$|R
2500|$|The line's {{combination}} of a powerful engine, <b>rugged</b> <b>construction</b> and a large cabin has made these aircraft popular bush planes.

2500|$|There {{are various}} types of {{off-road}} motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes, specially designed for off-road events. The term off-road refers to driving surfaces that are not conventionally paved. These are rough surfaces, often created naturally, such as sand, gravel, a river, mud or snow. These types of terrain can sometimes only be travelled on with vehicles designed for off-road driving (such as SUVs, ATVs, snowmobiles and mountain bikes) or vehicles that have off-road equipment. Compared to road-going motorcycles, off-road machines are simpler and lighter, having long suspension travel, high ground clearance, and <b>rugged</b> <b>construction</b> with little bodywork and no fairings for less damage in spills. [...] Wheels (usually 21" [...] front, 18" [...] rear) have knobby tires, often clamped to the rim with a rim lock.|$|E
50|$|Formerly one {{of their}} most {{expensive}} joysticks is the HOTAS Cougar, a close but by no means exact reproduction of both the throttle and stick that is used in the real F-16 fighter aircraft. The product features <b>rugged</b> all-steel <b>construction</b> and numerous programming possibilities but is hampered by low-quality potentiometers, leading to a thriving replacement industry. Some of the devices have had reported quality problems, including play in the centering springs and the tendency of the speedbrake switch to break due to a manufacturing defect (this has been fixed on later serial numbers).|$|R

Besides its extremely small size and <b>rugged</b> monolithic <b>construction,</b> the silica-based sensor has the advantage that thermal mismatch is minimal and a vacuum reference pressure cavity is present, enabling application in high-temperature environments. Operation in an environment up to 600 °C is demonstrated. Furthermore, a possible route toward mass fabrication of such sensors is presented, avoiding the need for a FIB operation. status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|The P-40 was {{generally}} superior to early Italian fighter types, {{such as the}} Fiat G.50 and the Macchi C.200. Its performance against the Macchi C.202 Folgore elicited varying opinions. Some observers consider the Macchi C.202 superior. Caldwell, who scored victories against them in his P-40, felt that the Folgore was superior to the P-40 and the Bf 109 except that its armament of only two or four machine guns was inadequate. Other observers considered the two equally matched or favored the Folgore in aerobatic performance, such as turning radius. Aviation historian Walter J. Boyne wrote that over Africa, the P-40 and the Folgore were [...] "equivalent". Against its lack of high-altitude performance, the P-40 {{was considered to be}} a stable gun platform, and its <b>rugged</b> <b>construction</b> meant that it was able to operate from rough front line airstrips with a good rate of serviceability.|$|E

A prototype SRM and controller were built and fully tested to validate the SRM design and to develop a set of rules and equations for controlling the motor. Particular emphasis was given to developing a simple practical control strategy that was suitable for an HEV application and not trying to develop a more sophisticated strategy that could not be justified in terms of increased development time and implementation cost...|$|R
40|$|Multifunctional capability, {{flexible}} design, <b>rugged</b> lightweight <b>construction,</b> and self-powered operation are desired attributes for electronics {{that directly}} interface {{with the human}} body or with advanced robotic systems. For these and related applications, piezoelectric materials, in forms that offer the ability to bend and stretch, are attractive for pressure/force sensors and mechanical energy harvesters. In this paper we introduce a large area, flexible piezoelectric material that consists of sheets of electrospun fibers of the polymer poly[(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene]. The flow and mechanical conditions associated with the spinning process yield free-standing, three-dimensional architectures of aligned arrangements of such fibers, in which the polymer chains adopt strongly preferential orientations. The resulting material offers exceptional piezoelectric characteristics, to enable, as an example, ultra-high sensitivity for measuring pressure, even at exceptionally small values (0. 1 Pa). Quantitative analysis provides detailed insights into the pressure sensing mechanisms, and engineering design rules. Applications range from self-powered micro-mechanical elements, to self-balancing robots and sensitive impact detectors. Comment: 49 pages, 16 figure...|$|R

40|$|About {{sixty percent}} of the power in {{industries}} is consumed by induction machines, which implies induction machines {{are an integral part of}} industries. Even though these motors are stalwart and <b>rugged</b> in <b>construction,</b> they often experiences faults due to long time usage without maintenance. Bearing damage accounts 40 % in the total faults and cause severe damage to the machine if unnoticed at nascent stage. So these faults should be continuously monitored for efficient operation, otherwise may cause severe damage to the machine. Conventional vibration monitoring is difficult due to requirement of high manpower and costly sensors. So motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is widely used for detection and localization of these faults. In this paper, the bearing faults are estimated by means of current frequency spectral subtraction using discrete wavelet transform. In addition to this, the current signature analysis after spectral subtraction is carried out using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and a comparative analysis is presented to estimate fault severity using statistical parameters. The proposed method is assessed based on current signatures obtained from a 2. 2 kW induction machine. The experimental results acknowledged the effectiveness of proposed method...|$|R

50|$|During World War II Collins Radio {{became a}} key {{supplier}} of ground, ship, and aircraft communication equipment, expanding from about 350 to {{a peak of}} about 3700 employees. Arthur Collins was a co-designer of the Autotune device. Invented for commercial aviation shortly before the war, it allowed the pilot to remotely switch to preset frequencies. Autotune precisely adjusted the radio in about 40 seconds, without the lengthy hand-tuning normally required by a designated radio operator. The ART-13 100 watt HF military radio was highly prized for this feature and for its <b>rugged</b> and reliable <b>construction.</b> Over 90,000 were built for B-24, B-25, B-29, TBF and other aircraft.

25|$|As the Klingons {{are portrayed}} as a warrior culture, Klingon starships are usually {{depicted}} as warships, heavily armed {{with a variety of}} particle beam weaponry and antimatter warheads. Many Klingon ships also make use of cloaking technology to hide the vessel from view. The first Klingon ship design used in The Original Series, the D7-class battlecruiser, was designed by Matt Jefferies to evoke a predator's shape akin to that of a manta ray, providing a threatening and instantly recognizable form for viewers. The configuration of Jefferies' design featured a bulbous forward hull connected by a long boom to a wing-like main hull with the engine nacelles mounted on each wingtip. Later Klingon starships by other designers kept to this same overall configuration, although updated to reflect their respective time periods: Rick Sternbach's designs for The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine drew on elements of Starfleet ships features to reflect the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons, while John Eaves' designs for Enterprise incorporated more <b>rugged</b> and primitive <b>construction</b> to make the vessels appear consistent with the earlier time period.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the analysis, study and {{modeling}} of the torque ripple minimization setup for the closed loop control of Switched Reluctance Motor. SRM {{is becoming more and}} more popular for high speed industrial application environments due to its <b>rugged</b> and robust <b>construction.</b> For low cost, variable speed drives SRM are most widely used. But the torque pulsations in SRM are relatively higher compared to sinusoidal machines due to the doubly salient structure of the motor. Nonlinear inductance profile and pulse magnetizing make the torque ripple unavoidable. Both machine design and electronic control approaches have been used to minimize the torque ripples in SRM. This paper gives an extensive review of the origin of the torque ripple and approaches adopted to minimize the torque ripple. The mathematical modeling of three phase SRM is developed and integrated with different converter topologies in Matlab / Simulink environment along with control methods. The power spectrum density wave forms of torque are studied to verify the simulation results obtained. Index Terms—.
