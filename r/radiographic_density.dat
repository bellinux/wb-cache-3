Methods: A prospective, 3 -day point-prevalence study was performed by a survey of all intensive care units (ICU) in the Netherlands (n= 96). Thirty-six ICU's responded (37 %), reporting on 266 patients, of whom 151 were mechanically ventilated. The questionnaire included criteria and potential risk factors for ALI/ARDS, according to the North American-European Consensus Conference (NAECC) or the lung injury score (LIS≥ 2. 5).

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of the {{evaluation}} of an automatic system developed to analyze <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities.</b> This system, called RADEN, has been implemented at the Institute for Information Processing of the Italian National Research Council in Pisa. Forty-three pairs of abdominal X-ray films were obtained before and after the administration of ionic iodate contrast medium (i. i. c. m.) during urographic examinations. The 86 X-ray films were acquired and digitized using a computer-controlled optoelectronic device with a sampling step ranging 125 microns to 250 microns. The resulting images were arrays of 512 x 512 pixels, each one quantified on a byte (256 gray levels). The computing system included a high-performance personal computer equipped with a video RAM board having built-in facilities for image processing and with an optical disk to archive the images. Automatic and semi-automatic procedures were developed to segment, recognize and classify the images and to characterize three homogeneous regions [...] i. e., bone, water and air. The output data were compared with the area values of the air densities computed directly on the X-ray films by a radiologist. Furthermore, both data sets were compared with the scores given in a blind study by four observers. The subsequent statistic analysis showed the increase in air density areas after i. i. c. m. administration and the applicability of the implemented system to the automatic examination of abdominal <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities.</b> The results encourage to believe that the proposed approach could be employed as a first step for the development of quite a more complex system oriented to X-ray image understanding and to assisted diagnosis...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the product}} of tube current and {{exposure}} time, measured in milliampere-seconds (mA·s), is the primary controlling factor of <b>radiographic</b> <b>density,</b> kVp also affects the <b>radiographic</b> <b>density</b> indirectly. As the energy (which {{is proportional to the}} peak voltage) of the stream of electrons in the x-ray tube increases, the x-ray photons created from those electrons are more likely to penetrate the cells of the body and reach the image receptor (film or plate), resulting in increased <b>radiographic</b> <b>density</b> (compared to lower energy beams that may be absorbed in the body {{on their way to the}} image receptor). However, scattered x-rays also contribute to increased radiographic density: the higher the kVp of the beam, the more scatter will be produced. Scatter is unwanted density (that is, density created without bringing any pertinent information to the image receptor). This is why kVp is not primarily used to control density - as the density resulting from increasing kVp passes what is needed to penetrate a part, it will only add useless information to the image.|$|E

This study aims to investigate the use of a densitometer to analyze plain radiographic images and correlate them with the rate of new bone formation as represented by the bone healing index. A total of 34 bone lengthening procedures in 29 patients were retrospectively reviewed. We used an X-Rite 301 densitometer to measure densities of new callus on plain radiographs taken at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Patients aged below 16 y had significantly lower BHIs indicating faster bone healing and shorter duration of treatment. The ratio of <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities</b> between centre and edge of the new bone measured from plain radiographs taken at 8 weeks correlated positively with the eventual BHI of the patient.

40|$|Background Radiolucent {{lines and}} {{sclerotic}} margins are often seen on knee radiographs taken {{a year or}} longer after knee replacement surgery. Histology {{has shown that the}} radiolucent zone is predominantly fibrocartilage and the sclerotic margin is lamellar bone. The reasons for their existence are not clearly understood. Methods A three‐dimensional finite element model of the medial half of the proximal 75 mm of a tibia implanted with a knee replacement was created and run over 365 iterations simulating 1 year of in vivo post implant remodelling. After each iteration, new material properties were calculated for all elements of the model using established bone remodelling and tissue differentiation rules. For comparison with patient anteroposterior radiographs, “synthetic anteroposterior radiographs” were generated by reverse calculating <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities</b> from material properties of the model after 365 iterations. Von Mises stress of elements in the bone where the sclerotic line is usually seen were calculated after 365 iterations. These values were compared with the same entities assuming no remodelling. Findings The mean von Mises stress in the sclerotic region was higher when remodelling was assumed than when not, suggesting that the presence of the soft tissue (radiolucent line) increased the stress in the underlying bone. Interpretation The sclerotic line is caused by the stiffening of bone due to the relatively larger loads seen by the bone just beneath the soft tissue (radiolucent line) adjoining knee replacements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{influence}} of <b>radiographic</b> bone <b>density</b> {{changes in the}} area surrounding a total hip arthroplasty (THA) revision with a cementless press-fit stem is unknown, notably in terms of functional results. We have therefore conducted a study aiming to (1) propose a radiographic method to assess bone density, (2) measure the functional effects of reduced bone density, and (3) determine the factors contributing to these modifications. HypothesisA reduction in <b>radiographic</b> bone <b>density</b> has a negative influence on the functional result after revision using a cementless press-fit stem. Material and methodsWe retrospectively assessed 150 THA revisions at a mean follow-up of 6. 3 ± 3. 2  years (range, 2 – 15  years). The clinical assessment {{was based on the}} Harris Hip Score. Bone density modifications were measured radiographically and the method was evaluated. The change in bone density was classified into two groups: (1) bone density not reduced or< 2 Gruen zones (118 cases [79 %]); (2) bone density reduced≥ 2 zones (32 cases [21 %]). The variables showing a potential influence were the Cortical Index (CI), the type of primary stability with the press-fit system, and the femoral implant length. ResultsInter- and intraobserver reliability of <b>radiographic</b> bone <b>density</b> measurement was evaluated as moderate or good (Kappa, 0. 58; 0. 60 and 0. 67, respectively). For the Harris Hip Score at follow-up, there was a borderline statistical relation between stages 1 and 2 : for the 118 stage 1 patients, this score was 83. 62 ± 11. 54 (range, 27 – 99) versus 78. 34 ± 15. 98 (range, 62 – 91) for stage 2 patients (P= 0. 09). A CI≤ 0. 44 showed mediocre bone quality contributing to decreased bone density (P< 0. 02). On the other hand, there was no statistically significant relation with the type of primary fixation (P= 0. 34) or the length of the implant (P= 0. 23). ConclusionsA cementless revision femoral stem can induce a reduction in bone density with possible functional effects. The negative role played by bone scarcity on the functional score is confirmed, and even though the difference is not statistically significant, we suggest using a short stem when this is possible.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} soft-tissue simulation materials on dental and bone tissue <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities</b> using pixel intensity (PI) and digital subtraction radiography (DSR) analyses. Methods: 15 dry human mandibles were divided into halves. Each half was radiographed using a charge-coupled device sensor without a soft-tissue simulation material (Wm) and with 5 types of materials: acrylic (Ac), wax (Wx), water (Wt), wood (Wd) and frozen bovine tissue (Bt). Three thicknesses were tested for each material: 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm. The material was positioned {{in front of the}} mandible and the sensor parallel to the molar region. The radiation beam was perpendicular to the sensor at 30 cm focal spot-to-object distance. The digital images of the bone and dental tissue were captured for PI analyses. The subtracted images were marked with 14 landmark magnifications, and 2 areas of analyses were defined, forming the regions of interest. Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Dunn's post-test were used (p < 0. 05). Results: DSR showed that both the material type and the thickness tested influenced the gain of density in bone tissue (p < 0. 05). PI analyses of the bone region did not show these differences, except for the lower density observed in the image without soft-tissue simulation material. In the dental region, both DSR and PI showed that soft-tissue simulators did not influence the density in these regions. Conclusions: This study showed that the materials evaluated and their thicknesses significantly influenced the density-level gain in alveolar bone. In dental tissues, there was no density-level gain with any soft-tissue material tested...|$|R

In material science, x-rays {{can be used to}} identify the thickness of samples with different material densities. The current method is to collect a radiograph using estimated conditions, evaluate the results, then make changes to the conditions. The residual image can be rescanned making it possible to obtain an image of lower <b>radiographic</b> <b>density.</b> By tabulating or graphing the effects of energy changes and rescans, a more informed choice of conditions is possible. For this study, six materials were chosen with a material density ranging from 1. 74 - 16. 65 g/cc.

Methods We evaluated lung capillary protein permeability non-invasively with help of the 67 Ga-transferrin pulmonary leak index (PLI) technique and extravascular lung water (EVLW) by the transpulmonary thermal-dye dilution technique in consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients {{in the intensive care}} unit within 24 h of direct, blunt thoracic trauma (n = 5, 2 with ARDS), and within 12 h of indirect trauma by transhiatal oesophagectomy (n = 8), abdominal surgery for cancer (n = 6) and bone surgery (n = 4). We studied transfusion history, haemodynamics, oxygenation and mechanics of the lungs. The lung injury score (LIS, 0 – 4) was calculated. Plain radiography was also done to judge densities and atelectasis. Results The PLI and EVLW were elevated above normal in 61 and 30 % of patients, respectively, and the PLI directly related to the number of red cell concentrates given (r s = 0. 69, P s = 0. 55, P = 0. 007). Thoracic trauma patients had a worse oxygenation requiring higher airway pressures and thus higher LIS than the other patient groups, unrelated to PLI and EVLW but attributable to a higher cardiac output and thereby venous admixture. Finally, patients with radiographic signs of atelectasis had more impaired oxygenation and more densities than those without. Conclusion The oxygenation defect and <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities</b> in mechanically ventilated patients with pulmonary dysfunction and ALI/ARDS after trauma and surgery are likely caused by atelectasis rather than by increased permeability-oedema related to red cell transfusion. </p...|$|R

Totally, 27 biopsies were available for μ‐ CT analysis. In addition, CBCT was taken after positioning a previously fabricated acrylic resin template with a 2 ‐mm‐diameter metal rod at the randomly selected implant site to study <b>radiographic</b> bone <b>density</b> (RBD). The relationship between μ‐ CT and CBCT quantitative variable and RBD was analyzed using Spearman correlation.

40|$|Background: The characteristics, {{incidence}} and {{risk factors for}} acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may depend on definitions and geography. Methods: A prospective, 3 -day point-prevalence study was performed by a survey of all intensive care units (ICU) in the Netherlands (n = 96). Thirty-six ICU's responded (37 %), reporting on 266 patients, of whom 151 were mechanically ventilated. The questionnaire included criteria and potential risk factors for ALI/ARDS, according to the North American-European Consensus Conference (NAECC) or the lung injury score (LIS >= 2. 5). Results: Agreement between definitions was fair (kappa 0. 31 - 0. 42, P = 0. 001). ALI/ARDS was characterized, regardless of definition, by <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities,</b> low oxygenation ratios, high inspiratory O- 2 and airway pressure requirements. Depending on definitions, ALI and ARDS accounted for about 12 - 33 % and 7 - 9 % of ICU admissions per year, respectively, constituting 21 - 58 % (ALI) and 13 - 16 % (ARDS) of all mechanically ventilated patients. The annual incidences of ALI and ARDS are 29. 3 (95 %CI 18. 4 - 40. 1) and 24. 0 (95 %CI 14. 2 - 33. 8) by NAECC, respectively, and are, respectively, 83. 6 (95 %CI 65. 3 - 101. 9) and 20. 9 (95 %CI 11. 7 - 30. 1) by LIS per 100, 000. Risk factors for ALI/ARDS were aspiration, pneumonia, sepsis and chronic alcohol abuse (the latter only by NAECC). Conclusion: The effect of definitions of ALI/ARDS on mechanical ventilation in the Netherlands is small. Nevertheless, the incidence of ALI/ARDS may be higher than in other European countries but lower than in the USA, and the incidence of ALI by LIS may overestimate compared to that by NAECC. Aspiration, pneumonia, sepsis and chronic alcohol abuse are major risk factors, largely independent of definitions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This experimental study was carried out on 14 male Wistar rats. The rats were randomly divided into two groups. Group I rats were fed with a Zn-deficient (ZD) diet, and Group II rats with a Zn-containing (ZC) diet. All the rats on the experimental diet were killed at the end of the fourth week and their blood samples were taken. The serum Zn levels were measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Radiographic assessment of the jaw bone density was done at the end of the study. Subsequently, the final measurements were made on the dry skulls, the mandibles, and teeth in both the groups. Statistical evaluation was performed by the student′s t-test and repeated measures analysis. The difference between the groups was considered statistically significant if P < 0. 05. Results: The ZD group showed a significantly lower value in body weight (P < 0. 05), serum level of zinc (P < 0. 0001), and <b>radiographic</b> bone <b>density</b> of the mandible (P = 0. 02). With regard to the craniofacial parameters, a significant difference was observed only in the length of the clinical crowns of the teeth (L 13), which were longer in group II as compared to group I (P = 0. 03). Conclusion: This study confirmed that changes in zinc intake could not affect the growth of craniofacial structures. Also, it might change the <b>radiographic</b> bone <b>density</b> of the mandible...|$|R
40|$|Near-infrared spectroscopic {{tomography}} {{was used}} to measure the properties of 24 mammographically normal breasts to quantify whole-breast absorption and scattering spectra and to evaluate which tissue composition characteristics can be determined from these spectra. The absorption spectrum of breast tissue allows quantification of (i) total hemoglobin concentration, (ii) hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and (iii) water concentration, whereas the scattering spectrum provides information about the size and number density of cellular components and structural matrix elements. These property data were tested for correlation to demographic information, including subject age, body mass index, breast size, and <b>radiographic</b> <b>density.</b> Total hemoglobin concentration correlated inversely to body mass index, likely because lower body mass indicates proportionately less fat and more glandular tissue, and glandular tissue contains greater vascularity, hence, more total hemoglobin. Optical scattering was correlated to breast diameter, subject age, and <b>radiographic</b> <b>density.</b> In the <b>radiographic</b> <b>density,</b> fatty breasts had low scattering power and extremely dense breasts had higher values. This observation is consistent with low attenuation of conventional x-rays with fat and higher attenuation in glandular tissues. Optically, fatty tissues have large scatterers leading to a low scattering power, whereas glandular or fibrous tissues have more cellular and collagen-based structures that lead to high scattering power. The study presents correlative data supporting the hypothesis that optical measurements of absorption and scattering can provide physiologically relevant information about breast tissue composition. These breast constituents vary significantly between individuals and can be altered because of changes in breast physiology or pathological state...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} vertebral "end plate sclerosis" and neck pain. Design: A retrospective study was carried out of lateral cervical spine radiographs with a Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS). Patients: Two hundred patients' files were randomly assessed, comprising four equal groups, A to D. The mean ages of the patients were 62 ± 7. 4 years, 61 ± 7. 5 years, 40 ± 5. 6 years and 23 ± 5. 6 years respectively. In group A, all patients had symptoms of neck pain and a radiographic diagnosis of "end plate sclerosis" of the cervical spine. In groups B to D, asymptomatic patients were recruited and their age groups were 50 - 69, 30 - 49 and 10 - 29 years respectively. Using the PACS, the <b>radiographic</b> <b>density</b> and the sagittal diameter, thickness and area of the end plates at the C 5 level were measured. Results and conclusions: No {{significant differences were found}} in the <b>radiographic</b> <b>density</b> of the end plates either between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (groups A and B), or between different age groups (groups B, C and D). A significant increase in end plate area and thickness was found, however, in both group B (P< 0. 005) and group C (P< 0. 01) in comparison with group D. This indicates that the extent of end plate sclerosis increases with age. Our results suggest that the <b>radiographic</b> <b>density</b> of cervical vertebral end plates correlates neither with neck pain nor with increasing age. The radiological sign of "end plate sclerosis" may be over-reported, further limiting its value in the assessment of patients with cervical spondylosis. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} develop and test a tool for low bone mass pre-screening by {{combining}} periapical radiographs with clinical risk factors. Methods: The study sample consisted of 60 post-menopausal women over 40 years of age who were referred for dental radiographs. These patients also had their bone mineral density measured at the lumbar spine and proximal femur using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. <b>Radiographic</b> <b>density</b> measurements and 14 morphological features were obtained from each dental radiograph using digital image processing software. The clinical variables considered were age and bone mass index. Classification and regression tree analysis (CART) {{was used to test}} the predictive power of clinical and radiographic risk factors for classifying individuals. Results: CART indicated that the most important variables for classifying patients were age, number of terminal points/periphery, periphery/trabecular area, <b>radiographic</b> <b>density</b> and bone mass index. Conclusion: A combination of clinical and radiographic factors can be used to identify individuals with low bone mineral density, with higher accuracy than any one of these factors taken individually...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe characteristics, {{incidence}} and {{risk factors for}} acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may depend on definitions and geography. MethodsA prospective, 3 -day point-prevalence study was performed by a survey of all intensive care units (ICU) in the Netherlands (n= 96). Thirty-six ICU's responded (37 %), reporting on 266 patients, of whom 151 were mechanically ventilated. The questionnaire included criteria and potential risk factors for ALI/ARDS, according to the North American–European Consensus Conference (NAECC) or the lung injury score (LIS⩾ 2. 5). ResultsAgreement between definitions was fair (κ 0. 31 – 0. 42, P= 0. 001). ALI/ARDS was characterized, regardless of definition, by <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities,</b> low oxygenation ratios, high inspiratory O 2 and airway pressure requirements. Depending on definitions, ALI and ARDS accounted for about 12 – 33 % and 7 – 9 % of ICU admissions per year, respectively, constituting 21 – 58 % (ALI) and 13 – 16 % (ARDS) of all mechanically ventilated patients. The annual incidences of ALI and ARDS are 29. 3 (95 %CI 18. 4 – 40. 1) and 24. 0 (95 %CI 14. 2 – 33. 8) by NAECC, respectively, and are, respectively, 83. 6 (95 %CI 65. 3 – 101. 9) and 20. 9 (95 %CI 11. 7 – 30. 1) by LIS per 100, 000. Risk factors for ALI/ARDS were aspiration, pneumonia, sepsis and chronic alcohol abuse (the latter only by NAECC). ConclusionThe effect of definitions of ALI/ARDS on mechanical ventilation in the Netherlands is small. Nevertheless, the incidence of ALI/ARDS may be higher than in other European countries but lower than in the USA, and the incidence of ALI by LIS may overestimate compared to that by NAECC. Aspiration, pneumonia, sepsis and chronic alcohol abuse are major risk factors, largely independent of definitions...|$|R
40|$|Bacgroun/Aim. The {{radiopacity}} of an endodontic {{material can}} considerably vary as measured on film and a digital sensor. Digital radiography offers numerous advantages over convential film-based radiography in dental clinical practice regarding both diagnostic capabilities and postintervention procedures. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the capacity of conventional and charge-conpled device (CCD) based digital radiography to detect material on radiograph depending on the radio-pacifying agent present in the material. Methods. Experimental cements were formulated by mixing Portland cement with the following radiopacifying agents: zinc oxide (ZnO), zirconium oxide (ZrO 2), titanium dioxide (TiO 2), barium sulphate (BaSO 4), iodoform (CHI 3), bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3) and ytterbium trifluoride (YbF 3). In addition, 5 endodontic materials comprising Endomethasone®, Diaket®, N 2 ®, Roth 801 ® and Acroseal® were investigated to serve as control. Per three specimens of each material were radiographed alongside an aluminum step wedge on film (Eastman Kodak Company®, Rochester, NY) and a CCD-based digital sensor (Trophy Radiologie®, Cedex, France). Radiopacity values were calculated by converting the <b>radiographic</b> <b>densities</b> of the specimens expressed as a mean optical densities or mean grey scale values into equivalent thickness of aluminum. Results. Twoway ANOVA detected no significant differences with respect to the imaging system (p > 0. 05), but the differences were significant with respect to radiopacifier (p < 0. 001) and the interaction of the two factors (p < 0. 05). Paired ttest revealed significant differences between the methods used for pure Portland cement, all concentrations of BaSO 4 and CHI 3, 10 % and 20 % additions of ZrO 2 and Bi 2 O 3 and 10 % and 30 % addition of YbF 3 (p < 0. 05). Conclusion. The materials which incorporate CHI 3 or BaSO 4 as radiopacifying agents are expected to be significantly more radiopaque on a digital sensor than on film. During clinical practice one should concern to the quality of contrast assessement obtained by digital according to conventional radiography. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the outcomes of autogenous bone graft (AB) and bioglass (BG) associated or not with leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma (LP-PRP) in the rabbit maxillary sinus (MS) by histomorphometric and radiographic analysis. Twenty rabbits divided into 2 groups (G 1, G 2) were submitted to sinus lift surgery. In G 1, 10 MS were grafted with AB and 10 MS were grafted with BG. In G 2, 10 MS were grafted with AB + LP-PRP and 10 MS were grafted with BG + LP-PRP. After 90 days, the animals were killed and specimens were obtained, x-rayed, and submitted to histomorphometric, <b>radiographic</b> bone <b>density</b> (RD) and fractal dimension analysis. <b>Radiographic</b> bone <b>density</b> mean values (SD), expressed as aluminum equivalent in mm, of AB, BG, AB + LP-PRP, and BG + LP-PRP groups were 1. 79 (0. 31), 2. 04 (0. 39), 1. 61 (0. 28), and 1. 53 (0. 30), respectively. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) were observed between BG and AB, and BG + PRP and BG. Fractal dimension mean values were 1. 48 (0. 04), 1. 35 (0. 08), 1. 44 (0. 04), and 1. 44 (0. 06), respectively. Significant differences were observed between BG and AB, and AB + LP-PRP and BG. Mean values for the percentage of bone inside MS were 63. 30 (8. 60), 52. 65 (10. 41), 55. 25 (7. 01), and 51. 07 (10. 25), respectively. No differences were found. No correlations were observed among percentage of bone, RD and FD. Histological analysis showed that MS treated with AB presented mature and new bone formation. The other groups showed minor bone formation. Within the limitations of this study, the results indicated that at a 90 -day time end point, AB yielded better results than AB + LP-PRP, BG, and BG + LP-PRP and should be considered the primary material for MS augmentation...|$|R
