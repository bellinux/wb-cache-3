30|$|Concrete is {{the most}} common {{building}} material used globally. The important processes of concrete production, such as materials mixing, pumping, transportation, injection, pouring, moulding and compaction, are based on the <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> the materials. It is known that the <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> cement paste has a strong impact on the properties of the concrete (Ferraris 1999). Various terms like flowability, mobility, workability and pumpability have been used to explain the <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> concrete (Tattersall et al. 1983). However, it is generally agreed to define <b>rheology</b> in terms <b>of</b> yield stress and plastic viscosity (Banfill 2006). Various theoretical and empirical models have been developed to determine yield stress and plastic viscosity, however, these values are greatly dependent on model assumptions, rheometer specifications and accuracy of experimental data.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of improved technology of the preparation of coal-water slurries that have potential for replacing fuel oil in direct combustion. Research accomplishments are summarized for: standardization of experimental procedures; investigation of effect of high-pressure roll mill/ball mill grinding on the energetics of fine grinding and the <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> coal-water slurries prepared with such fines; study of aging behavior of slurries; and ways <b>of</b> improving <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> slurries. The rheological behavior of slurries is a manifestation of particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions in the slurry. Improvement in the <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> slurries could be brought about by suitably altering these interactions. The research directed towards investigation of the influence of co-addition of sodium hexametaphosphate and vacuum oil, with CoalMaster as the primary dispersant, showed that co-addition of the reagents significantly improved the <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> coal-water slurries. Further research conducted in this quarter indicated that co-addition of reagents also improves the long-term rheological behavior of coal-water slurries...|$|R

40|$|The <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> {{suspensions}} of Brownian, or colloidal, particles (diameter d ≲ 1 μm) differs markedly {{from that}} of larger grains (d ≳ 50 μm). Each of these two regimes has been separately studied, but the flow of suspensions with intermediate particle sizes (1 μm≲ d ≲ 50 μm), which occur ubiquitously in applications, remains poorly understood. By measuring the <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> suspensions of hard spheres {{with a wide range}} of sizes, we show experimentally that shear thickening drives the transition from colloidal to granular flow across the intermediate size regime. This insight makes possible a unified description <b>of</b> the (non-inertial) <b>rheology</b> <b>of</b> hard spheres over the full size spectrum. Moreover, we are able to test a new theory of friction-induced shear thickening, showing that our data can be well fitted using expressions derived from it. Comment: 5 page...|$|R

The bioreactor should provide optimum conditions, with respect to temperature, pH and substrate condition, for example, besides its basic function of containment.
