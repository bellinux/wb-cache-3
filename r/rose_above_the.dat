5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{tears of}} the Eye of Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the morning star, the Eye can also be equated with the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, {{at the start of the}} Egyptian year, Sothis' heliacal rising, in which the star <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> horizon just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, the Eye of Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{chose to}} follow an army career, passing his {{entrance}} exams to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in September 1901 and representing the Royal Military Academy at both football and rugby {{as well as}} cricket, scoring a century in a match against the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the British Army the following year, being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 21 December 1904. Despite the limitations on his sport that the military service caused, he played several matches for Old Cliftonians, his regiment, and the army, remaining a free-hitting batsman. He played at Lord's in 1913 for Royal Engineers Cricket Club against Royal Artillery Cricket Club, scoring 58 and 36 runs in the two innings, but he never played first-class cricket. He also joined Clifton Rugby Football Club in February 1905, but never <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> 2nd XV. He served with the 2nd Sappers and Miners in India, and was promoted to lieutenant on 23 June 1907.|$|E

5|$|The first {{church was}} {{markedly}} cruciform {{in shape and}} smaller than the present floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> crossing {{between the north and}} south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the clerestory windows on top of it are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. This wall has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall {{of the city that}} was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. He claims that the water <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There was an old statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E

25|$|The heavy oak vessel {{had been}} hauled {{from the river}} {{up the hill and}} lowered into a {{prepared}} trench, so only the tops of the stem and stern posts <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> land surface. After the addition of the body and the artefacts, an oval mound was constructed, which covered the ship and <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> horizon at the riverward side of the cemetery. The view to the river is now obscured by Top Hat Wood, but the mound would have been a visible symbol of power to those using the waterway. This appears to have been the final occasion upon which the Sutton Hoo cemetery was used for its original purpose.|$|E
25|$|Surtsey, {{one of the}} {{youngest}} islands in the world, is part of Iceland.

25|$|To the {{southwest}} of the Kesava temple is a small temple to Somyanayaki (form of the goddess Lakshmi), also dated to the 12th century. However, the temple was expanded and enhanced later.

25|$|Ascension is a geologically young formation, {{the tip of}} an undersea volcano which <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> waves only {{a million}} years ago. It is {{associated}} both with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge plate boundary 80km {{to the west and}} with a hotspot 25–300km to the south east. Its last eruption may have occurred in the sixteenth century. Due to its short above-water history, its soil consists mostly of clinker.|$|E
25|$|The stars within Crux {{were known}} to the Ancient Greeks, where Ptolemy {{regarded}} {{them as part of}} the constellation Centaurus. They were entirely visible as far north as Britain in the fourth millennium BC. However, the precession of the equinoxes gradually lowered the stars below the European horizon, and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes. By AD 400, most of the stars in the constellation we now call Crux never <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> horizon for Athenians.|$|E

25|$|On 16 March {{power plant}} staff were briefly {{evacuated}} after smoke <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> plant and radiation levels {{measured at the}} gate increased to 10mSv/h. Media reported 1,000mSv/h close to the leaking reactor, with radiation levels subsequently dropping back to 800–600mSv. Japan's defence ministry criticized the nuclear-safety agency and TEPCO after some of its troops were possibly exposed to radiation when working on the site. Japan's ministry of science (MEXT) measured radiation levels of up to 0.33mSv/h 20kilometers northwest of the power plant. Japan's Nuclear Safety Commission recommended local authorities to instruct evacuees leaving the 20-kilometre area to ingest stable (not radioactive) iodine.|$|E

Father Patrick Keegans, Lockerbie's Roman Catholic priest, was preparing to visit his neighbours Dora and Maurice Henry at approximately 7 pm that evening, after the aircraft wing destroyed their home; there was nothing left of their bodies to bury. Keegans' house at 1 Sherwood Crescent was the only one on the street that was neither destroyed by the impact nor gutted by fire.|$|E
25|$|After fatally {{shooting}} Bernall, Harris {{turned toward}} the next table, where Bree Pasquale sat next to the table rather than under it. Harris asked Pasquale {{if she wanted to}} die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Witnesses later reported that Harris seemed disoriented—possibly from the heavily bleeding wound to his nose. As Harris taunted Pasquale, Klebold noted Ireland trying to provide aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> table; Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious, but survived.|$|E

25|$|His son, Jean Antoine, {{grandfather}} of Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, served with distinction {{through all the}} later campaigns {{of the reign of}} Louis XIV. At the Battle of Cassano (1705), he suffered a neck wound so severe that he had to wear a silver stock ever after. Because he tended to be blunt and tactless, he never <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> rank of colonel. On retiring from the service, he married Françoise de Castellane with whom he had three sons: Victor (marquis de Mirabeau), Jean Antoine (bailli de Mirabeau) and Louis Alexandre (comte de Mirabeau). Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, was the son of Victor.|$|E
25|$|The tallest {{bridge was}} the Pont du Gard, which carried water across the Gard river to Nîmes, {{southern}} France. The 270m long aqueduct bridge {{was constructed in}} three tiers which measure successively 20.5m, 19.5m and 7.4m, adding up to a total height of 47.4m above the water-level. When crossing deeper valleys, Roman hydraulic engineers preferred inverted siphons over bridges for reasons of relative economics; this {{is evident in the}} Gier aqueduct where seven out of nine siphons exceed the 45m mark, reaching depths up to 123m. The tallest road bridges were the monumental Alcántara Bridge, Spain, and the bridge at Narni, Italy, which <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> stream-level c. 42m and 30m, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Described as “a strange person full of acerbity against {{everything}} and every one”, Pigasov frequently visits Dar’ya Mikhailovna prior to Rudin’s appearance and amuses {{her with his}} bitter remarks, mostly aimed at women. Coming from a poor family, he educated himself, but never <b>rose</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> level of mediocrity. He failed his examination in public disputation, in government service {{he made a mistake}} which forced him to retire. His wife later left him and sold her estate, on which he just finished building a house, to a speculator. Since then he lived in the province. He is the first victim of Rudin’s eloquence, as at Rudin’s first appearance he challenged him to a debate and was defeated easily. He ends up living with Lezhnev and Aleksandra Pavlovna.|$|E
