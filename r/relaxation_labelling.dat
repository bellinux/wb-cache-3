40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{training}} <b>relaxation</b> <b>labeling</b> processes, a popular class of parallel iterative procedures widely employed in pattern recognition and computer vision. The approach discussed here is based on a theory of consistency developed by Hummel and Zucker, and contrasts with a recently introduced learning strategy which can be regarded as heteroassociative, i. e., what is actually learned is the association between patterns rather than the patterns themselves. The proposed learning model is instead autoassociative and involves making a set of training patterns consistent, in the sense rigorously defined by Hummel and Zucker; this implies that they become local attractors of the <b>relaxation</b> <b>labeling</b> dynamical system. The learning problem is formulated in terms of solving a system of linear inequalities, and a straightforward iterative algorithm is presented to accomplish this.

40|$|<b>Relaxation</b> <b>labelling</b> is a {{mathematical}} technique frequently applied in image processing algorithms. In particular, it is extensively {{used for the}} purpose of segmenting images. The paper presents a hardware implementation of a segmentation algorithm, for images consisting of two regions, based on <b>relaxation</b> <b>labelling.</b> The algorithm determines, for each pixel, the probability that it should be labelled as belonging to a particular region, for all regions in the image. The label probabilities (labellings) of every pixel are iteratively updated, based on those of the pixel's neighbors, until they converge. The pixel is then assigned to the region correspondent to the maximum label probability. The system consists of a control unit and of a pipeline of segmentation stages. Each segmentation stage emulates in the hardware an iteration of the relaxation algorithm. The design of the segmentation stage is based on commercially available digital signal processing integrated circuits. Multiple iterations are accomplished by stringing stages together or by looping the output of a stage, or string of stages, to its input. The system interfaces with a generic host computer. Given the modularity of the architecture, performance can be enhanced by merely adding segmentation stages...|$|E
