Anyone can file a notice <b>of</b> <b>lien</b> against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another under the Uniform Commercial Code and other laws. In most states of the United States, the validity <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> is not investigated or inquired into at the time of filing. Notices <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's credit rating, ability to obtain home equity loans, refinance the property or take other action with regards to the property. Notices <b>of</b> releases <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> generally must be filed before property may be transferred. The validity <b>of</b> a <b>lien</b> is determined by further legal procedures.
