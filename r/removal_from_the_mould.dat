40|$|Blow {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important polymer processing method for producing plastic automotive parts. Yet, there are still several problems that affect the overall success of forming these parts. Among them, are thermally induced stresses, relevant shrinkage and part warpage caused by inappropriate solidification conditions. This work presents a finite element model that allows for predicting residual stresses and subsequent deformations that arise during the cooling stage of finished parts. It is expected that the virtual presence of the flash zone has an influence on the development of residual stresses in the numerical model. Deflashing is usually performed immediately after part <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould,</b> therefore, the numerical model is adapted to take this into account. Numerical results obtained with and without flash for a simple part, as well as a complex automotive part, are compared to determine accuracy and limitations of the model.

40|$|TiAl {{intermetallic}} compound-based {{materials and}} components are made from a mixture of powders of titanium, aluminium and alloying additions or aluminium alloys by cold isostatic pressing and forming to the desired semi-finished product or component geometry. The component is heated to above the melting point of aluminium or the aluminium alloy in a confining mould and, after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould,</b> is finally sintered to complete phase formation while avoiding expansion of the consolidated material. USE - As a lightweight structural material in aerospace and automobile applications, e. g. vehicle engine valves and turbine engines. ADVANTAGE - The method allows production of the component in its finished form by pressureless reaction sintering {{without the need for}} expensive conventional encapsulation and hot isostatic pressing. The mould sintering operation is carried out at a temperature which avoids reaction between the material and the mould, thus permitting reuse of the mould. The pr oduct has a fine grain structure without the need for high temperature forming and has the desired geometry achieved using conventional semi-finished product forming processes...|$|E
30|$|As for {{the surface}} treatment, the TR soles {{chemical}} treatment {{is applied to}} the substrate to provide uniformity, allowing and increasing the cohesive strength of the adhesive joint [6]. This treatment allows the chemically modification of the surface to be bonded. In the footwear industry, the most commonly used chemical treatment is via halogenated substances. During production, PU soles are coated with a release agent to facilitate its <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> and the footwear industry uses more than one treatment, starting with mechanical carding which is followed by application of a primer. On the leather based uppers, mechanical treatment is applied followed by the application of a primer. This treatment creates mechanical roughening on the substrate surface by increasing the contact area and therefore increasing the number of possible linkages in the interface between the adhesive and the substrate. In the footwear industry, the mechanical treatment is the most widely used, with the carding performed using the sandpaper [6]. The primer also works as a surface pre-treatment and consists in a polymer solution in organic solvents. This composition is related with the adhesive, but with low viscosity, forming a thin layer on the substrate. The primer, when dry, provides a very strong bond with the adhesive, requiring compatibility of the primer with the adhesive [6]. In the footwear industry, various methods are used depending on the application operation. In the case of bonding upper/sole, the method of application by brush is used.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} processes and a device for flexibly and automatically deburring and removing from moulds injection moulded workpieces seated on cores and for cleaning injection moulding tool cores and moulds, said device {{being used in}} a variety of different ways and being adaptable in a simple manner to various injection moulding tools of a variety of shapes. At least partly standardized tool units are used for adapting them to the production of various tool geometries, core clearances and similar by simply modifying the spatial arrangement of individual modular tool components to the tool units, whereby the sprue is first cut off and the front-end and longitudinal burr on <b>the</b> <b>moulded</b> workpieces are removed by translational and/or rotational movement from inside a first tool unit using grouped cutting tools, followed by <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moulds</b> of <b>mould</b> <b>removal</b> supports provided with an integrated burst protection by second tool unit whereby the burst protection is pushed o ver the workpiece before <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> removal supports, and after extraction of the workpiece or workpieces <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> tools, they are cleaned by a third tool unit which has a roller arrangement movable in the radial and axial directions...|$|R

40|$|Water {{contributes}} to the setting reaction of self-adhesive luting cements, however, it can also accelerate their degradation. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare a self-adhesive resin luting cement to other resin-based and glass-ionomer luting materials with regards to water sorption (WS) and solubility (WSB). The tested null hypothesis was that there is no difference in respect to these properties among the materials. Material and methods: Eight specimens from each group (15 mm x 0. 5 mm) were prepared from self-adhesive luting cements Biscem (BC) and RelyX Unicem (R), dual-cure cements Bifix (BF), Allcem (A) and Enforce (E), chemical-cure cements C&B (CB) and Cement Post (CP) and a glass-ionomer luting cement Meron C (M) as the control group. The dual-cure products were light-cured beneath an IPS Empress Esthetic ceramic disk (20 mm x 1. 5 mm) and for the chemical reaction materials, a 15 min-interval was respected for <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould.</b> The WS and WSB were respectively calculated as (m 2 -m 3 /V) and (m 1 -m 3 /V). Mass values of m 1, m 2 and m 3 were determined by cycles of desiccation, water-immersion and a new desiccation. For each property, the data was analyzed by one-criteria ANOVA and Tukey tests (p < 0. 05). Results: The glass-ionomer cement presented the highest WS, followed by the self-adhesive luting cements. Other resin cements were less susceptible to WS. No materials differed from each other when the WSB was considered, except for the M, which presented the lowest WSB. Conclusions: Self-adhesive luting cements were more prone to WS since water is essential to their setting reaction. However, their WSB was similar to the other resin-based cements...|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of thermal NIL {{presented}} here, holes are pre-patterned in a triangular array {{on the surface of}} a thin aluminium layer deposited on a P+ conductive Si wafer. As described in Figure  1 c, a thermoplastic resin (NEB 22 from Sumitomo Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) is coated on an aluminium layer. A silicon mould, treated with an anti-sticking layer [31] and presenting a triangular array of pits, is then pressed on the sample in an EVG 520 hot embossing tool (EV Group, St. Florian an Inn, Austria) at 0.2 kN.cm− 2 and 125 °C. Mould patterns are reproduced in the polymer since the applied temperature is higher than the resin's glass transition temperature. After <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> at room temperature, the pattern is transferred into the surface of the Al layer using a conventional plasma dry etching technique. In a Centura 5200 reactive ion etching chamber (Applied Materials, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a Cl 2 /Ar/O 2 plasma is used to remove the residual resin layer and a Cl 2 /BCl 3 plasma is used for etching the Al surface. The final structure consists of a 2 × 2 -cm 2 surface of aluminium structured with holes of few nanometres depth in a triangular array of different periods according to the initial mould design. During the anodization, these holes will act as surface defects, initiating the pore growth as described in Figure  1 a. The layer is so directly anodized at the voltage corresponding to the period given by the NIL and according to Equation 1. Samples are anodized in a home-made cell under a constant voltage, in an orthophosphoric or oxalic acid bath at constant temperature (T = 8 °C). The electrolyte is stirred during the process of anodization to facilitate the flow of the species in the electrolyte and to remove the bubbles of H 2 gas from the platinum electrode. A Parstat 2273 potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) is used to apply a constant voltage and to follow the I-V curve in situ between a platinum circular electrode and the sample. In order to obtain defect-free triangular arrays of pores, the voltage has to be adjusted so that the natural period of the porous alumina corresponds to the NIL-fabricated guiding pattern. The anodizing time does not differ significantly from the classical anodization time of a simple anodization: with 3 % oxalic acid under 40 V at 8 °C, simple anodization of 1 μm of Al takes 1, 750 s and anodization after nanoimprint lasts 1, 700 s. Furthermore, under these experimental conditions, the ratio between the thickness of Al layer deposited and the final thickness of highly organised alumina is evaluated at 1.25. Figure  1 b shows an array of 2 × 2 cm 2 of highly organised porous alumina.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway.

5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> immediately after <b>the</b> parts are created, {{as well as}} applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free <b>the</b> part <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould.</b> It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|R
