40|$|Incidents {{can affect}} the flow in non?incident {{direction}} due to <b>rubbernecking.</b> To this date, only homogeneous <b>rubbernecking</b> behaviour has been assessed. This study provides insights into inter?driver heterogeneity in <b>rubbernecking</b> behaviour while passing an incident site. We use empirical trajectory data obtained from a helicopter?mounted video camera. The length of study section is approximately 220 meters, starting at 125 meters upstream of the incident site. Results show that the variations in speed in the upstream of incident location are substantially higher within passenger car drivers then within the truck drivers. The passenger cars in the median lane reduce the speed further upstream, mostly with sharp deceleration while passenger cars in the shoulder lane reduce the speed closer to the incident scene. Some drivers did not exhibit <b>rubbernecking</b> behavior, passing the incident with a steady speed. The results provide {{a better understanding of}} <b>rubbernecking</b> behaviour and can be used to establish determinant factors to measure the <b>rubbernecking</b> effects.

40|$|<b>Rubbernecking</b> is {{an ongoing}} project that started in 2003, since when I have been visiting sites {{represented}} in the daily newspapers. It takes its title from the American term ‘Rubbernecking’, slang that describes the phenomenon – often associated with car crashes or breakdowns on motorways – where people slow down, crane the neck and strain to look. <b>Rubbernecking</b> proposes a way of looking that is curious and feminine unlike the detached gaze of the male flaneur. <b>Rubbernecking</b> uses information in the public realm (i. e. a news story) as the impetus to travel to different places. The chosen events vary, not always representing sensational or traumatic occurrences. In the <b>Rubbernecking</b> project there is a lag between the event, the reporting of that event, reading {{about it in the}} news and {{the time it takes to}} travel to the site. If journalism might be perceived (in part) as the attempt to make us feel close to, or synchronous with an event while remaining objective, <b>Rubbernecking</b> does the opposite; it imposes time and distance between the news-story and place where the newspaper is being read while also acknowledging the subject position of the reader. The project currently takes the form of a series of small publications of various sizes and formats. Each publication presents a different way of analysing the news; in Rolling Riga I followed a news-cycle, walking round Riga for 24 hours waiting for the next edition to appear on the streets, in The Shanghai Week I selected a different news-story everyday for seven days. In Le Notti Di Roma I only visited sites of occurrences that happened at night, while ISIS represents a single event (students jumping off of Magdalen Bridge on May Day 2005) that was reported in every national newspaper on a single day...|$|R

5000|$|The term {{is often}} used to refer to the {{activity}} of motorists slowing down in order to see something {{on the other side of}} a road or highway, often the scene of a traffic accident. A study on the English M6 motorway found that 29% of accidents and breakdowns caused slowdowns in the uninvolved opposite lanes. According to a 2003 study in the U.S., <b>rubbernecking</b> was the cause of 16% of distraction-related traffic accidents. <b>Rubbernecking</b> appears in the book 100 Most Dangerous Things in Everyday Life and What You Can Do About Them, which advises that the safest course when there are flashing lights and an accident is to keep moving, as [...] "there is nothing to see here". Rubbernecking's impact on traffic has been the subject of studies and is said to be factored into highway design.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a behavioral car-following model based on empirical trajectory data that {{is able to}} reproduce the spontaneous formation and ensuing propagation of stop-and-go waves in congested traffic. By analyzing individual drivers’ car-following behavior throughout oscillation cycles {{it is found that}} this behavior is consistent across drivers and can be captured by a simple model. The statistical analysis of the model’s parameters reveals that there is a strong correlation between driver behavior before and during the oscillation, and that this correlation should not be ignored if one is interested in microscopic output. If macroscopic outputs are of interest, simulation results indicate that an existing model with fewer parameters can be used instead. This is shown for traffic oscillations caused by <b>rubbernecking</b> as observed in the US 101 NGSIM dataset. The same experiment is used to establish the relationship between <b>rubbernecking</b> behavior and the period of oscillations...|$|R
