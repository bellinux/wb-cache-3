50|$|The {{choice of}} {{footwear}} {{can change the}} impact of prolonged standing. Shoes should support the foot, have shock-absorbing cushions, fit the foot well, and be comfortable. Shoes should not be flat, have heels higher than 5 cm, or change {{the shape of the}} foot. There are also special insoles for shoes that can be used when soft mats or chairs are not available. Additionally the floors in a work area should not be metal or concrete. It is best to have cork or <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> <b>floors.</b> Floors should not be slippery.|$|R
40|$|We wish to {{estimate}} the pressure distribution on the <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller from the experimental curve using the same apparatus {{as described in the}} paper I in the range of surface speed 39 - 360 cm/sec and roller weights 8. 2 - 36. 3 kg. 　We assume pressure distribution curve to be quadratic, sine and cubic curves on <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller and then calculate the out-put voltage from the block diagram of this apparatus. 　From the comparing of the result of experimental curve with calculated one, we assure three phenomena. 　(1) When the softer <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller rotates at the low speed under the high pressure, the pressure distribution curve becomes a quadratic one. 　(2) When the soft <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller rotates at the low speed, it becomes a sine one. 　(3) When the <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller rotates at the high speed, it transferes to the asymmetric distribution from a symmetric one...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{quantify}} the odor and gas emission benefits of a fine ground <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> on laboratory scale manure storage units and to evaluate {{the ability of a}} fine ground <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> applied to a commercial swine manure storage unit to remain intact and functional {{over an extended period of}} time. A three-inch cover of fine ground rubber reduced odors by 77 to 99 percent from the manure storage tanks over a six-week period. However, consistent reductions of NH 3 emissions were not observed and H 2 S emissions from all manure storage treatments were below detectable limits. Assessments of the integrity of the fine ground <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> were promising for storage units in both the laboratory and field-scale trials...|$|R
50|$|The Type 4 grenade had a {{fragmentation}} body made of {{terra cotta}} or porcelain materials.

The other end of the fuse, which was outside the <b>rubber</b> plug, was <b>covered</b> with a match-head composition. A slip-on <b>rubber</b> cap <b>covered</b> the whole neck, and fuse. A small, loose wooden block with an abrasive composition on one side was contained in the <b>rubber</b> fuse <b>cover.</b>|$|R
