40|$|Theoretical {{predictions}} for generic multi-scale observables in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) typically suffer from large Sudakov logarithms {{associated with the}} emission of soft or collinear radiation, whose presence spoils the perturbative expansion in the coupling strength which underlies most calculations in QCD. A canonical way to improve predictions wherever these logarithms appear is to resum them to all perturbative orders, which can conveniently be achieved using Effective Field Theory (EFT) methods. In an age of increasing automation using computers, this task is still mostly performed manually, observable-by-observable. In this thesis we identify the 2 -loop soft function as a crucial ingredient for the resummation of QCD Sudakov logarithms to Next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy in Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), for wide classes of observables involving two massless colour-charged energetic particles, such as dijet event shapes at lepton colliders, or colour singlet production at hadron colliders. We develop a method to evaluate these soft functions using numerical methods based on sector decomposition and {{the choice of a}} convenient parametrisation for the phase space. This allows the factorisation of all implicit (real emission) and explicit (virtual correction) divergences made manifest by dimensional and analytic regularisation. The <b>regulator</b> <b>pole</b> coefficients can then be evaluated numerically following a subtraction and expansion, and two computational tools are presented to perform these numerical integrations, one based on publicly available tools, the other based on our own code. Some technical improvements over naive straightforward numerical evaluation are demonstrated and implemented. This allows us to compute and verify two of three colour structures of the 2 -loop bare soft functions for wide ranges of observables with a factorisation theorem. A number of example results - both new and already known - are shown to demonstrate the reach of this approach, and a few possible extensions are sketched. This thesis therefore represents a crucial step towards automation of resummation for generic observables to NNLL accuracy in SCET. </p...|$|E
40|$|Most of the Low Dropout Regulators (LDRs) {{have limited}} {{operation}} {{range of load}} current due to their stability problem. This paper proposes a new frequency compensation scheme for LDR to optimize the regulator performance over a wide load current range. By introducing a tracking zero to cancel out the <b>regulator</b> output <b>pole,</b> the frequency response of the feedback loop becomes load current independent. The open-loop DC gain is boosted up by a low frequency dominant pole, which increases the regulator accuracy. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, a LDR utilizing the new frequency compensation scheme is designed and fabricated using TSMC 0. 35 mum digital CMOS process. Simulation results show that with output current from 0 muA to 100 mA the bandwidth variation is only 2. 3 times and the minimum DC gain is 72 dB. Measurement of the dynamic response matches well with simulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the modelling {{and the control}} strategies based on the states feedback control of an Electrical Vehicle (EV). The Electromechanical behaviour of studied system is modelled by using the states representation deduced from the electrical and dynamical laws. Two kinds of methods are {{used to determine the}} values of control's parameters, first one is the states feedback <b>regulator</b> using <b>pole</b> placement, and the second one is the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The Pole-placement design allows determining the values of the controller's parameters by the displacement of the poles to specified locations according to the zeros of a desired polynomial, whereas the values of feedback vector gains are obtained by resolving the Ricatti equation in LQR method. Finally, the simulation of the proposed controller was carried out for the European, the American and the stander driving cycles as the EV speed references in order to validate its robustness and its dynamical performances...|$|R

By carrying out numerous experiments on the cart <b>pole</b> <b>regulator</b> benchmark we aim to provide a useful baseline for future research on parameterized policy search algorithms.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to present a}} modeling and control of a single-track car model for active steering vehicle system. The sliding mode control strategy will be utilized to overcome various coefficients of road frictions and external disturbances on the system. In order to compensate the disturbances, side slip angles and yaw rate of the vehicle will be observed. The model presented take into account different friction of road coefficients of the system. From the mathematical derivation {{it is found that}} the system has fulfilled a matching condition. Extensive computer simulations are performed for various types of disturbances such as crosswind and braking torque. From the simulation results the effect of disturbance attenuation will be observed. The performance of the proposed controller will be compared to the linear quadratic <b>regulator</b> and <b>pole</b> placement techniques. The results showed that the sliding mode control scheme is effectively in attenuating various disturbances for different road coefficients as compared to the LQR and pole placement control schemes. Furthermore, the simulation results also showed that the system is insensitive to the external disturbances and capable to overcome â€˜late actionâ€™ by the driver due to sudden disturbance on any road conditions...|$|R

The {{effectiveness of the}} algorithm is illustrated by an example. Key words: Linear quadratic <b>regulator,</b> output feedback, <b>pole</b> assignment, optimal control. 2 1. Introduction Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) theory is no doubt {{one of the most}} fundamental control system design methods (Anderson and Moore, 1989). There are many attractive features of the LQR problem. For example, under certain stabilizability and detectability conditions, the resulting closed-loop system is not only asymptotically stable, but it also possesses infinite gain and at least a 60 degree phase margin, which implies that it has good sensitivity and robustness properties (Kalman 1964, Safonov and Athans 1977). Another important problem in control theory and practice is the design of a feedback law that places the closed-loop poles at desired location [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Pole {{placement}} is {{a control}} method assigned to arbitrary closed loop poles by state or output feedback. In linear systems, poles have influence on stability, system response, and transient {{response of the}} system. The applications of pole placement technique in power system operation and control have been found a significant place over the years. This paper presents salient features of pole placement technique {{in the design of}} controllers in power systems. Following this, as an application the AGC regulators are designed for a two area interconnected power system and their feasibility is tested by implementing these regulators in the wake of 1 % load disturbance in one of the areas. The dynamic performance achieved with the designed AGC regulators is compared with that obtained with optimal AGC regulator designs based on full state vector feedback control concept. The investigations of the results achieved demonstrate the superiority of AGC <b>regulators</b> designed using <b>pole</b> placement technique over the optimal AGC regulators in all aspects of system dynamic response characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{investigation}} of multibody system modelling and control analysis techniques {{for the development of}} advanced suspension systems in passenger cars. A review of the application of automatic control to all areas of automotive vehicles illustrated the important factors in such developments, including motivating influences, constraints and methodologies used. A further review of specific applications for advanced suspension systems highlighted a major discrepancy between the significant claims of theoretical performance benefits and the scarcity of successful practical implementations. This discrepancy was the result of idealistic analytical studies producing unrealistic solutions with little regard for practical constraints. The predominant application of prototype testing methods in implementation studies also resulted in reduced potential performance improvements. This work addressed this gap by the application of realistic modelling and control design techniques to practical realistic suspension systems. Multibody system modelling techniques were used to develop vehicle models incorporating realistic representations of the suspension system itself, with the ability to include models of the controllers, and facilitate control analysis tasks. These models were first used to address ride control for fully active suspension systems. Both state space techniques, including linear quadratic <b>regulator</b> and <b>pole</b> placement and frequency domain design methods were applied. For the multivariable frequency domain study, dyadic expansion techniques were used to decouple the system into single input single output systems representing each of the sprung mass modes. Both discretely and continuously variable damping systems were then addressed with a range of control strategies, including analytical solutions based on the active results and heuristic rule-based approaches. The controllers based on active solutions were reduced to satisfy realistic practical limitations of the achievable damping force. The heuristic techniques included standard rule-based controllers using Boolean logic for the discretely variable case, and fuzzy logic controllers for the continuously variable case...|$|R
40|$|The electronization of {{automobiles}} {{is considered to}} be a revolution in automotive technology development progress. One trend for automotive electronics design is pursuing higher level integration. System level integrated circuits are needed to simplify the automotive electronics design and increase the reliability {{of automobiles}}. In this thesis, a prototype of linear voltage regulator is designed for system level integration. Instead of conventional PMOS linear regulator topology, a NMOS power transistor is chosen as the pass device on considerations of smaller silicon area and better dynamic performance. The characteristic differences of PMOS and NMOS linear regulators are analyzed. Based on the frequency behavior analysis of these two types of regulators, a frequency compensation scheme for the NMOS linear regulator is purposed in this thesis. This purposed scheme is able to accommodate the wide frequency variation of the NMOS linear <b>regulator</b> output <b>pole.</b> The effectiveness of frequency compensation is examined by both mathematical modeling and transistor level simulation. The over-current protection of the NMOS linear regulator is also designed, which is realized by applying another current regulation loop to the voltage regulator. This NMOS linear regulator is able to maintain a constant output current around 250 mA in over-current protection scenario. Compared to the existing PMOS linear regulator counterpart, the off-chip ceramic capacitor of this NMOS linear regulator can be reduced to 220 nF (10 x smaller) without sacrificing the ± 2 % output voltage accuracy within - 40 C~ 175 C. The regulator quiescent current at no current load scenario is 12 ?A. Owing to the introduction of adaptive biasing scheme, the maximum quiescent current is 1. 31 mA. This adaptive biasing only degrades the current efficiency by maximum 4 %. At the end of the thesis, possible maximum load current and external capacitor scaling abilities of this NMOS linear regulator are discussed.

40|$|Myosin V motors are {{believed}} to contribute to cell polarization by carrying cargoes along actin tracks. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Myosin Vs transport secretory vesicles along actin cables, which are dynamic actin bundles assembled by the formin For 3 at cell poles. How these flexible structures are able to extend longitudinally in the cell through the dense cytoplasm is unknown. Here we show that in myosin V (myo 52 myo 51) null cells, actin cables are curled, bundled, and fail to extend into the cell interior. They also exhibit reduced retrograde flow, suggesting that formin-mediated actin assembly is impaired. Myo 52 may contribute to actin cable organization by delivering actin <b>regulators</b> to cell <b>poles,</b> as myoV defects are partially suppressed by diverting cargoes toward cell tips onto microtubules with a kinesin 7 -Myo 52 tail chimera. In addition, Myo 52 motor activity may pull on cables to provide the tension necessary for their extension and efficient assembly, as artificially tethering actin cables to the nuclear envelope via a Myo 52 motor domain restores actin cable extension and retrograde flow in myoV mutants. Together these in vivo data reveal elements of a self-organizing {{system in which the}} motors shape their own tracks by transporting cargoes and exerting physical pulling forces...|$|R
40|$|By {{reversing}} paradigms {{that normally}} utilize mathematical models {{as the basis}} for nonlinear adaptive controllers, this article describes using the controller to serve as a novel computational approach for mathematical system identification. System identification usually begins with the dynamics, and then seeks to parameterize the mathematical model in an optimization relationship that produces estimates of the parameters that minimize a designated cost function. The proposed methodology uses a DC motor with a minimum-phase mathematical model controlled by a self-tuning <b>regulator</b> without model <b>pole</b> cancelation. The normal system identification process is briefly articulated by parameterizing the system for least squares estimation that includes an allowance for exponential forgetting to deal with time-varying plants. Next, towards the proposed approach, the Diophantine equation is derived for an indirect self-tuner where feedforward and feedback controls are both parameterized in terms of the motor’s math model. As the controller seeks to nullify tracking errors, the assumed plant parameters are adapted and quickly converge on the correct parameters of the motor’s math model. Next, a more challenging non-minimum phase system is investigated, and the earlier implemented technique is modified utilizing a direct self-tuner with an increased pole excess. The nominal method experiences control chattering (an undesirable characteristic that could potentially damage the motor during testing), while the increased pole excess eliminates the control chattering, yet maintains effective mathematical system identification. This novel approach permits algorithms normally used for control to instead be used effectively for mathematical system identification...|$|R
