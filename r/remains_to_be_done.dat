5|$|The ceramic waste forms offer higher waste {{loadings}} {{than the}} glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure. Also, mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms {{provide evidence for}} long term durability. Due to this fact {{and the fact that}} they can be processed at lower temperatures, ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms. Ceramic waste forms offer great potential, but a lot of research <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{coloured glass}} {{windows in the}} cathedral date from the late 12th century, whilst others are as new as the four Ervin Bossányi windows in the south east transept (1957). Many have already been conserved and protected by the team of stained glass conservators led by Leonie Seliger. However, much conservation work <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> notably on the Oculus window in the south east transept – a late 12th century round window.|$|E
25|$|One more {{issue is}} that some complex {{instructions}} are difficult to restart, e.g. following a page fault. In some cases, restarting from the beginning will work (although wasteful), {{but in many cases}} this would give incorrect results. Therefore, the machine needs to have some hidden state to remember which parts went through and what <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> With a load/store machine, the program counter is sufficient to describe the state of the machine.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the number}} of local seats is {{established}} by the election results at the local level, what <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> is {{to fill in the}} difference with the required number of list member seats for each party.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, there have been {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) and improvements in our understanding of NET biology. However, the benefits <b>to</b> patients have <b>been</b> relatively modest and much <b>remains</b> yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> The 'Hallmarks of Cancer', as defined by Hanahan and Weinberg, provide a conceptual framework for understanding the aberrations that underlie tumourigenesis and to help identify potential targets for therapy.

40|$|Liquidity in {{the eight}} {{government}} bond markets in which the ABF 2 invests has improved significantly since the fund’s inception in 2005. These improvements may <b>be</b> traced <b>to</b> the consolidation of issuance in a few benchmark maturities, an increase in market making activity, and the lowering of barriers to participation by non-resident investors. In each of these factors, the ABF 2 project played an important catalytic role. But there <b>remains</b> work <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Local-currency corporate bond markets have yet to develop active secondary markets.

25|$|There is no {{definite}} {{record as}} to who gave the order to begin shelling the Four Courts. Historians have only presumed that it was Collins. There is only anecdotal evidence as to how and when the ultimatum was served on the anti-Treaty garrison, whether adequate time was allowed the Four Courts men to surrender, or whether shelling began precipitately while the garrison was loading up their arms to leave the building. Further study <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on this most critical event of 1922, which actually started the Civil War in earnest.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefit of}} mycorrhizas to plants has been {{attributed}} to increased uptake of nutrients, especially phosphorus. This may be due to increased surface area in contact with soil, increased movement of nutrients into mycorrhizae, a modified root environment, and increased storage. Mycorrhizas can be much more efficient than plant roots at taking up phosphorus. Phosphorus travels to the root or via diffusion and hyphae reduce the distance required for diffusion, thus increasing uptake. The rate of phosphorus flowing into mycorrhizae can be up to six times that of the root hairs. In some cases, the role of phosphorus uptake can be completely taken over by the mycorrhizal network, and all of the plant’s phosphorus may be of hyphal origin. Less is known about the role of nitrogen nutrition in the arbuscular mycorrhizal system {{and its impact on the}} symbiosis and community. While significant advances have been made in elucidating the mechanisms of this complex interaction, much investigation <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar {{dangerous}} {{soil conditions}} and insufficiently resistant buildings {{are also on}} the southern, western and northern boundaries of San Francisco and San Pablo bays and would also be severely affected by a major earthquake on the Hayward fault. As that portion includes the so-called Silicon Valley, the potential economic disruption due to destruction of works in progress and the dismantling of microelectronics fabrication plants could have an economic effect extending worldwide. The current estimates of the probability of a major earthquake on any of the numerous regional faults range up to 70 percent within the thirty-year period 2000–2029. A recent quiet period following many years of minor activity is considered to be particularly ominous by many, although geologists have not yet been able to predict earthquakes with any useful accuracy. They do warn that all residents of the region should be prepared for a large event and its subsequent effects (e. g., lack of water, firefighting, first aid, electricity, motor and heating fuels, etc.) and that much life-safety protective work <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{by going}} to a more {{abstract}} level one can eliminate the combinatorial side (that is, leave out the indices) and get something that makes sense for p not of the special form of covering with which we began.

30|$|We {{know that}} {{empirical}} studies {{are full of}} not only theoretical assumptions but theoretical thoughts about empirical assumptions. How to reconcile theoretical and empirical thinking is a crucial methodological challenge for scientific innovation and a real imperative to influence societal processes of change and political decisions in Europe. It is in this scholarly context that I set the challenge to consolidate the emerging ICP, {{taking into account the}} Unity/Diversity framework debate with the MCP and the NCP. However, there also <b>remains</b> work <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on the nexus between xenophobia-reduction, solidarity-promotion and interculturalism. This would certainly address the gap between theoretical assumptions and policy outcomes, something the MCP {{does not appear to have}} achieved.|$|R
25|$|It is {{primarily}} {{the likelihood of}} a severe earthquake on the Hayward or San Andreas faults that has spurred a substantial effort to retrofit and sometimes replace large structures at risk, particularly the eastern and western spans of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco and Oakland city halls, and numerous elevated rail, road, and pedestrian structures and overpasses. Much work <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in the region and progress is being hampered by budget constraints imposed by trickle down federal-state-regional deficits, design and construction delays due to state and local political bickering over design, and unexpectedly high steel and cement costs due to the extensive construction work being done in China. Nonetheless, Bay area cities and counties have long expected a major earthquake and as a result all building in the past 30 years has been required to adhere to strict guidelines regarding earthquake resistance. Of all the earthquake prone regions of the world, the San Francisco Bay Area is among the most prepared structurally for the eventuality of a major quake while remaining grossly unprepared in both civil response planning and in the retrofitting of older buildings.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin {{warned in}} 1978 that [...] "Powell's opinion suffers from {{fundamental}} weaknesses, {{and if the}} Court is {{to arrive at a}} coherent position, far more judicial work <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> than a relieved public yet realizes". The Supreme Court has continued to grapple with the question of affirmative action in higher education. [...] In the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger, it reaffirmed Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke in a majority opinion, thus rendering moot concerns expressed by lower courts that Bakke might not be binding precedent due to the fractured lineup of justices in a plurality opinion. The court's decision in the 2013 case of Fisher v. University of Texas made alterations to the standards by which courts must judge affirmative action programs, but continued to permit race to be taken into consideration in university admissions, while forbidding outright quotas.|$|E
500|$|This {{meeting was}} mostly {{symbolic}} {{and did not}} have any concrete proposals or results. Nevertheless, some policies or earlier decisions were reaffirmed or emphasized. First of all, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) Heads of State and Government met with President Hamid Karzai of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan and discussed the progress in that country, and recognized the valuable role played by both Allies and Partners who make up the ISAF, but also emphasized that much <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> for Afghanistan to become a peaceful and stable country, fully integrated into the international community. Secondly, the commitment of the Euro-Atlantic community to peace, security and stability in the Balkans was reaffirmed. Further, the presence of the Heads of State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro at their meeting as observers was welcomed, and these leaders were urged them to meet the outstanding conditions set for Partnership for Peace membership by Allies. Thirdly, the resolve to fight terrorism was reaffirmed and [...] some initiatives aimed at increasing the EAPC’s contribution in this fight were taken, thereby endorsing the further implementation of the Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism.|$|E
