500|$|In 1999, American author Nancy Kathleen Stouffer alleged {{copyright}} and {{trademark infringement}} by Rowling of her 1984 works The Legend of Rah and the Muggles (...) and Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly. The primary basis for Stouffer's case rested {{in her own}} purported invention of the word [...] "Muggles", {{the name of a}} race of mutant humanoids in The Legend of Rah and the Muggles, and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter, like Harry Potter, is a bespectacled boy with dark hair, though he is not a character in The Legend of Rah and the Muggles. Stouffer also drew a number of other comparisons, such as a castle on a lake, a <b>receiving</b> <b>room</b> and wooden doors. Portions of Rah were originally published in booklet form by Ande Publishing Company in 1986, a company founded by Stouffer together with a group of friends and family. Ande Publishing filed for bankruptcy in September 1987 without selling any of its booklets in the United States or elsewhere. Rowling has stated that she first visited the United States in 1998.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{an index}} which is {{measured}} in field conditions, between [...] "real" [...] rooms. It is a measurement which deliberately includes effects due to flanking routes and differences in the relative size of the rooms. It attempts, however, to normalize the measured difference level to the level which would be present when the rooms are furnished by measuring the quantity of acoustic absorption in the <b>receiving</b> <b>room</b> and correcting the difference level to the level which would be expected if there was 10m2 Sabine absorption in the <b>receiving</b> <b>room.</b> Detailed, accurate knowledge of {{the dimensions of the}} <b>receiving</b> <b>room</b> are required.|$|E

30|$|When the {{listener}} <b>receives</b> <b>room</b> reflections {{in addition to}} the direct signal, which is usually the case, the pattern of reflections depends on the directivity of the source [15]. This effect occurs for both linear resonators and general sources; however, it can be more pronounced for the general case, as the pattern of reflections is more variable, [16]. This effect provides more compelling justification for implementing internal directional source synthesis.|$|R

40|$|The SEA (statistical energy analysis) method can {{accurately}} {{predict the}} sound transmission {{loss of a}} finite wall. However, {{there is a large}} discrepancy between the calculated value and the measured value at lower frequencies, since the random incidence mass law deduced for the infinite panel is partly applied in this method. In this paper, to improve this point, the radiation factor derived by investigating the directivity characteristic of transmitted waves through a finite wall was introduced into the coupling loss factor between source and <b>receiving</b> <b>rooms.</b> The experimental and theoretical values agreed well over a wide frequency range. ...|$|R
