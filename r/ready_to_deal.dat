Many of the characters Ginsberg references in [...] "Howl", such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of [...] "Howl" [...] are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a [...] "best mind" [...] destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg's schizophrenic mother: the line [...] "with mother finally ****** (fucked)" [...] comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: [...] "I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother." [...] Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write [...] "Howl" [...] was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with directly.
