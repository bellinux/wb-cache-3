Morgan, {{team up with}} Bob Mayfield, a JSC aerospace educations specialist, {{to preview}} some experiments in zero-G. McAuliffe, prime crewmember, injects a hydroponic solution into a cylinder to review one of the experiments for the flight (42470); McAuliffe experiences {{a few moments of}} weightlessness provided by the KC- 135. She and Mayfield are previewing a molecular mixing experiment which was designed to demonstrate differences of separation process in one-G and zero-G (42471); McAuliffe and Morgan play leap-frog in the temporary weightlessness of the KC- 135 (42472); McAuliffe is seated near the controls of the KC- 135 aircraft (42473); McAuliffe (center frame) and Morgan, her backup, monitor an experiment involving magnetic effects. The experiment uses a control box, a square <b>recepticle</b> containing rubber tubing, stainless steel rod, a filter with desiccant, soft iron wire, and a magnet (42474).
