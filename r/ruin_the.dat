5|$|For live shows, The White Stripes {{were known}} for Jack's {{employment}} of heavy distortion, {{as well as}} audio feedback and overdrive.

5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as <b>the</b> <b>ruins</b> of Charax Spasinu.This claim is based on the scale of <b>the</b> <b>ruins,</b> <b>the</b> fact that the local name for <b>the</b> <b>ruins</b> is Naysān which is probably a corruption of the Parthian name Maysān, and the location of <b>the</b> <b>ruins</b> at <b>the</b> confluence of the Tigris and Karkheh Rivers as stated of Charax Spasinu, by Pliny the Elder.|$|R
5|$|American reviewers were {{enthusiastic}} of Deep Purple's {{live performances}} {{and the lack}} of a new successful single apparently did not <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> positive perception of the band in the US, {{to the point that they}} were often addressed as an American band. Band members even thought about transferring their residence in the United States, but renounced when they learned that the 21 year old Paice could be drafted for the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E
5|$|The plan works, in a way—Dallas can't resist {{insulting}} Hunsecker's methods, and, {{forced to}} choose between them, the timid Susan breaks up with Dallas in order to protect him from her brother. Hunsecker, however, is enraged by Dallas's insults to him after a brief confrontation. He decides to <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> boy after all (against Falco's advice) and wants to have marijuana planted on the musician, then have him arrested and roughed up by corrupt police Lt. Harry Kello (Emile Meyer).|$|E

5|$|This {{entrance}} {{was expected}} to replace the need for Elisenberg Station, and was located {{in the middle of}} the Oslo Tunnel, between Nationaltheatret and Skøyen. Oslo Byes Vel and the Conservative, Red and Centre parties opposed the construction of the entrance, arguing that it would <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> south-western corner of the Palace Park. The Conservative Party proposed building it further south, across Henrik Ibsens gate, either in Hansteens gate or in Parkveien near Oslo Commerce School, while the others wanted to open Elisenberg Station for traffic.|$|E
5|$|A beach party {{takes place}} at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While {{treading}} water, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death a shark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins {{was killed in a}} boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is then placed on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from a shark attack.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{struggle}} which threatened to <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed {{and eventually the}} Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.|$|E

5|$|After the Revolution of 1848, then-Count Wilhelm {{became the}} first duke of Urach. A passionate {{artillery}} officer, he desired to improve the defenses of his castle and so began to build pre-outwork caponiers {{in the style of}} the imperial Fortress of Ulm (though not on a scale as grand) and a trench along the fortress to deter attack. Later he had cannons placed in the bastions on the walls. From 1898 to 1901 the two buildings left of the main gate, the Ducal Palace and the old groundskeepers house, were constructed and expanded respectively. A motion to build a cableway up to the castle in 1911 was rejected because it was believed it would <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> beauty of the castle.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Pendennis was neglected; many of its guns became {{unserviceable}} {{and some}} buildings fell into <b>ruin.</b> <b>The</b> old post of captain of Pendennis Castle was abolished in 1837, with the fortification commanded by a conventional military appointment. In the 1850s, renewed fears of a French invasion led to investment in new artillery at the castle, and nineteen 32- and 56-pounder (14.5 and 24.5 kg) guns were installed. Falmouth continued to be an important harbour, particularly for the Royal Navy. When new concerns about France emerged, an electronically operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from Pendennis and St Mawes. New 6- and 12-pounder (2.7 and 5.4 kg) quick-firing guns, supported by machine-guns for close defence, were assigned to the castle to deal with the emerging threat from enemy torpedo boats.|$|E

When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over her mouth to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E

5|$|In late January 1965, Buddhist {{protests against}} junta-appointed {{civilian}} Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương broke out across South Vietnam. The unrest came after Huong had unveiled {{plans to expand}} conscription and {{the war against the}} communists, and demonstrations were at their largest in I Corps, a Buddhist and anti-war escalation stronghold. In Huế, matters degenerated into a riot as 5,000 demonstrators attacked the United States Information Service Library and burned 8,000 books. Khánh and Thi were thought to have {{turned a blind eye to}} the rioting in order to allow the disorder to <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> Huong government and allow them to inherit power. Khánh decided to have the armed forces replace Huong, and on the morning of 27 January, Khánh staged a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Kỳ. However, many of the officers had agreed to Khánh's plan in hopes he would fail and discredit himself.|$|E

5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would <b>ruin</b> <b>the</b> village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, they questioned its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would begin as early as 1963.|$|E
