Calls to South Africa from Swaziland, however, required {{the use of the}} <b>regional</b> <b>code</b> 07.

50|$|From a {{worldwide}} perspective <b>regional</b> <b>coding</b> {{may be seen}} as a failure. A huge percentage of players outside of North America can be easily modified (and are even sold pre-modified by mainstream stores such as Amazon.co.uk) to ignore the <b>regional</b> <b>codes</b> on a disc. This, coupled with the fact that almost all televisions in Europe and Australasia are capable of displaying NTSC video (at the very least, in black and white), means that consumers in these regions have a huge choice of discs. Contrary to popular belief, this practice is not illegal and in some countries that strongly support free trade it is encouraged.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} new {{developments}} in the implementation of regional and federal building energy performance codes in Russia. Since mid- 2000, the number of regions with codes has more than doubled: now more than thirty regions have adopted codes and have received registration by federal officials. These regions have a collective population of more than 60 million people, and together account for some 70 percent of Russia’s new construction and renovation. Buildings built in compliance with new codes consume forty percent less energy for heating than minimally code-compliant buildings built before 1995. Almost all Russian <b>regional</b> <b>codes</b> are based on the same model code, developed by the authors and other Russian and American colleagues. The <b>regional</b> <b>codes</b> embody essentially the same energy-performance requirements, normalized per degree-day in the heating season. The <b>regional</b> <b>codes</b> do vary from each other in a number of ways, reflecting economic conditions, construction-industry particularities, and policy priorities. The onset of codes has yielded significant market transformation, as new requirements have prompted manufacturers to develop new generations of advanced walls and windows. New technologies include porous lightweight concrete for one-layer walls, porous hollow bricks, and exterior insulation. The Russian market has also been witnessing ongoing advances in fenestration, including increased use of vinyl frames and selective coatings...|$|R

50|$|In some cases, colours may vary. Vehicles {{registered}} as classic cars can carry black plates with silver or white characters {{and without the}} blue bands on the sides. Vehicles in transit on French territory must carry a red plate with white characters. Instead of the <b>regional</b> <b>code,</b> the right hand band displays the expiry date of the plate. Vehicles purchased in the free trade zones of Gex and Savoie also carry red plates, but with the <b>regional</b> <b>code.</b> Diplomatic vehicles carry green plates with orange or white characters. Vehicles owned by the French Forces and Civilian Elements stationed in Germany (FFECSA) carry a pale blue plate with white characters.|$|E
