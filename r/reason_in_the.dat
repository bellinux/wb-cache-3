5|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{systematic}} study of fossils emerged {{as an integral part}} of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of <b>Reason.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Italian Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classical}} {{philosophers and}} scientists, including Aristotle, considered the heart {{the seat of}} thought, reason, or emotion, often disregarding the brain as contributing to those functions.) |page=book 3, ch. 4. |nopp=y |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814220201/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/parts/book3.html |archivedate=14 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }} The identification of the heart as the seat of emotions in particular {{is due to the}} Roman physician Galen, who also located the seat of the passions in the liver, and the seat of <b>reason</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} mainly by river engineering {{and water pollution}} in densely populated regions. The species' population trend is overall stable, but is declining in some areas (Germany), while in other areas it is expanding (for example in the Danube river). In the Rhine river during the 1970s, Theodoxus fluviatilis came close to local extinction because of water pollution. Subsequently, the water quality improved {{for more than two}} decades, leading to a recovery. Even so, the species became extinct in the Rhine for an unknown <b>reason</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s. Since 2006, Theodoxus fluviatilis recolonized the Rhine, probably via ship transport through the Main-Danube Canal. An analysis based on cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene has shown that the recolonization probably originated in the Danube.|$|E

5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat in the northern area of the freeway was approved in 2004. The study compared the original routing for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with an alternate route that involved an indirection connection via the BL I-94 interchange and an I-94 concurrency near Benton Harbor. The study recommended using a version of the alternate connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen, both to save money and decrease impact to the Mitchell's satyr. At the time the freeway segment opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but since then, funding has not been available. MDOT did not include construction of the extension for this <b>reason</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> department's 2014–18 highway projects plan released in 2013, although most of the design work and land acquisition has been completed. Until the missing freeway segment is built, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange and additional lanes will be added to I-94 as well. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section. MDOT's 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016 split the remaining work into three phases. The department has listed funding for only the first two of these three phases, and construction is anticipated to start in 2021.|$|E

25|$|In {{some sources}} Austro-Hungarian U-boats are {{referenced}} with Roman numerals {{as a way}} to distinguish them from German U-boats with similar numbers, but the Austro-Hungarian Navy itself used Arabic numerals. There are gaps in the numbering for several reasons. One series of Austro-Hungarian U-boats under construction in Germany was sold and commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. In other cases, U-boats commissioned into the Imperial German Navy were temporarily assigned Austro-Hungarian numbers when they operated in the Mediterranean. One final <b>reason,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of the unassigned U-13, was superstition.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the European {{intellectual}} {{transformation of}} {{and after the}} Renaissance bridged the Middle Ages and the Modern era. The Age of <b>Reason</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western world is generally regarded as being the start of modern philosophy, and {{a departure from the}} medieval approach, especially Scholasticism. Early 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. The 18th century saw the beginning of secularization in Europe, rising to notability {{in the wake of the}} French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{aluminum}} oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the metallic aluminum against aggressive chemical reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of {{aluminum oxide}} {{is usually not}} homogeneous. It forms a complex multilayer structured laminate of amorphous, crystalline and porous crystalline aluminum oxide mostly covered with small residual parts of unconverted aluminum hydroxide. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of the anode foil, the oxide film is structured by a special chemical treatment so that either an amorphous oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The amorphous oxide variety yields higher mechanical and physical stability and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.|$|E

25|$|In {{the human}} level, with the {{development}} of consciousness, love, although continuous with its lower forms, attains a higher form because of its relation to <b>reason.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> beginning these two factors are in a natural harmony, but the one doesn't have conscious access to the other. Each one operates almost separately from the other. Then comes a stage where reason and love come in rapport and conflict with each other, yet the important factor is that they start coming simultaneously in the conscious sphere. Then comes a third stage where a synthesis of love and reason is achieved to bring an altogether new type of consciousness, best described as superconsciousness.|$|E

25|$|Of the 105 {{seats in}} Ireland, twenty-five were uncontested {{for a number}} of reasons, not least that the IPP and Sinn Féin had been finding common ground in the {{immediately}} previous period.

British government propaganda formulated in Dublin Castle and circulated through a censored press alleged that republican militants had threatened potential candidates to discourage non-Sinn Féiners from running. For whatever <b>reason,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 73 constituencies in which Sinn Féin candidates were elected 25 were returned unopposed (17 were in Munster). The uncontested constituencies that Sinn Féin won subsequently showed high levels of support for republican candidates.|$|E

25|$|Other modern Jewish {{philosophers}} {{have pursued}} {{a range of}} ethical approaches, {{with varying degrees of}} reliance upon traditional Jewish sources. Notably, Hermann Cohen authored Religion of <b>Reason</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradition of Kantian ethics. Martin Buber wrote on various ethical and social topics, including the dialogical ethics of his I and Thou. Hans Jonas, a student of Martin Heidegger, draws upon phenomenology in his writings on bioethics, technology and responsibility. Emmanuel Levinas sought to distinguish his philosophical and Jewish writings; nevertheless, some scholars are constructing Jewish ethics around his innovative and deeply Jewish approach. Jewish feminism has used the principles of feminist ethics and also played a role in Jewish ethics.|$|E
25|$|Peirce was {{a working}} {{scientist}} for 30 years, and arguably {{was a professional}} philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of Kant's Critique of Pure <b>Reason,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on {{a wide array of}} disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy, metrology, geodesy, experimental psychology, economics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.|$|E
25|$|Schleiermacher's own moral {{system is}} an attempt to supply these deficiencies. It connects the moral world by a {{deductive}} process with the fundamental idea of knowledge and being; it offers a view of the entire world of human action which at all events aims at being exhaustive; it presents an arrangement of the matter of the science which tabulates its constituents after the model of the physical sciences; and it supplies a sharply defined treatment of specific moral phenomena in their relation to the fundamental idea of human life as a whole. Schleiermacher defines ethics as the theory {{of the nature of the}} reason, or as the scientific treatment of the effects produced by human <b>reason</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of nature and man.|$|E
