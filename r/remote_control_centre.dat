40|$|Australia {{has been}} a leading mining nation and its mines {{continue}} to attract substantial investment due to its strong mineral endowment, mining tradition and high skills base. In recent years Australian mining companies have been facing higher labour costs, which need to be offset by other savings. Automating mine-site machinery offers one potential source of such savings. Underground mines pioneered automated technology largely for safety and mine accessibility reasons and to reduce operating costs. Yet these operations now represent a much smaller portion of the total ore tonnes mined due to the changing mining techniques meaning larger lower grade deposits are becoming economic. It appears the future of mine automation will be directed by surface mining as this maturing technology finds further applications above ground {{and in the next}} decade large scale open pit automation trials gain more momentum. This paper assesses the implications of introducing driverless haul trucks in a typical large remote Australian open-pit mine. Such automation will save employee and associated costs, increase operational productive hours and ultimately will reduce mine site workforce numbers. While there will be fewer jobs per mine, with reduced costs and higher productivity some previously uneconomic mines may again be profitable. The social implications of greater mine site automation are the reduction in population of remote mining towns and a decrease in the lower skilled labour requirements for the mining sector. There will be an increase in fly-in fly-out mining operations and companies will establish <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> for automated mines in larger cities. This may decrease overall labour requirements and so reduce employment in the sector; therefore, the government should be mindful of implementing policies that ensure a fair return on the economic rent of mineral leases.

30|$|All {{functions}} {{of a vehicle}} are controlled by a driver for Grade 0 (GoA 0), reflecting historic railway practice but no longer typical for metro systems. Grades 1 (GoA 1) and 2 (GoA 2) both require a driver on-board, but include some degree of automatic train protection (ATP). ATP is installed to prevent collisions, and will automatically apply the brakes if the train passes a red signal or is travelling too fast. GoA 2 also includes automatic train operation (ATO) to control {{the movement of the}} train during regular operation. Grades 3 (GoA 3) and 4 (GoA 4) of automation correspond to driverless or unattended train operation, without an on-board driver’s involvement (ATP and ATO functions are still a part of the system). GoA 3 retains an attendant on-board to operate doors, assist passengers and operate the train in case of equipment failures. In GoA 4, a train is fully automatic, as all the four criteria listed in Table  2 can be executed without a physical presence of a human on board. The trains are effectively monitored and controlled by staff based in a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E

40|$|Today, {{many small}} {{aerodromes}} {{have a hard}} time surviving economically, and amongst the largest cost is air traffic control. Airlines are cutting costs where they can, and many times this affects the aerodromes as well, e. g. when airlines decide to park remotely instead of at the gate. The project called Remotely Operated Towers, initiated by SESAR and run by Saab and LFV, is aiming to address this problem. The project revolves around remotely providing ATS to aerodromes where it is deemed suitable.

30|$|The global {{architecture}} of the system shows three main modules. The first one is the « Train sensing system » which serves to detect train arrivals and departures respectively toward/from the LX. This module is responsible for triggering the local protection system composed of automatic half barriers and signalling lights. The second module is also linked to a monitoring system (third module) composed of cameras, a processing unit responsible {{for the analysis of}} image sequences sent by the cameras—and possibly for storing them in a dedicated database—. The unit also recognises potentially dangerous situations and alerts the Local Control Centre (LCC) of the LX zone. The LCC is able to communicate with the approaching train in order for example to issue a braking order. The LCC is also linked to a Main <b>remote</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> (MCC) which manages the traffic on a larger scale. Following a disruption occurring on at a LX, a MCC may decide to divert some trains to other routes. Note that train detection devices have to be situated far enough away from the LX crossing zone, so that when obstacles are detected within this zone, there still is enough time for the monitoring module to take anticipatory measures.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The major {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are the engineering development and the structural analysis with finite element method (FEM) of a refrigerated container having a passive equipment and a remote control system to carry both fresh (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C) goods. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to offer some solutions to the many disadvantages of using phase change material (PCM) to refrigerate the insulated container for transporting both fresh and frozen goods. Design/methodology/approach - In order to transport both fresh products (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen products (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C), the PCM elements are filled with one eutectic liquid only, so as to avoid problems related to filling and emptying the eutectic plates, and to plate corrosion. Moreover, specially shaped air ducts and a cool flow control system are designed to maintain a uniform circulation of cool air and constant humidity values. All the structures of the container are correctly designed by means of FEM calculations to assure that all the structural, safety standards parameters are satisfied. Findings - An innovative refrigerated container with PCM and a remote control system used to transport both fresh (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C) products, in which it is possible to maintain the temperature values for almost seven days, has been considered here. Many disadvantages due to the use of PCM have been eliminated. It is possible to maintain a uniform circulation cool air and humidity values within the design parameters by means of fans; moreover, this container is light and environmentally friendly. All structures of the container are designed using FEM. Originality/value - This paper presents a refrigerated container with passive equipment and a remote control system to carry both fresh (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C) goods in which it is possible to maintain the temperature values necessary for almost seven days. The container is equipped with a remote control system powered by photovoltaic panels which works in real time, is capable of giving information about the environmental parameters set in it and monitors the state of products by means of a network of sensors. Furthermore, the remote control system can send information about the position of the container to a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>centre.</b> The relevant structural conditions are numerically (FEM) evaluated and reported...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{in the field of}} lighting and illumination allows low energy consumption and a rapid growth in the use, and development of solid-state sources. As the efficiency of these devices increases and their cost decreases there are predictions that they will become the dominant source for general illumination in the short term. The objective of this thesis is to study, through extensive simulations in realistic scenarios, the feasibility and exploitation of visible light communication (VLC) for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) applications. A brief introduction will introduce the new scenario of smart cities in which visible light communication will become a fundamental enabling technology for the future communication systems. Specifically, this thesis focus on the acquisition of several, frequent, and small data packets from vehicles, exploited as sensors of the environment. The use of vehicles as sensors is a new paradigm to enable an efficient environment monitoring and an improved traffic management. In most cases, the sensed information must be collected at a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> {{and one of the most}} challenging aspects is the uplink acquisition of data from vehicles. My thesis discusses the opportunity to take advantage of short range vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-roadside (V 2 R) communications to offload the cellular networks. More specifically, it discusses the system design and assesses the obtainable cellular resource saving, by considering the impact of the percentage of vehicles equipped with short range communication devices, of the number of deployed road side units, and of the adopted routing protocol. When short range communications are concerned, WAVE/IEEE 802. 11 p is considered as standard for VANETs. Its use together with VLC will be considered in urban vehicular scenarios to let vehicles communicate without involving the cellular network. The study is conducted by simulation, considering both a simulation platform (SHINE, simulation platform for heterogeneous interworking networks) developed within the Wireless communication Laboratory (Wilab) of the University of Bologna and CNR, and network simulator (NS 3). trying to realistically represent all the wireless network communication aspects. Specifically, simulation of vehicular system was performed and introduced in ns- 3, creating a new module for the simulator. This module will help to study VLC applications in VANETs. Final observations would enhance and encourage potential research in the area and optimize performance of VLC systems applications in the future...|$|E
