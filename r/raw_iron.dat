5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} <b>raw</b> <b>iron</b> ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
2500|$|William A Irvin {{could carry}} up to 14,000 tons of iron ore {{in either the}} {{processed}} taconite form, or the <b>raw</b> <b>iron</b> ore straight from the mines. [...] About 90% of what she carried was taconite, although she did switch to coal and limestone for periods of time. [...] William A Irvin was equipped to carry grain, although she never did due to {{the problems associated with}} switching cargoes from taconite to grain. [...] All cargo was loaded and unloaded through the top of the ship, through the 18 hatches on deck. [...] All hatches were covered with large one-piece steel hatch covers, which weighed 5.5 tons per cover. [...] After all the covers were lifted off and placed aside using the hatch crane, the cargo could be dumped {{to the bottom of the}} three holds, which would normally take 3–4 hours to complete. [...] Unloading used Hulett cranes: cranes whose necks reach down to the bottom of the holds and grab 10-15 tons per bite, much like a large playground crane. [...] After all the cargo was either in or out of the holds, the hatch covers would be replaced and clamped down using the dog-ear or butterfly clamps. [...] Although the covers needed a crane to move them, they would need to be secured to ensure that they would not be dislodged by waves washing the decks during storms.|$|E

6000|$|In the Odyssey, {{when the}} poet {{describes}} {{the process of}} tempering iron, we read, [...] "as when a smith dips a great axe or an adze in chill water, for thus men temper iron." [...] [Footnote: Odyssey, IX. 391-393.] He is not using iron to make a sword or spear, but a tool-adze or axe. The poet is perfectly consistent. There are also examples both of bronze axes and, apparently, of bronze knives. Thus, though the woodcutter's or carpenter's axe is of bronze in two passages cited, iron is the usual material of the axe or adze. Again we saw, when Achilles gives a mass of iron as a prize in the games, he {{does not mean the}} armourer to fashion it into sword or spear, but says that it will serve the shepherd or ploughman for domestic implements, [Footnote: Leaf, Iliad (1902), XXIII. line 30, Note.] so that the men need not, on an upland farm, go to the city for iron implements. In commenting upon this Mr. Leaf is scarcely at the proper point of view. He says, [Footnote: Iliad, XXIII. 835, Note.] [...] "the idea of a state of things when the ploughman and shepherd forge their own tools from a lump of <b>raw</b> <b>iron</b> has a suspicious appearance of a deliberate attempt to represent from the inner consciousness an archaic state of civilisation. In Homeric times the [Greek: chalceus] is already specialised as a worker in metals...." [...] However, Homer does not say that the ploughman and shepherd [...] "forge their own tools." [...] A Homeric chief, far from a town, would have his own smithy, just as the laird of Runraurie (now Urrard) had his smithy {{at the time of the}} battle of Killicrankie (1689). Mackay's forces left their impedimenta [...] "at the laird's smithy," [...] says an eye-witness. [Footnote: Napier's Life Of Dundee, iii. p. 724.] ...|$|E
