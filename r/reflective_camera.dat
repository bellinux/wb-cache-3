50|$|In 2011 Angelina Nikonova and {{her partner}} Olga Dihovichnaya shot a feature film Twilight Portrait (Portret v symerkah), using a simple <b>reflective</b> <b>camera</b> due to the low budget. However, the film made a great success and won a number of prices, {{including}} international price for best debut 2011 on Warsaw International Film Festival. For the film, Angelina worked as a director, a script writer, a producer, a location manager, casting director, make-up artists, and art director.At the same time, Angelina Nikonova worked as an organizator of International Film Festival 2morrow/Zavtra.|$|E
50|$|Nothing came {{of these}} efforts, and by 1927 Schmidt's {{prospects}} were so poor that he accepted Schorr's offer. He began {{to establish a}} workshop {{in the basement of}} the Main Service Building at the observatory and to repair the horizontal telescope. During 1927 and 1929, Schmidt participated in two solar eclipse expeditions mounted by the Hamburg Observatory, the first to northern Sweden and the second to the Philippines. It was during this second trip that Schmidt announced to his companion, the astronomer Walter Baade, the most important invention of Schmidt's lifetime, indeed an invention that revolutionized astronomy and optical design in the second half of the 20th century, namely his wide-angle <b>reflective</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bernhard Woldemar Schmidt ( [...] on Naissaar, Estonia, Russian Empire - 1 December 1935 in Hamburg, Germany) was a German optician. In 1930 {{he invented}} the Schmidt {{telescope}} which corrected for the optical errors of spherical aberration, coma, and astigmatism, making {{possible for the}} first time the construction of very large, wide-angled <b>reflective</b> <b>cameras</b> of short exposure time for astronomical research.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Reflective</b> and <b>Camera</b> {{technologies}} do {{not perform}} well on moving swing doors, because they typically depend upon detection {{of changes in}} the background. A sensor mounted on a swing door system is constantly in motion, so the background (i.e. floor beneath the door) changes continuously. To overcome this problem, a triangulation sensor provides an innovative solution.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{monitoring of}} slope deformations by vision metrology with a CCD <b>camera.</b> <b>Reflective</b> targets are placed over a slope, and their object coordinates {{is measured by}} a photogrammetric technique. Precision and sensitivity of slope deformation measurement using vision metrology are investigated. Deformation of targets placed on a slope was detected by measurement at two time epochs using hypothesis testing, {{and a series of}} equations is derived for the detection. The strengths of the observation networks were evaluated from three view points, i. e. precision of target object coordinates, sensitivity of observations and reliability of observation. Model experiments were carried out to verify the method's validity. A slope model of 1. 1 m 0. 5 m in size was constructed. An reasonable exposure configuration is looked for, which is capable of detecting displacement of about 2 mm pro 30 m. It is thus clarified that sufficient precision, sensitivity and reliability are achievable for practical use by a total of 12 exposures: four for each of three locations. * Corresponding author. 1...|$|R
30|$|Optical {{trackers}} {{are more}} {{widely used in}} high-end motion picture production, but this technique {{can be used for}} immersive virtual reality. These devices incorporate a camera system to track the motion. Optical trackers fall under three categories: beacon trackers, pattern recognition, and laser ranging [113]. Beacon trackers use markers placed on the user to track the motions of the user. These markers are usually LEDs or <b>reflective</b> materials. The <b>camera</b> tracks the position of the markers. With an array of markers, the orientation of the body parts may also be determined. The SELSPOT {{is an example of a}} beacon tracker [114]. It has 30 infrared LEDs that are tracked by a camera. The OPTOTRAK 3020 (Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) is another device that uses the same principle [115]. The system can track up to 256 infrared light pulses from a LED. The FlashPoint Model 3000 (Image Guided Surgery Technology Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) is a system that uses infrared LEDs and can track up to 360 markers per second. These two systems have been tested for computer-aided surgery capabilities. The DynaSight Sensor from Origin Instruments (Grand Prairie, TX, USA) uses an infrared camera to track markers that are placed on the user [116].|$|R
40|$|In October 2009 I curated {{the second}} {{exhibition}} of Clunie Reid at MOT International. The exhibition {{was a great}} success, receiving critical acclaim in both Art Forum and Art Review. Clunie Reid showed {{a new series of}} individual wall based works that pushed the medium and scale of her previous small photo-collages and focused the mass information of her wall based installations while retaining their raw guttural and immediate appropriation of media images. These new works successfully enlarge and focus our gaze on the reversed spectacle of contemporary society, slipping it to us in the bite-sized snippets for our media-holic minds to devour. Pages from hello, loaded, adverts from TV, images from the internet are re-photographed and printed on <b>reflective</b> surfaces. Broken <b>cameras,</b> disruptive flash glare and printing slippage are all appropriated to enhance the work. Reidâ€™s venomous wit is hand written over these seductive surfaces, turning the language of spectacle in on itself, negating the stupidity, transforming the dumb into great profundity. Her materials mirror her subjects, the gloss and seductive surfaces combined with the trashy use of tape, stickers and marker pen, perfectly complement the celebrities, sneaker ads and out of focus environments. Clunie Reid's work cuts through a global language and the success of this exhibition went a long way to securing her place in the international art world. Clunie Reid (born in 1971, Pembury, Kent) lives and works in London, UK and is represented by MOT International. She was selected for East International (2007) and received the John Jones Art on Paper Award 2008 for her work at Zoo Art Fair. She has recently participated in Nought to Sixty at the ICA and had solo exhibitions at MOT International, Focal Point Gallery in Southend and Galerie Reinhard Hauff in Stuttgart. Her work has been included in a number of international exhibitions including We came here to get laid not critique dutch culture at Wilfried Lentz Gallery in Rotterdam, Aspen 11 at Neue Alte Brucke in Frankfurt, Local Operations at Serpentine Gallery in London, falkeandcharlotte project space/ Dolores at Ellen de Bruijne Gallery in Amsterdam, and This show is ribbed for her pleasure, Cynthia Broan Gallery, New York...|$|R
