Optimization is a process that is user-specific and incorporates the various systematic errors attributable to measurement of ocular parameters. In order to optimize a lens-constant, the user must back calculate the formula so that the actual post-operative <b>refractive</b> <b>error</b> is included.

25|$|Corrective {{contact lenses}} are {{designed}} to improve vision, most commonly by correcting <b>refractive</b> <b>error.</b> This is done by directly focusing light so it enters the eye with the proper power for clear vision.|$|E
25|$|A {{common cause}} of low visual acuity is <b>{{refractive}}</b> <b>error</b> (ametropia), or errors in how the light is refracted in the eyeball. Causes of refractive errors include aberrations {{in the shape of}} the eyeball, the shape of the cornea, and reduced flexibility of the lens. Too high or too low <b>refractive</b> <b>error</b> (in relation to the length of the eyeball) is the cause of nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) (normal refractive status is referred to as emmetropia). Other optical causes are astigmatism or more complex corneal irregularities. These anomalies can mostly be corrected by optical means (such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser surgery, etc.).|$|E

Thus <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> had not grabbed the attention of policymakers and service providers...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: <b>Refractive</b> <b>errors</b> {{are the one}} of {{the most}} common visual {{disorders}} found worldwide in school going children and it is also one of the causes of blindness. It can easily be prevented, if timely proper measures are taken. In Kathmandu valley and Mechi Zone of Nepal, the distribution of <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> was found to be very high. No records are available from the Western part of Nepal. Considering the importance of the <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> the present study had been undertaken in Pokhara city. Materials and methods: Nine hundred and sixty four subjects (474 boys, 490 girls) were selected between age groups 10 to 19 years from six schools representing different region of Pokhara. After Preliminary examination: on acuity of vision with Snellen’s and Jaeger’s charts, the subjects were referred to the Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara for con�rmation of the <b>refractive</b> <b>errors.</b> Results: Sixty two schools children (6. 43 %), out of 964 had <b>refractive</b> <b>errors.</b> Myopia was found to be most common (4. 05 %). The <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> were found more in Private school children (9. 29 %) than Government school children (4. 23 %), which is statistically signi�cant (P < 0. 05). More boys (7. 59 %) were found to have suffered from <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> than girls (5. 31 %). Further, children with vegetarian diet (10. 52 %) had greater number of <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> than non-vegetarian diet children (6. 17 %). Conclusion: In the present study, percentage distribution of myopia was found to be higher (4. 05 %) than the hyperopia (1. 24 %) and astigmatism (1. 14 %). Interestingly, in the present study the <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> were found signi�cantly higher in Private schools children than Government schools because the children who read in Private schools have higher socioeconomic status; spend more time in home work, watching Television and Computer as compared to government schools children. These near activities of the eyes causes stress on eyes of the children and might be one of the causes of developing myopia...|$|R

25|$|The {{underlying}} cause {{is believed to}} be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include doing work that involves focusing on close objects, greater time spent indoors, and a family history of the condition. It is also associated with a high socioeconomic class.

25|$|Genetically, linkage {{studies have}} {{identified}} 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes {{that are associated}} with myopia, but none of these loci are part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia. A collaboration of all myopia studies worldwide, identified 16 new loci for <b>refractive</b> <b>error</b> in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, ion transport, retinoic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development.

In intact eyes, lens-induced relative peripheral hyperopia produced central axial myopia. Moreover, eliminating the fovea by laser photoablation did not prevent compensating myopic changes in response to optically imposed hyperopia.

25|$|OA1 is {{recognized}} by many different symptoms. Reduced visual acuity {{is accompanied by}} involuntary movements of the eye termed as nystagmus. Astigmatism is a condition wherein there occurs significant <b>refractive</b> <b>error.</b> Moreover, ocular albino eyes become crossed, a condition called as ‘lazy eyes’ or strabismus. Since very little pigment is present the iris becomes translucent and reflects light back. It appears green to blueish red. However, {{the most important part}} of the eye, the fovea which is responsible for acute vision, does not develop properly, probably indicating the role of melanin in the development stages of the eye. Some affected individuals may also develop photophobia/photodysphoria. All these symptoms are due to lack of pigmentation of the retina. Moreover, in an ocular albino eye, nerves from back of the eye to the brain may not follow the usual pattern of routing. In an ocular albino eye, more nerves cross from back of the eye to the opposite side of the brain instead of going to the both sides of the brain as in a normal eye. An ocular albino eye appears blueish pink in color with no pigmentation at all unlike a normal eye. Carrier women have regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation due to X-inactivation and partial iris transillumination and do not show any other symptoms exhibited by those affected by OA1.|$|E

The decreased acuity is reflected in various abnormalities in cell properties in the visual cortex. These changes include a marked {{decrease in the number}} of cells connected to the affected eye as well as cells connected to both eyes in cortical area V1, resulting in a loss of stereopsis, i.e. depth perception by binocular vision (colloquially: [...] "3D vision").

40|$|Background: <b>Refractive</b> <b>errors</b> and {{convergence}} insufficiency play {{major roles}} in reading efficiency. Uncorrected <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> are a {{primary cause of}} binocular anomalies, including convergence insufficiency. Symptoms of asthenopia in both refractive and binocular vision anomalies are similar. Despite the relationships that exist between them, the extent of association between <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> and convergence insufficiency has not been studied extensively. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of convergence insufficiency and <b>refractive</b> <b>errors</b> and investigate their associations with gender and age in a sample of high school children. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and comprised data from 1056 African high school students aged 13 – 18 years, who were randomly selected from 13 high schools in uMhlathuze municipality in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In the final sample, 403 (38 %) were males and 653 (62 %) were females. The participants’ mean age and standard deviation were 15. 89 ± 1. 58 years and median age was 16 years. <b>Refractive</b> <b>errors,</b> heterophoria, near point of convergence, fusional vergences and accommodative functions were evaluated. Results: Prevalences for convergence insufficiency were as follows: low suspect 12. 4 % (confidence interval, [CI] 10. 2 – 14. 4), high suspect 6. 3 % (CI, 5. 0 – 7. 9), definite 4. 6 % (CI, 3. 4 – 5. 9), and pseudo-convergence insufficiency 2. 1 % (CI, 1. 2 – 3. 0). <b>Refractive</b> <b>errors</b> were: hyperopia 6. 8 % (CI, 5. 3 – 8. 4), myopia 6. 0 % (CI, 4. 6 – 7. 5), astigmatism 2. 3 % (CI, 1. 8 – 3. 2), anisometropia 1. 3 % (CI, 0. 7 – 2. 0) and emmetropia 86. 2 % (CI, 85. 1 – 89. 1).
