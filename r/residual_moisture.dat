5|$|Typhoon Utor, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Seniang, swept through the central Philippines in December2006, {{exacerbating}} the damage left behind by previous Philippine typhoon strikes that year. <b>Residual</b> <b>moisture</b> from the tropical cyclone indirectly contributed to extensive flooding in Malaysia. Utor originated from an area of disturbed weather that organized into a tropical depression on December7 west-southwest of Yap. The cyclone steadily progressed westward while gradually intensifying, reaching tropical storm intensity late on December7. On December9 and the ensuing two days, Utor crossed the central Philippines and reached typhoon strength before weakening somewhat upon entry into the South China Sea. Reintensification ensued afterwards, and Utor reached its peak intensity on December13 with maximum sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph) shortly after regaining typhoon strength. However, wind shear and dry air began to take its toll on Utor thereafter, quickly weakening the storm until its dissipation on December15.|$|E

25|$|The {{historic}} {{origin of}} sesame was favored by {{its ability to}} grow in areas that {{do not support the}} growth of other crops. It is also a robust crop that needs little farming support—it grows in drought conditions, in high heat, with <b>residual</b> <b>moisture</b> in soil after monsoons are gone or even when rains fail or when rains are excessive. It was a crop that could be grown by subsistence farmers at the edge of deserts, where no other crops grow. Sesame has been called a survivor crop.|$|E

30|$|TPH <b>residual</b> {{content and}} <b>moisture</b> <b>residual</b> content of solid slag at {{different}} terminal temperature {{are shown in}} Fig.  4. TPH content dropped from 4.6 % to below 1 %, with the terminal temperature increasing from 200 to 350  °C. The terminal temperature continued to rise from 350  °C to over 400  °C, the TPH content continued to decrease, but the drops were very small. The TPH content almost unchanged when terminal temperature varied from 400 to 415  °C.|$|R
25|$|Inside the dryer, hot dry air {{is pumped}} {{into the bottom of}} the hopper {{containing}} the resin so that it flows up through the pellets, removing moisture on its way. The hot wet air leaves the top of the hopper and is first run through an after-cooler, because it is easier to remove moisture from cold air than hot air. The resulting cool wet air is then passed through a desiccant bed. Finally, the cool dry air leaving the desiccant bed is re-heated in a process heater and sent back through the same processes in a closed loop. Typically, <b>residual</b> <b>moisture</b> levels in the resin must be less than 50 parts per million (parts of water per million parts of resin, by weight) before processing. Dryer residence time should not be shorter than about four hours. This is because drying the material in less than 4 hours would require a temperature above 160°C, at which level hydrolysis would begin inside the pellets before they could be dried out.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{winter storm}} {{developed}} on December 14 {{east of the}} Rockies and across the southern states and traveled across {{many of the same}} areas, bringing significant snows to areas that were affected by both ice storms. Portions of Kansas received over a foot (30cm) of snow on top of the accumulated ice. The system moved across the Great Lakes region on December 15 and 16 and intensified while adding moisture from a developing coastal low as well as <b>residual</b> <b>moisture</b> from what was Tropical Storm Olga that affected most of the Antilles and Caribbean. Several areas in the Midwest and eastern North America received close to a foot of snow including Chicago, some areas of the Toronto and Detroit areas, Montreal, and Ottawa. Accumulations of as much as 20inches (50cm) fell across northern New England, northern New York, eastern Ontario from rural eastern Ottawa to Cornwall, and north of the Saint Lawrence River in the province of Quebec into the Charlevoix region. Thundersnow was even reported across portions of southern Ontario and Quebec. Widespread amounts of snow between 8 and 14inches (20–35cm) were reported across Ontario, Quebec, most of New England and the Canadian Maritimes as well as in several areas of the Midwest including Kansas and Missouri, while between a half-inch to an inch (13–25mm) of ice fell across higher elevations in Maryland and Virginia with significant icing as well over West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This was accompanied by heavy rain between 2 and 4inches (50–100mm) south of the Mason–Dixon line towards the Carolinas and the Southeast, with significant rainfall across the Middle Atlantic Coast, coastal sections of Nova Scotia, and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador. Additionally, heavy thunderstorms developed across the Southern states near the Gulf of Mexico coast, where tornado watches were issued for portions of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina on December 15 with several tornadoes later confirmed. The storm finally exited off the coast into the Atlantic Ocean on December 18.|$|E

It can be inferred that low-speed stirring can improve heat transfer condition and liquids removal efficiency, but the changes of scraper rotary speed on TPH and moisture removal rate are not remarkable.|$|R

500|$|The outer rainbands of the {{tropical}} cyclone caused flooding in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Chiapas, resulting in some damage. Several mudslides in southern Mexico and Guatemala were attributed to these rains. Off the Mexican coast, waves from Dora peaked at 13ft (4.0m). These high waves toppled a lighthouse roughly [...] east of Acapulco and also damaged or swept away 60thatch-roofed restaurants around La Penitas and La Bocana. After passing southwestern Mexico, Dora was expected to track near the Baja California Peninsula, forcing port authorities in Los Cabos Municipality to suspend boat tours and other tourist services. Four elementary schools were converted into emergency shelters in preparation for potential flooding. <b>Residual</b> <b>moisture</b> from Dora enhanced the monsoonal flow over Arizona and New Mexico, producing showers across the region.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{becoming}} a hurricane, Alex {{was located in}} a moist, low shear environment, which led to steady intensification on June30. The pressure continued to falla sign of an intensifying cyclonewith a more rapid drop occurring that afternoon and evening. The hurricane strengthened into a Category2 storm late on June30 as it approached the northeastern Mexican coast.

After the storm, the National Hurricane Center revised the landfall intensity estimate, showing Alex was even stronger when it struck the Mexican coast, with sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) and a central pressure of [...] Several hours after moving ashore, the storm weakened to Category1 status, and its structure began to deteriorate. However, deep convection persisted around the center. By 1200UTC, Alex had weakened into a tropical storm; by 0000UTC July2, the Sierra Madre Oriental disrupted Alex's core, causing the storm to weaken into a tropical depression and dissipate over San Luis Potosí. However, the interaction with the mountain range caused orographic lift {{on the eastern side}} of the storm after the center of circulation had ceased to exist, producing torrential rainfall throughout northern and central Mexico. Following the dissipation of Alex, divergence at the 200mb atmospheric pressure level (approximately at [...] of altitude), a ridge of high pressure located over southern Texas, and Alex's <b>residual</b> <b>moisture</b> interacted to produce intense convection over Nuevo León, Tamaulipas and Coahuila for the next 72hours.|$|E

50|$|Another {{improvement}} is applied at the regeneration stage when the residual filter cake is removed by back-flushing the clean plant water {{to wash the}} internal ceramic filter. Filter cake dewatering of ceramic filters produces low final cake moistures at minimum operation and maintenance costs. The <b>residuals</b> <b>moisture</b> are removed from the filter cake due to capillary action within the ceramic elements, which rotate above the slurry level. This process gives maximum filtration, and the final cake can be maintained at the lowest moisture content due to the effective cleaning of both ceramic sectors. In addition, performance can be optimized by using an ultrasonic cleaning system to achieve efficient operation conditions for regeneration of plates. The use of filtrate in looped water cycle in the design operation can reduce the water consumption up to 30-50%. High filtrate purity can be obtained, as there is only 0.001-0.005 g/l solids in the filtrate produced from this process. This eventually results in the reduction of polymer flocculant consumption in thickeners.Ceramic scraper knives have been introduced to this design as {{they are able to}} shave through the mass formed in filter cake dewatering. The remaining layer of solid residue on the filter provides protection from mechanical abrasion. Therefore, the maintenance costs can be reduced while the service life of the ceramic filter increases.|$|R
40|$|Drought is {{the main}} factor {{affecting}} crop grain yield. Increasing grain yield under drought and crop water use efficiency (WUE) is essential for enhancing world crop production and food availability. The objective of this study, carried out in India on 20 durum wheat cultivars, under three water regimes (full irrigation, limited irrigation and <b>residual</b> soil <b>moisture)</b> and during two seasons, {{was to investigate the}} potential use of plant traits (particularly carbon isotope discrimination, [Delta], and ash content, ma) to predict grain yield and WUE in wheat. WUE components were estimated using a soil water balance model (Budget) allowing comparison of environments in data scarce situations. A highly significant correlation was noted between grain yield and grain [Delta] across water regimes. However, the associations between grain yield, [Delta] and ma were found to depend highly on the water regime and environmental conditions. The association between grain yield and grain [Delta] was significant under full irrigation in season 1 and under <b>residual</b> soil <b>moisture</b> in season 2. Significant positive correlations were noted in both seasons between grain yield and leaf [Delta] under <b>residual</b> soil <b>moisture</b> and between grain yield and leaf ash content at anthesis under limited irrigation. A significant correlation was found across environments between grain and leaf [Delta] and T, the quantity of water transpired during the growth cycle, as estimated by the soil water balance model. T also significantly correlated to grain and leaf ma. Variation in WUE across environments was driven more by runoff, drainage and soil evaporation than by harvest index and transpiration. The associations between WUE and transpiration, runoff and [Delta] were negative but not significant. WUE was significantly correlated with leaf and grain ma at maturity. The study indicates that [Delta] and ma can be used as indirect selection criteria for grain yield and suggests that ma is a good predictor of transpiration, grain yield and WUE across environments. The use of mechanistic models that allows differentiating between cultivars should permit in a next future to analyze the relationships between WUE, [Delta] and ma across cultivars and evaluate the possibility to use these traits as predictors of WUE in wheat breeding programs.

40|$|Eritrea’s {{coastal zone}} has been {{identified}} as an area of substantial development potential. About 14, 000 ha of this 5 million ha area (i. e. < 0. 3 %) has already been developed under a form of spate irrigation known locally as jeriff. This is a water diversion and spreading technique in which wadis (ephemeral streams), springing from Eritrea’s Central Highlands are diverted to irrigate land in the coastal plains. The system as it is applied in Sheeb, an area north-east of Asmara, characterised by agro-pastoral spate irrigation, is described. Under spate irrigation, crop growth is entirely dependent on the <b>residual</b> soil <b>moisture</b> stored in the soil profile. If the basin fields are flooded adequately, the resulting <b>residual</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is sufficient for two or sometimes three crop harvests. The spate irrigation system builds up land by depositing rich sediment on the fields, but therefore, the elevation of the irrigated lands rises every year. Moreover, the system requires huge numbers of trees annually for constructing diversion structures which are subsequently often washed away by heavy floods. In general, the overall irrigation efficiencies of spate schemes are only about 20 % because of the difficulty of controlling floods and because water is lost by percolation, seepage and evaporation. Suggestions are made to improve the system and make it more sustainable: permanent flood diversion and distribution structures should be built to effectively divert the floods and to reduce water loss through percolation and seepage, and the basin fields should be properly levelled to distribute the floodwater uniformly over the entire field...|$|R
