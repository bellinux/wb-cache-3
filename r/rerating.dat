Originally {{designated}} as a 44-gun ship, her redesign by Fox led to a <b>rerating,</b> apparently based on her smaller dimensions when compared to Congress and Constellation. Joshua Humphreys may have rerated Chesapeake to 38guns, or Secretary Stoddert rerated Congress and Constellation to 38 guns because they were larger than Chesapeake, which was rated to 36 guns. The most recent information on her rating is from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, which states she was rerated [...] "from 44guns to 36, eventually increased to 38". Her gun rating remained a matter of confusion throughout her career; Fox used a 44-gun rating in his correspondence with Secretary Stoddert. In preparing for the War of 1812 Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton directed Captain Samuel Evans to recruit the number of crewmen required for a 44-gun ship. Hamilton was corrected by William Bainbridge in a letter stating, [...] "There is a mistake in the crew ordered for the Chesapeake, as it equals in number the crews of our 44-gun frigates, whereas the Chesapeake is {{of the class of}} the Congress and Constellation."

40|$|Lecturepg. 41 The authors present two {{case studies}} where {{improperly}} applied hydraulics resulted in poor mechanical reliability, due to chronic flow instability problems. A successful hydraulic <b>rerate</b> of these pumps, which required minimal modifications {{to their original}} pump casings and no modifications to the piping, drivers, or baseplates, dramatically improve their reliability and reduced annual repair costs. The first case study describes the <b>rerate</b> of a 4 X 6 X 13, 3560 rpm, 300 hp, single suction overhung pump and its spare, which were averaging between seven and 12 failures per year from 1990 to 1995. The second case study involves the <b>rerate</b> of a 12 X 14 X 23, 1780 rpm, 600 hp, double suction, between bearings pump and its spare, which were experiencing three to five failures per year. Both <b>rerates</b> involved selecting an impeller pattern with a best efficiency point closer to actual operating conditions and an acceptable suction specific speed (Nss < 11, 000), and then modifying the pump casing to obtain the proper volute throat areas for the desired performance. The pumps in both case studies realized marked improvements in reliability {{as a result of}} the hydraulic <b>rerates.</b> The authors will take the readers through the <b>rerate</b> process, illustrating the key steps involved, and explain which types of problematic pumps qualify for this conversion.

40|$|LecturePg. 91 - 100 Performance {{verification}} of centrifugal compressor <b>rerates</b> creates a unique challenge to turbomachinery users. It {{is not often}} practical to perform flange-to-flange performance tests on machinery already installed in the field, as the redundant instrumentation necessary to conduct a reliable test is rarely present onsite. In addition, <b>rerated</b> units are typically commissioned during a turnaround where time constraints do not allow the luxury of a test. In some cases, {{it may be possible}} to remove a relatively small compressor body from the site and shop test it. However, in almost all circumstances the cost associated with doing so is prohibitively expensive. This leaves the user faced with the dilemma of being uncertain of a <b>rerated</b> compressor's performance until it is actually run with the new process. A solution is proposed to the problem of performance verification for <b>rerated</b> centrifugal compressors. Single stage scale model testing of the aerodynamic elements that comprise a compressor stage is a proven method used by original equipment manufacturers in the development of new components. This practice may also be used to find the performance of aerodynamic elements intended to be used in compressor <b>rerates.</b> If the test proves successful, the design can be incorporated with a high degree of confidence that the equipment will operate as expected. After the <b>rerate</b> is complete, the performance can be verified through limited field testing. The details a single stage testing program as well as the independent field performance {{verification of}} four very different compressors are presented. Two of the units under consideration were single body. The other unit consisted of a two-body compressor train. The compressors under consideration were originally supplied by three different original equipment manufacturers. The full scale hardware consisted of impellers ranging in size from 17. 0 in to 43. 5 in in diameter. The scale factors used to model the aerodynamic stage ranged from 0. 81 to 0. 25. A total of seven different stages were single stage scale model tested between the three compressors. The limited field testing used only the existing instrumentation previously installed on the compressor trains. After the field variables were taken into account, it was found that the predicted performance was in good agreement with actual compressor operations...|$|R

40|$|Current design {{improvements}} of {{both the}} rotating and stationary aerodynamic components of centrifugal compressors can greatly increase the efficiency of vintage machines. A centrifugal compressor built in the 1970 's or 1980 's might have an external polytropic efficiency in the high 70 's, whereas a newer compressor might have an efficiency over 85 percent. Centrifugal compressors are designed to operate at a best efficiency point (BEP) shown on its performance map.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 215 - 232 Refineries, {{petrochemical}} companies, and gas processors {{are continually}} trying to increase plant production while budgets are getting tighter. <b>Rerating</b> process centrifugal compressors {{has become an}} ever-increasing trend {{as a solution to}} this problem. Existing hardware, however, has its limitations. The limiting factors can be different for different applications of the same equipment. When <b>rerating</b> existing compressors cannot adequately meet increased compression production demands, new equipment must be added to an existing plant or a new plant must be built. Both of these scenarios require the purchase of new compressors. Realizing that eventually a new plant may expand or increase production to respond to increased demand, and that the differential cost for a new compressor is high, it makes sense to consider the future uprateability of new compressors when they are initially purchased and built. Discussions in this paper will give the rotating equipment engineer guidance when evaluating the design of a centrifugal compressor [...] either new or rerated, including a list of items that should be reviewed; and guidelines that should be followed.
