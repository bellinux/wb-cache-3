40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{has become}} an important measurement of scheduling algorithms in virtualized data centers. One of the challenges of energy-efficient scheduling algorithms, however, is the trade-off between minimizing energy consumption and satisfying quality of service (e. g. performance, resource availability on time for reservation requests). We consider resource needs {{in the context of}} virtualized data centers of a private cloud system, which provides <b>resource</b> <b>leases</b> in terms of virtual machines (VMs) for user applications. In this paper, we propose heuristics for scheduling VMs that address the above challenge. On performance evaluation, simulated results have shown a significant reduction on total energy consumption of our proposed algorithms compared with an existing First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm with the same fulfillment of performance requirements. We also discuss the improvement of energy saving when additionally using migration policies to the above mentioned algorithms.

40|$|<b>Leasing</b> {{computational}} <b>resources</b> for on-demand computing is now {{a viable}} option for providers of network services. Temporary spikes or lulls in demand for a service can be accommodated by flexible leasing arrangements. From the service provider’s perspective the problem is how many <b>resources</b> to <b>lease</b> and for how long. In this work we formulate and solve the <b>resource</b> <b>leasing</b> problem for {{the case of a}} single service. The objective is to minimize the cost of <b>leasing</b> <b>resources</b> while still maintaining an adequate quality of service, which we measure by the average wait time of requests. Demand for the service and execution times of service requests are modelled as random variables. The problem is formulated as a continuous-time, infinite-horizon Markov decision problem. We use the dynamic programming method of value iteration for its solution and we characterize the resulting optimal cost function. We find that the cost of providing a service is convex-like in the number of <b>resources</b> <b>leased</b> and nondecreasing in the number of requests in the system. Close examination of the optimal cost function shows that the cost of providing a service is more sensitive to under-deployment than to over-deployment. Thus, when demand for the service is known to exist, but is unpredictable, it is better to <b>lease</b> more <b>resources</b> than fewer resources. ...|$|R

40|$|As cluster {{computers}} {{are used for}} {{a wider range of}} applications, we encounter the need to deliver resources at particular times, to meet particular deadlines, and/or {{at the same time as}} other resources are provided elsewhere. To address such requirements, we describe a scheduling approach in which users request <b>resource</b> <b>leases,</b> where leases can request either as-soon-as-possible (“best-effort”) or reservation start times. We present the design of a lease management architecture, Haizea, that implements leases as virtual machines (VMs), leveraging their ability to suspend, migrate, and resume computations and to provide leased resources with customized application environments. We discuss methods to minimize the overhead introduced by having to deploy VM images before the start of a lease. We also present the results of simulation studies that compare alternative approaches. Using workloads with various mixes of best-effort and advance reservation requests, we compare the performance of our VM-based approach with that of non-VMbased schedulers. We find that a VM-based approach can provide better performance (measured in terms of both total execution time and average delay incurred by best-effort requests) than a scheduler that does not support task pre-emption, and only slightly worse performance than a scheduler that does support task pre-emption. We also compare the impact of different VM image popularity distributions and VM image caching strategies on performance. These results emphasize the importance of VM image caching for the workloads studied and quantify the sensitivity of scheduling performance to VM image popularity distribution...|$|E
40|$|Using {{clusters}} of servers and datacenters to process {{large numbers of}} data- and computation-intensive jobs is becoming mainstream. The need for large clusters {{is driven by the}} fact that many workloads are growing at a faster rate than the advances in single computer performance. To manage processing in a cluster of multiple computers, several frameworks have appeared over the years. These frameworks supply the user with convenient computation constructs and abstract from the low-level implementations to relieve the burden of inter-process communication and task placement in a cluster. However, these frameworks often assume total control over a static partition of the cluster, leading to under-utilization in times when one framework is over-committed with work, whereas another framework is idling. To overcome this under-utilization, and multiplex frameworks in clusters, cluster schedulers have been proposed, which sit on top of the hardware resources and schedule hardware <b>resource</b> <b>leases</b> to frameworks. It is not well described how these systems differ from each other. Furthermore, how to achieve performance balance between frameworks, such that multiple frameworks achieve similar performance metrics when running time-varying workloads is relatively unexplored. We define a taxonomy which describes the combination of cluster schedulers and frameworks, called Two-Level schedulers in general. We characterize the multiple state-of-the-art cluster schedulers that are described in the literature or are used in practice. We distinguish multiple aspects which define the cluster schedulers. These aspects can dictate how frameworks interface with the cluster scheduler and can also influence framework performance. We aim to achieve performance balance for multiple spark frameworks running under the mesos cluster scheduler. First, we evaluate the performance of a single framework running single interactive data analytics queries. We find multiple configuration parameters which influence the performance for interactive queries. However, we conclude that using sparkmesos for interactive queries results in either inefficient use of resources, or does not allow us to multiplex resources over multiple frameworks. We continue with achieving performance balance for multiple frameworks for non-interactive queries. We first establish a baseline performance balance, which we attain by using knowledge of the possibly different workload intensities run by the frameworks in a real cluster. Afterwards, we achieve similar performance balance, compared to the baseline, for up to three frameworks without knowing the workload intensity a priori. This is achieved by using a feedback loop controller, which updates resource share sizes allocated to frameworks dynamically, based on the online performance metrics of the frameworks.

Computation cost is based on the number of instructions and the processing capacity of a node, which is measured as instructions per time.

For comparison purposes, the permanent leasing strategy is also investigated. In the permanent spectrum leasing strategy, a fixed number of resources is permanently rented. On the other hand, the intuition behind the dynamic spectrum leasing strategy is to attempt to rent a channel only when needed and release {{it as soon as}} it is not needed. Finally, the intuition behind the anticipated spectrum leasing strategy is to attempt renting resources in advance (and release rented resources only when a preset minimum number of resources is achieved) to increase the probability of having available resource to be used when needed.

30|$|In this paper, {{dynamic and}} {{anticipated}} <b>resource</b> <b>leasing</b> strategies {{to address the}} problem of <b>leased</b> <b>resource</b> availability are investigated. Then, network performance analysis is developed, and the performance evaluations of different leasing strategies (namely permanent, dynamic, and anticipated leasing strategies) are provided for some network scenarios. The developed mathematical model additionally considers non-homogeneous bandwidth requirement, where different primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) may require a number of channels. The tradeoff between spectrum leasing cost and system Erlang capacity (defined as the maximum offered traffic for which all the QoS requirements are guaranteed) is also investigated. Specifically, the maximum Erlang capacity is obtained by optimizing the number of reserved channels for different traffic scenarios considering a maximum allowed number of simultaneously rented channels. Also, the minimum achievable cost per Erlang is obtained by considering a fractional number of leased channels. Additionally, the cost per Erlang of capacity as function of both the utilization factor of the primary resources and the maximum allowed number of simultaneously rented channels is evaluated. Numerical results demonstrate that system performance strongly depends on the value of the mean secondary service time relative to the mean primary service time. Also, numerical results show that the cost of leasing a spectrum band is drastically reduced (compared to the permanent leasing strategy) when dynamic spectrum leasing strategies are employed.|$|R
