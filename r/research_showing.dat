25|$|Decades of {{research}} {{have shown that}} substantial changes occur in the lowest neocortical processing areas, and that these changes can profoundly alter the pattern of neuronal activation in response to experience. Neuroscientific research indicates that experience can actually change both the brain's physical structure (anatomy) and functional organization (physiology). , neuroscientists {{are engaged in a}} reconciliation of critical-period studies (demonstrating the immutability of the brain after development) with the more recent <b>research</b> <b>showing</b> how the brain can, and does, change in response to hitherto unsuspected stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) is an {{advocacy}} group founded in 2002 by Robert Verkerk and based in the United Kingdom. The ANH was initially founded to raise funds to finance a legal challenge of the EU Food Supplement Directive. The ANH lobbies against regulation of dietary supplements and in favor of alternative medical approaches such as homeopathy, and also advocates a healthy diet, exercise, and other lifestyle approaches to health. Verkerk rejects scientific <b>research</b> <b>showing</b> that megadoses of vitamins lack any health benefit.|$|E

While a mediation, statistically speaking, clarifies the mechanism underlying the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, Wolley agreed {{in an interview with the}} Harvard Business Review that these findings are saying that groups of women are smarter than groups of men. However, she relativizes this stating that the actual important thing is the high social sensitivity of group members.|$|E
25|$|The <b>research</b> <b>showing</b> {{benefits}} from action games {{has been questioned}} due to methodological shortcomings, such as recruitment strategies and selection bias, potential placebo effects, and lack of baseline improvements in control groups. In addition, many of the studies are cross-sectional, and of the longitudinal interventional trials, not all have found effects. A response to this {{pointed out that the}} skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted, such as mental rotation, which is not a common task in action games. Action gamers are not only better at ignoring distractions, but also at focusing on the main task.|$|E
25|$|A newer {{model for}} {{improvement}} in medical care takes its origin {{from the work}} of W. Edwards Deming in a model of Total Quality Management. In this model, there is an attempt to identify the underlying system defect that allowed the opportunity for the error to occur. As an example, in such a system the error of free flow IV administration of Heparin is dealt with by not using IV heparin and substituting subcutaneous administration of heparin, obviating the entire problem. However, such an approach presupposes available <b>research</b> <b>showing</b> that subcutaneous heparin is as effective as IV. Thus, most systems use a combination of approaches to the problem.|$|E

25|$|Though smoking {{cessation}} is generally now {{a goal of}} mental health clinicians, {{there is a lack}} of empirical <b>research</b> <b>showing</b> successful strategies for accomplishing this goal. However, all studies have shown a reduction in smoking, though not necessarily elimination. Evidence has been found to support the use of sustained-release bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy, atypical antipsychotics, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Better outcomes are seen when two or more cessation strategies are employed, as well as for patients using atypical antipsychotics rather than typical antipsychotics. There is also no evidence for an increase in positive symptoms or side effects following {{smoking cessation}}, while there is evidence for a decrease in negative symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{evolutionary}} history, olfaction {{has served}} various purposes {{related to the}} survival of the species, such as the development of communication. Even in humans and other animals today, these survival and communication aspects are still functioning. There is also evidence suggesting that there are deficits in olfactory memory in individuals with brain degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. These individuals lose the ability to distinguish smells as their disease worsens. There is also <b>research</b> <b>showing</b> that deficits in olfactory memory can act as a base in assessing certain types of mental disorders such as depression as each mental disorder has its own distinct pattern of olfactory deficits.|$|E
