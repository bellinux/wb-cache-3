40|$|Trace {{elements}} were {{measured in the}} <b>rims</b> <b>and</b> interiors of nine chondrules separated from the Chainpur LL- 3 chondrite. Whole rock samples of Chainpur and samples of separated rims were also measured. Chondrule rims are moderately enriched in siderophile and volatile elements relative to the chondrule interiors. The enriched volatile elements include the lithophilic volatile element Zn. The moderate enrichment of volatiles in chondrule <b>rims</b> <b>and</b> the lack of severe depletion in chondrules can account for the complete volatile inventory in Chainpur. These results support a three-component model of chondrite formation in which metal plus sulfide, chondrules plus <b>rims</b> <b>and</b> matrix silicates are mixed to form chondrites...|$|R

5|$|Beginning at the post–World War I 1920 Summer Olympics, the {{lighting}} of the Olympic Flame {{was followed by}} the release of doves, symbolizing peace. (Experienced athletes brought newspapers to cover themselves because of the birds' droppings.) The release was discontinued after several doves perched themselves at the cauldron's <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.|$|E
5|$|Four major rock {{formations}} {{are present in}} Worlds End State Park, all at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The Loyalsock gorge <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> {{the upper part of}} its walls are the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which is formed with grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. Below this is the Mississippian Burgoon Formation, which comprises buff-colored sandstone and conglomerate. The creek bed and base of the gorge walls are the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{released}} as a hardcover on August 25, 2001, published by HarperCollins in Canada, Alfred A. Knopf in the United States, and Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom. Knopf ordered an initial print run of 60,000 copies. It debuted at the #2 sport on the Maclean's fiction bestseller list and peaked at #1 in late September and early October. It was translated {{and published in}} multiple languages, including Japanese and German. The book was {{a finalist for the}} 2001 for the Books in Canada First Novel Award, as well as the Kiriyama Prize, an international literary award for promoting greater understanding of the Pacific <b>Rim</b> <b>and</b> South Asia. It was nominated by the Vancouver Public Library and the Bergen Public Library for the 2003 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotational}} {{axis of the}} Moon lies within Shackleton, only a few kilometers from its center. The crater is 21km in diameter and 4.2km deep. From the Earth, it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough, cratered terrain. It is located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on a massif. The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted. No significant craters intersect the <b>rim,</b> <b>and</b> it is sloped about 1.5° toward the direction 50–90° from the Earth. The age of the crater is about 3.6billion years {{and it has been}} in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years.|$|E
5|$|Seven trails with round-trip {{times of}} {{half an hour}} (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon. Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City. Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer. However, hiking beyond Big Springs {{requires}} a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking. A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West <b>Rim</b> <b>and</b> LaVerkin Creek. The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific <b>Rim</b> <b>and</b> a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E

25|$|A Faraday disk {{can also}} be {{operated}} with neither a galvanometer nor a return path. When the disk spins, the electrons collect along the <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> leave a deficit near the axis (or the other way around). It is possible in principle to measure the distribution of charge, for example, through the electromotive force generated between the <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> the axle (though not necessarily easy). This charge separation will be proportional to the relative rotational velocity between the disk and the magnet.|$|E
25|$|The crater {{must have}} {{originally}} been deep, {{with a high}} mountainous <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> towering central peak. Over time the crater floor has relaxed to the spherical shape of the Tethyan surface, and the crater's <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> central peak have collapsed (similar relaxation is apparent on Jupiter's moons Callisto and Ganymede). This indicates {{that at the time}} of the Odysseus impact, Tethys must have been sufficiently warm and malleable to allow the topography to collapse; its interior may have even been liquid. If Tethys had been colder and more brittle at the time of impact, the moon might have been shattered, and even if it survived the impact, the topography of the crater would have retained its shape, similarly to the crater Herschel on Mimas.|$|E
