Functional brain {{networks}} produce connected {{low frequency}} patterns of activity when {{the brain is}} at rest which can be analyzed with resting state functional MRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> by fitting general linear models for signals acquired at a pre-defined seed region and other regions of interest (ROIs). However, typ-ical <b>rs-fMRI</b> analysis tends to ignore spatial correlations in <b>rs-fMRI</b> data, hence biases the standard errors of estimated parameters and leads to incorrect inference. Spatio-temporal or spatio-spectral models can incorporate the spatial correlations in fMRI data. To date, these models have not targeted <b>rs-fMRI</b> connectivity analysis. Herein, we expand a spatio-spectral model from fMRI analysis based on several ROIs to whole brain <b>rs-fMRI</b> connectivity analysis. Our model captures distance-dependent local correlation (within an ROI), dis-tance-independent global correlation (between ROIs), and temporal correlations for whole brain <b>rs-fMRI</b> connectivity analysis with or without confounders. Si-mulated and empirical experiments demonstrate that this spatio-spectral model yields valid inference for whole brain <b>rs-fMRI</b> connectivity analysis...|$|E
40|$|The multi-scan resting state fMRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> dataset was {{recently}} released; thus the test-retest (TRT) reliability of <b>rs-fMRI</b> measures can be assessed. However, because this dataset was acquired {{only from a}} single group under a single condition, we cannot directly evaluate whether the <b>rs-fMRI</b> measures can generate reproducible between-condition or between-group results. Because the modulation of resting state activity has gained increasing attention, {{it is important to}} know whether one <b>rs-fMRI</b> metric can reliably detect the alteration of the resting activity. Here, we shared a public Eyes-Open (EO) /Eyes-Closed (EC) dataset for evaluating the split-half reproducibility of the <b>rs-fMRI</b> measures in detecting changes of the resting state activity between EO and EC. As examples, we assessed the split-half reproducibility of three widely applied <b>rs-fMRI</b> metrics: amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, and seed-based correlation analysis. Our results demonstrated that reproducible patterns of EO-EC differences can be detected by all three measures, suggesting the feasibility of the EO/EC dataset for performing reproducibility assessment for other <b>rs-fMRI</b> measures...|$|E

However, evidence of its usefulness remains scant, because existing studies have investigated relatively small samples and focused primarily on qualitative evaluation. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the clinical usefulness of <b>rs-fMRI</b> in the context of presurgical mapping of motor functions, and in particular to determine the degree of correspondence with tb-fMRI which, while not a gold-standard, is commonly used in preoperative setting. A group of 13 patients with lesions close to the sensorimotor cortex underwent <b>rs-fMRI</b> and tb-fMRI to localize the hand, foot and mouth motor areas. We assessed quantitatively the degree of correspondence between multiple <b>rs-fMRI</b> analyses (independent-component and seed-based analyses) and tb-fMRI, with reference to sensitivity and specificity of <b>rs-fMRI</b> with respect to tb-fMRI, and centre-of-mass distances. Agreement with electro-cortical stimulation (ECS) was also investigated, and a traditional map thresholding approach based on agreement between two experienced operators was compared to an automatic threshold determination method. <b>Rs-fMRI</b> can localize the sensorimotor cortex successfully, providing anatomical specificity for hand, foot and mouth motor subregions, in particular with seed-based analyses. Agreement with tb-fMRI was only partial and <b>rs-fMRI</b> tended to provide larger patterns of correlated activity.

40|$|Resting state {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> provides a powerful tool to examine large-scale neural networks in the human brain and their disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders. Thanks to its low demand and high tolerance, resting state paradigms can be easily acquired from clinical population. However, due to the unconstrained nature, resting state paradigm is associated with excessive head movement and proneness to sleep. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of <b>rs-fMRI</b> measures is moderate at best, falling short of widespread use in the clinic. Here, we characterized the effect of sleep on the test-retest reliability of <b>rs-fMRI.</b> Using measures of heart rate variability (HRV) derived from simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, we identified portions of fMRI data when subjects were more alert or sleepy, and examined their effects on the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity measures. When volumes of sleep were excluded, the reliability of <b>rs-fMRI</b> is significantly improved, and the improvement appears to be general across brain networks. The amount of improvement is robust with the removal of as much as 60 % volumes of sleepiness. Therefore, test-retest reliability of <b>rs-fMRI</b> is affected by sleep and could be improved by excluding volumes of sleepiness as indexed by HRV.

To reduce this problem, distortion correction (DC) with field map is widely used for both task and resting-state fMRI (<b>rs-fMRI).</b> Although DC with field map has been reported {{to improve the quality of}} task fMRI, little is known about its effects on <b>rs-fMRI.</b> Here, we tested the influence of field-map DC on <b>rs-fMRI</b> results using two <b>rs-fMRI</b> datasets derived from 40 healthy subjects: one with DC (DC+) and the other without correction (DC−). Independent component analysis followed by the dual regression approach was used for evaluation of resting-state functional connectivity networks (RSN). We also obtained the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency signal power (0. 01 – 0. 1 Hz and above 0. 1 Hz, respectively; LFHF ratio) to assess the quality of <b>rs-fMRI</b> signals. For comparison of RSN between DC+ and DC− datasets, the default mode network showed more robust functional connectivity in the DC+ dataset than the DC− dataset. Basal ganglia RSN showed some decreases in functional connectivity primarily in white matter, indicating imperfect registration/normalization without DC. Supplementary seed-based and simulation analyses supported the utility of DC. Furthermore, we found a higher LFHF ratio after field map correction in the anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and cerebellum.

40|$|Resting State fMRI (<b>RS-fMRI)</b> {{represents}} an emerging and powerful tool to explore brain functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with neurologic disorders. Compared to activation/task-related fMRI, <b>RS-fMRI</b> has the advantages that (i) BOLD fMRI signals are self-generated and independent of subject’s performance during {{the task and}} (ii) a single dataset is sufficient to extract a set of RS networks (RSNs) that allows to explore whole brain FC. According to these features <b>RS-fMRI</b> appears particularly suitable {{for the study of}} FC changes related to multiple sclerosis (MS). In the present review we will first give a brief description of <b>RS-fMRI</b> methodology and then an overview of most relevant studies conducted so far in MS by using this approach. The most interesting results, in particular, regard the default-mode network (DMN), whose FC changes have been correlated with cognitive status of MS patients, and the visual RSN (V-RSN) whose FC changes have been correlated with visual recovery after optic neuritis. The executive control network (ECN), the lateralized frontoparietal network (FPN), and the sensory motor network (SMN) have also been investigated in MS, showing significant FC rearrangements. All together, <b>RS-fMRI</b> studies conducted so far in MS suggest that prominent RS-FC changes can be detected in many RSNs and correlate with clinical and/or structural MRI measures.

40|$|Resting state fMRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> is {{commonly}} used to study the brain's intrinsic neural coupling, which reveals specific spatiotemporal patterns {{in the form of}} resting state networks (RSNs). It has been hypothesized that slow <b>rs-fMRI</b> oscillations (5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured <b>rs-fMRI</b> in humans while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. The two driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's α rhythm (8 - 12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope. We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two different coupling modes where either α oscillations were synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS). Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased <b>rs-fMRI</b> connectivity within the stimulated RSN compared with phase-synchronized or no tACS. This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for patients with altered <b>rs-fMRI</b> connectivity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Resting state fMRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> has become an important tool to estimate brain connectivity. However, relatively little is known about how slow hemodynamic oscillations measured with fMRI relate to electrophysiological processes. It was suggested that slowly fluctuating power envelopes of electrophysiological signals synchronize across brain areas and that the topography of this activity is spatially correlated to resting state networks derived from <b>rs-fMRI.</b> Here we take a novel approach to address this problem and establish a causal link between the power fluctuations of electrophysiological signals and <b>rs-fMRI</b> via a new neuromodulation paradigm, which exploits these power synchronization mechanisms. These novel mechanistic insights bridge different scientific domains and are of broad interest to researchers in the fields of Medical Imaging, Neuroscience, Physiology, and Psychology. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Resting state {{functional}} MRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> {{and functional}} connectivity mapping have become widely used {{tools in the}} human neuroimaging community and their use is rapidly spreading {{into the realm of}} rodent research as well. One of the many attractive features of <b>rs-fMRI</b> is that it is readily translatable from humans to animals and back again. Changes in functional connectivity observed in human studies can be followed by more invasive animal experiments to determine the neurophysiological basis for the alterations, while exploratory work in animal models can identify possible biomarkers for further investigation in human studies. These types of interwoven human and animal experiments have a potentially large impact on neuroscience and clinical practice. However, impediments exist to the optimal application of <b>rs-fMRI</b> in small animals, some similar to those encountered in humans and some quite different. In this review we identify the most prominent of these barriers, discuss differences between <b>rs-fMRI</b> in rodents and in humans, highlight best practices for animal studies, and review selected applications of <b>rs-fMRI</b> in rodents.

40|$|Resting-state {{functional}} MRI (<b>RS-fMRI)</b> is {{a widely}} used method for inferring connectivity between brain regions or nodes. As with task-based fMRI, the spatial specificity of the connectivity maps can be distorted by the strong biasing effect of the BOLD signal in macroscopic veins. In <b>RS-fMRI</b> this effect is exacerbated by the temporal coherences of physiological origin between large veins that are widely distributed in the brain. In gradient echo based EPI, used {{for the vast majority}} of <b>RS-fMRI,</b> macroscopic veins that carry BOLD-related changes exhibit a strong phase response. This allows for post-processing identification and removal of venous signals using a phase regressor technique. Here, we employ this approach to suppress macrovascular venous contributions in high-field whole-brain <b>RS-fMRI</b> data sets, resulting in significant changes to both the spatial localization of the networks and the correlations between the network nodes. These effects were observed at both the individual and group analysis level, suggesting that venous contamination is a confounding factor for <b>RS-fMRI</b> studies even at relatively low image resolutions. Suppression of the macrovascular signal using the phase regression approach may therefore help to better identify, delineate, and interpret the true structure of large-scale brain networks...|$|E
40|$|The resting-state fMRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> {{signal is}} {{affected}} {{by a variety of}} low-frequency physiological phenomena, including variations in cardiac-rate (CRV), respiratory-volume (RVT), and end-tidal CO 2 (PETCO 2). While these effects have become better understood in recent years, the impact that their correction has on the quality of <b>rs-fMRI</b> measurements has yet to be clarified. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effect of correcting for CRV, RVT and PETCO 2 on the <b>rs-fMRI</b> measurements. Nine healthy subjects underwent a test-retest <b>rs-fMRI</b> acquisition using repetition times (TRs) of 2 s (long-TR) and 0. 323 s (short-TR), and the data were processed using eight different physiological correction strategies. Subsequently, regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and resting-state connectivity of the motor and default-mode networks are calculated for each strategy. Reproducibility is calculated using intra-class correlation and the Dice Coefficient, while the accuracy of functional-connectivity measures is assessed through network separability, sensitivity and specificity. We found that: (1) the reproducibility of the <b>rs-fMRI</b> measures improved significantly after correction for PETCO 2; (2) separability of functional networks increased after PETCO 2 correction but was not affected by RVT and CRV correction; (3) the effect of physiological correction does not depend on the data sampling-rate; (4) the effect of physiological processes and correction strategies is network-specific.

A total of 42 consecutive patients with focal epilepsy were enrolled. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of visually assessed <b>RS-fMRI,</b> MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), video electroencephalography (VEEG), and positron-emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) in EZ localization were evaluated to assess their diagnostic abilities.

40|$|Resting-state fMRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> is {{receiving}} substantial attention for its sensitivity to functional abnormality {{in the brain}} networks of people with psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, because {{of the variety of}} <b>rs-fMRI</b> processing methods, the necessity of <b>rs-fMRI</b> quality assurance is increasing. Conventionally, the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is generally adopted for quality examination, but the tSNR does not guarantee reliable functional connectivity (FC) outcomes. Theoretically, intrinsic FC is supposed to reflect the spontaneous synchronization of neuronal basis, rather than that from thermal noise or non-neuronal physiological noise. Therefore, we proposed a new quality-assurance index for <b>rs-fMRI</b> to estimate the physiological contributions in spontaneous oscillations (PICSO). The PICSO index was designed as a voxel-wise measure for facilitating practical applications to all existing <b>rs-fMRI</b> data sets on the basis of two assumptions: Gaussian distributions in temporal fluctuations and ultra-slow changes of neural-based physiological fluctuations. To thoroughly validate the sensitivity of the proposed PICSO index to FC, we calibrated the preprocessing steps according to phantom data and verified the relationship between the PICSO and factors that are considered to affect FC in healthy participants (n = 12). Our results demonstrated that FC showed a significantly positive correlation with the PICSO. Moreover, for generating robust FC outcomes, directly acquiring data at a relatively large voxel size was more effective than performing smoothness on high-resolution data sets. In conclusion, compared with tSNR, the PICSO index is more sensitive to the resulting FC, providing a practical quality-assurance indicator for all existing <b>rs-fMRI</b> data sets...|$|E
40|$|Resting-state {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (<b>RS-fMRI)</b> is a technique used to investigate the spontaneous correlations of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals across different regions of the brain. Using functional connectivity tools, it is possible to investigate a specific <b>RS-fMRI</b> network, referred to as "default-mode" (DM) network, that involves cortical regions deactivated in fMRI experiments with cognitive tasks. Previous works have reported a significant effect of aging on DM regions activity. Independent component analysis (ICA) is often used for generating spatially distributed DM functional connectivity patterns from <b>RS-fMRI</b> data without the need for a reference region. This aspect and the relatively easy setup of an <b>RS-fMRI</b> experiment even in clinical trials have boosted the combined use of <b>RS-fMRI</b> and ICA-based DM analysis for noninvasive research of brain disorders. In this work, we considered different strategies for combining ICA results from individual-level and population-level analyses and used them to evaluate and predict the effect of aging on the DM component. Using <b>RS-fMRI</b> data from 20 normal subjects and a previously developed group-level ICA methodology, we generated group DM maps and showed that the overall ICA-DM connectivity is negatively correlated with age. A negative correlation of the ICA voxel weights with age existed in all DM regions at a variable degree. As an alternative approach, we generated a distributed DM spatial template and evaluated the correlation of each individual DM component fit to this template with age. Using a "leave-one-out" procedure, we discuss the importance of removing the bias from the DM template-generation process...|$|E

Recently, resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> has been applied as a non-invasive tool in many studies to assess functional abnormalities observed in PD without the effects of particular motor or cognitive tasks. In this review, we summarized 50 original PD <b>rs-fMRI</b> studies and subdivided them based on the medication status of the patients to highlight the impact of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) when <b>rs-fMRI</b> was used to assess patients with PD. Although there are many different published approaches to analyzing <b>rs-fMRI</b> in PD, it seems that DRT plays a critical role in the functional reorganization of the brain throughout all of these approaches. In particular, studies that compared PD patients with and without medication demonstrated that DRT normalizes aberrant functional patterns in PD and leads to an improvement of PD symptoms. Thus, researchers should consider DRT as a confounding factor, which could result in misinterpretations. We suggest that performing <b>rs-fMRI</b> in de novo patients could be a method of choice to study the fundamental functional abnormalities in PD independent of the effects of DRT. However, it is necessary to carefully control for excessive involuntary head motions in the patients not receiving DRT. On the other hand, recruiting patients under daily DRT might be favorable to assess particular interventions in clinical routine...|$|E

Resting-state functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> is widely used to study functional organization of the brain, but it remains unclear whether <b>rs-fMRI</b> could elucidate distinct characteristics in moyamoya disease. Here, we aimed to determine changes in a conventional <b>rs-fMRI</b> measure and analyze any associations with clinical symptoms and cerebral hemodynamics. Thirty-one adults with moyamoya disease and 25 adult controls underwent <b>rs-fMRI,</b> in which we measured brain connectivity via temporal correlations of low-frequency BOLD signals. We identified the extent of between-group differences with multivoxel pattern analysis. Seed-based analysis was performed to determine associations with vascular lesions, symptoms, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). There was significantly altered connectivity in the precentral gyrus, operculo-insular region, precuneus, cingulate cortex, and middle frontal gyrus in moyamoya disease. There was reduced connectivity in the left insula, left precuneus, right precentral, and right middle frontal regions, which form part of the salience, default mode, motor, and central executive networks, respectively. Patients with ischemic motor-related symptoms showed significantly decreased connectivity in precentral homotopic regions compared with those without, while there were no differences in vascular lesions or rCBF. Connectivity between the right occipital and left hippocampus was significantly associated with cognitive performance and posterior cerebral artery involvement. Our results demonstrate distinct alterations in the temporal correlations of low-frequency BOLD signals, predominantly in resting-state networks in moyamoya disease.

40|$|Resting-state {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (<b>RS-FMRI)</b> holds the promise of revealing brain functional connectivity without requiring specific tasks targeting particular brain systems. <b>RS-FMRI</b> is being used to find differences between populations even when a specific candidate target for traditional inferences is lacking. However, the problem with <b>RS-FMRI</b> is a lacking definition of what constitutes noise and signal. <b>RS-FMRI</b> is easy to acquire but is not easy to analyze or draw inferences from. In this commentary we discuss a problem that is still treated lightly despite its significant impact on <b>RS-FMRI</b> inferences; global signal regression (GSReg), the practice of projecting out signal averaged over the entire brain, can change resting-state correlations in ways that dramatically alter correlation patterns and hence conclusions about brain functional connectedness. Although Murphy et al. in 2009 demonstrated that GSReg negatively biases correlations, the approach remains in wide use. We revisit this issue to argue the problem that GSReg is more than negative bias or the interpretability of negative correlations. Its usage can fundamentally alter interregional correlations within a group, or their differences between groups. We used an illustrative model to clearly convey our objections and derived equations formalizing our conclusions. We hope this creates a clear context in which counterarguments can be made. We conclude that GSReg should not be used when studying <b>RS-FMRI</b> because GSReg biases correlations differently in different regions depending on the underlying true interregional correlation structure. GSReg can alter local and long-range correlations, potentially spreading underlying group differences to regions that may never have had any. Conclusions also apply to substitutions of GSReg for denoising with decompositions of signals aggregated over the network's regions to the extent they cannot separate signals of interest from noise. We touch on the need for careful accounting of nuisance parameters when making group comparisons of correlation maps...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{findings}} {{associated with}} resting-state cortical networks have provided {{insight into the}} brain’s organizational structure. In addition to their neuro-scientific implications, the networks identified by resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> may prove useful for clinical brain mapping. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that a data-driven approach to analyze resting-state networks (RSNs) is useful in identifying regions classically understood to be eloquent cortex as well as other functional networks. METHODS: This study included 6 patients undergoing surgical treatment for intrac-table epilepsy and 7 patients undergoing tumor resection. <b>rs-fMRI</b> data were obtained before surgery and 7 canonical RSNs were identified by an artificial neural network algorithm. Of these 7, the motor and language networks were then compared with electrocortical stimulation (ECS) as the gold standard in the epilepsy patients. The sensitivity and specificity for identifying these eloquent sites were calculated at varying thresholds, which yielded receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their associated area under the curve (AUC). RSNs were plotted in the tumor patients to observe RSN distortions in altered anatomy. RESULTS: The algorithm robustly identified all networks in all patients, including those with distorted anatomy. When all ECS-positive sites were considered for motor and language, <b>rs-fMRI</b> had AUCs of 0. 80 and 0. 64, respectively. When the ECS-positive sites were analyzed pairwise, <b>rs-fMRI</b> had AUCs of 0. 89 and 0. 76 for motor and language, respectively. CONCLUSION: A data-driven approach to <b>rs-fMRI</b> may be a new and efficient method for preoperative localization of numerous functional brain regions...|$|E
40|$|Resting-state fMRI (<b>RS-fMRI)</b> {{has been}} drawing {{more and more}} {{attention}} in recent years. However, a publicly available, systematically integrated and easy-to-use tool for <b>RS-fMRI</b> data processing is still lacking. We developed a toolkit {{for the analysis of}} <b>RS-fMRI</b> data, namely the RESting-state fMRI data analysis Toolkit (REST). REST was developed in MATLAB with graphical user interface (GUI). After data preprocessing with SPM or AFNI, a few analytic methods can be performed in REST, including functional connectivity analysis based on linear correlation, regional homogeneity, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and fractional ALFF. A few additional functions were implemented in REST, including a DICOM sorter, linear trend removal, bandpass filtering, time course extraction, regression of covariates, image calculator, statistical analysis, and slice viewer (for result visualization, multiple comparison correction, etc.).

40|$|Objectives: Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) {{are diagnosed}} based on early-manifesting clinical symptoms, including markedly impaired social communication. We assessed {{the viability of}} resting-state functional MRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> connectivity measures as diagnostic biomarkers for ASD and investigated which connectivity features are predictive of a diagnosis. Methods: <b>Rs-fMRI</b> scans from 59 high functioning males with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) males were used to build a series of machine learning classifiers. Classification features were obtained using 3 sets of brain regions. Another set of classifiers was built from participants' scores on behavioral metrics. An additional age and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset ([URL] were included for replication. Results: High classification accuracy was achieved through several <b>rs-fMRI</b> methods (peak accuracy 76. 67 %). However, classification via behavioral measures consistently surpassed <b>rs-fMRI</b> classifiers (peak accuracy 95. 19 %). The class probability estimates, P(ASD|fMRI data), from brain-based classifiers significantly correlated with scores on a measure of social functioning, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), as did the most informative features from 2 of the 3 sets of brain-based features. The most informative connections predominantly originated from regions strongly associated with social functioning. Conclusions: While individuals can be classified as having ASD with statistically significant accuracy from their <b>rs-fMRI</b> scans alone, this method falls short of biomarker standards. Classification methods provided further evidence that ASD functional connectivity is characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional networks, particularly those involved in social information processing...|$|E

Our goal was to define a novel indicator of neuronal activity based on a first-order textural feature of the resting state functional MRI (<b>RS-fMRI)</b> signal. Furthermore, we examined the association between this neuronal activity metric and glucose metabolism from F- 18 FDG-PET. We studied 15 normal elderly controls (NEC) and 15 probable Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. An independent component analysis {{was applied to the}} <b>RS-fMRI,</b> followed by template matching to identify neuronal components (NC). A regional brain activity measurement was constructed based on the variation of the <b>RS-fMRI</b> signal of these NC. The standardized glucose uptake values of several brain regions relative to the cerebellum (SUVR) were measured from partial volume corrected FDG-PET images. Comparing the AD and NEC groups, the mean brain activity metric was significantly lower in the accumbens, while the glucose SUVR was significantly lower in the amygdala and hippocampus. The <b>RS-fMRI</b> brain activity metric was positively correlated with cognitive measures and amyloid beta 1 - 42 cerebral spinal fluid levels; however, these did not remain significant following Bonferroni correction. There was a significant linear correlation between the brain activity metric and the glucose SUVR measurements. This proof of concept study demonstrates that this novel and easy to implement <b>RS-fMRI</b> brain activity metric can differentiate a group of healthy elderly controls from a group of people with AD...|$|E

Resting State fMRI (<b>RS-fMRI)</b> represents an emerging and powerful tool to explore brain functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with neurologic disorders. Compared to activation/task-related fMRI, <b>RS-fMRI</b> has the advantages that (i) BOLD fMRI signals are self-generated and independent of subject’s performance during the task and (ii) a single dataset is sufficient to extract a set of RS networks (RSNs) that allows to explore whole brain FC. According to these features <b>RS-fMRI</b> appears particularly suitable {{for the study of}} FC changes related to multiple sclerosis (MS). In the present review we will first give a brief description of <b>RS-fMRI</b> methodology and then an overview of most relevant studies conducted so far in MS by using this approach. The most interesting results, in particular, regard the default-mode network (DMN), whose FC changes have been correlated with cognitive status of MS patients, and the visual RSN (V-RSN) whose FC changes have been correlated with visual recovery after optic neuritis. The executive control network (ECN), the lateralized frontoparietal network (FPN), and the sensory motor network (SMN) have also been investigated in MS, showing significant FC rearrangements. All together, <b>RS-fMRI</b> studies conducted so far in MS suggest that prominent RS-FC changes can be detected in many RSNs and correlate with clinical and/or structural MRI measures. Futur...|$|E

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> allows for in vivo exploration of large-scale brain networks with high spatial resolution. Its application in rodents affords researchers a powerful translational tool to directly assess/explore the effects of various pharmacological, lesion, and/or disease states on known neural circuits within highly controlled settings. Integration of animal and human research at the molecular-, systems-, and behavioral-levels using diverse neuroimaging techniques empowers more robust interrogations of abnormal/ pathological processes, critical for evolving our understanding of neuroscience. We present a comprehensive protocol to evaluate resting-state brain networks using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in rodent model. Specifically, we begin with a brief review of the physiological basis for <b>rs-fMRI</b> technique and overview of <b>rs-fMRI</b> studies in rodents to date, following which we provide a robust step-by-step approach for <b>rs-fMRI</b> investigation including data collection, computational preprocessing, and brain network analysis. Pipelines are interwoven with underlying theory behind each step and summarized methodological considerations, such as alternative methods available and current consensus in the literature for optimal results. The presented protocol is designed in such a way that investigators without previous knowledge in the field can implement the analysis and obtain viable results that reliably detect significant differences in functional connectivity between experimental groups. Our goal is to empower researchers to implement <b>rs-fMRI</b> in their respective fields by incorporating technical considerations to date into a workable methodological framework...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous brain {{activity}} or off-line activity after memory encoding {{is associated with}} memory consolidation. A few recent resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>RS-fMRI)</b> studies indicate that the <b>RS-fMRI</b> could map off-line memory consolidation effects. However, the gene effects on memory consolidation process remain largely unknown. Here we collected two <b>RS-fMRI</b> sessions, one before and another after an episodic memory encoding task, from two groups of healthy young adults, one with apolipoprotein E (APOE) e 2 /e 3 and the other with APOE e 3 /e 4. The ratio of regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of local synchronization of spontaneous <b>RS-fMRI</b> signal, of the two sessions was used as an index of memory-consolidation. APOE e 3 /e 4 group showed greater ReHo ratio within the medial temporal lobe (MTL). The ReHo ratio in MTL was significantly correlated with the recognition memory performance in the APOE e 3 /e 4 group but not in e 2 /e 3 group. Additionally, APOE e 3 /e 4 group showed lower ReHo ratio in the occipital and parietal picture-encoding areas. Our results indicate that APOE e 3 /e 4 group may have a different off-line memory consolidation process compared to e 2 /e 3 group. These results may help generate future hypotheses that the off-line memory consolidation might be impaire...|$|E

This finding {{has been observed}} by statistically comparing the functional connectivity (FC) patterns computed from resting-state functional MRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> data recorded before and after intensive training to a visual attention task. Hence, functional connectivity serves a dynamic role in brain function, supporting the consolidation of previous experience. Following this line of research, we trained three groups of individuals to a visual discrimination task during a magneto-encephalography (MEG) experiment [2]. The same individuals were then scanned in <b>rs-fMRI.</b> Here, in a supervised classification framework, we demonstrate that FC metrics computed on <b>rs-fMRI</b> data are able to predict the type of training the participants received.

40|$|Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) {{is widely used}} {{in the field of}} functional neuroimaging to decompose data into spatio-temporal patterns of co-activation. In particular, ICA has found wide usage in the analysis of resting state fMRI (<b>rs-fMRI)</b> data. Recently, a number of large-scale data sets have become publicly available that consist of <b>rs-fMRI</b> scans from thousands of subjects. As a result, efficient ICA algorithms that scale well to the increased number of subjects are required. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage likelihood-based algorithm for performing group ICA, which we denote Parallel Group Independent Component Analysis (PGICA). By utilizing the sequential nature of the algorithm and parallel computing techniques, we are able to efficiently analyze data sets from large numbers of subjects. We illustrate the efficacy of PGICA, which has been implemented in R and is freely available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network, through simulation studies and application to <b>rs-fMRI</b> data from two large multi-subject data sets, consisting of 301 and 779 subjects respectively...|$|E
