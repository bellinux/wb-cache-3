5000|$|HD77 is a {{model name}} of Marantz 4-way high-fidelity {{loudspeakers}} which were produced during the mid-1970s. They were bass reflex speakers, but came with a cylindrical piece of foam which fit into the bass-reflex port of the enclosure if the listener preferred the more accurate bass response provided by airtight speaker boxes. However, they were not fully airtight this way, but rather {{what is known as}} aperiodic. They were designed by former JBL Engineer Edmond May. The foam plug in port was in fact a [...] "closed-cell" [...] type which did in fact seal cabinet completely. How it worked was it was cut slightly larger than opening and when inserted, you turned the <b>retainer</b> <b>screw</b> and it would tighten and compress the plug, thereby sealing the cabinet to make the loudspeaker a [...] "suspension" [...] type. The controls on baffle are resistive potentiometers, which changed the response curve of corresponding driver from soft to bright, giving great versatility to adapt within almost any listening environment.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of work of joints of tractors of models DT-VT allows {{to make the}} conclusion about presence of breakages because of low constructive strength and not correct definition of parameters of details. Probes of breakages of joints shows that today at designing of joints there is no system of the account of a mode of behavior and joint life cycle. Designing of threaded connections of automobile and tractor technics should be carried out taking into account modes and duration of operation of the car on these modes. Designing of threaded connections is carried out taking into account operation and life cycle modes. It is offered to carry out calculation taking into account accumulation of fatigue damages to a current of set time of operation. For definition of parameters of fatigue strength the technique of the accelerated tests is offered. The technique allows to define parameters of fatigue strength which {{it is necessary to}} use in calculations threaded connections. In work probes of a tension of joint of a driving wheel of a caterpillar, are resulted by a method of the is finitely-element analysis. For probes settlement models are offered and tested. Settlement models allow to simplify construction of geometrical model for use in computer programs and calculations. Using the described technique of designing it is developed construction a <b>retainer</b> <b>screw</b> with a special thread...|$|E
50|$|Stoddard-Dayton {{was slow}} {{to react to the}} {{emergence}} of a mass market and maintained a high-quality strategy after automobiles ceased to be exclusively rich men's status symbols. They were building cars as good as possible while Ford and General Motors were building as cheap as possible. Stoddard-Dayton continued to expand model offerings at all price points, but never changed fundamental manufacturing methods. The classic example of this was the 11-part radiator cap on the limousine - body, two pins, gasket, gasket <b>retainer,</b> <b>screws,</b> and latch. It was permanently attached to the radiator so that it could not be lost or stolen and could be opened with a flip of the locking lever, even when the engine was hot. Meanwhile, in Detroit, a Ford punch press was punching out caps and then an operation applied threads. True, the threads sometimes stuck and it could not be removed when the radiator was hot - but the Model T was selling for $399.|$|R
