In that case, one speaks of non-parametric statistics {{as opposed to the}} parametric statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman's <b>rank</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.|$|E

40|$|Science-based models often involve {{substantial}} {{uncertainty that}} must be quantified in a defendable way. Shortage of empirical data inevitably requires input from expert judgment. How this uncertainty is best elicited can be critical to a decision process, as differences in efficacy and robustness of the elicitation methods can be substantial. When performed rigorously, expert elicitation and pooling of experts' opinions can be powerful means for obtaining rational estimates of uncertainty. Causes of uncertainty may be interrelated and may introduce dependencies. Ignoring these dependencies may lead to large errors. Dependence modelling is an active research topic, and methods for dependence elicitation are still very much under development. Dependence measures such as <b>rank</b> <b>correlations</b> are commonly used in different types of models. Eliciting <b>rank</b> <b>correlations</b> and conditional <b>rank</b> <b>correlations</b> from experts have been proposed and used in the past. Conditional <b>rank</b> <b>correlations</b> are not elicited directly from experts, rather the experts are asked to estimate some other related quantities. In this paper two methods for eliciting conditional <b>rank</b> <b>correlations</b> via related quantities are compared {{in order to obtain}} insight about which of the two renders more accurate estimates of conditional <b>rank</b> <b>correlations.</b> Our data shows that good performance in uncertainty assessments does not automatically translates into good performance in dependence estimates. We show that, analogously to uncertainty estimates, combining experts' estimates of dependence according to their performance results in better estimates of the dependence structure. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London. ...|$|R

2500|$|As we go {{from each}} pair to the next pair x increases, and so does y. This {{relationship}} is perfect, {{in the sense that}} an increase in x is always accompanied by an increase iny. This means that we have a perfect <b>rank</b> <b>correlation,</b> and both Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients are 1, whereas in this example Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is 0.7544, indicating that the points are far from lying on a straight line. In the same way if y always decreases when x increases, the <b>rank</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficients will be −1, while the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient {{may or may not be}} close to −1, depending on how close the points are to a straight line. [...] Although in the extreme cases of perfect <b>rank</b> <b>correlation</b> the two coefficients are both equal (being both +1 or both −1), this is not generally the case, and so values of the two coefficients cannot meaningfully be compared. For example, for the three pairs (1,1) (2,3) (3,2) Spearman's coefficient is 1/2, while Kendall's coefficient is1/3.|$|E
2500|$|The {{degree of}} {{dependence}} between variables X and Y {{does not depend}} on the scale on which the variables are expressed. [...] That is, if we are analyzing the relationship between X and Y, most correlation measures are unaffected by transforming X to a+bX and Y to c+dY, where a, b, c, and d are constants (b and d being positive). [...] This is true of some correlation statistics as well as their population analogues.
