Five rates of TE, ranging from 0 to 700 g a. i. ha⁻¹, were applied at stem elongation and bud emergence stages (BBCH 32 and BBCH 51, respectively). Seed viability and vigor tests were conducted at Oregon State University Seed Laboratory to measure the effects of treatments on seed quality. Irrigation delayed PM by four days compared to the non-irrigated treatment. The TE applications did not alter seed maturation. At PM, the flower heads contained light brown petals with brownish-green sepals and seeds were pale green to pale yellow. Heads at HM contained dark brown petals and sepals, whereas seeds turned to yellow or yellow-dark grayish purple. Seed dry weight did not change significantly from PM to HM. Seed moisture content at maximum seed dry weight (PM) ranged from 340 to 540 g kg⁻¹ and decreased to below 140 g kg⁻¹ at HM.

Because clover is mainly pollinated by bees, the use of insecticides in management of these weevils is discouraged. To gain basic knowledge for development of alternative management strategies, we investigated weevil field abundance over two growing seasons, as well as feeding and olfactory host preferences by A. fulvipes and A. trifolii. Field trap catches in southern Sweden revealed that white clover was dominated by A. fulvipes and <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> by A. trifolii.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from April 1, 2016 - April 1, 2018 Entomopathogenic fungi are cosmopolitan microbial pathogens that cause fungous diseases {{in a wide range}} of insects via spore infection. Due to their natural enemy status, they have tremendous potential for use as microbial control agents against insect pests, especially subterranean pests for which few management options are available. The clover root borer (Hylastinus obscurus Marsham) develops belowground, attacks the roots of <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium pratense L.) and causes a drastic reduction in seed yield. Hylastinus obscurus was controlled with organochlorine pesticides but their use was prohibited due to hazardous effects on the environment, and non-target organisms including humans. Subsequently, no alternative pest management strategy was developed for this pest. Meanwhile, little is known about impacts of entomopathogenic fungi on clover root borer. The current study was conducted to isolate naturally occuring entomopathogenic fungi and assess their pathogenicity against the clover root borer. More than 150 isolates were collected from infected clover root borers and root zone soil samples from five <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> production fields in western Oregon. Based on morphologic characters and phylogenetic analyses using ITS sequence data, these belonged to six species - Beauveria bassiana, B. pseudobassiana, Metarhizium brunneum, Isaria fumosorosea, I. farinosa and Lecanicillium muscarium. A laboratory experiment showed that two species of field isolated fungi - B. bassiana and I. fumosorosea were as effective in killing clover root borer adults as commercial sources of M. brunneum and I. fumosorosea when exposed to these fungi in petri dishes with sterile white sand. Subsequently, H. obscurus adults were exposed to four spore concentrations of B. bassiana and M. brunneum separately in cups filled with field collected unsterilized and sterilized soil. There were no significant mortality differences on either sterilized and unsterilized soil. However, at the highest concentration, more than 80 % of clover root borers died with M. brunneum while with B. bassiana, the mortality was not significantly different due to high mortality in the negative control. Based on the study, at least six species of entomopathogenic fungi occur naturally in <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> production fields in western Oregon, and field isolated fungi are as virulent as commercial fungi against the clover root borer. Further research is needed for evaluation of the pathogenicity of these entomopathogenic fungi under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{agricultural}} landscape {{has gone through}} large changes to meet increasing demands for food. This has led to major biodiversity declines, while effects on ecosystem services that support agricultural productivity, such as pollination and pest control, remain less studied. This thesis examines temporal trends, impacts, and management for functionally important insects in agriculture using <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> production as a model system. Red clover is pollinated by bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and honey bees. Major yield losses are caused by <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> (Apion spp.), which in turn are attacked by natural enemy parasitoids. Field studies, where sites previously sampled in the 1930 s- 1960 s were revisited 2008 - 2011, showed a shift towards more species poor bumble bee communities in <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> fields dominated by a few species which are less effective pollinators. Moreover, crop pest damage by <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> had more than doubled, while parasitism rates provided by natural enemies had decreased. In parallel to these changes, seed yields have declined and become more variable in recent decades. We performed an experiment which showed that the gain in seed set obtained when simultaneously increasing pollination and pest control outweighed the sum of seed set gains obtained when increasing each service separately. With the field data collected we also developed integrated pest management by validating a pest sampling method, developing a threshold for insecticide treatment, and suggesting minimum effective chemical pest control. We further found that pest damage was higher in landscapes with {{a high proportion of}} agricultural land, and that maximising the distance to a clover field in the previous year could function as a proactive method to decrease pest abundance. In summary, this thesis shows that agricultural intensification can jeopardise the supply of crop pollination and pest control services, and that such changes may translate into crop yield effects. It further highlights that interactions between pollination and pest control can alter the benefits obtained from serviceproviding organisms, and this needs to be considered to properly manage multiple ecosystem services. Simultaneous enhancement of beneficial organisms which contribute to crop productivity and integrated management of pests that pose a threat to production can contribute to sustainable food production in agriculture...|$|R

The identification of appropriate stockless organic conversion strategies will help farmers and growers in their decision to convert to organic production. The current practice of a two-year red clover/ryegrass ley conversion relies on subsidies to be economically viable. This standard conversion and six alternatives were tested on a sandy loam soil entering organic conversion. A test crop of winter wheat will be grown across the entire experimental area in the first fully organic year (2001 / 2002). Strategies containing a legume ley phase returned the greatest amount of nitrogen to the soil.

40|$|Increasing {{cultivation}} of oilseed rape may have consequences for pollinators and wild plant pollination. By providing pollinating insects with pollen and nectar, oilseed rape benefits short-tongued, generalist insect species. Long-tongued bumble bee species, specialized to other flower types, may instead be negatively affected by increased {{competition from the}} generalists (e. g. due to nectar-robbing of long-tubed flowers) after oilseed rape flowering has ceased. We expected that the increased abundance of short-tongued pollinators and reduced abundance of long-tongued bumble bees in landscapes with {{a high proportion of}} oilseed rape would impact the pollination of later flowering wild plant species. In addition, we expected contrasting effects on plants pollinated by short-tongued pollinators and those pollinated by long-tongued bumble bees. We predicted that semi-natural grasslands, which provide insects with alternative floral resources, would reduce both negative and positive effects on pollination by mitigating competition between pollinators. In 16 semi-natural grasslands, surrounded by agricultural landscapes, with a variation in both the proportion of oilseed rape and the proportion of semi-natural grassland within 1. km, we studied reproductive output in two species of potted plants with different pollination strategies: the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium pratense). The first species is mainly pollinated by short-tongued pollinators, e. g. hoverflies and solitary bees, and the latter by long-tongued bumble bees. Both species flowered after oilseed rape. Strawberry weight was higher in landscapes with a high proportion of oilseed rape, but only in landscapes with a low proportion of semi-natural grassland. The proportion of developed achenes was also positively related to the proportion of oilseed rape, but only during the latest flowering period. In contrast, <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> set was unrelated to the proportion of oilseed rape. Whereas the discrepancy between the two strawberry measurements calls for further research, this study suggests that oilseed rape can affect later flowering plants and that the impact differs among species...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Both red (Trifolium pratense L.) {{and white}} (Trifolium repens L.) <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> yields {{can be highly}} {{variable}} and low in western Oregon. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: i) determine crop water requirements and supplemental irrigation timing, and ii) quantify the effects of soil and water status on inflorescence production, seed yield and seed yield components for <b>red</b> and white <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> crops. In each species, five supplemental irrigation treatments were applied in 1990 and 1991 to first and second year seed crops grown on a Woodburn silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aquultic Argixeroll) near Corvallis, OR. Non-irrigated controls were also maintained. In <b>red</b> <b>clover,</b> increased plant water stress reduced the duration of the season-long bud and flower production, stem length, potential floral capacity (PFC), and seed yield (SY). Root rot index (RRI) increased with increasing levels of plant water stress, indicating that supplemental water applications reduced second-year root rot severity. The reduction in SY from increasing plant water stress was primarily caused by a decrease in floral fertility, and less conclusively by reductions in inflorescence number per unit area. One irrigation to fill the soil active profile during peak flowering provided adequate water to maintain efficient seed production. In white clover, SY was maximum in 1990 when water application was delayed until 68...|$|R
5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses.

40|$|Grasslands Pawera' {{tetraploid}} <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> is {{an important}} agricultural legume through its agronomic roles in soil enrichment by nitrogen fixation {{and the production of}} high yields of quality herbage. Since this cultivar was only recently released in New Zealand, many of its agronomic aspects, and particularly those relating to seed production are still not fully understood. The present study was conducted to investigate the pattern of seed development, attainment of seed quality components, time of harvesting, cell structure in the seed coat, hardseededness and related problems, and the longevity and germination characteristics of seeds buried in the soil. Peak flowering date varies with time of sowing and climatic conditions, a sufficiently large number of effective bee pollinators (Bombus species) being essential during the flowering period for successful seed production. The pattern of seed development in 'Pawera' <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> {{is similar to that of}} its diploid counterparts and may be divided into three distinct stages. The first stage lasts for 10 days after pollination. The second stage occupies a period of 16 days, and the third stage takes a further 10 - 14 days. Seed dry weight is maximal 26 days after pollination (physiological maturity). Maximum seed viability is attained 22 to 26 days after pollination. Therefore if seed is harvested during the third or ripening stage, seed quality components such as viability, seedling vigour, seed weight, and storage life will not be adversely affected. The correct time of harvesting can be decided by using seed coat colour and seed moisture content as seed maturity indices. Generally the sequences of both embryo and endosperm development in 'Pawera' <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> show close similarity to some other Trifolium species. The processes of cell degeneration and differentiation occur throughout the seed developmental period. Cell structure in the seed coat is also similar to corresponding structures in the testa of other small-seeded legumes. The present investigation highlights the relationship between individual seed coat structures and their respective role in affecting seedcoat permeability and impermeability mechanisms. The results fail to implicate the micropyle or hilum as permeable sites on the seed coat. In originally permeable seeds, water conduction occurs at random sites on the seed coat. However, when a hard seed is softened by mechanical impaction or under natural environmental conditions, the strophiole is the only initial permeable site on the testa. Observations in the present study have clearly implicated the cell structure of the strophiolar region as a unique and most sensitive area of the seed coat. The findings of the present study suggest that the rate of breakdown of hardseededness varies inversely with the depth of seed burial. Seed samples containing mature seeds maintain their viability in the soil longer than immature seeds. The rapid depletion of seed numbers in the soil is mainly due to germination in situ. Certain proportions of the seed population persist in the soil for extended periods due to the influence of different types of dormancy mechanisms. Of these, enforced dormancy plays a most important role in maintaining the viability of buried seeds, especially with increased burial depth. 'Pawera' <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seeds</b> show a distinct periodicity of germination at different times of the year. This is an effective genetically controlled and environmentally modified seed survival mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{differences}} in seed vigour within lots of <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> cv. Pawera, white clover cv. Huia and lucerne cv. Wairau {{were recorded in}} a preliminary experiment. Subsequently, 7 high viability Pawera seed lots were used to explore the relationship between seed vigour, as measured in the laboratory, and seed performance, both {{in the field and}} in storage. Four vigour testing techniques i. e. conductivity, accelerated aging (AA), controlled deterioration (CD) and speed of germination were employed. Results for standard germination (SG) and each of the vigour tests were related to seed performance by correlation analysis. Field performance was monitored for 6 seed lots, sown at 8 dates through spring and autumn. Seed storability was determined by measuring the viability of 4 seed lots under 5 storage conditions (including ambient open storage and simulated temperate controlled storage: 20 °C, 45 % to 90 % RH) over a total of 11 months. The effects of mechanical damage, thousand seed weight, imbibition rate and storage fungi on seed viability and vigour were also investigated and seed quality changes during storage were monitored. The vigour rankings found in the laboratory were consistent with those for field emergence, emergence rate over the 8 sowings and performance during storage. Low vigour lots also showed a significant reduction in seedling dry weight for the autumn sowings when soil temperatures were very low. Each of the four vigour techniques were able to provide more accurate parameters for predicting seed performances than the SG test. For predicting seed field emergence over all the sowings, the best result was provided by the CD test at either 16 % or 18 % seed moisture content (r = 0. 933 and 0. 911 resp.), followed by AA (2 -day AA of surface sterilized seed) (r = 0. 840) and conductivity (r = - 0. 602). For predicting seed storability, the best result was obtained from the CD test (at either 18 % or 20 % seed moisture content) for ambient storage conditions, and from both CD (either 18 % or 20 % seed moisture content) and AA (3 -day aging) under controlled storage conditions. Correlation coefficients for vigour tests and storage performance tended to vary between storage periods. Seeds which imbibed water rapidly (within 4 h) were low in viability and vigour, but this was generally related to the extent of mechanical damage to the seed coat. Seed weight was not related to seed vigour. Seed deterioration during storage was associated with increasing conductivity, abnormal seedlings and dead seed content, and decreasing germination rate, normal seedlings, and field emergence. Vigour was lost before viability. The deterioration rate was quicker at high RH (75 and 90 % RH), since the seeds were quickly invaded by storage fungi. The present experimental results strongly suggest that standard germination was a poor predictor of seed performance, both in the field and during storage. Both accelerated aging and controlled deterioration seem promising techniques for determining vigour of <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> lots. The further development of these vigour tests is discussed...|$|R
