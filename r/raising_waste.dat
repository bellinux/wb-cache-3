40|$|All along waste {{problems}} and {{issues have been}} discussed. One of the main problem {{is the lack of}} waste minimization awareness among citizens. Solutions have been derived, either via technology or by changing human behaviour. Nevertheless the changes in human behaviour is the ultimate solution that should be sought after. In order to change human behaviour, waste minimization awareness should be instilled in the human well-being, which should start in the education environment such as university. However there is limited model available for creating and instilling awareness in people. Thus, this research was conducted to develop the Waste Minimization Awareness Model (WMAM) for university campus. The model will act as a guide and working flowchart for university’s administration, lecturers and facilities managers to <b>raise</b> <b>waste</b> minimization awareness and thus improve the waste management behaviour including reduce, reuse, recycle and compost among the universities’ students. The three objectives of this research were to identify the components of awareness, to identify the channels of communications and to develop a WMAM for university campus. Soft System Methodology (SSM) was used in this research as a research technique. It has five stages which includes literature review, elements identification, conceptual model development, verification and validation. Survey through questionnaires as a research method was adopted in this research. The respondents for this research were 405 undergraduate students from three public universities, including Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, University Malaya and Universiti Islam Antarabangsa Malaysia. The analysis found that six components of awareness: values, norms, knowledge, perceived behavioural control, motivation and skills needed to <b>raise</b> <b>waste</b> minimization awareness among the students. This research identified 49 channels of communication delivering waste minimization message. These findings from the analysis were used to develop the WMAM and verified through verification by expert...|$|R

At present, technology to process the scrap is conventional process which consumes high energy and caused the environmental problem. An alternative technology has been proposed to process the waste aluminum can into valuable feedstock materials without release any emission. In this process, aluminum can was treated using alkaline solution in a closed reactor. Aluminum was easily dissolved into the solution and gas was spontaneously released. The {{results showed that the}} process was mainly controlled by temperature and concentration. The higher the temperature and concentration resulted in the faster of the dissolution process. At the end of the process, solution was filtrated and calcined at desired temperature. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the calcined filtrate contained of pure alumina.

Our systems as humans are usually wasteful and create by-products that only end up in landfi lls and threaten the prospect of future generations while the natural resources offered to us by Mother Nature are slowly running out. One of the main difference between natural systems and human systems; in terms of production; is that natural systems use a cradle to cradle concept; where outputs from one system are used as inputs into another system; where as humans systems apply a more cradle to grave concept, resulting in large amounts of waste being produced.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a series}} of structural calculations that examine effects of <b>raising</b> the <b>Waste</b> Isolation Pilot Plant repository horizon from the original design level upward 2. 43 meters. These calculations allow evaluation of various features incorporated in conceptual models used for performance assessment. Material presented in this report supports the regulatory compliance re-certification, and therefore begins by replicating the calculations used in the initial compliance certification application. Calculations are then repeated for grid changes appropriate for the new horizon raised to Clay Seam G. Results are presented in three main areas: 1. Disposal room porosity, 2. Disturbed rock zone characteristics, and 3. Anhydrite marker bed failure. No change to the porosity surface for the compliance re-certification application is necessary to account for raising the repository horizon, because the new porosity surface is essentially identical. The disturbed rock zone evolution and devolution are charted {{in terms of a}} stress invariant criterion over the regulatory period. This model shows that the damage zone does not extend upward to MB 138, but does reach MB 139 below the repository. Damaged salt would be expected to heal in nominally 100 years.

This paper is dedicated to the study of effects of geometrical dimensions, and water temperature on the separation efficiency of IAF process that handles effluent of dairy industry. Operation of IAF was based on the best factors gained by Al-Maliky, Al-Ajawi, Al-Bayati (2009) for the treatment of effluent of dairy industry. Results have shown that ratios higher than 1 : 1 (width: height) of flotation tank tend to increase the separation efficiency under the same detention time; 1. 25 : 1, 1. 5 : 1, 1. 75 : 1 and 2 : 1 had made an addition of 4. 5, 5. 2, 8. 3 and 10. 12 % to the efficiency gain made by 1 : 1. Far from 2 : 1 was appeared to have a reverse effect in reducing the separation efficiency. The <b>raise</b> in <b>waste</b> water temperature had shown a significant role in enhancing the water/oil separation efficiency, until it reaches about 80 - 84 οC, beyond which that efficiency tends to decrease as oil flocs tend to scrap and layer disturbances take place.

40|$|Systematic {{pig slurry}} {{application}} to crop soils {{may lead to}} the accumulation of heavy metals in regions with intensive pig raising. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the accumulation of Cu, Zn and Mn in soils under systematic pig slurry application. For this purpose, soil samples were collected from two of the most representative watersheds of Santa Catarina where the predominant activity is pig raising. In each watershed, 12 properties were chosen to evaluate the different systems of pig husbandry (complete cycle (CC), farrowing (FaU) and finishing units (FiU)). Based on information of the producers, soil samples were collected in areas with and without systematic manure application. To determine the total Cu, Zn and Mn content in soils and manure, a methodology proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States (USEPA), method nº 3050 B, was used. For the available heavy metal content, Cu and Zn was extracted with HCl 0. 1 mol L- 1 and Mn with KCl 1 mol L- 1. Data were subjected to multivariate analysis, using the canonical discriminant analysis to identify the metals that best differentiate the soils studied within each swine housing system. Successive pig slurry applications cause an increase in Cu, Zn and Mn availability in the soil and this indicates the need for monitoring of the metal concentrations over time. The critical values of Cu in the soil can be reached and exceeded more rapidly than Zn. The results showed that the soil type may be one of the attribute underlying the determination of public policies in pig <b>raising</b> and <b>waste</b> management because soils such as Inceptisols were shown to be more prone to possible contamination since they may more rapidly reach total critical Cu levels...|$|R
