5|$|Painted turtles {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to predators when young. Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes, crows, chipmunks, thirteen-lined ground and gray squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, <b>raccoons,</b> badgers, gray and red fox, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous hatchlings fall prey to water bugs, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, snapping turtles, three types of snakes (copperheads, racers and water snakes), herons, rice rats, weasels, muskrats, minks, and <b>raccoons.</b> As adults, the turtles' armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators, ospreys, crows, red-shouldered hawks, bald eagles, and especially <b>raccoons.</b>|$|E
5|$|While killing <b>raccoons</b> {{is legal}} during the hunting season, {{typically}} September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon {{and then leave}} it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where {{the objective is to}} demonstrate the skill of the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing <b>raccoons</b> from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{the price}} of raccoon pelts rose again {{to a high of}} 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. It was {{possible}} to catch ten <b>raccoons</b> per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs. One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone. This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s, and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping took more <b>raccoons</b> than hunting with dogs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Raccoons</b> {{were first}} hunted by Native Americans, who {{harvested}} the common animals both for meat and fur. British and European settlers in North America later adopted the practice.|$|E

5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to World War I <b>raccoons</b> were very common despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned {{to keep them from}} destroying crops.|$|E
5|$|In the West, human-introduced bass, bullfrogs, and {{especially}} snapping turtles, {{have increased the}} predation of hatchlings. Outside the Southeast, where sliders are native, released pet red-eared slider turtles increasingly compete with painted turtles. In cities, increased urban predators (<b>raccoons,</b> canines, and felines) may impact painted turtles by eating their eggs.|$|E

50|$|The four {{smallest}} <b>raccoon</b> subspecies, with {{a typical}} weight of 1.8 to 2.7 kg, live {{along the southern}} coast of Florida and on the adjacent islands; {{an example is the}} Ten Thousand Island <b>raccoon</b> (Procyon lotor marinus). Most of the other 15 subspecies differ only slightly from each other in coat color, size and other physical characteristics. The two most widespread subspecies are the eastern <b>raccoon</b> (Procyon lotor lotor) and the Upper Mississippi Valley <b>raccoon</b> (Procyon lotor hirtus). Both share a comparatively dark coat with long hairs, but the Upper Mississippi Valley <b>raccoon</b> is larger than the eastern <b>raccoon.</b> The eastern <b>raccoon</b> occurs in all U.S. states and Canadian provinces to the north of South Carolina and Tennessee. The adjacent range of the Upper Mississippi Valley <b>raccoon</b> covers all U.S. states and Canadian provinces to the north of Louisiana, Texas and New Mexico.|$|R

5|$|A herd of elk was {{introduced}} to the watershed shortly before November 2000. Black bears have also been observed in the watershed. Coyotes live in the watershed, and have been hunted and trapped. Other mammals living in the watershed include gray squirrels, beavers, minks, bobcats, <b>raccoons,</b> and red and gray foxes. The Allegheny Wood Rat has the potential to inhabit much of the watershed except for the northwestern part.|$|E
5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and <b>raccoons</b> prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood loss and weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E

50|$|In 1950, Edward Alphonso Goldman {{identified}} the Barbados <b>raccoon</b> {{as a distinct}} species, a classification that has been challenged {{over the past years}} by other scientists, who assume that it was a subspecies of the common <b>raccoon.</b> This assumption was supported by a study of its morphological and genetic analysis in 2003 by Kristofer M. Helgen and Don E. Wilson, which indicated that the Barbados <b>raccoon</b> was introduced by humans just a few centuries ago. The study yielded the same result for the probably closely related subspecies Guadeloupe <b>raccoon</b> and Bahaman <b>raccoon</b> also living on West Indian islands. Therefore, the Barbados <b>raccoon</b> is listed as a subspecies of the common <b>raccoon</b> in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005.|$|R

5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and <b>raccoons.</b> This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in the {{increasingly}} urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, <b>raccoons,</b> wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, {{mountain}} goats, {{and mountain}} lions, while the streams and lakes contain {{several species of}} trout. Cottontail rabbits and wood rabbits live throughout the Hills, as do squirrels, <b>raccoons,</b> chipmunks, and porcupines. Wild burro and bobcat can be found, as well as bison in limited quantity. Woodpecker, robin, sparrow, jay, bobwhite, and wren are Black Hills birds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe recent {{invasion}} of the <b>raccoon</b> dog in the Netherlands {{may be associated with}} the risk of introduction and spread of zoonotic pathogens. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether Echinococcus multilocularis and Trichinella spp. infections are present in Dutch <b>raccoon</b> dogs. Between 2013 and 2014, nine <b>raccoon</b> dogs, mainly road kills, were collected for necropsies. One <b>raccoon</b> dog tested repeatedly positive in the qPCR for E.  multilocularis. The positive <b>raccoon</b> dog was collected in the province of Flevoland, which is not a known endemic region for E.  multilocularis. Another <b>raccoon</b> dog tested positive for Trichinella spiralis by the digestion of the forelimb musculature and the tongue. Trichinella spiralis has not been reported in wildlife since 1998 and thus far was not found in wild carnivores in the Netherlands. It shows that despite the small <b>raccoon</b> dog population that is present in the Netherlands and the limited number of <b>raccoon</b> dogs that were tested, the <b>raccoon</b> dog may play a role in the epidemiology of E.  multilocularis and Trichinella spp. in the Netherlands...|$|R

5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, <b>raccoons</b> and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, <b>raccoons</b> (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult <b>raccoons</b> and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of <b>raccoons.</b> Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E
5|$|Studies on <b>raccoons</b> in the Southeast {{have yielded}} {{infection}} rates ranging from 47% to {{as low as}} 15.5%. Armadillo prevalence studies have been described in Louisiana, and range {{from a low of}} 1.1% to 28.8%. Additionally, small rodents, including squirrels, mice, and rats, are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors. A Texas study revealed 17.3% percent T. cruzi prevalence in 75 specimens representing four separate small rodent species.|$|E
