50|$|With {{the closing}} of Wurtsmith AFB in 1993, the need for <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> and <b>control</b> was {{assigned}} to the CRTC. Equipment and personnel to operate it were added to the facility. The mission of the CRTC was increased with the additional tasking of running an ANG Medical Readiness Training School. The schoolhouse was designed to train ANG medical units for field operations. Both of these programs added personnel to the workforce and the number of employees, military and civilian, was over 100 persons.|$|R
40|$|The Surface Management System (SMS) is a {{decision}} support tool that helps tower traffic coordinators and Ground/Local controllers manage and control airport surface traffic {{in order to increase}} capacity, efficiency, and flexibility. SMS provides common situation awareness to personnel at various air traffic control facilities such as air traffic control towers (ATCTs), airline ramp towers, the Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Controls</b> (TRACONs), and Air Route Traffic Control Centers. SMS also provides a traffic management tool to assist ATCT traffic management coordinators in making decisions regarding airport configuration and runway load balancing. The Build 1 of the SMS tool was successfully tested at Memphis International Airport. This paper reports the recent development efforts performed to integrate SMS with the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) to improve its prediction accuracy for arrival traffic and robustness under modeling uncertainties. The preliminary analysis results performed on the traffic data at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport have shown significant improvements in predicting runway assignment, runway arrival time, and arrival demand.

500|$|Twenty-nine {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} work the Roanoke air traffic control facility, which {{in addition to the}} tower includes a TRACON (Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Control),</b> that also provides air traffic services for Lynchburg, Smith Mountain Lake, New London, Brookneal and the Falwell Airport in Lynchburg. The TRACON also provides non radar services to Dublin, Blacksburg, and Hillsville due to limitations on the airport's surveillance radar caused by the surrounding terrain. The total airspace controlled by Roanoke stretches well over [...] from the Mountain Empire region to Farmville.|$|E
500|$|At that point, First Officer Klotz radioed the controller, saying, [...] "ah well I {{think we}} need {{priority}} we're passing [...]" [...] The controller inquired as to how long the flight could hold {{as well as what}} their alternate airport was. Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their alternate airport and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, [...] "It was Boston but we can't do it now we, we, don't, we run out of fuel now." [...] A handoff controller listening in on the conversation called the New York Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 52 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its alternate airport. The NY TRACON controller replied, [...] "Slow him to one eight zero knots and I'll take him." [...] The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 52 say that they could no longer reach their alternate airport. At 20:46:47, the NY ARTCC radar controller cleared the flight to proceed to JFK at [...] and to slow to [...] Flight 52 departed the CAMRN holding pattern at 20:47.|$|E
2500|$|At 3:27:33, Sullenberger radioed a Mayday call to New York Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> (TRACON): [...] "... this is Cactus 1539 , hit birds. We've lost thrust on both engines. We're {{turning back}} towards LaGuardia". Air traffic {{controller}} Patrick Harten told LaGuardia's tower to hold all departures, and directed Sullenberger back to Runway13. Sullenberger responded, [...] "Unable".|$|E
50|$|Not all {{airports}} have a <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> or terminal <b>control</b> available. In this case, the en-route {{center or}} a neighboring terminal or <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> may co-ordinate {{directly with the}} tower on the airport and vector inbound aircraft to a position from where they can land visually. At some of these airports, the tower may provide a non-radar procedural approach service to arriving aircraft handed over from a radar unit before they are visual to land. Some units also have a dedicated approach unit which can provide the procedural approach service either all the time or for any periods of radar outage for any reason.|$|R
50|$|In early 1949, the Radio Operations School {{transferred}} to Keesler from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. In addition to training radio operators, Keesler {{was to begin}} teaching air traffic service technicians; aircraft <b>approach</b> controllers, ground <b>radar</b> mechanics, and <b>radar</b> repairman/ground <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> specialists.

2500|$|In 2008, city {{officials}} broke ground for Boise Air Terminal's a new {{airport traffic control}} tower, the latest facilities improvement. The tower's height at [...] made it the tallest building {{in the state of}} Idaho until it was surpassed by the Zions Bank Idaho Headquarters Building in 2013 (at 323ft), and the Pacific Northwest's tallest control tower. It was relocated to {{the south side of the}} airport in order to control an existing Guard assault strip, runway 09/27, south of Gowen Field. The tower was planned and constructed when it was believed that the radar functions would be moved to Salt Lake City in Utah. After it was decided to leave the radar positions in Boise, the facility at the base of the tower was redesigned and partially remodeled to house the Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> (TRACON).|$|E
2500|$|A new [...] midfield {{passenger}} terminal, {{which cost}} $1.1 billion, opened in 2008 between the airport's two parallel runways, {{southwest of the}} previous terminal and the crosswind runway. A new FAA Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> (TRACON) building, second tallest in the United States, opened in April 2006, the first component of the long-planned midfield complex. The Weir Cook Terminal itself opened for arriving flights {{on the evening of}} November 11, 2008, and for departures the following morning. HOK was its master designer, with AeroDesign Group (a joint venture among CSO Architects, SchenkelShultz Architecture and ARCHonsortium) serving as architect of record. Aviation Capital Management (Indianapolis), a subsidiary of BSA LifeStructures, is the airport's program manager. Hunt/Smoot Midfield Builders, a joint venture of Hunt Construction Group and Smoot Construction was the construction manager. Thornton Tomasetti was the terminal's structural engineer along with Fink, Roberts and Petrie. Syska Hennessy was the mechanical, electrical, & plumbing engineer.|$|E
5000|$|This group soon {{was joined}} by 3rd Battalion 9th Marines {{who served as the}} {{security}} element. Marine Air Traffic Control Unit 62 (MATCU 62) handled the airport traffic control operations including the airport tower and GCA <b>radar</b> (Ground <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach).</b> The force occupying [...] "The Rose Garden" [...] was designated Task Force Delta. The base was made up of marines, sailors (medical and construction staff), air force (mostly cargo handing), a six-man United States Army contingent from the 11th Signal Brigade (United States) (providing specialized communications security to the command from June to December 1972), and Thai military elements. The base was in existence until September 1973 when all the units returned to their home bases.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> {{units for}} the five major London {{airports}} are also controlled from TC, plus the <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> services for Biggin Hill.

40|$|A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> {{employing}} widely-dispersed transmit {{and receive}} antennas is studied {{for the detection}} of moving targets. The MIMO approach transmits orthogonal waveforms from the different transmit antennas so these waveforms can be separated at each receive antenna. For a moving target in colored Gaussian noise-plus-clutter, we quantify the gains from having widely-dispersed antennas that allow the overall system to “view ” the target simultaneously from several different directions. The MIMO radar performance is contrasted with that of a traditional phased-array approach, which employs closely-spaced antennas for this purpose. The MIMO <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> is well suited to handle targets that have small radial velocities for scenarios in which co-located sensors cannot separate the target from the background clutter. Both a centralized processing and a simple distributed processing form of the MIMO <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> are developed and studied, and the gains from the centralized version, which come at the price of additional complexity, are clearly demonstrated and explained intuitively. The constant false alarm rate property of an adaptive version of the MIMO moving target detector is also demonstrated for homogeneous clutter...|$|R
50|$|A Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> (TRACON) is an ATC {{facility}} usually {{located within}} the vicinity of a large airport. In the US Air Force it is known as RAPCON (<b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Control),</b> and in the US Navy as a RATCF (Radar Air Traffic Control Facility). Typically, the TRACON controls aircraft within a 30 to 50 nautical mile (56 to 93 km) radius of the airport at an altitude between 10,000 and 15,000 feet (3,000 to 4,600 m).
