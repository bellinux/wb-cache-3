5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.|$|E
25|$|As {{young males}} mature and leave their {{maternal}} groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner {{and it is}} rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly {{pacing back and forth}} {{in front of the other}} male. They seek out females only during mating time. When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.|$|E

Produced almost solely by Gambino (with help from Community composer Ludwig Goransson), {{it seems as if}} BTI is the first rap album this year that is completely confident in what it is." [...] Lizzie Plaugic of CMJ stated in a mixed review, [...] "Because The Internet is not easily dismissible, because it's so self-awarely annoying. It trips over its own feet hoping the cool kids will <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> at it, because behind those eye rolls is a jealousy that Gambino can fall with such nonchalance. Even though Because The Internet is kind of strange and kind of a bummer, it does show Glover's range as a musician." [...] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork stated, [...] "With Gambino's wordplay ping-ponging from caustic wit to message board snark, the enduring strength of the album is its production. Gambino and Göransson handle the bulk of it here alongside usual suspect Stefan Ponce and alley oops from twin act Christian Rich and Flying Lotus associate Thundercat. Because the Internets production team not only ensures the sounds are pretty, spacey, and jarring in all the right places, but they also effortlessly nail the album's Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz synchronicity gambit." ...|$|E

40|$|Early modern English {{canonical}} {{sources and}} sermons often urge {{the subordination of}} women.

Indeed many held that a man had to be an idiot or a buffoon to try to act on their hoary “wisdom. ” Households didn’t bask serenely in naturalized or essentialized patriarchy. Instead, husbands, wives, and servants struggled endlessly over authority. Nor did some insidiously gendered public/private distinction make the political subordination of women invisible. Conflict, Herzog argues, doesn 2 ̆ 7 t corrode social order: it 2 ̆ 7 s what social order usually consists in. He uses the argument to impeach conservatives and their radical critics for sharing confused alternatives. The social world Herzog brings vibrantly alive is much richer—and much pricklier—than many imagine. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|Hochschild gives a clear example on how {{companies}} {{maximize their}} profits {{through the use}} of feeling rules by viewing the job of a flight attendant. A flight attendant's job requires emotional labor. The flight attendance uplifts the customer through his or her demeanor and expression of feelings. A flight attendant who is constantly smiling or asking the customer how they are doing is more comforting to a customer versus if a flight attendant who <b>rolls</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and rarely smiles. The feeling rules for a flight attendant calls for them to be happy, calm, and to suppress their negative feelings. Customers who see the way the flight attendant upholds themselves are more likely to come back if the experience was pleasant. Which is why many airlines like Delta, which was rated {{as one of the top}} airlines calls and requires these feeling rules at the workplace. In a way, this is beneficial to the companies and the customer because the customer is satisfied and keeps coming back, which makes the company more money. However, at the same time, it can be harmful to the flight attendant because they are not able to express their feelings, but rather suppress their feelings for the benefit of others.|$|R
