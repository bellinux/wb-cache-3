The objective of the experiment conducted here was to recover the distorted signal resulting from body movement while measuring the heart <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> non-invasively from the wrist. The class of filters, known as adaptive filters, that can extract meaningful information from the distorted signal, used predetermined initial conditions to equalize the signal distortion due to motion. These filters do not require prior knowledge about the system. Adaptive filters of LMS-type and RLS-type were used in this study to recover the distorted heart <b>rate</b> <b>signal.</b> This study also presented a comparison on short-range wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth and ANT+, {{that can be used for}} data transmission of the heart <b>rate</b> <b>signal...</b>|$|R

For this purpose, heart <b>rate</b> <b>signals</b> of 62 college students (22 women and 40 men) attending Sahand university of technology were collected. Basic Methods: Time,frequency and nonlinear features (Mean, power spectrum and Lyapunov exponents) of heart <b>rate</b> <b>signals</b> were calculated during rest and music in two groups of healthy young college students: women and men. Main Results: The results show that mean heart <b>rate</b> <b>signals</b> in men group increased during music;however, it decreased in the same protocol in women group.

Principal Conclusions:The current study of heart rate (HR) time series using linear and non linear techniques has shown significant differences between before and during the music, and thus could give additional insight into the underlying dynamics of HR and in the investigation of cardiac autonomic function during music in two genders.

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of two Kalman filter (KF) schemes based on the direct estimated model and differencing estimated model for input <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> was thoroughly analyzed and compared for combining measurements of a sensor array to improve the accuracy of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscopes. The principles for noise reduction were presented and KF algorithms were designed to obtain the optimal <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> estimates. The input <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> in the direct estimated KF model was modeled with a random walk process and treated as the estimated system state. In the differencing estimated KF model, a differencing operation was established between outputs of the gyroscope array, and then the optimal estimation of input <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> was achieved by compensating for the estimations of bias drifts for the component gyroscopes. Finally, dynamic simulations and experiments with a six-gyroscope array were implemented to compare the dynamic performance of the two KF models. The 1 σ error of the gyroscopes was reduced from 1. 4558 °/s to 0. 1203 °/s by the direct estimated KF model in a constant rate test and to 0. 5974 °/s by the differencing estimated KF model. The estimated <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> filtered by both models could reflect the amplitude variation of the input signal in the swing rate test and displayed a reduction factor of about three for the 1 σ noise.

A mathematical model for the accuracy improvement was described and a Kalman filter (KF) was designed to obtain optimal rate estimates. Especially, the <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> was modeled by a first-order Markov process instead of a random walk to improve overall performance. The accuracy of the combined <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> and affecting factors were analyzed using a steady-state covariance. A system comprising a six-gyroscope array was developed to test the presented KF. Experimental tests proved that the presented model was effective at improving the gyroscope accuracy. The experimental results indicated that six identical gyroscopes with an ARW noise of 6. 2 °/&radic;h and a bias drift of 54. 14 °/h could be combined into a <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> with an ARW noise of 1. 8 °/&radic;h and a bias drift of 16. 3 °/h, while the estimated <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> by the random walk model has an ARW noise of 2. 4 °/&radic;h and a bias drift of 20. 6 °/h.
