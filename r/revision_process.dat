25|$|After its try-out run in Chicago during November 2009-January 2010 at the Chicago Theatre, {{the show}} {{moved to the}} Beacon Theater in New York, {{originally}} scheduled for additional performances for March to April 2010. The show's opening was delayed as it underwent a huge <b>revision</b> <b>process,</b> delaying the show's opening in New York from February 5 up to February 29, and was subsequently delayed twice more to March 17, and finally to April 29. The show had undergone rework, adding in new acts, actors, characters, and storyline. The changes included the removal of composers Scott Price and Jean-François Côté, who were replaced by Cirque composer Simon Carpentier. The two lead clowns, Daniel Passer and Wayne Wilson, were fired from the production, but were hired soon after. Thanks to the resultant delays of the retool, Ovo and Banana Shpeel were dueling shows in New York. Ovo would open first and receive much better reviews.|$|E

500|$|Balassi says Hemingway {{applied the}} iceberg theory better in The Sun Also Rises {{than in any}} of his other works, by editing {{extraneous}} material or purposely leaving gaps in the story. He made editorial remarks in the manuscript that show he wanted to break from the stricture of Gertrude Stein's advice to use [...] "clear restrained writing." [...] In the earliest draft, the novel begins in Pamplona, but Hemingway moved the opening setting to Paris because he thought the Montparnasse life was necessary as a counterpoint to the later action in Spain. He wrote of Paris extensively, intending [...] "not to be limited by the literary theories of others, [...] to write in his own way, and possibly, to fail." [...] He added metaphors for each character: Mike's money problems, Brett's association with the Circe myth, Robert's association with the segregated steer. It wasn't until the <b>revision</b> <b>process</b> that he pared down the story, taking out unnecessary explanations, minimizing descriptive passages, and stripping the dialogue, all of which created a [...] "complex but tightly compressed story." ...|$|E

The estima-tion results of the extended NKM model suggest that real-time data are not rational forecasts of revised data. These results are in line with the evidence provided by Aruoba (2008) using a reduced-form econometric approach. Moreover, the different policy parameter estimates obtained depending on whether or not the <b>revision</b> <b>processes</b> are assumed to be well behaved, provide evidence that policymakers decisions could be de-termined by the availability of data at the time of policy implementation.

40|$|It has {{frequently}} been claimed that, {{in foreign language}} writing, attention to linguistic processes inhibits attention available for higher level conceptual processing [e. g., Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Whalen & Menard, 1995]. This Study examines this hypothesis for foreign language <b>revision</b> <b>processes</b> by comparing online revisions made by 22 Dutch junior high school writers when producing computer-written texts in Dutch and English (FL). This comparison is made using a multi-dimensional revision taxonomy. The study combines the use of think-aloud and keystroke-logging techniques. The relationship between different types of revisions and text quality is also considered. The results indicate that, although revisions made to linguistic elements were more frequent in FL, there was little evidence that students' higher level <b>revision</b> <b>processes</b> were inhibited in FL writing. Little relationship was found between revision frequencies and text quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

"Kill Switch" [...] {{was written}} outside the mytharc {{of the series}} as a {{standalone}} story, which Gibson intended to be reminiscent of the [...] "dark visions" [...] of filmmaker David Cronenberg and to contain [...] "many obvious pokes and prods at high-end academic cyberculture." [...] Gibson's initial idea for the episode eventually evolved into the episode's final act. This was later combined with Maddox's idea of a deserted house with shuttered windows, surrounded by a chain-link fence.

500|$|Nancy Drew is {{a fictional}} American {{character}} in a mystery fiction series created by publisher Edward Stratemeyer as the female counterpart to his Hardy Boys series. The character first appeared in 1930. The books are ghostwritten {{by a number of}} authors and published under the collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene. [...] Over the decades, the character evolved in response to changes in US culture and tastes. The books were extensively revised and shortened, beginning in 1959, in part to lower printing costs with arguable success. In the <b>revision</b> <b>process,</b> the heroine's original character was changed to be less assertive and more feminine. In the 1980s, an older and more professional Nancy emerged in a new series, The Nancy Drew Files, that included romantic subplots for the sleuth. The original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series started in 1930, and ended in 2004. Launched that same year, the Girl Detective series features Nancy driving a hybrid electric vehicle and using a cell phone. In 2013, the Girl Detective series ended, and a new current series called Nancy Drew Diaries was launched. Illustrations of the character evolved over time to reflect contemporary styles. The character proves continuously popular worldwide: at least 80million copies of the books have been sold, and the books have been translated into over 45 languages. Nancy Drew is featured in five films, two television shows, and a number of popular computer games; she also appears in a variety of merchandise sold around the world.|$|E

The paper suggests that teachers sometimes also override student concerns and decisions on use of feedback, even when peer feedback, which appears to allow for more student participation in the feedback process is involved. It focuses on the cases of two students, whose use of feedback and interactions with their teachers raise questions relating to the ownership of their writing and <b>revision</b> <b>processes.</b> It is sugggested that teacher interventions may lead to students relinquishing control of their writing and <b>revision</b> <b>processes,</b> {{as well as their}} written products.

40|$|Franck GANIER: La révision de textes procéduraux The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that {{procedural}} texts offer an interesting genre for studying <b>revision</b> <b>processes</b> in writing and for applying research results to help technical writers to revise their texts. Indeed, because such texts require their readers to follow procedures successfully, technical writers have to produce efficient documents. Research on revision generally shows that the efficiency of revision is related to the use of appropriate methods. Technical writers, however, are not always completely successful •perhaps because they are not always aware of some particular methods. Indeed, the pragmatic function of procedural documents makes it essential to revise them. Thus, a study of users’ behavior can help reveal the efficiency •or inefficiency •of procedural documents. Such studies can be used to evaluate different versions of the text as they are revised. This paper aims to provide links between procedural texts and <b>revision</b> <b>processes,</b> as well as describing the problems usually met by technical writers when they are writing and revising such documents. It concludes with a number of suggestions for aiding revision. Ganier Franck. La révision de textes procuraux. In: Langages, 40 e année, n° 164. 2006. La révision de texte.
