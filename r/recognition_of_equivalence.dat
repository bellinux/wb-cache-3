A formal complex process (for <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence)</b> is needed for specialists who possess overseas specialist qualifications but who do not possess the FRACP. The requirements change from time to time. External commentators, such as Mr Peter Garling, SC, have described these processes as 'onerous' during a 2008 statutory inquiry.|$|E

The paper examines the possible avenues and the WTO law implications for the alignment of emissions standards between the European Union (EU) and United States of America (US). Looking particularly at the automobile sector, it argues that TTIP negotiators should strive for the mutual <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> of EU and US car emissions standards, while pursuing full harmonisation in the long term. It concludes that the preferential trade agreement (PTA) status of TTIP {{would not be able}} to exempt measures taken for regulatory convergence from compliance with applicable WTO rules, particularly the rules of the WTO’s Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). Furthermore, the EU and the US {{would not be able to}} ignore requests for the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> of third countries’ standards and would need to provide the grounds upon which they assess third countries’ standards as not adequately fulfilling the objectives of their own regulations and therefore rejecting them...|$|E

40|$|The {{freedom of}} {{movement}} of people and goods within the European Union (EU) has a large impact for the member states. Particularly within health care {{it is important to}} recognize, or if necessary obtain, an adequate level of the quality of profession and practice, so that citizens know that health care is offered in their country at a level comparable to other countries. The importance of recognition also applies to laboratory medicine. European Communities Confederation of Clinical Chemistry (EC 4) is the organization of societies for clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine in the EU. In Europe, health care develops in the direction where patients are treated in a health care chain environment. In this chain, patients move quickly from primary health institutes to secondary and tertiary institutes, and vice versa. This situation involves many health care workers including several laboratories. Diagnosis and therapy are now ‘core business ’ of health care. Medical laboratories play an essential role in this. The broad spectrum of medical laboratory investigations make consultancy of medical laboratory specialists ever more important. The quality of both professionals and laboratories, as well as continuity of laboratory data within and between laboratories, are of utmost importance. EC 4 is active in giving support to attain such quality. In most countries, this is the case at present. EC 4 plays {{a central role in the}} Coordination of Automatic <b>Recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equivalence</b> of Standards (CARE), if such a level exists or is achieved. Such CARE is focussed at three levels, the profession, quality of laboratories and calibration of laboratory data.

40|$|Master thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of pitch class (PC) perception. Tones separated by an octave have the same PC and exhibit strong perceptual similarity. So far, very {{little research has been}} published on how harmonic context influences the perception of pitch class. We investigated how subjects (musicians and non-musicians) judge whether two sequentially presented tones have the same PC when they are presented without context and when they are presented within a harmonic context of common major and minor chord progressions. The <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> PC <b>equivalence</b> was measured with accuracy rates and reaction times. The study revealed that the presence of a harmonic context decreases the accuracy and speed <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> PC <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> two tones, but only for musicians. When tones that belong to the same PC are placed in the same context, subjects make faster and more accurate judgements about PC equivalence, in comparison to when they are placed in a different context. When tones that belong to a different pitch class are placed in the same context, subjects make more errors and their reaction times are longer in comparison to when they are placed in a different context. According to our findings, we assume that subjects perceive the tone and the context as a gestalt and that the inconsistency of tones’ and contexts’ equivalence underlies the errors and longer reaction times in the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> PC. Answers are more accurate and faster when the relationship between contexts {{is the same as the}} relationship between the PC of tones (both contexts and tones are the same, or both contexts and tones are different). Answers are slower and more errors occur when the relationship between contexts is not the same as the relationship between tones (contexts are the same but tones are different, or contexts are different but tones are the same). ...|$|R

40|$|Six {{experiments}} {{tested the}} assumption that, in visual perception, observers have reliable and {{direct access to}} the <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> shapes in projective geometry (I call this "the invariance hypothesis in the theory of shape constancy"). This assumption has been made in the study of vision since Helmholtz's time. Two experiments tested <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> the projective <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> planar shapes. In another four experiments, subjects estimated the apparent shape of a solid object from different perspectives. Departure from projective equivalence was assessed in each study by measuring the cross ratio for the plane. This measure of projective invariance is new to perceptual research. Projective equivalence was not found to be perceived uniformly in any of the studies. A significant effect of change in perspective was found in each study. These results were construed as supporting the classical theory of depth cues against the invariance hypothesis...|$|R
50|$|Every foreign diploma held by Serbian {{nationals}} should undertake process <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> or <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> foreign diploma (e.g. BA, BSc, etc.) or honorary title (e.g. PhD, PhEng, etc.).Not surprisingly, Serbian {{graduates from}} US universities (even {{from the best}} ones) are not given equivalence automatically, but rather are put in 3rd, 4th or 5th years of diploma studies. Recent examples include graduates from University of California at Berkeley and MIT who were given 8 differential subjects to study at the Faculty of Mathematics, and too many subjects to even get enrolled to final year at the Faculty of Physics so the graduate was enrolled in 3rd year of undergraduate studies of General (not even Theoretical, Experimental, or Applied) physics.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is to propose a preliminary account for the intuitive <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> the logical <b>equivalences</b> attributed to Augustus DeMorgan. Such equivalences concerned with the negation of conjunctions and disjunctions have been previoulsy studied only {{in the context of}} syllogistic tasks, but not from the perspective of decision making. An on-line exploratory study was conducted to test two hypotheses. The first hypothesis states that DeMorgan´s law for the negation of conjunctions is easier to recognize than the corresponding law for the disjunctions case. The second hypothesis states that spontaneous errors in the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> DeMorgan´s laws follow a cognitive pattern. The results obtained for the first hypothesis suggest that the disjunctions case is more intuitive than the conjunctions case. An heuristic explanation for such unexpected result is suggested. The second hypothesis testing results suggest that the observed errors are not random. Suggestions for future research are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{outlines}} the biographies of Jacob {{and his son}} Tullo {{in the context of}} the history of the Mantuan Jews in the age of emancipation. Giacobbe came from a family of the Jewish élite and was brought up to the Enlightenment ideas and to the principles of 1789. Following the path, which had been opened in Mantua by rabbis Simone Calimani and Jakob Rafael Jacob Saraval, Giacobbe turned toward the ideal of the reconcilability of faith with reason, in tune with prevailing tendencies also within non-Jewish bourgeoisie. The inclination to reduce religion to the “love of the neighbor” brought Giacobbe to the more or less explicit <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> different faiths, which mirrored at a cultural level the social integration between Jewish elites and non-Jewish bourgeoisie. Tullo’s detachment from traditional faith was even more radical, however a strong need for a faith survived and this was satisfied by the conversion to the religion of the nation. In this sense you can talk of a marked “assimilazionismo. ” The animated opposition showed by Tullo in the 1890 s against any proposals to make a Jewish identity reviving can be explained by his fear for the centrifugal tendencies, which - along with the escalation of the class struggle - could have endangered the unity of the new State. Massarani was obsessed with these risks and he consequently acted in order to prevent them...|$|R

40|$|Indigenous {{peoples of}} the North form an {{integral}} part of ethnic and cultural diversity of the global civilization: {{in many parts of the}} contemporary world, there are enclaves of indigenous peoples that make their unique contribution to the regional and global development. The authors conduct a theoretical analysis of Russian and foreign scientists’ approaches to the study of the traditional worldview of indigenous {{peoples of the}} North. This study revealed the ideas that form the basis of the traditional culture of indigenous peoples, such as the four-element structure of the worldview, which includes cognitive, value-normative, emotional-volitional and practical elements that together determine a person’s readiness to a certain type of behavior in specific circumstances. The authors show on the empirical data that the hallmark of the traditional culture of indigenous peoples of the North is a strict adherence to the previous generations’ patterns of behavior - customs, rituals, forms of activity. The article concludes that the traditional culture of indigenous communities is syncretic, which is manifested in integrity, indivisibility of all forms <b>of</b> life, and <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> the absolute <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> three major elements of the universe - “nature-society-man”...|$|R
