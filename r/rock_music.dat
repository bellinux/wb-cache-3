What was formerly known as rock and roll, a reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply <b>rock</b> <b>music,</b> an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles {{were not part of}} mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, <b>rock</b> <b>music</b> diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a catchall category called simply <b>rock</b> <b>music,</b> which came to include diverse styles like heavy metal and punk rock. During the 1970s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade {{with a wave of}} singer-songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class.|$|E
5|$|Grunge became commercially {{successful}} in the early 1990s, due to releases such as Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Superunknown, Alice in Chains' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of <b>rock</b> <b>music</b> at the time. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, they influenced modern <b>rock</b> <b>music,</b> as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture and added introspection and an exploration {{of what it means}} to be true to oneself. Grunge was also an influence on subsequent genres such as post-grunge (a derivative of grunge) and nu metal.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of <b>rock</b> <b>music</b> {{that began}} in the mid-1960s, with the garage, {{psychedelic}} and blues rock movements.
