30|$|For {{the first}} focus, ordinal <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> {{employed}} with the R package MASS (Ripley et al. 2018).

It {{should be noted that}} real distances between adjacent categories are unknown. Thus, I focus on describing the relationships between attributions and learned helplessness rather than conducting hypothesis tests for statistically significant differences between the ordinal regression models for Korea and Finland. This is also because differences between the two countries may be evident, but not revealed.|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite several studies, the {{adequate}} {{management of}} positive distal ureter margins {{at the time}} of radical cystectomy (RC) remains controversial.

Methods: In all, 1, 447 consecutive patients treated with RC at a single center between January 1987 and August 2014 were considered. Multivariable (MVA) logistic <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> used to determine predictors of positive IFS.

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between four job characteristics and family-to-work conflict on emotional exhaustion and mental health problems. Methods: Multiple <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> performed using data from 1, 008 mental health care employees. Separate <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> computed for high and low patient interaction jobs. Results: Different job characteristics as well as family-to-work conflict were associated with emotional exhaustion and mental health problems in each job type. The relationship between family-to-work conflict and emotional exhaustion was mitigated by social support from colleagues for those who worked in low patient interaction jobs. Conclusion: In addition to general and specific stressors, it is worthwhile to include home-related stressors that interfere with the work domain in stress research...|$|E

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} reporting biases in <b>regression</b> <b>analyses.</b> The {{consequences of}} researchers’ strategy to select significant predictors and omit nonsignificant predictors from <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> examined, focusing {{on how this}} strategy—labeled the Texas sharpshooter (TS) approach—creates a predictor reporting bias (PRB) in primary studies and research syntheses. PRB was demonstrated in simulation studies when correlation coefficients from several primary regression studies with an underlying TS approach were aggregated in meta-analyses. Several important findings are noted. First, meta-analytical effect sizes of true effects can be overestimated because smaller, nonsignificant findings are omitted from regression models. Second, suppression effects of correlated predictor variables create biased effect size estimations for variables that {{are not related to}} the outcome. Finally, existing small effects are concealed, and between-study heterogeneity can be overestimated. Results show that PRB is contingent on sample size. While PRB is substantial in studies with small sample sizes (N 500) are analyzed. Preconditions and remedies for reporting biases in <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R
