Freeview had warned consumers {{in advance of the}} update, which was phased over a three-month period. The problem affected a specific range of older units, and was caused by an increased Network Information Table (channel list) exceeding the memory available in some set-top boxes. This {{had been part of the}} specification that was available and implemented in the very early OnDigital boxes, but not in those using the SetPal chip set. Affected consumers were advised to buy new set-top boxes.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} six {{statutory}} instruments designating wrecks under the Act, in 2002(amended 2003), 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2017. Twelve wrecks are designated as controlled sites, on which diving is banned. [...] These twelve vessels (including one German submarine), all lost on military service, provide a small {{representative sample of}} all such vessels. [...] All other vessels that meet the criteria of the act are subject to a <b>rolling</b> <b>programme</b> of assessment and those that meet the criteria will be designated as protected places. [...] The order that is currently in force, since March 2017, designates 79 wrecks as protected places. This means that diving is allowed but divers must follow the rule of look, don't touch.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{of the new}} border system {{started in}} September 1967. The first phase, from 1967 to 1972, was {{initially}} seen as a strengthening of weak points in the existing system; subsequently, it became a general <b>rolling</b> <b>programme</b> of work along {{the entire length of}} the border. Nearly [...] of new fencing was built, usually further back from the geographical border line than the old barbed-wire fences had been. The entire system was expected to be completed by 1975, but it continued well into the 1980s. The new border system had an immediate effect in reducing the number of escapes. During the mid-1960s, an average of about 1,000people a year had made it across the border. Ten years later, that figure had fallen to about 120 per year.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of an {{extensive}} consultation carried out in 2000-2001, the Ministry of Defence announced that it would carry out a <b>rolling</b> <b>programme</b> of assessment of all British military wrecks known to have been lost on military service. Designation as a controlled site is only applicable in waters controlled by the United Kingdom. [...] Wrecks considered dangerous will be designated as controlled sites. Wrecks that met a set of criteria would be designated. [...] Under the act, wrecks to be designated as controlled sites must have sunk within the last two hundred years. [...] Wrecks to be designated as protected places must have been lost after 4 August 1914. [...] The criteria for designation announced by the Ministry of Defence include: whether the wreck represents the last resting place of servicemen; whether the wreck has suffered sustained disturbance and looting, and whether designation is likely to stop such disturbance; whether diving on the wreck attracts public criticism; whether the wreck is of historical significance. [...] In addition it was announced that if a wreck designated as a protected place suffers sustained disturbance it will be designated as a controlled site.|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{were done}} at round gold wires of 0, 9 mm in diameter, used in jewelry making, from Au 585 alloy (58, 5 %Au, Ag, Cu and Zn). These cold drawn wires was cold rolled in two <b>rolling</b> <b>programmes</b> to various heights without any {{intermediate}} annealing on a two-high rolling stand with plain rolls of 180 mm in diameter. In first programme, the wires were rolled in several passes, with single height reductions of about 30 %, while in second one the rolling {{was carried out}} with maximal reduction only. Rolling speed was constant at all passes. It vas noted that more significant increase in widening, at samples rolled in a single pass, was at height reductions over 70 %, while at samples rolled in several passes significant increase in widening took place at high reductions of 80 % and over. Greater widening was obtained at rolling wires with maximal reduction only in comparison to wires rolled in several passes with small single reductions...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of Private Finance Initiatives in the United Kingdom and similar {{initiatives}} overseas the requirement for sound management of the asset has become a financial necessity. Originally developed and trialled on the A 30 /A 35 Exeter to Bere Regis Design Build Finance and Operate concession in the United Kingdom the Strategic Planning Model (SPM) has recently been implemented in Peninsular Malaysia on the PLUS Toll Road System. The novelty of this implementation {{has been in the}} collaborative working with the local teams to ensure the necessary institutional development of management expertise within the organisation and, secondly, the adoption of the Highway Development and Management Tool (HDM- 4) not only as the tool upon which to base operating standards but also as the preferred method for determining long-term <b>rolling</b> <b>programmes</b> to ensure concession compliance at minimum cost to the concessionaire. The implementation in Malaysia is set to fully embrace the SPM concept, whereby the strategic analysis carried out in HDM- 4 puts forward a long-term strategic plan for the network and the highway maintenance management system HMS- 2 provides the tactical programme of works in keeping with the overall strategic goals. The system is now in its second year of operation and has provided two annual periodic maintenance works packages for use by the concessionaire on the network...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{management}} {{research and}} practice is dominated by a single project paradigm. This {{does not reflect the}} nature of many construction clients who have large multi-project portfolios. Traditional single project management strategies are usually adopted for managing such portfolios - with limited success. The literature suggests that programmes, within portfolios, require different forms of management in order to optimize project delivery. In order to better understand these portfolios and thereby allow the exploration of new forms of management, a typology has been developed mapping out the various features of client's construction portfolios. The resultant typology provides a simple method for identifying the programme composition of a portfolio, highlighting the expected features of each programme type, and thereby directing management attention to the main aspects of each programme that can be optimized for efficiency. Six cases of client's construction project portfolios were studied using a highly structured, replication logic, case study methodology. A typology of clients' multi-project environments was developed and validated through literal and theoretical replication between cases. Three main types emerged as descriptive of programmes within client's construction portfolios: bounded programmes, target <b>programmes</b> and <b>rolling</b> <b>programmes.</b> The distinctive features of each type suggest that programme-specific approaches may be necessary for the successful delivery of projects within client's construction portfolios.

50|$|The {{four main}} engines were coupled {{hydraulically}} {{to the central}} gearbox incorporating three differentials. The system allowed the driver to employ any number of the main engines, depending on the load and the speed required. The cleverness of the arrangement was {{in the way that}} the supercharge pressure delivered by the two auxiliary engines fell progressively as the speed of the main engines rose, thus ensuring constant horsepower over the whole rpm range. The locomotive entered trial service on the London to Derby line in 1951 but fell victim to rationalization within the newly nationalized rail network.
