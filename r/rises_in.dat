5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E

5|$|The River Brue {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels {{to the east of}} the Polden Hills. It <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> hills near the {{southern}} border of the county, flows through Bruton, where it is joined by the River Pitt, and on through Baltonsborough. The lower reaches have been diverted into a channel that joins the Parrett at Burnham-on-Sea in Bridgwater Bay. There is a raised bog in the central Brue valley and the surrounding area is a mosaic of swamps, meres and alder woodland. The River Parrett <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> the hills around Chedington in Dorset and flows northwestwards past Aller, Somerset, and through the Somerset Levels to Bridgwater, after which it becomes an estuary with its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The river has a tidal bore, similar to that in the River Severn. The Somerset Levels are only a few feet above sea level and liable to flooding. They are drained by ditches and channels that drain into the Parrett including the King's Sedgemoor Drain, just south of the Polden Hills.|$|E

40|$|The skill premium in the United States {{has gone}} up {{significantly}} between the 1960 ’s and the 2000 ’s. During the same period, individual wage volatility has also increased. Using a model that incorporates the technology-education race model of Tinbergen (1974) into a standard incomplete markets model, this paper shows that the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> individual wage risk is an important contributor to the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> skill premium. Depending on the decomposition method, the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> wage risk explains 9 % or 17 % of the total <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> skill premium between the 1960 ’s and the 2000 ’s...|$|R

5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{contrary}} models assert that, for example, a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> expected inflation {{would increase}} current real spending contingent on any nominal rate and hence increase income, limiting the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the {{nominal interest rate}} that {{would be necessary to}} re-equilibrate money demand with money supply at any time. In this scenario, a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> expected inflation [...] results in only a smaller <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the nominal interest rate [...] and thus a decline in the real interest rate [...] It has also been contended that the Fisher hypothesis may break down in times of both quantitative easing and financial sector recapitalisation.|$|R

5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon. Phobos <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
