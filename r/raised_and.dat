5|$|NCMPs have <b>raised</b> <b>and</b> {{debated in}} Parliament {{a wide range}} of issues. What follows are some of the more notable issues mentioned.|$|E
5|$|The KJRM {{inherited}} four river monitors {{from the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, each {{from a different}} class. In April 1941, one was sunk, and the rest were scuttled. One of the scuttled ships was <b>raised</b> <b>and</b> scrapped. The other two were <b>raised</b> <b>and</b> put to use by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and were lost late in the war, with one being raised {{after the war and}} put into service until 1962.|$|E
5|$|About {{this time}} Darwin wrote Reflection on reading my Geological notes, {{the first of}} a series of essays {{included}} in his notes.

5|$|Criticism must {{generally}} {{be expressed in}} a temperate and dispassionate manner. This allows rational debate about the issues <b>raised,</b> <b>and</b> thus may even contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice.|$|E
5|$|German {{military}} officers were {{disappointed by the}} limited extent of the attack, which ultimately achieved more political goals than strategic ones. Russia's Black Sea Fleet was not seriously damaged by the raid. The gunboat Donetz was later <b>raised</b> <b>and</b> returned to service.|$|E

5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be <b>raised</b> <b>and</b> the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was <b>raised</b> <b>and</b> patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 {{the wreck}} was <b>raised</b> <b>and</b> towed to St. Louis and broken up; her iron {{was used in}} the {{construction}} of the Eads Bridge across the Mississippi River.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Marostica {{defeated}} Democrat Jodi Radke {{in the general}} election with 56% of the vote.
