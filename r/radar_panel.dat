50|$|Project 22800 {{was first}} {{publicly}} presented by Almaz in 2015. Project 22800 derives from Project 12300 Skorpion, a proposed 1990s Almaz {{design for a}} 500 ton displacement missile boat, and was also heavily influenced by Project 21631, the Buyan-M corvette.The Karakurts have a stealth shaped superstructure with an integrated mast carrying four phased array <b>radar</b> <b>panels.</b> The primary armament consists of Kalibr-NK cruise missiles or P-800 Oniks supersonic anti-ship missiles carried in eight UKSK vertical launching system cells in the rear part of the superstructure, behind the bridge.The corvettes built for the Russian Navy will be equipped with a 76.2 mm AK-176MA automatic dual-purpose gun, a modernized version of the AK-176. A proposed export version may carry the Italian OTO Melara 76 mm gun.For anti-missile defense, the first two ships will only carry a pair of AK-630M gun-based CIWS. Starting from the third ship, the Karakurts will be equipped with Pantsir-M, a navalized version of the Pantsir surface-to-air missile system.The Karakurts are not designed for anti-submarine warfare.|$|R
50|$|Tyrannix: A {{cold and}} calculating second-in-command of the Terrakors, who was {{transferred}} to the body identified as the R-1100. He is also their communications expert. He is mostly loyal to Nemesis, although he overthrows him when he tires of Nemesis' failed attempts to find the Terrastarr. There is no record of him before his awakening as a mind-possessed Robotix body specialized for communications and mid-range combat. He has highly sensitive sensor systems, being able to detect targets approaching from miles away and even accurately telling who exactly the target is. His Robotix body is a skeletal humanoid with wing-like <b>radar</b> <b>panels</b> and plasma engines as his legs and left arm. As such, he never walks on the ground, preferring to hover and fly - although he can use the engines as normal legs if he wants to, as shown when he is running in the air when his leg engines are on. His arm engine also doubles as a flamethrower, laser cannon, and a correction thruster while in zero gravity. Pilot of choice: Gaxon.|$|R

40|$|Lightweight, {{deployable}} trusses {{are commonly}} used to support space-borne instruments including RF reflectors, radar panels, and telescope optics. While in orbit, these support structures are subjected to thermal gradients that vary with altitude, location in orbit, and self-shadowing. Since these instruments have tight dimensional-stability requirements, their truss members are often covered with multi-layer insulation (MLI) blankets to minimize thermal distortions. This paper develops a radiation heat transfer model to predict the thermal gradient experienced by a triangular truss supporting a long, linear <b>radar</b> <b>panel</b> in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). The influence of self-shadowing effects of the <b>radar</b> <b>panel</b> {{are included in the}} analysis, and the influence of both MLI thickness and outer covers/coatings on the magnitude of the thermal gradient are formed into a simple, two-dimensional analysis. This thermal model is then used to size and estimate the structural mass of a triangular truss that meets a given set of structural requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{spaceborne}} <b>radar</b> <b>panel</b> considered how radar {{could be}} used to measure precipitation from satellites. The emphasis was on how radar {{could be used}} with radiometry (at microwave, visible (VIS), and infrared (IR) wavelengths) to reduce the uncertainties of measuring precipitation with radiometry alone. In addition, the fundamental electromagnetic interactions involved in the measurements were discussed to determine the key work areas for research and development to produce effective instruments. Various approaches to implementing radar systems on satellites were considered for both shared and dedicated instruments. Finally, a research and development strategy was proposed for establishing the parametric relations and retrieval algorithms required for extracting precipitation information from the radar and associated radiometric data...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} in inflatable space-structures technology for possible applications on U. S. Department of Defense (DOD) missions {{because of the}} technology's potential for high mechanical-packaging efficiency, variable stowed geometry, and deployment reliability. In recent years, the DOD sponsored Large Radar Antenna (LRA) Program applied this new technology to a baseline concept: a rigidizable/inflatable (RI) perimeter-truss structure supporting a mesh/net parabolic reflector antenna. The program addressed: (a) truss concept development, (b) regidizable materials concepts assessment, (c) mesh/net concept selection and integration, and (d) developed potential mechanical-system performance estimates. Critical and enabling technologies were validated, most notably the orbital radiation durable regidized materials and the high modulus, inflatable-deployable truss members. These results in conjunction with conclusions from previous mechanical-packaging studies by the U. S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Program Office (SPO) were {{the impetus for the}} initiation of the DARPA/SPO Innovative Space-based Antenna Technology (ISAT) Program. The sponsor's baseline concept consisted of an inflatable-deployable truss structure for support {{of a large number of}} rigid, active <b>radar</b> <b>panels.</b> The program's goal was to determine the risk associated with the application of these new RI structures to the latest in radar technologies. The approach used to define the technology maturity level of critical structural elements was to: (a) develop truss concept baseline configurations (s), (b) assess specific inflatable-rigidizable materials technologies, and (c) estimate potential mechanical performance. The results of the structures portion of the program indicated there was high risk without the essential materials technology flight experiments, but only moderate risk if the appropriate on-orbit demonstrations were performed. This paper covers both programs (LRA and ISAT) in two sections, Parts 1 and 2 respectively. Please note that the terms strut, tube, and column are all used interchangeably and refer to the basic strut element of a truss. Also, the paper contains a mix of English and metric dimensional descriptions that reflect prevailing technical discipline conventions and common usage...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} the realization process for <b>radar</b> absorbing <b>panels</b> made of composite materials. It is demonstrated that the proper selection of the carbon fiber length and volume fraction allows reducing sensibly the overall thickness of the screen compared to a standard absorber, and obtaining {{at the same time}} broad-band absorption response in the X- and Ku-bands. To this end, the carbon fiber composite material realizing the lossy sheet of the absorbing screen is designed by simulation in order to have tailored complex effective permittivity. Two prototypes of absorbing screens are realized and tested experimentally. The first one is a three-layer panel, characterized by reflection coefficient lower than − 10 dB in the frequency range from 8 to 14 GHz, and total thickness of 4. 5 mm. The second one is a five-layer panel with reflection coefficient less than − 20 dB in the range 9 – 18 GHz, and total thickness of 5. 5 mm...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{ability to}} switch rapidly from one task to another {{is crucial for}} optimal {{performance}} in'real-life situations where efficiency and accuracy are often necessary. Task switching is exemplified by the jet aircraft pilot who must perform several distinct tasks such as altering the trajectory of an aircraft, monitoring the aircraft's <b>radar</b> <b>panel</b> and gauges, operating communications equipment, and so forth. Task switching may entail several important stages of processing (Figure 1), which include selecting the next task to be performed (i. e., goal shifting), activating the task's procedural rules, and focusing attention on relevant perceptual stimulus features (1).

40|$|An energy {{dissipation}} method based on cyclic application and removal of constraints is proposed to remove vibration energy from large deployable space structures. In a vibrating structure, application and removal of constraints allow redistribution {{of the total}} vibrational energy between the modes of the structure. Since the high-frequency modes of structures typically {{have high levels of}} damping, cyclic application and removal of constraints result in natural {{energy dissipation}} through energy funneling into the high-frequency modes. Each cycle of constraint application and removal can reduce but never increase the total amount of energy of the system and therefore this methodology can be potentially implemented without sensing the state of vibration of the structure. For deployable space structures, the methodology is particularly suitable for implementation since the constraints can be applied and removed by freezing and releasing joints using electromagnetic brakes. The specific example of a <b>radar</b> array <b>panel</b> is considered in this paper. The panel is modeled using finite elements and it is assumed that select joints of the panel are equipped with electromagnetic brakes. The efficacy of energy removal is demonstrated through numerical simulation of energy transfer into high-frequency modes of the system. Future work wil...|$|R
25|$|Rail {{service was}} briefly interrupted, with full Amtrak and {{expanded}} Metrolink service resuming in {{stages in the}} days after the quake. Metrolink used the interruptions to road transport as a reason to experiment with service to Camarillo and Oxnard, which continues to the present. During the interruption, Metrolink leased equipment from Amtrak, San Francisco's Caltrain and Toronto, Canada's GO Transit to handle the sudden onslaught of passengers. All MTA bus lines operated service with detours and delays on the day of the quake. Los Angeles International Airport and other airports in the area were also shut down as a 2-hour precaution, including Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (now Bob Hope Airport) and Van Nuys Airport, which is near the epicenter, where the control tower suffered from <b>radar</b> failure and <b>panel</b> collapse. The airport was reopened in stages after the quake.|$|R
5000|$|Northrop Grumman {{flew the}} MQ-8C {{demonstrator}} installed with their AN/ZPY-1 STARLite Radar, {{although there was}} no requirement for an MQ-8C radar at the time; the Navy began seeking information for a radar for the MQ-8C in July 2014 with surface search, synthetic aperture radar, inverse SAR, and weather mode capabilities. Although the AN/ZPY-4 has been installed on some B-model Fire Scouts, the larger C-model can accommodate a larger and more powerful radar. The MQ-8C will be ready to perform surface warfare missions in 2018 and mine countermeasure missions in 2020. [...] The aircraft's first deployment is expected for 2016 to give Littoral Combat Ships a -radius ISR capability. The Fire Scout program office is considering whether to equip the airframe itself to perform more missions or focus on manned-unmanned teaming with larger MH-60S/R Seahawk helicopters. On 26 May 2016, NAVAIR signed a contract for the Osprey 30 lightweight AESA radar for the MQ-8C, the first system of its type to offer full spherical coverage with no moving parts; the 360-degree, 50 kg airborne <b>radar</b> uses fixed <b>panels</b> distributed around the body of aircraft, mounting antennas weighing just over 11 kg each.|$|R
