40|$|Abstract—Contaminant-transport {{processes}} are being investigated at the U. S. Geological Survey’s Amargosa Desert Research Site (ADRS), {{adjacent to the}} Nation’s first commercial disposal facility for low-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste.</b> <b>Gases</b> containing tritium and radiocarbon are migrating through a 110 -m thick unsaturated zone from unlined trenches that received waste from 1962 to 1992. Results relevant to long-term monitoring of radionuclides are summarized as follows. Contaminant plumes have unexpected histories and spatial configurations due to uncertainties in the: (1) geologic framework, (2) biochemical reactions involving waste components, (3) interactions between plume components and unsaturated-zone materials, (4) disposal practices, and (5) physical transport processes. Information on plume dynamics depends on ex-situ wet-chemical techniques because in-situ sensors for the radionuclides of interest do not exist. As at other radioactive-waste disposal facilities, radionuclides at the ADRS are mixed with varying amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Carbon-dioxide and VOC anomalies provide proxies for radioactive contamination. Contaminants in the unsaturated zone migrate along preferential pathways. Effective monitoring thus requires accurate geologic characterization. Direct-current electrical-resistivity imaging successfully mapped geologic units controlling preferential transport at the ADRS. Direct sampling {{of water from the}} unsaturated zone is complex and time consuming...|$|E

40|$|In {{underground}} repositories for <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste,</b> significant {{quantities of}} gases may be generated due to several processes (i. e., corrosion of metals in waste and packaging, radiolysis of water, microbial degradation of various organic <b>waste,</b> etc). These <b>gases</b> may migrate through the engineered barrier {{system and the}} natural geological barrier.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that a high-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> tank generates quantities of hydrogen, ammonia, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen that are potentially well within flammability limits. These gases are produced from chemical and nuclear decay reactions in a slurry of <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> materials. Significant amounts of combustible and reactant gases accumulate in the waste over a 110 - to 120 -d period. The slurry becomes Taylor unstable owing to the buoyancy of the gases trapped in a matrix of sodium nitrate and nitrite salts. As {{the contents of the}} tank roll over, the generated <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> rupture through the waste material surface, allowing the gases to be transported and mixed with air in the cover-gas space in the dome of the tank. An ignition source is postulated in the dome space where the <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> combust in the presence of air resulting in pressure and temperature loadings on the double-walled waste tank. This analysis is conducted with hydrogen mixing studies HMS, a three-dimensional, time-dependent fluid dynamics code coupled with finite-rate chemical kinetics. The waste tank has a ventilation system designed to maintain a slight negative gage pressure during normal operation. We modeled the ventilation system with the transient reactor analysis code (TRAC), and we coupled these two best-estimate accident analysis computer codes to model the ventilation system response to pressures and temperatures generated by the hydrogen and ammonia combustion...|$|R

40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> {{management}} {{is an important}} component of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident mitigation and remediation activities of the so-called Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. This article describes the localization and characteristics of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> present in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and summarizes the pathways and strategy for handling the <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> related problems in Ukraine and the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and in particular, the pathways and strategies stipulated by the National <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Waste</b> Management Program. The brief overview of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> issues in the ChEZ presented in this article demonstrates that management of <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> resulting from a beyond-designbasis accident at a nuclear power plant becomes the most challenging and the costliest effort during the mitigation and remediation activities. The costs of these activities are so high that the provision of <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> final disposal facilities compliant with existing radiation safety requirements becomes an intolerable burden for the current generation of a single country, Ukraine. The nuclear accident at the Fukushima- 1 NPP strongly indicates that accidents at nuclear sites may occur in any, even in a most technologically advanced country, and the Chernobyl experience shows that the scope of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> management activities associated with the mitigation of such accidents may exceed the capabilities of a single country. Development of a special international program for broad international cooperation in accident related <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> management activities is required to handle these issues.
