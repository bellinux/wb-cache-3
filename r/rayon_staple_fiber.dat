40|$|Abstract. Waste PET bottles {{which is}} the main {{ingredients}} are PET (polyethylene terephthalate), {{is not easy to}} degrade under natural conditions. If without recycling rationally, waste plastic bottles will pollute the environment, that is of no advantage for “the construction of resource saving and environment-friendly society”. This paper introduces a new kind of recycling way – the technology of regenerating fibers – that will process the recycled PET bottle flakes into <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> (a kind of textile raw materials). And finally it can produce various raw materials of textile garments by the <b>staple</b> <b>fiber.</b> The process of PET bottle flakes recycling mainly takes five steps: sorting, separation, cleaning, crushing and using. This paper analyzes the domestic and foreign PET processing of technology on regenerating <b>staple</b> <b>fiber.</b> And it puts forward a complete set of modification technology program for regenerating <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> by PET on the basic of theory...|$|R
40|$|Polyester <b>Staple</b> <b>Fiber</b> is a {{material}} that is produced from synthetic chemical and compound with various uses in industry phrase. There are states that export material of Polyester <b>Staple</b> <b>Fiber</b> to Indonesia like China, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia and India. Among those states, dumping practices was found in Indonesian International trade which is implementing by the exporters. Dumping occur when a foreign company sells a product to the another state at less than fairmarket value. Loss caused to states who imports goods which contain dumping, therefor dumping is prohibited in International trade which have been mentioned by World Trade Organization (WTO). Dumping was done by China in the exporting activity of Polyester <b>Staple</b> <b>Fiber.</b> The lower price that is provided of China 2 ̆ 7 s Polyester <b>Staple</b> <b>Fiber</b> {{is the reason that}} makes the Indonesian consumer interested of buying it more than the inland production. That thing decrease the market share of the inland producers company and caused loss. To anticipate the increasing of loss, Indonesian Fiber Synthetic Producer Association (APSYFI) made a petition to the Indonesian Antidumping Committee. The petition of Indonesian Fiber Synthetic Producer Association (APSYFI) that was represented by two national Polyester <b>Staple</b> <b>Fiber</b> company which are PT.

40|$|Fly ash being a waste {{material}} can be utilized in construction of roads and embankments. Randomly distributed fiber reinforced soils have recently attracted increasing attention in geotechnical engineering. At many sites, {{availability of the}} land is a huge problem; in such situations construction of steep slope fly ash embankments is worth considering. The polypropylene <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> of 1 % by dry weight was used with fly ash for the experimental work. Proctor compaction test, direct shear test, and unconfined compression test have been performed without and with polypropylene <b>staple</b> <b>fiber.</b> Centrifuge tests have been performed at 80 % compaction effort to observe the effect of fiber reinforcement taking two different slope angles (θ = 78. 6 °). Experimental results show that due to mixing of fiber in fly ash, maximum dry density decreases and optimum amount of water content increases. Fiber reinforcement increases the shear strength of fly ash and changes its brittle behaviour into ductile behaviour. In case of reinforced slope there is a reduction in the vertical settlement and it fails at higher values of ‘g’, which means that polypropylene <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced slopes can sustain higher loads. © IACMA...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{compared}} fiber trapping of embeddable and locatable spinning (ELS) {{with that of}} sirofil and siro core-spinning with flute pipe air suction. Online pictorial analysis showed that the 3 rd ELS was free of the visual fiber loss during the 1 st ELS, 2 nd ELS, sirofil, and siro core-spinning. This indicated the 3 rd ELS possessed high ability of trapping <b>staple</b> <b>fibers.</b> Weight loss of different yarns proved that the 3 rd ELS had a statistically higher fiber trapping capacity than 1 st ELS, sirofil and siro core-spinning. Yarn visual appearance results showed that filaments failed to be entirely buried in the siro core-spun yarn body due to the <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> loss and imperfect filament tension adjustment. Poor trapping and filament fasting of <b>staple</b> <b>fibers</b> might be the reasons for more hairy siro core-spun yarn than other composite yarns. Sirofil and siro core-spun yarn had higher value of coefficient of mass variation per unit yarn length and yarn imperfections than the 3 rd ELS yarn which might be probably due to their irregular fiber loss during the sirofil and siro core-spinning. The fiber loss {{would result in a}} decrease in yarn cross-section fiber utilization; therefore, sirofil, siro core-spun and the 1 st ELS yarn had a statistically lower tensile tenacity than the 3 rd ELS composite yarn. ...|$|R

Since wood is a candidate to replace fossil raw materials in so many applications of thecircular economy, other sources need investigation. Cotton linters work in the viscose process – can cotton waste beused to make dissolving pulp? We describe the textile qualities of lyocell fibers from (i) pure cotton waste pulp and(ii) blending with conventional dissolving pulp. The <b>staple</b> <b>fibers</b> were tensile tested, yarns spun and tensile tested andknitted, and tested for shrinkage, water and dye sorption, abrasion resistance, fuzzing and pilling, staining and fastness. TENCEL <b>staple</b> <b>fibers</b> and off-the-shelf TENCEL yarn were used as references. The results show that the two studyfibers had tenacity and an E-modulus that exceeded the <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> reference. Also, the study yarns were at least as goodas the spun reference yarn and the commercial off-the-shelf yarn in terms of wet tenacity. Single jerseys made from thestudy yarns shrunk less upon laundering, which is surprising since they could absorb at least as much water at acomparable rate as the references. Dyeability, staining and color fastness, durability and pilling tendency showed thatthe two study fiber tricots performed at least as good as the references.
