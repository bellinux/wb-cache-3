50|$|In practice, bearing errors {{can often}} exceed those defined in Annex 10, in some directions. This is usually due to terrain effects, {{buildings}} near the VOR, or, {{in the case}} of a DVOR, some counterpoise effects. Note that Doppler VOR beacons utilise an elevated groundplane that is used to elevate the effective antenna pattern. It creates a strong lobe at an elevation angle of 30° which complements the 0° lobe of the antennas themselves. This groundplane is called a counterpoise. A counterpoise though, rarely works exactly as one would hope. For example, the edge of the counterpoise can absorb and <b>re-radiate</b> <b>signals</b> from the antennas, and it may tend to do this differently in some directions than others.|$|R

The {{digital switchover}} process for Tenby duplicated the timing at Carmel, {{with the first}} stage taking place on 26 August 2009 and the second stage being completed on 23 September 2009.

50|$|When it was built, Pontardawe {{transmitter}} <b>re-radiated</b> a <b>signal</b> received off-air from Kilvey Hill about 12 km to the southwest. However, {{sometime after}} the Alltwen relay {{was built on}} the opposite side of the valley, the Pontardawe mast was reassigned to relay its signal instead. Both sites have line-of-sight to Kilvey Hill, but the direct signal to the Pontardawe site does have a close encounter with a wooded hillside 2 km away which severely intrudes into the signal's First Fresnel Region. Alltwen's line-of-sight is unobstructed.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the {{performance}} of two main MIMO techniques, beamforming and multiplexing, in the Terahertz (THz) band. The main problem with the THz band is its huge propagation loss, which {{is caused by the}} tremendous signal attenuation due to molecule absorption of the electro-magnetic wave. To overcome the path loss issue, massive MIMO has been suggested to be employed in the network and is expected to provide Tbps for a distance within a few meters. In this context, beamforming is studied recently as the main technique to take advantage of MIMO in THz and overcome the very high path loss with the assumption that the THz communication channel is Line-of-Sight (LoS) and there are not significant multipath rays. On the other hand, recent studies also showed that the well-known absorbed energy by molecules can be re-radiated immediately in the same frequency. Such <b>re-radiated</b> <b>signal</b> is correlated with the main signal and can provide rich scattering paths for the communication channel. This means that a significant MIMO multiplexing gain can be achieved even in a LoS scenario for the THz band. Our simulation results reveal a surprising observation that the MIMO multiplexing could be a better choice than the MIMO beamforming under certain conditions in THz communications...|$|R
5000|$|The device {{consisted}} of a 9-inch (23 cm) long monopole antenna (quarter-wave for 330 megahertz (MHz) frequencies, but able to also act as half-wave or full-wave, the accounts differ) — a straight rod, led through an insulating bushing into a cavity, where it was terminated with a round disc that formed one plate of a capacitor. The cavity was a high-Q round silver-plated copper [...] "can", with the internal diameter of 0.775 in (19.7 mm) and about 11/16 in (17.5 mm) long, with inductance of about 10 nanohenry. [...] Its front side was closed with a very thin (3 mil, or 75 micrometers) and fragile conductive membrane. In {{the middle of the}} cavity was a mushroom-shaped flat-faced tuning post, with its top adjustable to make it possible to set the membrane-post distance; the membrane and the post formed a variable capacitor acting as a condenser microphone and providing amplitude modulation (AM), with parasitic frequency modulation (FM) for the <b>re-radiated</b> <b>signal.</b> The post had machined grooves and radial lines into its face, probably to provide channels for air flow to reduce pneumatic damping of the membrane. The antenna was capacitively coupled to the post via its disc-shaped end. The total weight of the unit, including the antenna, was 1.1 ounces (31 grams).|$|R

2500|$|In 1941, RAF Fighter Command {{planned to}} use the {{airfield}} for an experimental unit, and after requisitioning land from several adjacent farms, contracted George Wimpey and Company to begin work on 11 June 1941. However, its intended use soon changed into being a satellite airfield for the fighter squadrons based at RAF Colerne. Originally, the new airfield's name was to be RAF Broadfield Down. The runways used the standard triangular pattern. The main, east-west runway was [...] long, with a designated alignment of 28/10, {{and the others were}} [...] aligned 21/03 and [...] aligned 34/16. The first aircraft to land was a Luftwaffe Ju 88 at 06.20 on 24 July 1941. Returning from a raid, it was confused by the RAF electronic countermeasures radio beacon at Lympsham, which was <b>re-radiating</b> the <b>signal</b> from a Luftwaffe homing beacon at Brest, France.|$|R
50|$|The systems {{used the}} same concept of small {{aluminium}} strips (or wires) cut to a half of the target radar's wavelength. When hit by the radar, such lengths of metal resonate and <b>re-radiate</b> the <b>signal.</b> Opposing defences would find {{it almost impossible to}} distinguish the aircraft from the echoes caused by the chaff. Other radar-confusing techniques included Mandrel, Piperack and Jostle. Ignorance about the extent of knowledge of the principle in the opposing air force led planners to judge that it was too dangerous to use, since the opponent could duplicate it. The British government's leading scientific adviser, Professor Lindemann, pointed out that if the Royal Air Force (RAF) used it against the Germans, the Luftwaffe would quickly copy it and could launch a new Blitz. This caused concern in RAF Fighter Command and Anti-Aircraft Command, who managed to suppress the use of Window until July 1943. It was felt the new generation of centimetric radars available to Fighter Command would cope with Luftwaffe retaliation.|$|R
25|$|The Bellini–Tosi system {{feeds the}} output voltage of a loop or Adcock antenna {{into a small}} coil of wire, the field coil. The varying voltage induced by the {{received}} signal causes the wire to <b>re-radiate</b> the same <b>signal.</b> Although as the coil is typically very {{much smaller than the}} wavelength and thus has a small antenna factor, the use of many loops of wire in the coil improves the overall signal strength. The total energy radiated by the coil is less than what is received on the antenna, but it broadcasts this into a much smaller physical area, so the flux may be much higher than the original signal.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{development}} of a high efficiency harmonic re-radiator, consisting of a diode doubler and conjugate-matched receive and transmit antennas, is described. Diode-based frequency multipliers and rectifiers, coupled with antennas, are of interest for quasi-optical applications, for energy-scavenging and for sensing applications. The device studied operates by receiving an interrogating signal at a frequency of 1. 3 GHz and <b>re-radiating</b> a <b>signal</b> at 2. 6 GHz. The primary goal of this research was to develop a passive, miniature and effective frequency doubler integrated with planar antennas. The system is referred to as a frequency doubling reflectenna, (FDR). Prediction of accurate performance was achieved by employing precise modeling and measurement methods. The FDR can be utilized in data collection applications. The footprint of the FDR is occupied primarily by the receive and transmit antennas. Therefore, {{a significant portion of the}} research focused on {{the development of}} compact and efficient planar antennas, which would provide for a miniature FDR. A first-generation FDR design was designed, which utilized quarter-wavelength shorted microstrip patch antennas. The choice of antennas provided a small prototype with dimensions equal to 44 mm by 17 mm. In order to further reduce the size of the harmonic re-radiator, meandered planar antennas were investigated and optimized for efficient operation. A second-generation FDR design, which utilized meandered microstrip patch antennas, was produced and a size reduction of 75 % was achieved. Both first- and second-generation harmonic re-radiator designs were designed for low input power operation and provided maximum measured conversion efficiencies of approximately 4. 5 % and 1. 8 %, with the input to the diode doubler at - 14. 5 and - 17. 5 dBm, respectively. Re-configurable microwave devices, which dynamically operate at different frequencies, are often desirable for sensing applications. Therefore, to conclude this research, a tunable FDR was realized using a semiconductor varactor that provided the dynamic capacitance required for the tunability...|$|R
