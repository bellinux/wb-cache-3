5|$|Ida's <b>regolith</b> is {{composed}} of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Its appearance changes over time through a process called space weathering. Because of this process, older <b>regolith</b> appears more red in color compared to freshly exposed material.|$|E
5|$|Beneath the finely {{comminuted}} <b>regolith</b> {{layer is}} the megaregolith, {{a layer of}} highly fractured bedrock many kilometres thick.|$|E
5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of <b>regolith</b> impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of <b>regolith.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{physical}} model is {{developed for the}} evolution of <b>regoliths</b> on small bodies and applied to the asteroid and meteorite parent bodies. The model considers global deposition of that fraction of cratering ejecta that is not lost to space. In addition, it is applied to cases of both strong, cohesive bodies and to bodies of weak, unconsolidated materials. It is found that large, strong asteroids generate surficial <b>regoliths</b> of a few kilometers depth while strong asteroids smaller than 10 -km diameter generate negligible <b>regoliths.</b> In conclusion, it is noted that the theory that substantial <b>regoliths</b> are produced predominantly by blanketing differs from earlier hypotheses that asteroidal <b>regoliths</b> might be thin or absent and that short surface exposure of asteroidal materials is due chiefly to erosion rather than blanketing...|$|R
40|$|Our {{comparisons}} of the single particle scattering behavior of terrestrial snows and icy satellite <b>regoliths</b> to the laboratory particle scattering measurements of McGuire and Hapke demonstrate that the differences between icy satellite <b>regoliths</b> and their terrestrial counterparts are due to particle structures and textures. Terrestrial snow particle structures define a region in the single particle scattering function parameter space separate from the regions defined by the McGuire and Hapke artificial laboratory particles. The particle structures and textures of the grains composing icy satellites <b>regoliths</b> are not simple or uniform but consist {{of a variety of}} particle structure and texture types, some of which may be a combination of the particle types investigated by McGuire and Hapke...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{comparative}} study of solar-flare tracks and other microscopic features in unmetamorphosed lunar breccias, carbonaceous chondrites, and noncarbonaceous gas-rich meteoritic breccias. The data suggest that these objects originated from material once on and {{just below the surface}} of solar-system <b>regoliths.</b> Characteristics of these <b>regoliths</b> are discussed with reference to the track-rich olivines in Orgueil and the impregnated Apollo 16 deep drill core. The use of a variant of the fission-track method to determine the time of compaction of soil grains into a breccia is explained...|$|R
5|$|A thick <b>regolith</b> {{layer on}} the lower slopes of the {{mountains}} and a thin cover of debris on the upper slopes are suggested by the relative absence of large boulders {{on the lower}} mountain flanks.|$|E
5|$|About 20 large (40â€“150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's <b>regolith.</b> Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} <b>regolith.</b> Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|Vesta's {{surface is}} covered by <b>regolith</b> {{distinct}} from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, <b>regolith</b> evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark component is {{probably due to the}} infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.|$|E
40|$|Geological models {{accounting}} for the strongly crater size-dependent IR and radar signatures of lunar crater floors are examined. The simplest model involves the formation and subsequent 'gardening' of an impact melt layer on the crater floor, but while adequate in {{accounting for}} the gradual fading of IR temperatures and echo strengths in craters larger than 30 km in diameter, it is inadequate for smaller ones. It is concluded that quantitative models {{of the evolution of}} rock populations in <b>regoliths</b> and of the interaction of microwaves with <b>regoliths</b> are needed in order to understand crater evolutionary processes...|$|R
5000|$|Saprolites form in {{the lower}} zones of soil horizons and {{represent}} deep weathering of the bedrock surface. In lateritic <b>regoliths</b> [...] - [...] <b>regoliths</b> are the loose layer of rocks that rest on the bedrock [...] - [...] saprolite may be overlain by upper horizons of residual laterite; most of the original profile is preserved by residual soils or transported overburden. Weathering formed thin kaolinitic Al2Si2O5(OH)4 saprolites 1,000 to 500 million years ago; thick kaolinitic saprolites 200 to 66 million years ago; and medium-thick immature saprolites 5 million years ago. The general structure of kaolinite has silicate Si2O5 sheets bonded to aluminium hydroxide Al2(OH)4 layers.|$|R
40|$|The {{coherent}} backscatter {{model of}} radar scattering from icy satellites argues {{that most of}} the received power comes from radio waves that have been multiply scattered from numerous refractive index discontinuities randomly located under the surfaces of the <b>regoliths.</b> In a laboratory analog experiment the circular and linear polarizations were measured in light scattered from a suspension of polystyrene spheres in water illuminated by laser. Results confirm that coherent backscatter from particle media reproduces the large intensity and unusual polarizations observed in the radar data. The model implies that the <b>regoliths</b> of icy satellites consist of matrices of small reflective index containing imbedded scatterers separated by distances of the order of a wavelength...|$|R
5|$|Comparison of {{high-resolution}} images {{obtained by}} the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimetres of <b>regolith</b> a hundred times more quickly than previous models suggestedon a timescale of 81,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Ida's surface appears heavily cratered {{and mostly}} gray, {{although}} minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida {{is covered by}} {{a thick layer of}} <b>regolith,</b> loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called ejecta blocks, several of which have been observed on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Lunar swirls are enigmatic {{features}} found {{across the}} Moon's surface, which {{are characterized by}} a high albedo, appearing optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young <b>regolith),</b> and often displaying a sinuous shape. Their curvilinear shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls.|$|E
50|$|The surface {{materials}} (<b>regoliths)</b> of airless bodies (in fact, {{the majority}} of bodies in the Solar System) are strongly non-Lambertian and exhibit the opposition effect, which is a strong tendency to reflect light straight back to its source, rather than scattering light diffusely.|$|R
5000|$|Pascal Lee studied {{astronomy}} and space sciences at Cornell, {{and worked as}} a research and teaching assistant for his thesis adviser Joseph Veverka, and the late Carl Sagan. Pascal Lee's PhD thesis dissertation was titled: [...] "Physical properties and processing of asteroid <b>regoliths</b> and interiors".|$|R
40|$|White-light {{polarization}} curves for {{a number}} of asteorids are presented. All have well-developed negative branches, suggestive of relatively dark, texturally complex surfaces - possibly <b>regoliths.</b> Geometric albedos, estimated from the positive branch of the polarization curves, show that a significant dispersion in surface albedo exists within the asteroid belt...|$|R
5|$|Rocks sampled in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the Lunar Module are mostly vesicular coarse-grained subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well. Much of the valley floor, as displayed in observations of {{the immediate}} landing area, is predominately <b>regolith</b> and fragments varying in sizes excavated by several impacts in the Moon's history.|$|E
5|$|The Red Canyon Conglomerate, the basal {{member of}} the Moenkopi, fills broad east-flowing paleo{{channels}} carved into the Kaibab Limestone. Some of these channels are up to several tens of feet deep and may reach 200ft (61m) deep in the St. George area. A thin, poorly developed soil, or <b>regolith,</b> formed over the paleotopographic high areas between the channels.|$|E
5|$|Unknown {{before the}} Apollo 15 mission, there are {{parallel}} linear {{patterns on the}} faces of the mountains in the area. Although they appeared to be occurrences of fracturing or layering appearing through the <b>regolith,</b> determining this is made difficult by the lighting circumstances during the mission. A dark band on Mount Hadley, believed to be a marking left by lava after receding, was observed by the Apollo 15 crew.|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} bidirectional reflectance {{distribution function}} (BRDF) of 9 different materials, analogue to planetary <b>regoliths</b> has been measured and analysed. The spectral range was 295 nm - 1105 nm (UV, VIS and NIR), the spectral bandwidth varied between 10 nm and 20 nm. Measurements {{have been done}} in the plane of incidence at an incidence angle of 45 and at exit angles ranging from - 65 to 65. The angle resolution as defined by the apertures of the lamp and the detector was 3. The samples are rock and mineral powders resembling planetary <b>regoliths</b> in terms of porosity, grain size distribution and material. Grain sizes range from < 20 #mu#m to 500 #mu#m. The investigated materials are anorthositic and tholeitic basalt, dunite mixed with carbon, the meteorite murchison, kerogene, quartz, and olivine (three different grain sizes). The measurement instrument is a newly designed goniospectrometer. Data analysis is done using the photometric function of Hapke. By analysing the resulting spectral model parameters and by comparing these parameter sets to remote sensing data of the lunar surface essentially two things are done. On the one hand the validity of Hapke's function is investigated {{and on the other hand}} the scattering process in <b>regoliths</b> is analysed. (orig.) 131 refs.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} and computer modeling {{are used to}} predict the development of <b>regoliths</b> on all asteroids {{more than a few}} tens of kilometers in diameter, allowing for a wide range in the intrinsic strength of asteroidal surface materials. The high frequency of interasteroid collisions requires nearly all asteroids to be fragments of precursors...|$|R
5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: <b>regolith</b> breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 {{show that the}} valley is composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia in the large massifs surrounding the valley and basalt underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of <b>regolith,</b> or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events. Taurusâ€“Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E
5|$|Humanity survives in the aftermath, but {{the world}} {{experiences}} an ice age outside of Kazamatsuri. In the city, a huge tree grows 500 meters tall in three years, which contains the orb of light from Kotarou and Kagari. The five heroines, now in high school, investigate the tree {{as members of the}} occult research society and transform Kotarou into a familiar, but he refuses to do what they demand. Kotarou takes the girls to the Moon where they are shown circled around a seedling (as the embodiment of the Moon's Kagari) sprouting on the otherwise barren <b>regolith.</b>|$|E

5|$|India, Japan, China, the United States, and the European Space Agency each sent lunar orbiters, and {{especially}} ISRO's Chandrayaan-1 {{has contributed to}} confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar <b>regolith.</b> The post-Apollo era has also seen two rover missions: the final Soviet Lunokhod mission in 1973, and China's ongoing Chang'e 3 mission, which deployed its Yutu rover on 14 December 2013. The Moon remains, under the Outer Space Treaty, free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a <b>regolith</b> because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the <b>regolith</b> to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of trapped solar gas in stony meteorites places their {{origin in the}} <b>regoliths</b> of asteroidal-type bodies.
