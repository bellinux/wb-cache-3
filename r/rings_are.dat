5|$|The {{majority}} of Uranus's <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> opaque {{and only a}} few kilometers wide. The ring system contains little dust overall; it consists mostly of large bodies 0.2–20m in diameter. However, some <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> optically thin: the broad and faint 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> made of small dust particles, while the narrow and faint λ ring also contains larger bodies. The relative lack of dust in the ring system may be due to aerodynamic drag from the extended Uranian exosphere.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of the}} rings. One hypothesis is that the <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.|$|E
5|$|After the ε ring, the α and β <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> the {{brightest}} of Uranus's rings. Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, {{which means they}} are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. However, the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2. The masses of the α and β <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> estimated to be about 5kg (each)—half {{the mass of the}} ε ring.|$|E
25|$|A {{division}} <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{such that}} every non-zero element is a unit. A commutative division <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a field. A prominent {{example of a}} division <b>ring</b> that <b>is</b> not a field <b>is</b> the <b>ring</b> of quaternions. Any centralizer in a division <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> also a division ring. In particular, {{the center of a}} division <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a field. It turned out that every finite domain (in particular finite division <b>ring)</b> <b>is</b> a field; in particular commutative (the Wedderburn's little theorem).|$|R

5|$|The Neptunian rings {{contain a}} large {{quantity}} of micrometer-sized dust: the dust fraction by cross-section area is between 20% and 70%. In this respect they {{are similar to}} the rings of Jupiter, in which the dust fraction is 50%–100%, and are very different from the rings of Saturn and Uranus, which contain little dust (less than 0.1%). The particles in Neptune's <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> made from a dark material; probably a mixture of ice with radiation-processed organics. The <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> reddish in color, and their geometrical (0.05) and Bond (0.01–0.02) albedos {{are similar to those of}} the Uranian rings' particles and the inner Neptunian moons. The <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> generally optically thin (transparent); their normal optical depths do not exceed 0.1. As a whole, the Neptunian rings resemble those of Jupiter; both systems consist of faint, narrow, dusty ringlets and even fainter broad dusty rings.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} rings were identified. Two additional rings {{were discovered}} in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings. The <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> extremely dark—the Bond albedo of the rings' particles does not exceed 2%. They are probably composed of water ice {{with the addition of}} some dark radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Earth-based {{observations}} {{announced in}} 2005 appeared {{to show that}} Neptune's <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by Voyager 2. In particular, {{it seems that the}} Liberté arc might disappear in as little as one century.|$|E

50|$|An {{internal}} {{characterization of}} left primitive <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> as follows: a <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> left primitive if {{and only if}} there is a maximal left ideal containing no nonzero two-sided ideals. The analogous definition for right primitive <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> also valid.|$|R
5|$|Since Voyager 2s fly-by, the {{brightest}} rings (Adams and Le Verrier) have been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope and Earth-based telescopes, owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power. They are visible, slightly above background noise levels, at methane-absorbed wavelengths {{in which the}} glare from Neptune is significantly reduced. The fainter <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> still far below the visibility threshold.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000km from {{the centre of}} Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000km. A faint outward {{extension}} to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000km.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien {{wrote of}} being {{impressed}} {{as a boy}} by S. R. Crockett's historical novel The Black Douglas and of basing the Necromancer (Sauron) on its villain, Gilles de Retz.

50|$|In {{commutative}} algebra, a J-0 <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{such that}} the set of regular points of the spectrum contains a non-empty open subset, a J-1 <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{such that the}} set of regular points of the spectrum is an open subset, and a J-2 <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> such that any finitely generated algebra over the <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a J-1 <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> not precisely known, although the <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the <b>ring</b> particles <b>is</b> 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a <b>ring</b> plane-crossing <b>was</b> observed.|$|R

5|$|Pioneer 11 {{made the}} first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet {{and a few of}} its moons, {{although}} their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> bright when viewed at high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, Pioneer 11 measured the temperature of Titan.|$|E
5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} planetary rings is not precisely known, they {{are believed to be}} the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{request for}} a sequel {{prompted}} Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent {{more than ten years}} writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C.S.Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the <b>Rings</b> <b>are</b> set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it.|$|E
5000|$|In ring theory, a <b>ring</b> R <b>is</b> {{called a}} reduced ring {{if it has}} no non-zero {{nilpotent}} elements. Equivalently, a <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> reduced if it has no non-zero elements with square zero, that is, x2 = 0 implies x = 0. A commutative algebra over a commutative <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> called a reduced algebra if its underlying <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> reduced.|$|R

50|$|In mathematics, a clean <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{in which}} every element can be written as the sum of a unit and an idempotent. A <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a local <b>ring</b> {{if and only if}} it is clean and has no idempotents other than 0 and 1. The {{endomorphism}} ring of a continuous module <b>is</b> a clean <b>ring.</b> Every clean <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> an exchange <b>ring.</b> A matrix ring over a clean <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> itself clean.|$|R
5|$|The <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo {{of the ring}} particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E
5|$|The {{wurtzite}} form {{of boron}} nitride (w-BN; point group = C6v; space group = P63mc) {{has the same}} structure as lonsdaleite, a rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into tetrahedra, but in w-BN the angles between neighboring tetrahedra are different. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into 6-membered rings; in the cubic form all <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> in the chair configuration, in w-BN the rings between 'layers' are in boat configuration.|$|E

Black sees similarities between the murders and the methods of torture employed by the medieval Inquisition. This is confirmed when a Protestant minister is drowned in imitation of another ritual torture. At {{the scene of the}} drowning, two wedding <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> found—a man's in the stomach of the victim and woman's nearby.|$|E

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a ring R. <b>Rings</b> <b>are</b> a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M(n, R) of all square n-by-n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R-module R'n. If the ring R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square matrices over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a field F, where every nonzero element is invertible. Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E
