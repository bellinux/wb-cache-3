40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To {{investigate}} the current clinical management of laryngeal mucosal premalignant lesions (LMPLs) among otorhinolaryngologists working in university hospitals (tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centers)</b> and nonuniversity hospitals (secondary <b>referral</b> <b>centers)</b> in The Netherlands. Then {{to compare the}} investigated practice with the results published in the literature. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A survey was conducted to assess the management of LMPLs. The questionnaire consisted of a systematic series of figures representing the initial presentation of a patient with a leukoplakic lesion at 12 different anatomical locations. The study group consisted of otorhinolaryngologists at all eight tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> in The Netherlands (n = 22) and a random selection of otorhinolaryngologists (n = 25) from secondary <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> throughout the country. RESULTS: Comparing the initial management (surgical excision versus biopsy) preferred by otorhinolaryngologists at tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> with that preferred by those at secondary <b>referral</b> <b>centers,</b> {{significant differences were found}} for seven anatomical locations. Notable differences were observed concerning the treatment of glottic lesions and the management of mild to moderate dysplasia after biopsy. Among the different tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centers,</b> no uniform preference in management was noticed. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the management of LPMLs between otorhinolaryngologists at tertiary and secondary <b>referral</b> <b>centers,</b> depending on the location and histopathology of the lesions. Consensus on and development of guidelines concerning the management of LMPLs could be useful to optimize the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of these lesions...|$|R

40|$|Objective To draw a {{reliable}} {{picture of the}} surgical management of advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) within the MITO Group, trying to correlate the disease extent at presentation, the category of center, and surgical outcome. Methods Three tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> for gynecologic oncology and four non-oncologic <b>referral</b> gynecologic surgical <b>centers,</b> participated in the project. A questionnaire was adopted to register perioperative data on AOCs (FIGO Stage IIIC-IV) consecutively operated on {{for a period of}} 12 months. Results A total of 205 patients were registered into the study: 140 and 65 were recruited in oncological <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> and non-referral centers, respectively. Following a multivariate analysis, the Eisenkop score and the category of center resulted the most potent predictors of complete surgical cytoreduction followed by PCI, preoperative CA 125, and ASA score. Complete surgical cytoreduction was associated with oncological <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> (60 % vs 24. 6 %, p < 0. 001). The proportion of patients undergoing additional surgical procedures was significantly different comparing the two categories of centers (at least one additional procedure was performed in 81. 4 % vs 50. 8 % in oncological <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> compared to the others, p < 0. 001). Despite the more aggressive surgery performed in oncological <b>referral</b> <b>centers,</b> the perioperative outcome measures were not significantly different in the two groups. Conclusions The chance of obtaining a complete cytoreduction mainly depends on patient characteristics, tumor spread, and quality of treatment. The latter is amenable for direct influence, and therefore, seems to be of utmost importance when considering efforts aiming at improvement in the outcome of this disease...|$|R

2500|$|Only about 10% of Tourette's {{patients}} exhibit coprolalia, but {{it tends}} to attract more attention than any other symptom. [...] There is a paucity of epidemiological studies of Tourette syndrome; ascertainment bias affects clinical studies. Studies on people with Tourette's often [...] "came from tertiary referral samples, the sickest of the sick". [...] Further, the criteria for a diagnosis of Tourette's were changed in 2000, when the impairment criterion {{was removed from the}} DSM-IV-TR for all tic disorders, resulting in increased diagnoses of milder cases. Further, many clinical studies suffer from small sample size. These factors combine to render older estimates of coprolaliabiased towards clinical populations of the more severe casesoutdated. An international, multi-site database of 3,500 individuals with Tourette syndrome drawn from clinical samples found 14% of patients with Tourette's accompanied by comorbid conditions had coprolalia, while only 6% of those with uncomplicated ("pure") Tourette's had coprolalia. The same study found that the chance of having coprolalia increased linearly with the number of comorbid conditions: [...] patients with four or five other conditionsin addition to ticswere four to six {{times more likely to have}} coprolalia than persons with only Tourette's. [...] One study of a general pediatric practice found an 8% rate of coprolalia in children with Tourette syndrome, while another study found 60% in a tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>center</b> (where typically more severe cases are referred). [...] A more recent Brazilian study of 44 patients with Tourette syndrome found a 14% rate of coprolalia; a Costa Rican study of 85 subjects found 20% had coprolalia; a Chilean study of 70 patients found an 8.5% rate of coprolalia; older studies in Japan reported a 4% incidence of coprolalia; and a still older clinical study in Brazil found 28% of 32 patients had coprolalia. [...] Considering the methodological issues affecting all of these reports, the consensus of the Tourette Syndrome Association is that the actual number is below 15 percent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Highly {{infectious}} diseases (HIDs) {{are defined as}} being transmissible from person to person, causing life-threatening illnesses and presenting a serious public health hazard. The sampling, handling and transport of specimens from patients with HIDs present specific bio-safety concerns. Findings The European Network for HID project aimed to record, in a cross-sectional study, the infection control capabilities of <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> for HIDs across Europe and assesses the level of achievement to previously published guidelines. In this paper, we report the current diagnostic capabilities and bio-safety measures applied to diagnostic procedures in these <b>referral</b> <b>centers.</b> Overall, 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries were evaluated. Although 81 % of these <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> are located near a biosafety level 3 laboratory, 11 % and 31 % of them still performed their microbiological and routine diagnostic analyses, respectively, without bio-safety measures. Conclusions The discrepancies among the <b>referral</b> <b>centers</b> surveyed between the level of practices and the European Network of Infectious Diseases (EUNID) recommendations have multiple reasons of which {{the interest of the}} individuals in charge and the investment they put in preparedness to emerging outbreaks. Despite the fact that the less prepared centers can improve by just updating their practice and policies any support to help them to achieve an acceptable level of biosecurity is welcome. </p...|$|R
