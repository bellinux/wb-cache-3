40|$|The paper {{presents}} a preliminary study {{and development for}} a lunar In Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) plant. To make the human space colonisation a fundamental step is represented by enabling technologies to exploit local resource, limiting a periodical refurbishment from Earth. Here a possible technological demonstrator mission is deeply analyzing taking care of any possible technological and design trade-offs. Firstly {{the selection of the}} material to be treated is presented, based on the analysis of the available resources on our satellite. As a second step the different methods of extraction are compared and the process of oxygen manufacturing is proposed as the most important element to both support life and supplying fuel for propulsion applications. Oxygen manufacture can be obtained thanks to different processes such as the hydrogen reduction of ilmenite, molten silicates electrolysis, pyrolisis and carbothermal reduction of anorthite. The last has been selected for the presented design as it offers the best compromise in terms of feasibility and innovation. The Malapert Mountain {{turned out to be the}} zone with the best-suited superficial soil composition to collect the anorthite, having a smooth morphology, quite good light exposition too. The requirements the ISRU technological demonstrator has been design include the production of 3 - 5 kg oxygen within 6 months. Moreover, the exploitation of a European launcher such the Ariane 5 is has been posted. As a consequence, strong limitations on launcheable mass and ISRU dimensions must have been taken into account while sizing. Five modules - each of which has been preliminarily designed - compose the overall plant. To better understand and analyze the feasibility and the process effectiveness the dynamic model of the entire plant has been implemented. The dynamic modelling of the ISRU demonstrator helped in refining the preliminary design of the modules and to simulate different operational mode of the plant itself. The ISRU architecture includes the following modules: 1. a Beneficiation modulus, whose aim is the selection of fine particles of anorthite from other species in order to satisfy reactor requirements; 2. a Reactor, the core of the system, i. e. the chamber where the reaction of reduction with methane takes place and monoxide and hydrogen are produced; 3. a <b>Reverse</b> <b>Steam</b> Reforming chamber, where water and methane are obtained from monoxide an hydrogen, coming from reactor and tanks where a surplus of hydrogen is stowed; 4. a Water Electrolysis modulus, where oxygen and water are produced from water; 5. a Power Generation system, which provides required power to every unit thanks to solar panels and fuel cells. A previous research and study in the field of analogous applications on Earth and Moon was followed by a thorough analysis to define the best configuration, in terms of dimensions and dynamic respond, which fitted in with mission requirements. Dynamic simulation needed the identification of mathematical model, capable of describing behaviours of every system. Thanks to this operation a numerical model was built in Matlab/Simulink environment. A parametrical analysis was conducted: this allowed to define running performances of every system and to describe different situations, such as non-optimal or critical working conditions. This part of the study involved an important contribution to dimensional statements and it could be a starting-point to improve reliability. The result of the dynamic analysis was the creation of a dynamic model library which re{{presents a}}nd describes every single modulus of the unit, whose elements can be interfaced to simulate the behaviour of the entire unit. This kind of approach to the problem allowed us to create completely parametrical elements of the library, applicable to bigger-size systems, flexible because they can be interfaced in many ways to solve different configurations, and integrable with external components...|$|E
5000|$|Since 1988 the Tobiashammer {{has also}} housed {{one of the}} larges steam engines in Europe: a twin, tandem, <b>reversing,</b> <b>steam</b> engine, built in 1920, with a total weight of 305 tonnes and a power output of 12,000 horsepower. It comes from the old Maxhütte {{smeltery}} at Unterwellenborn and was decommissioned in 1985. The engine is fully working and is operated during guided tours.|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{fitted with}} Pyle National {{turbo-generators}} and headlamps, with the generator {{attached to the}} top of the smokebox, ahead of the chimney. It had the Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, steam brakes and combination vacuum ejectors.|$|R
50|$|Their type H.T-1 {{mechanical}} stokers {{were capable}} of delivering 15000 lb of coal per hour, which ensured a high firing rate when required. The stoker was driven by a totally enclosed double-acting two-cylinder variable-speed <b>reversing</b> <b>steam</b> engine, located on the hind pivot casting and operated from the cab. The coal bunker on the rear engine unit's frame was designed with sloping sides to allow the coal to gravitate to the mechanical stoker's conveyor screw trough, which extended {{the full length of}} the bunker.|$|R
50|$|The 3600 {{class were}} fitted with <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> brakes, and two steam-operated water pick-ups for forward and reverse working. This {{reflects}} their intended work as fast suburban engines. About half were employed on such duties in the Birmingham area. The rest {{worked in the}} London area, though later a few worked Chester-Birkenhead trains, and some were allocated to South Wales sheds. They were essentially passenger train locomotives, and were eventually superseded by Collett's 2-6-2Ts. All were withdrawn and scrapped between 1930 and 1934.|$|R
50|$|Another locomotive, no. 280, was {{equipped}} with <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear in 1907, also to Hendrie’s design. The <b>steam</b> <b>reverser</b> {{proved to be an}} unqualified success and was soon adopted as standard equipment {{on the rest of the}} Class. It was fitted to all engines which were subsequently designed by Hendrie and remained the standard reverser on South African steam locomotives well into the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|The spatial {{layout and}} remnant fabric and {{earthworks}} at the Ebagoola township and Ada Stewart Battery {{are important in}} demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early, intensively worked goldfield in far north Queensland. The battery includes a 10-head stamper, Cornish boiler, grinding pans, duplex <b>steam</b> pump, <b>reversing</b> <b>steam</b> engine, associated brick and clay machinery mounts, and tailing sands. The nearby township site consists of dwelling sites and associated materials; stands of date palms and mango trees, the remains of cattle yards, while extensive areas of shallow workings and alluvial workings are found throughout the whole site. Miller's hut in the Ebagoola township site is typical of dwellings in early North Queensland mining camps, although possibly it is of later origin.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} were erected at the East London workshops. Apart {{from their}} boilers and cylinders, {{the frame and}} other important components were standard {{with those of the}} Class 14, such as the coupled wheels, bogie, Pyle National turbo-generators and headlamps, Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, steam brakes and combination vacuum ejectors. It was also delivered with Type MP1 tenders which had a coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. One noticeable visible difference from the Class 14 was the absence of the two large sandboxes on each running board.|$|R
50|$|In January 1925, Abel Gance began {{shooting}} Napoléon using a {{wide variety}} of innovative techniques, including strapping a camera to a man's chest, a snow sled, a horse's saddle, a pendulum swing, and wrapping a large sponge around a hand-held camera so that it could be punched by actors during a fight scene. For the Debrie Parvo camera strapped to the horse's saddle, Gance's technical director, engineer Simon Feldman, devised a <b>reversed</b> <b>steam</b> engine for cranking it, powered by two compressed air tanks. Wearing a costume to fit the scene, cameraman Jules Kruger rode another horse to tend the mechanism between shots. Rather than including one or two hand-held scenes for an unusual effect amid an otherwise static film, Gance strove to make his entire film appear as dynamic as possible. It premiered in early 1927.|$|R

50|$|Sigsbee's report {{confirmed}} Schley's {{doubts about}} Cervera being at Santiago de Cuba, and at around 1800 hours Schley ordered the Flying Squadron to <b>reverse</b> course and <b>steam</b> westward south of Cuba, passing Cienfuegos en route Key West, where the squadron would coal. But at about 2000 hours, {{the conflict in}} Schley's mind between his own conviction that Cervera was at Cienfuegos and Sampson's orders to move to Santiago de Cuba led him to order the Flying Squadron to heave to once more. It drifted westward with the current overnight and all the next morning, some of the ships taking on coal. At 1200 hours on 27 May 1898, Schley ordered it to resume its voyage to Key West. Abruptly, at 1325 hours, Schley {{had a change of}} heart, and ordered the Flying Squadron to again <b>reverse</b> course and <b>steam</b> east for Santiago de Cuba, off which it arrived at 1940 hours on 27 May 1898.|$|R
50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder engine {{cannot be}} reversed {{by means of}} the valve linkage (as in a normal fixed cylinder) because there is none. Reversing of the engine can be achieved by <b>reversing</b> the <b>steam</b> connections between inlet and exhaust or, in the case of small engines, by shifting the trunnion pivot point so that the port in the cylinder lines up with a different pair of ports in the port face. In the latter case, the fixed port face is usually provided with three ports, the central one being the steam feed and the outer two being exhausts, only one of which being in use at any time, depending on the required direction of running.|$|R
3000|$|Thermal water {{treatment}} is the direct logical {{choice for the}} SOEC electrolyser since it requires <b>steam.</b> <b>Reverse</b> osmosis is slightly more efficient but it delivers lower quality (400  ppm TDS versus 5  ppm), and therefore requires more sophisticated post-treatment, which should be avoided.

5000|$|Like his brother, James Stirling favoured the domeless boiler, {{known as}} the [...] "straightback" [...] and cabs for the enginemen. Although not the first British {{locomotive}} engineer to use the 4-4-0 type, {{he was the first}} to produce a 4-4-0 which could be regarded as successful, with his G&SWR 6 Class of 1873. Stirling also invented a <b>steam</b> <b>reverser,</b> using it on most of his designs from 1874.|$|R
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid <b>steam</b> <b>reverser,</b> could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|R
50|$|The Hendrie C, {{as it was}} popularly known, {{was similar}} to the Class A Hendrie A in general proportions, but with Walschaerts valve gear, 1+1/2 in larger {{diameter}} coupled wheels, a larger boiler with a higher boiler pressure and a more enclosed cab which offered better protection to the crew. They were equipped with Hendrie's <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear and had wide Belpaire fireboxes, carried down between the rear frames which had been widened by using a bridle casting.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear, {{controlled by}} <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear. The cylinders and steam chests were formed in three separate castings. The high-pressure cylinders were arranged with piston valves, while the low-pressure cylinders were arranged with Richardson balanced type slide valves, arranged above the cylinders. The steam chest covers of the low-pressure cylinders were designed with inclined joint faces {{to facilitate the}} handling of the valve and refacing of the ports during servicing.|$|R
50|$|They {{were built}} with Hendrie’s steam reversers. The Hendrie <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear {{consisted}} of a 5+1/2 in diameter steam cylinder and a 5 in diameter oil cylinder, arranged in line on a bracket which was fixed to the main engine frame on the driver's side. The cylinders had a common piston rod which had a slot in the centre, between the cylinders. This slot accommodated a sliding crosshead which engaged with an arm fixed to the reversing shaft.|$|R
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid <b>steam</b> <b>reverser.</b> The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|R

60|$|As {{the crabs}} approached, the stern-jacket of the Adamant was let down, and the engines were slowed. This stern-jacket, when {{protecting}} the rudder and propellers, {{looked very much}} like the cowcatcher of a locomotive, and was capable of being put to a somewhat similar use. It was the intention of the captain of the Adamant, should the crabs attempt to attach themselves to his stern, to suddenly put on all <b>steam,</b> <b>reverse</b> his engines, and back upon them, the stern-jacket answering as a ram.|$|R

50|$|The Walschaerts {{valve gear}} was {{controlled}} by a vertical type of <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> engine which {{was attached to the}} right-hand side of the boiler, just below the dome. It consisted of a 5+1/2 in diameter steam cylinder and a 4 in diameter oil cylinder, fitted with a common piston rod with a crosshead which was machined integral with the piston rod. This crosshead was connected to a lever fitted to the reversing shaft. After 1912, these reversing engines were replaced with Hendrie steam reversers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{guardian}} valve is a valve used {{in marine}} steam turbine propulsion plants to prevent steam from leaking into the astern turbine while the vessel is {{operating in the}} ahead mode. It is normally installed between the astern throttle valve and the astern elements of the low pressure (LP) turbine. Typically only the LP turbine of a steam ship's propulsion plant has <b>reversing</b> blade elements. <b>Steam</b> leaking {{in such a manner}} would result in a loss of efficiency and possibly overheat and damage the turbine blades.|$|R
50|$|A further {{complication}} was {{the unpredictable}} behaviour of the Eastleigh type of <b>steam</b> <b>reverser</b> employed. If this reverser misbehaved under the fluctuating pressures {{present in the}} steam chest, the locomotive {{seemed to have a}} will of its own. For example, if the reverser dropped into full gear, the slackness in the motion would make the valves overrun their designed full travel. This would result in the locomotive taking off like an unleashed race horse, high coal consumption, throwing the fire out of the chimney and running the risk of a violent high-speed slipping.|$|R
50|$|In most {{reciprocating}} piston engines, the <b>steam</b> <b>reverses</b> its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the cylinder {{by the same}} port. The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four events - admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, {{of which there are}} many types.|$|R
500|$|After 1903, a [...] {{frame with}} a longer {{overhang}} {{at the front}} end was introduced and <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear fitted. Some sources record these locomotives as X14 class, and this designation was sometimes {{used to refer to}} the longer-framed versions, but for most purposes the two sub-classes were grouped together and known as M7. The 1904/05 construction batch moved the sandboxes back to the front splasher and new items were feed water heating, single ram pumps and balanced crank axles. For the remainder of construction from the outshopping of the 105th locomotive in 1911, duplex pumps were fitted.|$|R
500|$|The {{fast-moving}} {{and unpredictable}} Bulleid <b>steam</b> <b>reverser</b> {{was replaced with}} a screw-link version, whilst the mechanical lubricators were moved to the footplates along the boiler sides. [...] Sanding was also added to the leading driving axle, whilst rearward application was incorporated to the middle driving axle. [...] The first 'modified' locomotive {{to be released from}} Eastleigh was 35018 British India Line in 1956. The final example, 35028 Clan Line, was completed in 1960. The success of the modification programme for the Merchant Navy class was also to influence the design of the future modification of 60 'Light Pacifics'.|$|R
