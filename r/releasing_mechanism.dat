40|$|The {{capabilities}} of three on-load and one off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were investigated for normal, extreme and failure type release {{operations at the}} Institute for Ocean Technology. The failure of <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> during maintenance and exercise drills is a well-documented occurrence. However, until very recently the possible causes of the failures have only been postulated but never tested in a systematic way. The current study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the operational performance of lifeboat <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with respect to normal, extreme and failure operational situations. Three twin fall davit on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and one off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> were tested in the experimental study. All the <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> design types are fully certified by the regulatory bodies. Of the three on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> two were of older existing design types while the third was of a newer (next generation) design. Of the four <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> tested, two of the mechanisms were new and never used outside of this study. Also, one of the never used new mechanisms was of an older design while the other was the next generation design. The never used mechanisms had a loading capacity of 6 tonnes, while the third on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> had been in operation for some time and had a capacity of 3 tonnes. The off-load mechanism had also been in use and had a capacity of 12 tonnes. The experiments were conducted in the material testing facility of the Institute for Ocean Technology of the National Research Council of Canada and encompassed the following tests: Inline/offline on-load tests Inline/offline static tests Offline cyclic loading Offline damage release cable Inline off-load tests Results for the above mentioned tests will be presented in this report. Thus far all the results from in-line to offline, and from dynamic to static indicate that hook C, the next generation design, appears to have a higher degree of stability than the other two sample hooks. The off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> was limited to inline tests and followed a different testing procedure as the on-load <b>mechanisms.</b> The off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> worked as intended in the limited test conditions.

50|$|Tinbergen added {{complexity}} to this model, a model {{now known}} as Tinbergen's hierarchical model. He suggested that motivational impulses build up in nervous centres in the brain which are held in check by blocks. The blocks are removed by an innate <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that allows the energy to flow to the next centre (each centre containing a block {{that needs to be}} removed) in a cascade until the behaviour is expressed. Tinbergen's model shows multiple levels of complexity and that related behaviours are grouped.|$|E

5000|$|Together with Nikolaas Tinbergen, Lorenz {{developed}} {{the idea of}} an innate <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> to explain instinctive behaviors (fixed action patterns). They experimented with [...] "supernormal stimuli" [...] such as giant eggs or dummy bird beaks which they found could release the fixed action patterns more powerfully than the natural objects for which the behaviors were adapted. Influenced by the ideas of William McDougall, Lorenz developed this into a [...] "psychohydraulic" [...] model of the motivation of behavior, which tended towards group selectionist ideas, which were influential in the 1960s. Another of his contributions to ethology is his work on imprinting. His influence on a younger generation of ethologists; and his popular works, were important in bringing ethology {{to the attention of the}} general public.|$|E
5000|$|Many dynamic {{models of}} {{artificial}} action selection were originally inspired by research in ethology. In particular, Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen provided {{the idea of}} an innate <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> to explain instinctive behaviors (fixed action patterns). Influenced by the ideas of William McDougall, Lorenz developed this into a [...] "psychohydraulic" [...] model of the motivation of behavior. In ethology, these ideas were influential in the 1960s, but they are now regarded as outdated because of their use of an energy flow metaphor; the nervous system and the control of behavior are now normally treated as involving information transmission rather than energy flow. Dynamic plans and neural networks are more similar to information transmission, while spreading activation is more similar to the diffuse control of emotional / hormonal systems.|$|E
50|$|Human infant data using {{eye-tracking}} measures {{suggest that}} the mirror neuron system develops before 12 months of age, and that this system may help human infants understand other people's actions. A critical question concerns how mirror neurons acquire mirror properties. Two closely related models postulate that mirror neurons are trained through Hebbian or Associative learning (see Associative Sequence Learning). However, if premotor neurons need to be trained by action in order to acquire mirror properties, {{it is unclear how}} newborn babies are able to mimic the facial gestures of another person (imitation of unseen actions), as suggested by the work of Meltzoff and Moore. One possibility is that the sight of tongue protrusion recruits an innate <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> in neonates. Careful analysis suggests that 'imitation' of this single gesture may account for almost all reports of facial mimicry by new-born infants.|$|E

5000|$|The wooden Sailfish {{began as}} the 11' 7½" [...] (3.5 m) [...] "Standard" [...] model. Shortly after its {{inception}} a larger, 13' 7" [...] (4.2 m) [...] "Super" [...] model was made available. In {{the early years}} the spars were made from Sitka spruce and the sail was silk. Historic photos show sails {{with as many as}} 10 panels and even small battens inserted. Sails in those days were lashed to the spars with line in the traditional manner with a marlin hitch instead of being attached by the plastic sail clips that became another familiar characteristic of this boat in later years. One of Alcort's first innovations for the Sailfish was to create a patented rudder <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that automatically released the rudder into a horizontal position for easy beaching. By the late 1950s the option of either a nylon or Dacron polyester sail in solid colors of red or blue became available to complement the previous white only sail.|$|E
5000|$|While some species-typical {{behavior}} is learned from parents, it's also sometimes {{the product of}} a fixed action pattern, also known as an innate <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> (IRM). In these instances, a neural network is 'programmed' to create a hard-wired, instinctive behavior in response to an external stimulus. When a blind child hears news that makes her happy, she's likely to smile in response; she never had to be taught to smile, and she never learned this behavior by seeing others do it. Similarly, when kittens are shown a picture of a cat in a threatening posture, most of them arch their backs, bear their teeth, and sometimes even hiss, even though they've never seen another cat do this. Many IRMs {{can be explained by the}} theory of evolution - if an adaptive behavior helps a species survive long enough to be fruitful and multiply (such as a cat hissing in order to discourage an attack from another creature), the genes that coded for those brain circuits are more likely to be passed on. A heavily studied example of a fixed action pattern is the feeding behavior of the Helisoma trivolvis (pulmonata), a type of snail. A study has shown that the intricate connections within the buccal ganglia (see nervous system of gastropods) form a central system whereby sensory information stimulates feeding in the helisoma. More specifically, a unique system of communication between three classes of neurons in the buccal ganglia are responsible for forming the neural network that influences feeding.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading edge flap and locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade.
