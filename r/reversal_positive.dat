40|$|Understanding how {{individual}} {{identity is}} processed from faces remains a complex problem. Contrast reversal, showing faces in photographic negative, impairs face recognition in humans and demonstrates {{the importance of}} surface-based information (shading and pigmentation) in face recognition. We tested the importance of contrast information for face encoding in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys using a computerized face-matching task. Results showed that contrast <b>reversal</b> (<b>positive</b> to negative) selectively impaired face processing in these two species, although the impairment was greater for chimpanzees. Unlike chimpanzees, however, monkeys performed just as well matching negative to positive faces, suggesting that they retained some ability to extract identity information from negative faces. A control task showed that chimpanzees, but not rhesus monkeys, performed significantly better matching face parts compared with whole faces after a contrast reversal, suggesting that contrast reversal acts selectively on face processing, rather than general visual-processing mechanisms. These results confirm the importance of surface-based cues for face processing in chimpanzees and humans, while the results were less salient for rhesus monkeys. These findings make {{a significant contribution to}} understanding the evolution of cognitive specializations for face processing among primates, and suggest potential differences between monkeys and apes...|$|E

The SRW will satisfy us for {{now as it}} can be generalized with a few simple assumptions to various other random walks. Our main topics are- the Wald identities along with the derivation of the moment generating function of the first passage time for 1 -dimensional SRW and the SRW properties such as: the arcsine laws for the last zero and fraction of time above axis, time reversal and equidistribution of positive time for SRW bridge. We will see that there are several properties whose probability distribution is similar asymptotically to the arcsine function.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 American Chemical SocietyThe hypothiocyanate anion (OSCN) (-) is {{reported}} to be a major product of the lactoperoxidase/H(2) O(2) /(SCN) (-) system, and this anion is proposed to have significant antimicrobial properties. The collision induced (CID) negative ion mass spectrum of "(OSCN) (-) " has been reported: there is a pronounced parent anion at m/z 74, together with fragment anions at m/z 58 (SCN) (-) and 26 (CN) (-). These fragment anions are consistent with structure (OSCN) (-). However there is also a lesser peak at m/z 42 (OCN(-) or CNO(-)) in this spectrum which is either formed by rearrangement of (OSCN) (-) or from an isomer of this anion. The current theoretical investigation of (OSCN) (-) and related isomers, together with the study of possible rearrangements of these anions, indicates that ground-state singlet (OSCN) (-) is a stable species and that isomerization is unlikely. The three anions (OSCN) (-), (SCNO) (-), and (SNCO) (-) have been synthesized (in the ion source of a mass spectrometer) by unequivocal routes, and their structures have been confirmed by a consideration of their collision induced (negative ion) and charge <b>reversal</b> (<b>positive</b> ion) mass spectra. The CID mass spectrum of (SCNO) (-) shows formation of m/z 42 (CNO(-)), but the corresponding spectra of (OSCN) (-) or (SNCO) (-) lack peaks at m/z 42. Combined theoretical and experimental data support earlier evidence that the hypothiocyanite anion is a major oxidation product of the H(2) O(2) /(SCN) (-) system. However, the formation of m/z 42 in the reported CID spectrum of "(OSCN) (-) " does not originate from (OSCN) (-) but from another isomer, possibly (SCNO) (-). Suresh Dua, Micheal J.

40|$|International audienceThe coercive field {{statistics}} in FePt nanostructures reveals {{the existence of}} multiple switching probability sub-distributions that can be asymmetric {{with respect to the}} field orientation. Each sub-distribution is correlated with an individual magnetization reversal path whose selection cannot happen at the magnetization <b>reversal</b> in negative (<b>positive)</b> field but rather at the moment of applying the initial positive (negative) magnetic field. This serves to determine the reference magnetic state from which <b>reversal</b> in negative (<b>positive)</b> field will develop. The disappearance of the asymmetric sub-distributions upon increasing the initial magnetic field μ 0 Hmax supports this model. However, the sub-distributions remaining at high μ 0 Hmax are not necessarily those characterized by the highest coercive field. This is attributed {{to the fact that the}} initial magnetization state hierarchy and the coercive field hierarchy are essentially decorrelated...|$|R

We examined the response to exogenous GABA or to stimulation of GABAergic fibres {{in order to identify}} the ionic basis of GABAergic synaptic transmission and its physiological implications. Reversal potentials of GABA responses (EGABA) were determined exclusively by the Cl− gradient, measured using whole-cell recording.

With normal intracellular Cl−, GABA depolarized neurons by 12 mV. In current clamp, repetitive activation of the GABAergic axons reduced the probability of spiking in response to simultaneous stimulation of excitatory axons. However, IPSPs could themselves elicit action potentials, and facilitation of IPSPs by repetitive activation could lead to a characteristic pattern of spiking.

This ability has been examined in reversal learning tasks, where participants first learn a stimulus–response association (e. g., select a particular object to get a reward) and then need to alter their response when reinforcement contingencies change. Although substantial evidence demonstrates that the OFC is a critical region for reversal learning, previous studies have not distinguished reversal learning for emotional associations from neutral associations.

FeTe exhibits a sign <b>reversal</b> from <b>positive</b> to negative across {{the transition to the}} low-temperature antiferromagnetic state, indicating the occurrence of drastic reconstruction in the band structure. The mobility analysis using the carrier density theoretically calculated reveals that the mobility of holes is strongly suppressed to zero, and hence the electric transport looks to be dominated by electrons. The Se substitution to Te suppresses the antiferromagnetic long-range order and induces superconductivity instead. The similar mobility analysis for Fe(Se 0. 4 Te 0. 6) and Fe(Se 0. 5 Te 0. 5) thin films shows that the mobility of electrons increases with decreasing temperature even in the paramagnetic state, and keeps sufficiently high values down to the superconducting transition temperature.
