5|$|Sunderland {{played in}} an all blue strip from their {{formation}} until 1884, when they adopted a <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> halved strip. They assumed the current strip of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes in the 1887–88 season. Their badge included a ship, {{the upper part}} of the Sunderland coat of arms, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes. In 1977 the badge was changed, but still included the ship, football and the background of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{played in}} <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> shirts in an FA Cup final {{for the first}} time, on {{previous}} occasions in 1930 and 32 they wore fully red shirts. Additionally, before the 1967/68 season, Arsenal only wore team badges on their shirts on special occasions, such as FA Cup Finals. The 1936 cup final was the fourth occasion such a badge was worn. Sheffield United also wore crested <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> shirts, their vertical stripe design.|$|E

The duke {{recorded}} that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E

5|$|The merged school began {{developing}} traditions such as Homecoming in 1951, and <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> Day in 1953. <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> Day {{eventually became}} a full week of school spirit related activities preceding the annual Male-Manual football game. Two traditions of the sexually segregated past, sororities and the all-male Mitre Club, persisted into the 1950s as unofficial organizations but gradually faded away. Students began publishing a newspaper, The Crimson Record, in 1955.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the design}} of the jersey was {{modified}} because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort. This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and an altered design. Instead of using the traditional hoops, the side used a sky-blue based jersey and a <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club's history where the traditional deep blue, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> combination was absent from the jersey. After the war, the V-strip design reverted to the original blue that had been present in the original jerseys, and the single <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes around the shirt's chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team's base design.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} kinds of <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> {{political}} violence: (i) a calculated {{part of the general}} warfare, (ii) local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the high staffs planned and organized the actions and gave orders to the lower level; at least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. At first the <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> governments officially opposed political violence, but the operational decisions were made at the military level.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other wines}} {{produced}} in the United States, Oregon wines are marketed as varietals. Oregon law requires that wines {{produced in the}} state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and for most varietals it must contain at least 90% of that variety. The exceptions to the 90% law are the following varietals: <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> Bordeaux varietals, <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> Rhône varietals, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Tannat. For these wines, they follow the Federal guidelines of 75%. Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin. Oregon is most famous for its Pinot noir, which is produced throughout the state. Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and Oregon is {{regarded as one of}} the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.|$|E

5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> paint to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E
