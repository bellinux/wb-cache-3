Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 77 - 80. The aim of {{this study}} is to investigate the speech interference of users in an open-planned multi-activities public leisure space. Bilkent <b>Roll</b> <b>House</b> was chosen as a leisure space because of its variety of activities in an open-plan such as bowling, dart, billiards, play station and dining area. In this respect, to analyze acoustical parameters and users characteristics of this study, a pilot and case study was undertaken by using questionnaires/intelligibility tests, computer simulations and real-size measurements. Questionnaires /speech intelligibility tests and Leq measurements were done in order to analyze noise annoyance ratings of the users of selected space as pilot study. The speech interference parameters measured as a case study are; Reverberation Time (T 30), Speech Transmission Index (STI), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Equivalent Continuous A-weighted Sound Pressure Level (Leq A). The results showed that reverberation characteristics of Bilkent <b>Roll</b> <b>House</b> are at the required range. However, it was observed that, the speech parameters (STI & SNR) results are insufficient in terms of speech communication. In addition, the noise level (Leq A) of the activities in Bilkent <b>Roll</b> <b>House</b> increases slightly in time. However, the results of Leq A at the dining area of Bilkent <b>Roll</b> <b>House</b> indicate that, users are affected in an informal way by the speech interference, and instead of increasing their voice level, they prefer to deal with their main activity to provide speech intelligibility in multi-activity spaces.

50|$|The Socialist Party of Great Britain {{was founded}} in Bartlett's Passage, off Fetter Lane, in 1904. From 1920 to 1961 the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} was initially located in Geraldine House, then moved to {{the north end of}} Fetter Lane, at Holborn Circus, and remained there until 1990, when it moved to the Isle of Dogs. The original site, between Rolls Buildings (a street) and Bream's Buildings (another street to the north) was called <b>Rolls</b> <b>House</b> from 1961 until its demolition in 2007. The new site, sometimes called 110 Fetter Lane rather than <b>Rolls</b> <b>House,</b> is the site of an 11-storey building containing 29 courtrooms and other judicial accommodation. 43 Fetter Lane was the longtime headquarters of printing company Monotype until its destruction by bombing in 1941.|$|R
