50|$|The most {{important}} cause of AK formation is solar radiation, specifically UV-B <b>radiation</b> (<b>wavelength</b> 290-320). UV-B radiation causes thymidine dimer formation in DNA and RNA, leading to significant cellular mutations. Additionally, {{recent research has}} been focused {{on the role of the}} p53 tumor suppressor gene in AK formation. This tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p132, allows for cell cycle arrest when DNA or RNA is damaged. Dysregulation of the p53 pathway can thus result in unchecked proliferation of dysplastic keratinocytes, thereby serving as a source of neoplastic growth and the development of AK, as well as possible carcinogenesis. Other molecular markers that have been associated with the development of AK include the expression of p16ink4, the CD95 ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TRAIL receptors, and loss of heterozygosity.|$|E
50|$|X-ray free {{electron}} lasers use long undulators. The underlying {{principle of the}} intense pulses from the X-ray laser lies in the principle of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), {{which leads to the}} microbunching. Initially all electrons are distributed evenly and they emit incoherent spontaneous radiation only. Through the interaction of this radiation and the electrons' oscillations, they drift into microbunches separated by a distance equal to one <b>radiation</b> <b>wavelength.</b> Through this interaction, all electrons begin emitting coherent radiation in phase. All emitted radiation can reinforce itself perfectly whereby wave crests and wave troughs are always superimposed on one another in the best possible way. This results in an exponential increase of emitted radiation power, leading to high beam intensities and laser-like properties. Examples of facilities operating on the SASE FEL principle include the Free electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH), the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the European x-ray {{free electron}} laser (XFEL) in Hamburg, the SPring-8 Compact SASE Source (SCSS), the SwissFEL at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) and, as of 2011, the SACLA at the RIKEN Harima Institute in Japan.|$|E

40|$|Transition {{radiation}} (TR) and diffraction radiation (DR) has widely {{been used}} for both electron beam diagnostics and generation of intense radiation beams in the millimeter and the submillimeter wavelength range. Recently, it was theoretically predicted that TR and DR properties change either at extremely high energies of electrons or at long <b>radiation</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> This phenomenon was called a prewave zone effect. We have performed the first observation and detailed investigation of the prewave zone effect in optical diffraction radiation at 1. 28  GeV electron beam at the KEK-Accelerator Test Facility (KEK-ATF). The beam energy at KEK-ATF is definitely not the highest one achieved in the world. Since we could easily observe the effect, at higher energies it might cause serious problems.

40|$|To {{maximize}} the signal-to-noise ratio of a laser-ultrasound system, one {{may choose to}} reduce the noise by using a better interferometer(and associated laser, optics, etc.), or to increase the signal by selecting a better generation laser. Given that interferometers have reached the detection limit of photon statistics, we focus our attention on ultrasound generation. To do so, we define an optoacoustic transfer function that describes the ultrasound generation efficiency of a pulsed laser on a specific material in a predetermined frequency bandwidth. On this basis, we compare the generation efficiency of various lasers on metals in the ablation regime. It is found that, at constant fluence, shorter pulses (ps) and shorter <b>radiation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> (UV) generate ultrasound more efficiently than longer pulses (ns) and longer <b>radiation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> (IR).

When the molar ratio of Cr 3 + to Al is 0. 2 : 1. 0, compared with the uncoated flake aluminum powders, its average reflectance of visible spectrum and brightness (L*) drop to 50 % and 15, respectively.
