40|$|Data such {{as income}} are {{frequently}} rounded. Rounding may {{be done to}} protect the confidentiality of records in a file, to enhance the readability of the data, or to simplify the data values under {{the notion that the}} digits subject to rounding are inconsequential. The rounding may not have any effect on the bias of an estimator, but it may have a large impact on variance. Integers can be expressed as X = qB + r, where q is the quotient, B is the base, and r is the remainder. B is a constant, but q and r are random variables. We will investigate four <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>rounding</b> “r ” above and observe the effects of rounding on bias and variance. We will assume a uniform distribution for r, but no specific distributional assumption will be made for “q. ” When q = 0, we will show that the variance of the data after rounding is three times the variance before rounding. As the variance of q gets larger, the effect of rounding on the variance decreases...|$|E

The number of cards dealt <b>for</b> each <b>round</b> (between 3 and 7) is chosen by the dealer and there is no set structure to the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> each <b>round.</b> Instead, the player who won the previous round, (referred to as the Caller) chooses the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> the <b>round</b> after viewing their hand.|$|R

Hénard proposed the same in Paris in 1903.Hénard called them carrefours à girations. The first test of the concept was with New York's Columbus Circle, completed in 1905.In 1907 the concept was introduced in Paris in the Place de l'Étoile and Place de la Nation.Roundabouts were introduced in Britain and Germany soon after, and became more common in those countries than in France.|$|R

50|$|Episodes in {{the first}} season were broken into four segments. In the first segment Mayhem shows a tape victims have sent to him asking for help with a bully. This was {{followed}} by Mayhem meeting with the victims and briefly discussing their problems. Mayhem and the victims would then confront the bully, and Mayhem would offer the bully $10,000 to fight a professional MMA fighter. In all of the episodes that aired, the bully accepted. The next segment consisted of Mayhem bringing the bully into his gym {{to see how the}} bully fights in order to help him determine who to put in the cage against him. During this segment, Mayhem introduced the bullies to their corner man, and usually discussed the fight with the bullies a little. This segment would end with the victims meeting the fighter who would be fighting their bully and some clips of the bully preparing in the locker room. The next segment began with Mayhem standing in the ring with the victims and introducing them to the crowd. After a brief introduction, the bully would then be brought out to boos from the crowd. Mayhem would then let the bullies and victims have a few last words before bringing out the fighter. The cage was then handed over to Big John, who would beg{{in the first}} round of each fight after a short segment explaining the rules. Round 1 is a 3-minute grappling only round. The bully starts the round with $5,000 but loses $1,000 every time he is forced to tap out. The next segment began with an explanation of the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>Round</b> 2. Round 2 is a 3-minute kickboxing round. The bully wins $5,000 if they can survive the entire 3 minutes, but does not get any money if he quits or gets KO'd or the referee stops the fight. After the round ends, Mayhem deals out the money, and asks the bully if there is anything they want to say to their victim(s) once the fight ended, in which is almost always an apology.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>rule</b> is <b>for</b> {{preliminary}} <b>rounds</b> (semifinals, quarter-finals, etc.). It {{says that}} for each dance of the round the judges must mark the number of dance couples specified by the Chairman of Adjudicators whom they decide {{to advance to the}} next round. A score of a couple is the number of all [...] "pass" [...] marks over all judges and dances. The couples with the highest score advance to the next round. Usually the number of the couples to enter the next round is known in advance. However in the cases of ties the Chairman decides the number of dancers <b>for</b> the next <b>round.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A round ends {{when any}} player has no cards left. That player is {{declared}} {{the winner of}} the round and is permitted to create a new <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> the next <b>round.</b> If a player has only one card left he or she must say [...] "Bartok" [...] or receive a penalty. This applies even if a player gets down to one card by non-standard means, such as trading hands with someone else. If the draw pile runs out before a round ends, all but the top card of the discard pile is flipped over to form the new draw pile. The game usually ends when several rules combine to make continued play impossible.|$|R

40|$|The Uruguay Round has {{established}} completely new <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> agricultural trade, {{but not yet}} achieved much liberalisation. The current new round of negotiations will, therefore, have to make another big step forward. Countries’ views on what exactly should be agreed in the new round still differ widely. However, {{it is remarkable that}} no country has so far doubted the validity of the new WTO <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> agriculture, nor refused to engage in serious negotiations about further reductions. The EU has so far not had major difficulties to honour the new commitments that resulted from the Uruguay Round, though in the area of export subsidies the constraints have already been felt. In the new round of negotiations, EU export subsidies will be a primary target of negotiations, {{given the fact that the}} EU grants around 88 % of all agricultural export subsidies world-wide. It will, therefore, be important for the EU to change its policies such that EU agriculture can export without subsidies. In the cereals sector, Agenda 2000 has made a notable step in this direction. For other products, though, the EU will need more reforms in the future.
