Art emisinin combination therapy (ACT) has higher rates of parasite clearance and inhibition of anti-malarial drugs resistance than non-ACT. Hence, we compared the efficacies of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) versus artesunate-sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (AS-SP) combination therapies in children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Objective To compare the fever <b>clearance</b> <b>time,</b> parasite <b>clearance</b> <b>time,</b> and length of hospital stay in uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients treated with AS-AQ and AS-SP. Methods We reviewed the medical records of children aged 1 - 14 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria admitted to Prof. Dr. R. D. Kandou Hospital between January 2002 - June 2010. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by fever <b>clearance</b> <b>time,</b> parasite clearan ce time, and length of hospital stay. The differences of treatment efficacy between the two groups of therapy were an alyzed by independent T test. Results We identified 185 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, 104 cases were treated with AS-AQ while the other 81 received AS-SP. Parasite <b>clearance</b> <b>time</b> was shorter in AS-AQ group than in AS-SP group at 1. 38 (SD 0. 69) versus 1. 91 (SD 0. 93) days, respectively (95 %CI of differences 0. 3 0 to 0. 76, P< 0. 05).

The detection limit of aflatoxin B 1 was 0. 008 ng/ml, while for aflatoxin M 1 was 0. 003 ng/ml. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for AFB 1 and AFM 1 was 0. 02 and 0. 01 ng/ml, respectively. <b>Clearance</b> <b>time</b> for AFB 1 and AFM 1 residues were analyzed in two experimental groups of broilers. One group fed with dietary AFB 1 (5. 0 mg/kg feed) and other with curcumin+AFB 1 diet (curcumin; 300 mg/kg feed, AFB 1; 5. 0 mg/kg feed). AFB 1 and AFM 1 residues <b>clearance</b> <b>time</b> was calculated based on LOQ using withdrawal time calculation software (WT 1. 4). <b>Clearance</b> <b>time</b> analyzed for AFB 1 ranged from 11 to 19 days and for AFM 1 ranged from 10 to 12 days at 95 % confidence level. Interestingly, curcumin supplementation in the diet reduced the <b>clearance</b> <b>time</b> of AFM 1 in liver and kidney but not in muscle tissues. Conclusively, the developed method can be appropriately used for the quality control testing of commercial broiler-meat processing companies, food manufacturers, and quality control laboratories...|$|R
