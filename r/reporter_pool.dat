Willis then moved into northern Iraq to cover the Kurdish refugee crisis.|$|R
50|$|Roy Neal Hinkel (May 30, 1921 - August 15, 2003) was an American {{television}} {{correspondent for}} NBC News. An aerospace specialist, he reported {{live on the}} Apollo 11 landing. His newscast from that event was later published on LP by Evolution Records. He also reported on the Apollo 13 crisis as a <b>pool</b> <b>reporter</b> for {{all three of the}} major networks at that time, and provided reporting during the launch of the first Space Shuttle, STS-1.|$|R
5000|$|A press pool is a {{group of}} news {{gathering}} organizations that combine their resources in the collection of news. A pool feed is then distributed to members of the broadcast pool who are free to edit it or use it as they see necessary. In the case of print <b>reporters,</b> a written <b>pool</b> report is distributed to all members. A pool spray is a brief photo opportunity, for instance, at the White House following a meeting.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Sanders and an NBC {{cameraman}} had exclusive {{coverage of}} the Federal raid to free Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy held by his relatives in Miami when the Federal Government ordered {{he had to be}} returned to his father in Cuba after his mother died in the waters off the coast of Florida while trying reach the USA. Sanders' coverage as <b>pool</b> <b>reporter</b> (he is bilingual and fluent in Spanish) on that event was seen on competing networks, such as Univision, Telemundo, and CNN.|$|R
5000|$|While {{there are}} not {{necessarily}} formal rules, there {{tends to be a}} set of informal expectations for pool members. Primarily, all pool members are expected to [...] "share the load" [...] equally. For example, in the case of ongoing events, a different station might provide a <b>pool</b> <b>reporter</b> and/or camera every day. For one-time events, each organization may have its own responsibility (such as providing all cameras or mobile trucks). If there are different venues, each location can be covered by a different member of the pool. If there is not a practical way to divide the responsibilities, organizations in the pool will split the cost.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, it is {{paramount}} that no pool members use their special access {{in order to}} garner an [...] "exclusive" [...] for themselves. In the case of television, a pool photographer is expected to turn over all of the material that was taped rather than keeping certain select shots {{for his or her}} own employer. Print <b>pool</b> <b>reporters</b> are prohibited from including any detail in their own stories that {{was not included in the}} pool report, even if it is only a matter of local color. As a result, White House pool reports are often written in excruciating detail. At a state dinner, the report will likely include what the president ate and what color clothes he was wearing.|$|R
5|$|During the 1930s, The Beverly Hills Hotel became {{increasingly}} popular with Hollywood film stars. Fred Astaire took a shine to the hotel, and enjoyed reading the Daily Variety and The Hollywood <b>Reporter</b> by the <b>pool.</b> Cesar Romero and Carole Lombard were pictured {{together at the}} hotel in 1937. In 1938, the Sand and Pool Club was established at the hotel. It proved extremely popular, with white sand imported from Arizona, which made the pool area look like a beach. The following year, it began hosting fashion shows sponsored by local department stores such as Bullock's Wilshire. In 1940, one of the hotel's long-time patrons, Marlene Dietrich, was instrumental in bringing about a change in policy in the Polo Lounge, which had made it compulsory for women to don skirts which she refused to wear.|$|R
2500|$|Simonyan, who {{was only}} 25 {{years old at the}} time of her hiring by the channel, was a former Kremlin <b>pool</b> <b>reporter</b> and had worked in journalism since she was 18. She told The New York Times that after the fall of the Soviet Union, many new young journalists were hired, {{resulting}} in a much younger pool of staffers than other news organizations. Journalist Danny Schechter (who has appeared as a guest on RT) has stated that having been part of the launch staff at CNN, he saw RT as another [...] "channel of young people who are inexperienced, but very enthusiastic about what they are doing." [...] Shortly after the channel was launched, James Painter wrote that RT and similar news channels such as France 24 and TeleSUR saw themselves as [...] "counter-hegemonic", offering a differing vision and news content from that of Western media like the CNN and the BBC.|$|R
50|$|Working {{first base}} in Game 3 of the 2011 World Series (his first World Series as an umpire), Kulpa {{controversially}} called St. Louis Cardinals hitter Matt Holliday safe after Holliday grounded into {{what would have}} been the second out of a routine double play in the game's fourth inning. Kulpa claimed that Holliday had arrived at first base prior to the tag from Texas Rangers first baseman Mike Napoli, although replays subsequently proved that Napoli had indeed tagged him out by a full stride, prior to Holliday's stumbling across the base and falling. Kulpa later told a <b>pool</b> <b>reporter</b> after the game that he was aware Napoli had tagged Holliday, but he thought Holliday's foot was already on the base. He did not ask for a second opinion. When the game ended, Kulpa reviewed the play on tape and admitted he should have called Holliday out. The Cardinals {{went on to win the}} game 16-7, and eventually won the Series in seven games.|$|R

5000|$|The dilemma {{facing the}} Duke and his fiancée was heavily covered {{at the time}} in the British and European press. An obscure vicar from the North of England, Jardine {{publicly}} volunteered to perform the ceremony. Press supporters of the wedding called Jardine, whose working-class parish was dominated by heavy industry, the [...] "poor man's pastor". The marriage was set for 3 June 1937 in the Château de Candé, Wallis's French home in exile. A small guest list - the wedding was boycotted by almost the entire British establishment - and a single <b>pool</b> <b>reporter</b> witnessed the wedding service, which was read by the vicar [...] "in a strong voice". Following the brief ceremony, the couple departed for a honeymoon in Austria and Jardine unsuccessfully attempted to return to his Darlington parish. However, the vicar was soon made aware that he had performed an act above his station. His vestry committee resigned, and he was encouraged to follow them. Under pressure, he left England and emigrated to California. In 1943 the ex-vicar published a memoir, At Long Last, of the unusual event.|$|R
5000|$|Kelsey {{was born}} on 7 May 1965. He was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, between 1978 and 1983. In 1984 he won an Exhibition to study history at Magdalene College, Cambridge. After graduating in 1987, Kelsey worked as a {{freelance}} newspaper and radio journalist in Turkey and Iraq for The Independent, BBC and The Sunday Telegraph. His investigation into illicit kidney trafficking between Istanbul and London in 1989 triggered a change in British law. He also documented the use of chemical weapons against civilians duringSaddam Hussein's campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq {{in a series of}} articles in The Independent. He joined the launch staff of The Independent on Sunday in 1989 and covered the 1990 Gulf War as a combat <b>pool</b> <b>reporter</b> with British forces. During this period he also presented a number of TV documentaries including [...] "Frontline" [...] for Channel 4 (1994), a documentary in which he escorted Queenie Fletcher, mother of murdered policewoman Yvonne Fletcher to confront Col Gadaffi in Libya and [...] "You Only Live Once" [...] for the BBC (1996), an investigation into anti-ageing science. In 1995 he joined the Sunday Times and became deputy editor of the Insight Team before being appointed news editor in 1998. Kelsey is author of Dervish: The Invention of Modern Turkey, a portrait of the country in the mid-1990s which was published by Hamish Hamilton in 1996 and Penguin Books the following year. Jan Morris, the noted travel writer, commented in her jacket review: 'An excellent travel book, offering startling and vivid insights, social, historical and political, into a Turkey that most visitors can hardly imagine.' Others described it as 'dystopian' and 'no standard travel narrative'.|$|R
