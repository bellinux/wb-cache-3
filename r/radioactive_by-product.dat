Government scientists in both the U.S. and the USSR had insisted that fusion weapons, unlike fission weapons, were cleaner, as fusion reactions did not produce the dangerously <b>radioactive</b> <b>by-products</b> of fission reactions. While technically true, this hid a more gruesome point: the last stage of a multi-staged hydrogen bomb often used the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions to induce fissioning in a jacket of natural uranium, and provided around half of the yield of the device itself.|$|R
30|$|Finally, for the {{synthesis}} of [18 F]EFB, 0.4 – 0.7  mL of [18 F] 3 in 5 % TFA acetonitrile were neutralised with 2  eq. triethylamine (110 – 112  μL) and added to 11  μmol of compound 6 (3.6  mg) in a sealed vessel. The reaction vessel was heated at 160  °C for 15  min, cooled to 50  °C and the solvent was concentrated at 50  °C under a stream of nitrogen for 7 – 10  min. Next, the crude mixture was diluted in 2  mL water ensuring < 15 % acetonitrile was present and injected in an HPLC semi-prep C 18 column to provide isolation of the pure product in > 99 % RCP and > 300  GBq/μmol molar radioactivity.

The resulting product was obtained in high purity and 4.0 % overall RCY in 3  h and 30  min from start of synthesis. Purity tests were performed with HPLC method B (Table  1).

40|$|The largest two sectors {{emitting}} CO 2 in {{the world}} are electricity generation and land-transportation. Therefore, nuclear power {{plays an important role in}} generating electricity with low CO 2 emission. An important aspect needs to be considered to ensure environmental sustainability is nuclear non-proliferation and less amount of radioactive waste generated. Thus the use of "thorium" as nuclear fuel has received increasing interest because thorium produces little amount of plutonium and very little amount of long-lived minor actinide. However, thorium cannot be used immediately due to its lack of fissile isotope indispensable to start fission reaction. At the same time, electric vehicle and hybrid-vehicle become more popular as low-carbon automobiles. Rare-earth elements are indispensable for manufacturing these low-carbon automobiles. However the problem with rare-earth production is its <b>radioactive</b> <b>by-product</b> of "thorium". Since the largest potential of consuming thorium by nuclear power still needs several decades for commercializing, there becomes a discrepancy in consumption and production of thorium causing unused stockpile of thorium. Several countries have announced to supply rare-earth but this cannot be safely and economically done unless thorium problem is solved. In this paper, an international framework called the "OREEC: Organization of Rare-Earth Exportation Countries" is proposed as a solution to this issue. The OREEC has mainly three functions: (1) ThAX, which is a financial collecting method, (2) Th FREE label, which is certification of adequate treatment of thorium and (3) The Bank, which stores separated thorium...|$|E
40|$|Since 1945, the {{chemical}} reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuels in the Hanford Chemical Separation areas {{has resulted in}} the generation of significant volumes of high-level, liquid, <b>radioactive,</b> <b>by-product</b> materials. However, because these materials were recognized to have beneficial uses, their disposal was delayed. To investigate the possibilities, the By-product Utilization Program (BUP) was initiated. The program mission was to develop a means for the application of radioactive-fission products for the benefit of society. Cs capsules were fabricated and distributed to private irradiation facilities for beneficial product sterilization. In June of 1988, a small leak developed in one of the Cs capsules at a private irradiator facility that is located in Decatur, Georgia. This leak prompted DOE to remove these capsules and to re-evaluate the BUP with the irradiator facilities that were currently using Cs capsules. As a result of this evaluation, a recall was issued to require that all remaining Cs capsules be returned to Hanford for safe management and storage pending final capsule disposition. The WHC completed the return of 309 capsules from a private irradiation facility, located in Northglenn, Colorado, to the Hanford Reservation. The DOE is also planning to remove 25 Cs capsules from a small, private irradiator facility located in Lynchburg, Virginia. This small irradiator facility is currently operational and uses the capsules for the underwater irradiation of wood-flooring products. This report discusses transportation-related activities that WHC has researched, developed, implemented, and is currently managing to ensure the safe and efficient movement of Cs- 137 back to the Hanford Reservation...|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{presence}} of un-reacted [13 N]NH 3 and <b>radioactive</b> <b>by-products</b> in the crude reaction mixture, the desired 13 N–labelled Ugi product could be easily isolated using semi-preparative HPLC, as demonstrated for reaction 1. The UV chromatogram of the final isolated product showed two major products co-eluting with the radioactive product. These {{are likely to be}} the non-radioactive α-aminoacyl amide Ugi product, and a structurally similar α-acyloxy amide, the product of the three-component coupling Passerini reaction between the isocyanide, carboxylic acid and aldehyde (see Additional file 1). This is consistent with our observations of {{the presence}} of the 3 -component coupling Passerini product in the LC/MS analysis of the crude reaction mixture during synthesis of the non-radioactive reference standards, and in the analogous 15 N reactions. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>by-products</b> observed in the radio-chromatograms of all reactions 1 – 7 were identified as 13 N–labelled di-imines in which one [13 N]NH 3 molecule reacts with the electrophilic carbon of two isocyanide molecules to form the 13 N–labelled di-imine (Fig. 4). Identification of these by-products further contributes to expanding the breadth of known radiochemistry available for radiosynthesis with [13 N]NH 3. Derivatisation of R 1 and R 2 substituents via the isocyanide and carboxylic acid moieties bearing targeting groups such as peptides, sugars or other functional groups, could enable rapid access to libraries of functionalised 13 N–labelled compounds. Furthermore, {{it may be possible to}} label molecules of specific biological interest using this method, such as 1, 4 -benzodiazepine- 2, 5 -diones which have shown promise as anticonvulsant agents, opiate receptor antagonists and as inhibitors of histone deacetylases which are linked to the pathogenesis of several cancers (Hulme et al., 1998; Loudni et al., 2007).|$|R

30|$|We used an {{aggregated}} {{representation of}} copper, nickel, and cobalt resources with 20 regions and seven resource types to determine regional patterns of resource extractions. More sophisticated and site-specific extraction models, {{like the one}} developed by Northey et al. can give a more detailed picture and may contain a more realistic and site-specific representation of capacity extension {{and the development of}} new mining projects (Northey et al. 2014). It would also allow us {{to take into account the}} cut-off grade to determine the economically recoverable amount of resources. This is particularly important for cobalt as deposits with higher grade in copper or nickel, which would probably be exploited first, do not necessarily have high cobalt grade at the same time, therefore what can be true at an aggregated level might not be the same at the deposit scale. Investment and supply risks have a site-specific component, too. They not only depend on the political climate of the hosting country but also on how the operator interferes with local ecosystems and how local communities react to pollution, land use change, or relocation of people. A better index taking into account country and site-specific considerations could be therefore developed, which could also include the mineralogy of the deposit and the associated environmental risk. Examples for environmental risks include the extraction of <b>radioactive</b> <b>by-products</b> (thorium in case of Dysprosium) and the arsenide nature of ores where cobalt is the main metal (Elshkaki and Graedel 2014; Mudd et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and demonstration of inertial fusion is incredibly challenging {{because it requires}} simultaneously controlling and precisely measuring parameters at extreme values in energy, space, and time. The challenges range from building megajoule (10 {sup 6 } J) drivers that perform with percent-level precision to fabricating targets with submicron specifications to measuring target performance at micron scale (10 {sup {minus} 6 } m) with picosecond (10 {sup {minus} 12 } s) time resolution. Over the past 30 years in attempting to meet this challenge, the inertial fusion community around the world has invented new technologies in lasers, particle beams, pulse power drivers, diagnostics, target fabrication, and other areas. These technologies have found applications in diverse fields of industry and science. Moreover, simply assembling the teams with the background, experience, and personal drive to meet the challenging requirements of inertial fusion has led to spin-offs in unexpected directions, for example, in laser isotope separation, extreme ultraviolet lithography for microelectronics, compact and inexpensive radars, advanced laser materials processing, and medical technology. The experience of inertial fusion {{research and development of}} spinning off technologies has not been unique to any one laboratory or country but has been similar in main research centers in the US, Europe, and Japan. Strengthening and broadening the inertial fusion effort to focus on creating a new source of electrical power (inertial fusion energy [IFE]) that is economically competitive and environmentally benign will yield rich rewards in technology spin-offs. The additional challenges presented by IFE are to make drivers affordable, efficient, and long-lived while operating at a repetition rate of a few Hertz; to make fusion targets that perform consistently at high-fusion yield; and to create target chambers that can repetitively handle greater than 100 -MJ yields while producing minimal <b>radioactive</b> <b>by-products.</b> Meeting these challenges will produce spin-off value of enormous magnitude.

40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> wastes are <b>by-products</b> {{of the use}} of {{radiation}} technologies. As with many technologies, the wastes are required to be disposed of in a safe manner so as to minimise risk to human health. This study examines the requirements for a hypothetical repository and develops techniques for decision making to permit the establishment of a shallow ground burial facility to receive an inventory of low-level radioactive wastes. Australia’s overall inventory is used as an example. Essential and desirable siting criteria are developed and applied to Australia's Northern Territory resulting in the selection of three candidate sites for laboratory investigations into soil behaviour. The essential quantifiable factors which govern radionuclide migration and ultimately influence radiation doses following facility closure are reviewed. Simplified batch and column procedures were developed to enable laboratory determination of distribution and retardation coefficient values for use in one-dimensional advection-dispersion transport equations. Batch and column experiments were conducted with Australian soils sampled from the three identified candidate sites using a radionuclide representative of the current national low-level radioactive waste inventory. The experimental results are discussed and site soil performance compared. The experimental results are subsequently used to compare the relative radiation health risks between each of the three sites investigated. A recommendation is made as to the preferred site to construct an engineered near-surface burial facility to receive the Australian low-level radioactive waste inventory...|$|R
40|$|Lanthanides, {{also called}} rare earth {{elements}} (REE) are key elements in modern technologies and especially in green technologies such as energy generation through wind power. Thus, they are of considerable economic importance with a global production of around 124 000 t REE per year. A detailed environmental assessment with identification of all risks is the foundation to assess the sustainability of mining, processing and separation processes. Rare earth elements usually are found together with actinides such as uranium and thorium. Therefore, actinides and their decay products are simultaneously enriched during the processing of REE. In addition to conventional REE minerals such as monazite or bastnasite, the mineral eudialyte {{can be used as}} a REE source. Even though, the total share of REE is low, the most important REE needed for industrial usages are strongly represented in eudialyte. Furthermore, the proportion of radioactive impurities is very low. Eudialyte is currently not used as source mineral, but might play a bigger role on the global market in the future. Little information about the environmental impacts of REE-production is available to the public, in particular with regard to its <b>radioactive</b> <b>by-products.</b> Thorium is the most prominent of these and has therefore been characterized in detail for its ecotoxicity. A first goal of this work was to evaluate the α- emitter thorium and its impact on the environment. To this aim, an intensive literature search was conducted and results were prepared including the long-term effects of thorium dust and gaseous emissions. Therefore and because ecotoxicological testing of gaseous emissions was technically difficult and environmentally less relevant – unlike its immense impact for exposed industrial workers and bystanders – the water effluent und solid waste streams were investigated with aquatic and terrestrial toxicological experiments. The knowledge gained is meant to supplement the missing data for thorium. A throughout analysis of thorium fluxes along the process of SEE recovery was carried out, and the effects of disposals and other products involved were measured based on ecotoxicological tests with aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In experiments with thorium exclusively the heavy metal property was regarded since radiation effects with a radioactivity half-life of approximately 14 billion years play a subordinate role in typical ecotoxicological testing periods. Moreover, it should be noted that thorium occurs in nature alongside its decay products. Th(OH) 4 at pH 6. 5 to 8 showed no toxic effects in all organisms studied, aquatic (bacteria, algae and daphnia) and terrestrial (springtails, earthworms). Thorium thus does not appear to be a problem in the range of water solubility and in soil concentrations typical found. The effects of process wastewater from various process steps in the production of REE were evaluated based on eudialyte, which was investigated as an example for REE minerals. Figure 1 shows the investigated process steps of eudialyte: after mining, drill, blast and load haul operation, the ore is milled and grinded. In order to enrich it, the wanted mineral is flotated. Afterwards chemicals (acids) are added to dissolve the minerals. Impurities are removed by pH adjustment and precipitation which is also used for REE separation later. Stronger REE separation is achieved by solvent extraction and finally pure REE are obtained by electrolysis. Ground and flotated eudialyte had no or very little ecotoxicological effects. By contrast, leaching residues showed that concentrations which arise during production have a negative impact on all tested organisms (see figure 1). Due to mixture toxicity, it is difficult to estimate which compound is responsible for the total toxicity. It is known that the toxicity of metals differs in various organisms. A general trend shows the following toxicity sequence: Hg> Ag> Cu> Cd> Zn> Ni> Pb> Cr> Sn (Luoma & Rainbow 2011; Merian et al. 2004; F. Scheffer & Schachtschabel 2010). In soil the pH value (soil acidity) has the greatest impact on the metal availability. If the pH value increases, the mobility of heavy metals decreases and thus their availability is reduced. The current study showed that residues from rare earth mining should be stored in a way that ensures that wash-out processes do not affect the water or soil systems. Even tailing dams should be avoided, since otherwise leaching residues can still be washed out, and, on the other hand, terrestrial organisms may be adversely affected. In conclusion, the dumping of leaching residues should be monitored so that they will not pass freely to stockpiles. Additionally, it is important to avoid fine dust which is produced by grinding processes and must not drift. This can be achieved by continuous humidification of stockpiles...|$|R
