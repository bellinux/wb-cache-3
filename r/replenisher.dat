25|$|In the mid-1980s, the Provisional IRA {{received}} {{large quantities}} of modern weaponry, including heavy weaponry such as heavy machine guns, over 1,000 rifles, several hundred handguns, rocket-propelled grenades, flamethrowers, surface-to-air missiles and the plastic explosive Semtex, from the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi. There were four successful shipments between 1985 and 1986; three of these trips were {{carried out by the}} trawler Casamara and a fourth by the oil-rig <b>replenisher</b> Villa. All told, they brought in 110 tons of weaponry. A fifth arms cargo on board the coaster Eksund was intercepted by the French Navy in 1987. This brought the Provisional IRA's new capability {{to the attention of the}} authorities on either side of the Irish border. Five men were captured with the boat; three IRA members, including Gabriel Cleary, received jail sentences. Reportedly, Gaddafi donated enough weapons to arm the equivalent of two infantry battalions.|$|E

50|$|For {{removal of}} gas in vacuum tubes, getters are used. For resupplying gas for {{gas-filled}} tubes, <b>replenishers</b> are employed. Most commonly, <b>replenishers</b> are used with hydrogen; a filament {{made from a}} hydrogen-absorbing metal (e.g. zirconium or titanium) {{is present in the}} tube, and by controlling its temperature the ratio of absorbed and desorbed hydrogen is adjusted, resulting in controlling of the hydrogen pressure in the tube. The metal filament acts as a hydrogen storage. This approach is used in e.g. hydrogen thyratrons or neutron tubes. Usage of saturated mercury vapor allows using a pool of liquid mercury as a large storage of material; the atoms lost by clean-up are automatically replenished by evaporation of more mercury. The pressure in the tube is however strongly dependent on the mercury temperature, which has to be controlled carefully.|$|R
5000|$|Van Helsing {{is able to}} pick up various weapons, some {{similar to}} the ones in the movie to {{complete}} the quest. Each weapon, except the elephant gun, has its own ammunition upgrades similar to Capcom's Devil May Cry series in gameplay. An ammo bar indicates how much of the upgraded ammo can be used. Regular ammo is unlimited and use of regular ammo increases the amount of upgraded ammo length. Van Helsing can collect up to three life <b>replenishers,</b> three ammo <b>replenishers</b> and three speed boosts. After every five kills, Van Helsing is able to perform a [...] "finishing move" [...] which will kill the sixth enemy with one hit. Special enemies such as any of the brides, Velkan the werewolf, Dracula or Igor have no response to a finishing move. The list of enemies that Van Helsing encounters during the length of the game include skeletons, flying skulls, small werewolves, skeletons armed with swords, bats, Dracula's children, stone statues, gargoyles, Giant Black Owls, Rusalkas, Dwergi, etc. along with the main enemies.|$|R
50|$|Gas can be {{efficiently}} {{stored in}} a <b>replenisher,</b> an electrically heated coil of zirconium wire. Its temperature determines the rate of absorption/desorption of hydrogen by the metal, which regulates the pressure in the enclosure.|$|E
5000|$|Potassium {{chloride}} {{is used in}} {{the treatment}} of hypokalemia as an electrolyte <b>replenisher.</b> With a molecular weight of approximately 75 and a valence of 1, the use of KCl for electrolytes makes 75 mg the equivalent of 1 mEq.|$|E
50|$|Schuylkill {{continued}} her {{service to the}} nation by her participation in the Arctic resupply operations in 1957. The <b>replenisher</b> oiler also served off Vietnam, and along both coasts of the United States. In 1974, Schuylkill was anchored at Savannah, Georgia, continuing her support of Naval forces worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The current fleet {{consists}} of 2 Portuguese João Belo class frigates, 1 French Commandant Rivière class frigate (in reserve), 1 German Lüneburg class auxiliary oil <b>replenisher,</b> 3 Vigilante class patrol boats, 2 Castrates class patrol boats, 3 East German Kondor II class minesweepers, and other smaller craft.|$|E
50|$|Qualea dichotoma is used {{prominently}} as decoration in Brazil, {{as either}} a garden element or {{as a part of}} landscaping. It is also used as a <b>replenisher</b> for low-nutrient soils.

5000|$|The Fort Victoria or Fort II {{class is}} {{a class of}} {{replenishment}} oiler of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, a role that combines the missions of a tanker and stores supply ship. As such they are designated auxiliary oiler <b>replenisher</b> (AOR). They are tasked with providing ammunition, fuel, food and other supplies to Royal Navy vessels around the world. There are two ships in the class, [...] and , the latter being taken out of service and despatched for scrapping at a Turkish breakers {{as a consequence of}} budgetary cutbacks across the Royal Navy.|$|E
50|$|Schuylkill was {{decommissioned}} on 14 February 1946 {{and turned}} over to the Maritime Commission on 27 April. Reacquired by the Navy on 30 January 1948 and assigned to the Military Sea Transport Service on 1 October 1949, the <b>replenisher</b> oiler served in waters ranging from the northern Pacific to the Persian Gulf, and from Baltimore to Bremerhaven. She saw active service in the western Pacific during the Korean War, making several voyages to Pusan. After hostilities ended, Schuylkill remained in the Pacific except for transiting the Panama Canal in June 1955 for service in the Gulf of Mexico until 22 October. She then departed for San Diego.|$|E

50|$|In preparation, {{which she}} started January 1, 2015, Pizzi ran 70-100 {{miles a week}} before her {{daughter}} woke up, then did further training at nighttime, including yoga and cross-training that totaled 30 hours a week. She also continued {{to work at the}} ice cream parlor and day care. By the time of competition, she got more sleep on the plane flights during the challenge (seven hours per night), than during her preparation (five hours). Her race preparation received national and international coverage. The entry fee was $36,000. Pizzi had to ask for additional time in order to find sponsors to help cover the cost. Ultima <b>Replenisher,</b> a maker of electrolyte-replacement drinks, Dr. Cool ice wraps, and Lyon-Waugh Auto group, a local car dealership, together covered 75% of the cost. The first two also provided their products to help her run. A Belmont bank hosted an autograph signing session for her departure, donated money in her name to the Belmont Food Pantry, and followed her progress via its website.|$|E
50|$|Quad Puzzle: The {{players were}} split into 3 groups: a {{timekeeper}} (Brooke), two flag retrievers (Hal and Michael), {{and a time}} <b>replenisher</b> (Mal). The flag retrievers job was to cross a ravine using 2 boards and the stools on the ravine {{to make it to}} the flags. They must also make it back to the other side in time. The timekeeper was to watch the timer, which was a liquid dispenser filled with blue-dyed water. If the water ceased to flow, the assignment was over. The time replenisher's job was to ride a quad bike through the forest until he reached some jugs. The jugs varied in amounts of water, and only one jug was allowed to be brought back per trip. If the flag retrievers made it to the other side before time is up, the players would win $10,000. Despite the fact that Mal brought back the smallest jugs he could have taken, Hal and Michael narrowly made it to the flags and back in time, winning the money.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The food, training, {{and health}} are crucial {{for a good}} {{performance}} in sports. Intense physical activity takes the athlete to maintain a very unstable balance between energy demand and consumption of nutrients. Spirulina microalga has a nutritional profile that renders it an ideal food supplement, because has high protein content, also contains vitamins, minerals, and pigments. In this context, the study aimed to develop, characterize and evaluate the stability of foods enhanced with Spirulina, which are intended for athletes. In this study, six different supplements were developed (electrolyte <b>replenisher,</b> muscle enhancer, and recovery supplement), without and with Spirulina. The electrolyte <b>replenisher</b> with Spirulina compared to the product without the microalga, showed an increase of 0. 35 % (w/w) in mineral content. The carbohydrates content of the developed recovery supplement with Spirulina was 2 % (w/w) higher than the muscle enhancer without Spirulina. It was not observed increased in the nutritional content of muscle recovery when added Spirulina. However, {{it is known that}} Spirulina presents active compounds with important functions for the body. Thus, the composition of the foods satisfied the nutritional needs of athletes. Regarding the stability of developed foods, the shelf life was estimated between 9 and 11 months...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Exposures to {{high doses}} of irradiation, to chemotherapy, benzene, {{petroleum}} products, paints, embalming fluids, ethylene oxide, herbicides, pesticides, and smoking {{have been associated with}} an increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Although there in no epidemiological evidence of relation between X-ray developer, fixer and <b>replenisher</b> liquids and AML, these included glutaraldehyde which has weakly associated with lymphocytic leukemia in rats and hydroquinone has been increasingly implicated in producing leukemia, causing DNA and chromosomal damage, inhibits topo-isomerase II, alter hematopoiesis and inhibit apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Case presentation Two white females (A and B) hired in 1985 as medical radiation technologists in a primary care center, in Greece. In July 2001, woman A, 38 -years-old, was diagnosed as having acute monocytic leukaemia (FAB M 5). The patient did not respond to therapy and died threeweeks later. In August 2001, woman B, 35 -year-old, was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB M 3). Since discharge, she is in continuous complete remission. Both women were non smokers without any medical history. Shortly after these incidents official inspectors and experts inspected workplace, examined equipment, archives of repairs, notes, interviewed and monitored employees. They concluded that shielding was inadequate for balcony's door but personal monitoring did not show any exceeding of TLV of 20 mSv yearly and cytogenetics analysis did not reveal findings considered to be characteristics of ionizing exposure. Equipment for developing photos had a long list of repairs, mainly leakages of liquids and increases of temperature. On several occasions the floor has been flooded especially during 1987 – 1993 and 1997 – 2001. Inspection confirmed a complete lack of ventilation and many spoiled medical x-ray films. Employees reported that an "osmic" level was continuously evident and frequently developed symptoms of respiratory irritation and dizziness. Conclusion The findings support the hypothesis that the specific AML cases might have originated from exposure to chemicals, especially hydroquinone and/or glutaraldehyde. The report also emphasises the crucial role of inspection of facilities and enforcement of compliance with regulations in order to prevent similar incidents. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and the safety}} of azathioprine (AZA) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) by localized application into HepG 2 tumor in vivo. METHODS: Different hepatoma and colon carcinoma cell lines (HepG 2, HuH 7, Chang liver, LoVo, RKO, SW- 48, SW- 480) were grown in minimal essencial medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % antibiotic/antimycotic solution and maintained in a humidified 37 &#x 2005; 0;C incubator with 5 % CO 2. These cells were pretreated with BSO for 24 h and then with AZA for different times. We examined the effects of this combination on some proteins and on cellular death. We also studied the efficacy {{and the safety of}} AZA (6 mg/kg per day) and BSO (90 mg/kg per day) in HepG 2 tumor growth in vivo using athymic mice. We measured safety by serological markers such as aminotransferases and creatine kinase. RESULTS: The in vitro studies revealed a new mechanism of action for the AZA plus BSO combination in the cancer cells compared with other thiopurines (6 -mercaptopurine, 6 -methylmercaptopurine, 6 -thioguanine and 6 -methylthioguanine) in combination with BSO. The cytotoxic effect of AZA plus BSO in HepG 2 cells resulted from necroptosis induction in a mitochondrial-dependent manner. From kinetic studies we suggest that glutathione (GSH) depletion stimulates c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and Bax translocation in HepG 2 cells with subsequent deregulation of mitochondria (cytochrome c release, loss of membrane potential), and proteolysis activation leading to loss of membrane integrity, release of lactate dehydrogenase and DNA degradation. Some of this biochemical and cellular changes could be reversed by N-acetylcysteine (a GSH <b>replenisher).</b> In vivo studies showed that HepG 2 tumor growth was inhibited when AZA was combined with BSO. CONCLUSION: Our studies suggest that a combination of AZA plus BSO could be useful for localized treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma as in the currently used transarterial chemoembolization method...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{space shuttle}} design was {{comprised}} of four components: the external tank, two solid rocket boosters (SRB), and the orbiter vehicle. Six orbiters were used during {{the life of the}} program. In order of introduction into the fleet, they were: Enterprise (a test vehicle), Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour. The space shuttle had the unique ability to launch into orbit, perform on-orbit tasks, return to earth and land on a runway. It was an orbiting laboratory, International Space Station crew delivery and supply <b>replenisher,</b> satellite launcher and payload delivery vehicle, all in one. Except for the external tank, all components of the space shuttle were designed to be reusable for many flights. ATK s reusable solid rocket motors (RSRM) were designed to be flown, recovered, and the metal components reused 20 times. Following each space shuttle launch, the SRBs would parachute into the ocean and be recovered by the Liberty Star and Freedom Star recovery ships. The recovered boosters would then be received at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Hangar AF facility for disassembly and engineering post-flight evaluation. At Hangar AF, the RSRM field joints were demated and the segments prepared to be returned to Utah by railcar. The segments were then shipped to ATK s facilities in Clearfield for additional evaluation prior to washout, disassembly and refurbishment. Later the refurbished metal components would be transported to ATK s Promontory facilities to begin a new cycle. ATK s RSRMs were manufactured in Promontory, Utah. During the Space Shuttle Program, ATK supported NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center whose responsibility was for all propulsion elements on the program, including the main engines and solid rocket motors. On launch day for the space shuttle, ATK s Launch Site Operations employees at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) provided lead engineering support for ground operations and NASA s chief engineer. It was ATK s responsibility to have a representative in Firing Room 2 at KSC in case of potential motor problems. However, the last time ATK was responsible for a space shuttle launch slip was 1989. During launch, engineers were also stationed in Promontory on teleconference with counterparts at KSC in the event their support was required...|$|E
