If {{this is the}} case, the person can submit an {{application}} for naturalisation {{after three years of}} marriage or registered partnership and cohabitation. If the person has cohabited in the Netherlands with a Dutch man or woman (both partners unmarried) for an uninterrupted period of three years, an application may also be submitted. Note: this is true in respect to marriage, partnership or cohabitation if and only if {{in the last three years}} the applicant has continually lived together with the partner inside the Netherlands. In case of marriage, it does not matter where this happened (i.e., inside or outside Dutch territories are both acceptable for married couples). As a rule of thumb, for each passed year, more than six months per year must have been spent under the same roof with that partner. There is an extra clause, namely that the couple has to remain living under the same roof for as long as the request for naturalization is being researched.|$|E

50|$|On 2 July 2009, the Constitutional Court {{found that}} it was unconstitutional to prevent <b>registered</b> <b>partners</b> from inheriting each other's property. It held that {{treating}} <b>registered</b> <b>partners</b> differently from married partners constituted {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation, breaching Article 14 of the Slovenian Constitution. It gave Parliament six months to remedy the situation. In response, the Minister of the Interior, Katarina Kresal (LDS), announced the Government would prepare a new law, which would legalise same-sex marriage. This sparked a considerable controversy in the public.|$|R

40|$|Social {{rights of}} married couples and <b>registered</b> <b>partners</b> in Czech {{republic}} and in France Summary The {{purpose of the}} present thesis is to compare social rights of married couples and <b>registered</b> <b>partners</b> in each country {{in order to be able}} to compare French and Czech legal regulations. At first it was necessary to analyze forms of family living in both states so that one can gain insight into the legal status of such couples in society. Another question raised by the present study is the access of couples to parental rights. According to the impact that parenthood has on working life and family budget, it can truly be considered a social welfare issue. Firstly we analyze, in separate chapters, individual areas of social welfare law in Czech republic and in France so that we can later compare the two. The thesis centers on survivors' benefits, through an evaluation of their purpose and of the impact of exclusion of <b>registered</b> <b>partners</b> from the group of beneficiaries. The study also examines relevant contemporary jurisprudence, mainly cases before the European Court of Human Rights and European Court of Justice...|$|R

50|$|Some U.S. cities, {{including}} New York, San Francisco, and Toledo, offer {{domestic partnership}} registries.

The court's decision mandated equal rights for same-sex registered couples not just in regard to pension benefits, but in regard to all rights and responsibilities currently applying to married couples.|$|E

50|$|Currently {{some types}} of {{adoption}} by same-sex couples are legal in 22 of the 56 countries and in 6 of the 6 dependent territories in Europe. Full joint adoption by same-sex couples is legal in seventeen European countries, namely Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany (not yet in effect), Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Another four, namely, Estonia, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland permit step-child adoption in which the <b>registered</b> <b>partner</b> can adopt the biological and, in some cases, the adopted child {{of his or her}} partner. In Croatia, a life partner may become a partner-guardian over their partner's child, which is to a great extent comparable to step-child adoption. As for the dependent territories, joint adoption by same-sex couples is legal in Gibraltar, Falkland Islands, Bermuda, Pitcairn Islands, Guernsey, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Several countries are currently considering permitting full joint or step-child adoption by same-sex couples.|$|E

40|$|This article criticises the new Dutch {{provisions}} (in force since 1 April 2014) {{that make}} it possible for a woman to become the second mother of the child of her female partner without having to go through an adoption procedure. The author argues {{that it would have been}} better - and possible - to make no distinction at all between a child born to a woman with a female partner and a child born to a woman with a male partner. He proposes a new provision for the Civil Code that would be both gender neutral and orientation neutral. The married or <b>registered</b> <b>partner</b> of the birth mother should automatically become the second legal parent of the child, unless another person - with permission of both partners - will have formally acknowledged the child before its birth.

25|$|Prior to the {{legalisation}} {{of same-sex}} marriage, Germany {{was one of}} the first countries to legislate registered partnerships (Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) for same-sex couples, which provided most though not all the rights of marriage. The law came into effect on 1 August 2001, and the act was progressively amended on subsequent occasions to reflect court rulings expanding the rights of <b>registered</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|R
40|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 15 th anniversary of the first legislation in the world that opened up marriage to same-sex couples (in the Netherlands, 1 April 2001) the author investigates if {{it would be possible to}} make marriage law, and in particular filiation law, completely orientation-neutral. He bases his analysis in the travaux préparatoires of the wording of the right to marry in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in other human rights documents. The demonstrates that the words “men and women” in the Universal Declaration have never been intended to exclude same-sex couples from marriage. On the contrary, those words were used to emphasize the gender-neutral character of the right to marry. Nevertheless, as regards parenting even Dutch law still makes a distinction between women and men – and thereby between heterosexual and lesbian marriages (especially when the child is conceived with semen from a known donor). The author analyses how these last distinctions can be eliminated (also with respect to surnames, and also in the interest transgenders and intersex people). He concludes that this is possible by merging the Civil Code articles on legal motherhood and legal fatherhood. The new rule could simply start with “Parent is the person who…”. And among other things it could provide that “parent” is the person who at the time of birth of a child is the married or <b>registered</b> <b>partner</b> of the person who gives birth, unless another person, with the consent of both partners, has acknowledged the child before it is born. Thereby the law would no longer distinguish between children conceived with or without a sperm donor, between children conceived with a known or unknown donor, or between children born to a lesbian or heterosexual couple. And so (Dutch) marriage law would become completely gender-neutral and orientation-neutral...|$|E
30|$|In addition, ‘refugees’[*], ‘asylum seekers’[*], ‘status holders’ and ‘people with a citizenship’ {{are often}} used concepts. A refugee {{is a person who}} has entered the Netherlands and of whom, based on the 1951 Geneva Convention, it has been {{established}} that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution in the country of origin because of a religious or political conviction, nationality, race or membership of a particular social group. An asylum seeker is a person who has entered the Netherlands, has applied for refugee status and is awaiting the decision of Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) (Nicolaas & Sprangers, 2012). Asylum seekers can sign up for an asylum application in assigned registration centres, such as Ter Apel and Schiphol. The Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA) is responsible for the registration of asylum seekers in the refugee centres. 3 If they are recognized as refugees, they will get a refugee status. Asylum seekers who do not qualify for the refugee status may nevertheless qualify for a residence permit. This may happen, for example, if there are serious grounds for believing that rejected asylum seekers, would face a risk upon returning to their country of origin. Status holders are formally recognised asylum seekers whose request has been granted and who received a (temporary) residence permit. Citizenship, acquired by birth or naturalization, is a legal bond between a person and the State. Immigrants who wish to naturalize, and become a person with a citizenship, should pass the language and integration requirement by successfully completing a formalized naturalization test (introduced in 2003), and should meet other conditions, such as not having a criminal record. In principle, dual citizenship is not allowed in the Netherlands, although there are many exceptions to the renunciation requirement, including being the <b>registered</b> <b>partner</b> of a Dutch national, or when renunciation of the original nationality is not legally possible or cannot be reasonably demanded.|$|E
