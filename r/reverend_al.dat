5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E
5|$|As {{de facto}} racial {{segregation}} increased, so did tensions between {{residents of the}} northeast {{and members of the}} predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and {{had been shot in the}} back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back, and that he was carrying a gun. A police officer testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell's jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.|$|E
25|$|Finally Lieberman {{withdrew from}} the race without winning a single contest. In total popular vote he placed 7th behind the {{eventual}} nominee, Massachusetts senator John Kerry; the eventual Vice Presidential nominee, North Carolina Senator John Edwards; former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean; Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich; retired General Wesley Clark; and <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, the Senate {{unanimously}} {{passed the}} bill without amendment on July 20, 2006 by a 98–0 vote. However, {{in an unprecedented}} event for a bill that passed unanimously out of committee, Senators of only one political party, Republicans, signed onto the bill's Senate committee report, and the report was not filed until six days after the bill's passage. The Senate report differed in significant ways from the House report, and in their own statement, Senate Democrats objected to parts of the Senate report that they believed highlighted evidence that could jeopardize the bill's constitutionality. The day after the committee report was filed, President George W. Bush signed the bill in a morning ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on July 27, 2006, one year {{in advance of the}} 2007 expiration date. The audience at the signing ceremony included family members of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, the <b>reverends</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, and other civil rights leaders.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, Reena Walker {{went on to}} put out {{the call}} to various women and {{organized}} the group African Americans Against Violence that effectively stopped a parade that a group of <b>reverends</b> led by <b>Al</b> Sharpton were attempting to hold in Harlem for Mike Tyson. The group, including Eve and Kathe Sandler, Nsia Bandele and Indigo Washington, worked tirelessly and successfully stopped the parade from happening, bringing much needed attention to the struggle of black women and sexism and domestic violence. A supporter of Mike Tyson, social worker Bill Jones, exclaimed [...] "The man has paid his debt" [...] (in regards to Tyson's rape conviction), and joined a large group of other Tyson supporters in heckling the African Americans Against Violence group, accusing them of [...] "catering to white radical feminists." [...] The {{effort on the part of}} these women to build a larger and ongoing black grassroots women's movement was minimized by these hecklers.|$|R
25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E
25|$|Tawana Glenda Brawley (born 1972) is an African-American {{woman from}} Wappingers Falls, New York, who gained notoriety in 1987–88 for falsely accusing four white men of having raped her. The charges {{received}} widespread national attention {{because of her}} age (15), the persons accused (including police officers and a prosecuting attorney), and the state in which Brawley was found after the alleged rape. She {{was found in a}} trash bag, with racial slurs written on her body and covered in feces. Brawley's accusations were given widespread media attention in part from the involvement of her advisers, including the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton and attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason.|$|E
500|$|In late 2015, Emanuel's {{approval}} rating plunged to [...] "the low 20's" [...] {{in response to}} a series of scandals, most directly the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, the city's subsequent attempts to withhold a video of the shooting, and the lack of an investigation into the matter. In early December 2015 the federal Justice Department announced an investigation into the operations of the Chicago police department, a move which Emanuel initially opposed. At one point half of Chicagoans favored Emanuel's resignation, with highly critical evaluations of the mayor appearing in such sources as The New York Times and The New Yorker, and coming from such figures as the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton.|$|E
500|$|Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, John Mayer, Jennifer Hudson, Usher, Jermaine Jackson, and Shaheen Jafargholi {{performed}} at the event. Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson gave eulogies, while Queen Latifah read [...] "We Had Him", a poem written for the occasion by Maya Angelou. The <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway." [...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she told the crowd: [...] "Ever since I was born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father you could ever imagine ... I just wanted to say I love him ... so much." [...] Reverend Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer.|$|E

In a scene in the segment, several celebrities, including actor Mel Gibson and former Major League Baseball player Mark McGwire, can be seen waiting in line for the first rocket. They both guest starred as themselves in two earlier episodes from the season. Others in the line include businessman Bill Gates, director Ron Howard, former President Jimmy Carter, scientist Stephen Hawking, rock musician Paul McCartney, basketball player Michael Jordan and ice skater Michelle Kwan.

2500|$|By contrast, Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities (1987) {{portrays a}} wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx and having an altercation with locals. A {{substantial}} {{piece of the}} last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, The New York Times reported that [...] "the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments." [...] In the same article, the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton (whose fictional analogue in the novel is [...] "Reverend Bacon") asserts that [...] "twenty years later, the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe's wardrobe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Albert Leornes Greene (born April 13, 1946), often {{known as}} The <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Green, is an American singer, {{songwriter}} and record producer, {{best known for}} recording a series of soul hit singles in the early 1970s, including [...] "Take Me to the River", [...] "Tired of Being Alone", [...] "I'm Still in Love with You", [...] "Love and Happiness" [...] and his signature song, [...] "Let's Stay Together". Inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, Green was referred to on the museum's site as being [...] "one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music". He has also {{been referred to as}} [...] "The Last of the Great Soul Singers". Green was included in the Rolling Stone list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, ranking at No. 65.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, a {{controversy}} arose over comments Fox made {{during a meeting}} with Texas business people in which he said, [...] "There {{is no doubt that}} Mexicans, filled with dignity, willingness and ability to work, are doing jobs that not even blacks want to do there in the United States." [...] This angered African-Americans in the United States, prompting many black leaders to demand an apology from Fox. <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton requested a formal apology from Fox to the African-American community and called for an economic boycott of Mexican products until an apology was received. [...] Sharpton, along with many African-Americans felt that Fox's comments were insensitive and racist. Reverend Jesse Jackson, during a news conference concerning Fox's statement about African-Americans, said that he felt that the comments were, [...] "unwitting, unnecessary and inappropriate," [...] and added that [...] " [...] statement had the impact of being inciting and divisive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008, Davis's lawyers filed a {{petition}} for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking {{review of the}} Georgia Supreme Court decision and arguing that the Eighth Amendment creates a substantive right of the innocent not to be executed. However, an execution date was scheduled for September 23, 2008, before the United States Supreme Court decided whether to take up Davis's case. The Georgia Supreme Court refused to grant a stay of execution and the Board of Pardons and Paroles denied clemency. [...] Amnesty International condemned the decision to deny clemency, and former President (and Georgia Governor) Jimmy Carter released a public letter in which he stated [...] "Executing Troy Davis without a real examination of potentially exonerating evidence risks taking {{the life of an}} innocent man and would be a grave miscarriage of justice." [...] <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton also called for clemency after he met and prayed with Davis on death row. A stay of execution was also supported by the NAACP; the president of the Georgia state conference said [...] "This is a modern-day lynching if it's allowed to go forward." [...] Former Republican Congressman and Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr wrote that he is [...] "a strong believer in the death penalty as an appropriate and just punishment," [...] but that the proper level of fairness and accuracy required for the ultimate punishment has not been met in Davis's case.|$|E
2500|$|The Boondocks {{has been}} a {{frequent}} subject of controversy since its comic-strip debut in 1999, with ABC News noting, [...] "Fans and critics of The Boondocks loved and hated the strip for the same reasons: its cutting-edge humor and unapologetic, sometimes unpopular, views on various issues, including race, politics, {{the war on terrorism}} and the September 11 attacks." [...] Numerous outlets predicted the show would encounter controversy prior to its November 2005 debut, due to its casual use of the word [...] "nigger". According to an article in The Washington Post, references to Rosa Parks were removed from one of the series' first completed episodes within a week of her death. In 2006, the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> Sharpton protested the first-season episode [...] "Return of the King," [...] for Martin Luther King, Jr.'s character's use of the word [...] "nigga," [...] saying [...] "Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures." [...] Cartoon Network released a statement in response defending McGruder: [...] "We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought-provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for, and why even today, it is important {{for all of us to}} remember that and to continue to take action," [...] the statement said. The episode was later awarded a Peabody Award for being [...] "an especially daring episode".|$|E
