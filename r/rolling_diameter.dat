No. 77 RW, were fitted with Dunlop Racing Tyres on test, {{which had a}} larger <b>rolling</b> <b>diameter</b> and lower drag co-efficient. This goes some way to explaining the 150 mi/h km/h maximum speeds that were obtained under ideal test conditions. The maximum safe rev limit for standard 6-cylinder 3.8-litre E-type engines is 5,500 rpm. The later 4.2-Litre units had a red marking on the rev counter from just 5,000 rpm. Both test cars must have reached or exceeded 6,000 rpm in top gear when on road test in 1961.|$|E

Tire size went to 165/14 from 155/15 and wheel size to 5 1/2J x 14 instead of 5J x 15, giving a wider section and slightly smaller <b>rolling</b> <b>diameter.</b> The suspension geometry was also revised, and an anti-roll bar was fitted {{to the rear}} suspension. ATE disc brakes were fitted from the outset, but with bigger front discs and calipers than the ones fitted to GT 1300 Juniors and late Giulia Sprint GT Veloces. The changes resulted in significant improvements to the handling and braking, which once again {{made it easier for}} the driver to maintain high average speeds for fast touring.|$|E

By doing so, the air spring can actively apply pressure and tension forces. The actuator is designed for small movements at high forces. It is insensitive to side forces, which are introduced by the bellows rolling on the rolling piston of the air spring. A diaphragm sealing is used to minimize friction. Hence a precise adjustment of small displacements at high dynamics is possible and the system is completely leakage-free.

Changes in anatomical structure and levels of endogenous phytohormones were investigated under drought stress during leaf rolling in Ctenanthe setosa. Leaf water potential (Ψleaf), some anatomical parameters, and the levels of phytohormones were determined at different visual levels of leaf rolling from 1 to 4. Ψleaf, thickness of mesophyll and lamina, and width/length ratio of hypodermis cells of leaves decreased while leaf <b>rolling</b> level increased. <b>Diameters</b> of xylem vessels and median vein, and length of upper and lower stomatal guard cells also decreased during leaf rolling. The amount of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) increased up to the 3 rd level of leaf rolling but it declined to the value of the 1 st level at the 4 th level of rolling. The gibberellic acid (GA 3) level changed irregularly during leaf rolling. Trans-zeatin and abscisic acid (ABA) amounts also increased during the rolling period.

40|$|Abstract—Deep {{cold rolling}} (DCR) {{is a cold}} working process, which easily {{produces}} a smooth and work-hardened surface by plastic deformation of surface irregularities. In the present study, the influence of main deep cold rolling process parameters on the surface roughness and the hardness of AISI 4140 steel were studied by using fractional factorial design of experiments. The assessment of the surface integrity aspects on work material was done, in terms of identifying the predominant factor amongst the selected parameters, their order of significance and setting the levels of the factors for minimizing surface roughness and/or maximizing surface hardness. It {{was found that the}} ball <b>diameter,</b> <b>rolling</b> force, initial surface roughness and number of tool passes are the most pronounced parameters, which have great effects on the work piece’s surface during the deep cold rolling process.

40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{significance of}} avian egg shape is poorly understood, {{and has been}} studied only in those species producing pyriform (pear-shaped, or pointed) eggs: waders and guillemots (murres) Uria spp., albeit to a limited extent. In the latter, {{it is widely believed}} that the pyriform shape has evolved to minimise their likelihood of rolling off a cliff ledge: the idea being that the more pointed the egg, the narrower the arc in which it rolls, and the less likely it is it will fall from a cliff ledge. Previous research also claimed that the <b>rolling</b> trajectory—the <b>diameter</b> of the arc they describe—of Common Guillemot U. aalge eggs is influenced not only by its shape but also by its mass, with heavier (i. e. larger) eggs describing a wider arc than lighter eggs. The finding that both shape and mass determined the rolling trajectory of Common Guillemot eggs (the shape–mass hypothesis) was used to explain the apparent anomaly that Bru¨nnich’s Guillemot U. lomvia produce eggs that are less pointed, yet breed on narrower ledges than Common Guillemots. They are able to do this, it was suggested, because Bru¨nnich’s Guillemot eggs are smaller and lighter in mass than those of Common Guillemots. However, since some populations of Bru¨nnich’s Guillemots produce eggs that are as large or larger than those of some Common Guillemot populations, the shape–mass hypothesis predicts that that (1) larger (i. e. heavier) eggs of both guillemot species will be more pyriform (pointed) in shape, and (2) that eggs of the two species of same mass should be similarly pointed. We tested these predictions and found: (1) only a weak, positive association between egg volume and pointedness in both guillemot species (...|$|R
40|$|In {{last ten}} years, {{the size range}} of {{dimensions}} program has increased and therefore the hot rolling process needs to be analysed and improved. The bar mill at Ovako Sweden AB in Hofors intends to increase the current roll diameter to improve the rolling capacity and to remove the existing bottleneck within the production flow. Therefore, this project is carried out to study the hot working of ingots within the current rolling setup, aiming to evaluate the subsequent change on ingot central deformation and porosity related to roller dimension. In this project, two plant trials are executed at Ovako Sweden AB and after the trials; analyses on ingot central deformation and central porosity are performed respectively with samples from the two trials. The results suggest that, after the first <b>rolling</b> stage, larger <b>diameter</b> rolls results in less pore defects but gives similar central deformation. Indicated from the results, the ingot {{is likely to have}} less central porosity but equal central deformation by increasing the roll diameter.

40|$|Feature Assisted Single Point Incremental Forming (FSPIF) is a {{technique}} to increase {{the accuracy of the}} SPIF process. FSPIF generates an optimized toolpath based on the features detected in the workpiece geometry and using knowledge of the behavior of these features during incremental forming. Using this optimized toolpath, parts can be formed with higher accuracy. The prediction of the dimensional deviations occurring in different features during forming as a function of their type (e. g. planar, ruled, freeform or ribs) and various process parameters, such as sheet thickness, wall angle, tool <b>diameter,</b> <b>rolling</b> direction, etc., is an important step in the FSPIF method. Due to the great number of parameters and combinations that are possible, a mathematical tool should be used in order to automate the prediction process. One such tool is MARS or Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, a fast, non-parametric multivariate regression technique with automatic variable selection, which generates continuous surfaces as a response function. In this paper, the authors describe and validate the use of MARS as a tool to predict deviations in uncompensated tests by training the MARS model using {{only a limited number of}} experiments. Using this validated model, compensation strategies are developed and implemented, which have shown significant improvements in accuracy in new test cases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the present}} study, {{response}} surface methodology {{has been used}} to optimize turn-assisted deep cold rolling process of AISI 4140 steel. A regression model is developed to predict surface hardness and surface roughness using response surface methodology and central composite design. In the development of predictive model, deep cold <b>rolling</b> force, ball <b>diameter,</b> initial roughness of the workpiece, and number of tool passes are considered as model variables. The rolling force and the ball diameter are the significant factors on the surface hardness and ball diameter and numbers of tool passes are found to be significant for surface roughness. The predicted surface hardness and surface roughness values and the subsequent verification experiments under the optimal operating conditions confirmed the validity of the predicted model. The absolute average error between the experimental and predicted values at the optimal combination of parameter settings for surface hardness and surface roughness is calculated as 0. 16 % and 1. 58 % respectively. Using the optimal processing parameters, the surface hardness is improved from 225 to 306 HV, which resulted in an increase in the near surface hardness by about 36 % and the surface roughness is improved from 4. 84 µm to 0. 252 µm, which resulted in decrease in the surface roughness by about 95 %. The depth of compression is found to be more than 300 µm from the microstructure analysis and this is in correlation with the results obtained from the microhardness measurements. Taylor hobson talysurf tester, micro vickers hardness tester, optical microscopy and X-ray diffractometer are used to characterize the modified surface layer.

40|$|In {{the veneer}} cutting process, {{compression}} and restraint {{caused by a}} pressure bar play an important role, but few studies {{have dealt with the}} effects of them on the frictional coefficient on the tool rake-face. Therefor, the main purpose of this report is to obtain quantitative information on these aspects. In this study, the roller bars with various diameters (D) and various rolling types were prepared to vary the depth (rt) of restraint caused between the face of the roller bar and the tool rake-face, the acting area of reatraint, and the degree of adhesion caused between the face of the roller bar and the tight side of the veneer. Before cutting, the test specimens were preheated in water at about 95 ℃ for 4 hours. Ten-millimeter-thick veneer of white seraya were cut with five rolling types of the roller bars, and the horzontal (Fh(k)) and vertical (Fv(k)) components of the cutting force (R(K)) were measured. And the frictional (F) and normal (N) forces acting on the tool and the resultant force (R(k)) were calculated. Based on these measurements, the frictional coefficient (μ) on the rake face was calculated from Eq. (12), and its variation under various experimental conditions was clarified. The main results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) The values of F and N increase with increases in not only the depth (⊿rt) of infinitesimal change of restraint but also D (Figs. 16 and 17). (2) The value of μdecreases with increases in ⊿rt, but the decreasing tendency of μ varies under various conbinations of <b>rolling</b> types and <b>diameters</b> (D) of the roller bars (Fig. 18). (3) The value of μ is the largest when cutting with a RF-type roller bar, but is the smallest when cutting with a RR-type roller bar (Fig. 19).

40|$|With the {{findings}} of this study surface defect densification defects and shape devia-tions can be avoided. Furthermore, the time for development of the rolling process can be shortened. Through a process analysis, the relationship between process input and process output was determined. The test gear is representative for automotive applications as well as suitable for fur-ther fatigue tests. An analogy process with cylindrical tools and cylindrical roller blanks was developed. The cylindrical rollers reflect the material properties and the geometrical kinematic contact conditions on the pitch circle and generate results of the rolling forces and the compression. In addition, a simulation model was developed based on the finite element method. In the gear rolling simulation a material model, which describes both the deformation and the compaction of powder metallurgical material, was developed and implemented. The process input variables are the process parameters, the tool geometry and the rolling blank material. Process parameters that were investigated were the number of revolutions, the number of reverse points and the rolling speed. The mechanical characteristics of the powder metallurgical material were measured. The rolling forces increase with the infeed. The increase of the rolling force is com-posed of a linear and a degressive proportion. The linear increase is caused by the elastic deformation of the tool shafts, tools and rolling blank. The degressive in-crease results from work hardening and compaction. The maximum rolling force is reached at the maximum infeed of the rolling tools. The maximum rolling force is dependent on the infeed, the blank material, the process parameters and the contact geometry. Infeed has the greatest impact on the rolling force and is followed by the carbon content and density. The surface of rolled powder metallurgical gears has an average surface roughness of about RZ = 1. 0 – 1. 5 µm. In extreme cases, surface defects called overlaps occur in the tooth root area. The intensity of surface defects is influenced by the combination of the occuring stress in the rolling contact and the durability of the blank material. Due to the small contact radii in the tooth root area high stresses occur. The surface can be improved by increasing the carbon content. The density and the sintering temperature have only a small effect on the surface. In addition, the load and the number of rollings worsen the surface. Densification is a type of plastic deformation which is caused by hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure of the rolling contact causes a collapse of the pores and the powder metallurgical material compacts. The hydrostatic stress component is caused primarily by the normal force. The density distribution is neither in tooth face direction nor in profile direction homgeneous. In tooth face direction, the compression drops due to the missing axial support from the faces. In profile direction, the densifictaion rises up to a maximum compression in the field of <b>rolling</b> pitch <b>diameter.</b> Beginning from that maximum the compression drops in the direction of the tooth tip and tooth root. By adapting the stock for densification a uniform compression in profile direction can be achieved. In general, the compression can be improved by adjusting the rolling blank properties. Higher densities of the blank increase the densification depth. The radius of the contact showed a minor influence on the compression depth. The carbon content, which has an influence on the hardness of the material, does not affect the compression depth. During rolling reproducible profile errors typically occur. These errors are character-ized by an overmeasure on the tip and an overmeasure in the tooth root. Elastic deformations of the roll blank and incorrectly oriented material flow during compression are the cause for the profile deviations. For compensation of the deviations a method was developed. The deviations could be improved significantly by the correction of the tool. The reached profile quality was Q 7, the profile line deviation Q 3, and pitch deviations and roundness were in the range of Q 1...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{have emerged as}} {{biological}} signaling molecules, participating in newly discovered cascades that govern cell proliferation, migration, and pathogenesis. A major challenge in understanding these pathways {{is the lack of}} detection technologies that allow for spatial and temporal resolution of specific ROS at the cellular level. The goal of this thesis is to design a nanotube sensor platform able to detect and study H 2 0 2 signaling fluxes at the cellular level in order to elucidate their role in biological processes. Understanding this role may lead to new therapeutic targets, and improve understanding of biological signaling. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are rolled sheets of graphene and can be either semiconducting or metallic depending on the angle of <b>rolling</b> and the <b>diameter</b> of the tube. Semi-conducting SWNT are one of only a few types of molecules that exhibit band gap photoluminescence (PL) in the near infrared (nIR), making them ideal for detection in biologically relevant media since it avoids biological auto-fluorescence. SWNT are also completely photostable even at high fluence, unlike conventional fluorophores and quantum dot systems, allowing them to serve as nIR single molecule optical sensors capable of long term and stable operations in vitro and in vivo. In this thesis, we show that the 1 D quantum confinement of photogenerated excitons in SWNT can amplify the detection of molecular adsorption to where single-molecule discrimination is realizable, even from within living cells and tissues. (cont.) We have developed a type I collagen film, similar to those used as 3 D cell scaffolds for tissue engineering, containing embedded SWNT capable of reporting single-molecule adsorption of quenching molecules such as H₂ 0 ₂. A Hidden Markov Modeling algorithm is utilized to link single-molecule adsorption events detected on the nanotube to forward and reverse kinetic rate constants for many different analytes. The collagen matrix is shown to impart selectivity to H₂ 0 ₂ over other ROS and common interferents. We utilized these new single-molecule sensors to study the fluxes of H₂ 0 ₂ from A 431 human skin carcinoma cells and particularly the local generation rate from Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein and tyrosine kinase that controls cell proliferation among other functions. We show that an array of nIR fluorescent SWNT is capable of recording the discrete, stochastic quenching events that occur as H₂ 0 ₂ molecules are emitted from individual A 431 and murine 3 T 3 fibroblasts cells in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF). We also show mathematically that such single molecule detection arrays have the unique property of distinguishing between "near field" and "far field" molecular generation, allowing one to isolate the flux originating from only the membrane protein. Corresponding inhibition experiments suggest a mechanism whereby water oxidizes singlet oxygen at a catalytic site on the receptor itself, generating H₂ 0 ₂ in response to receptor binding. An EGFR-mediated H₂ 0 ₂ generation pathway that is consistent with all current and previous literature findings has been proposed {{for the first time and}} numerically tested for consistency. (cont.) In an effort to extend this detection to in vivo systems, we investigated how SWNT are uptaken and localized within living cells and as well as their potential cytotoxicity. To this end, we have developed a novel method of studying this problem by tracking the non-photobleaching SWNT in real time by using a single particle tracking method. Over 10, 000 individual trajectories of SWNT were tracked as they are incorporated into and expelled from NIH- 3 T 3 cells in real time on a perfusion microscope stage. An analysis of mean square displacement allows the complete construction of the mechanistic steps involved from single duration experiments. We observe the first conclusive evidence of SWNT exocytosis and show that the rate closely matches the endocytosis rate with negligible temporal offset, thus explains why SWNT are non-cytotoxic for various cell types at a concentration up to 5 mg/L, as observed from our live-dead assay experimental results. Further, we studied the cellular uptake and expulsion rates of length-fractionated SWNT from 130 to 660 nm in NIH- 3 T 3 cells using this method. We developed a quantitative model to correlate endocytosis rate with nanoparticle geometry that accurately describes our data set and also literature results for Au nanoparticles. The model asserts that nanoparticles cluster on the cell membrane to form a size sufficient to generate a large enough enthalpic contribution via receptor ligand interations to overcome the elastic energy and entropic barriers associated with vesicle formation. (cont.) The total uptake of both SWNT and Au nanoparticles is maximal at a common radius of 25 nm when scaled using an effective capture dimension for membrane diffusion. The ability to understand and predict the cellular uptake of nanoparticles quantitatively should find utility in designing nanosystems with controlled toxicity, efficacy and functionality. The development of such single molecule detection technologies for ROS motivates their application to many other unexplored signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo. by Hong Jin. Thesis (Ph. D.)
