5000|$|The P3P {{specification}} offers {{possibility for}} a server to state a privacy policy using an HTTP header, which specifies {{which kind of}} information it collects and for which purpose. These policies include (but are not limited to) the use of information gathered using cookies. According to the P3P specification, a browser can accept or <b>reject</b> <b>cookies</b> by comparing the privacy policy with the stored user preferences or ask the user, presenting them the privacy policy as declared by the server. However, the P3P specification was criticized by web developers for its complexity. Some websites do not correctly implement it. For example, Facebook jokingly used [...] "HONK" [...] as its P3P header for a period. Only Internet Explorer provides adequate support for the specification.|$|E

Since this plug-in is produced and distributed by Google itself, it has met much discussion and criticism. Furthermore, the realisation of Google scripts tracking user behaviours has spawned the production of multiple, often open-source, browser plug-ins to <b>reject</b> tracking <b>cookies.</b> These plug-ins offer the user a choice, whether to allow Google Analytics (for example) to track his/her activities. However, partially because of new European privacy laws, most modern browsers allow users to <b>reject</b> tracking <b>cookies,</b> though Flash cookies can be a separate problem again.|$|R
40|$|Two {{web browser}} {{extensions}} that prevent cookie notifications on websites {{have been developed}} within this thesis. The motivation for developing the extensions is the new European legislation that requires website administrators to equip their sites with visible notifications that cookies are used within the website. The user's preferences of accepting or <b>rejecting</b> website <b>cookies</b> can be recalled by the developed extensions. On any subsequent visit to a website last user's action about accepting website notices is automatically carried out. The process of developing extensions for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers, {{as well as a}} description of different development techniques and approaches are presented in the thesis. A demonstration of publishing both extensions in the official web browsers' web stores is also shown in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|Platform for Privacy Preferences (P 3 P) compact {{policies}} (CPs) are {{a collection}} of three-character and four-character tokens that summarize a website 2 ̆ 7 s privacy policy pertaining to cookies. User agents, including Microsoft 2 ̆ 7 s Internet Explorer (IE) web browser, use CPs to evaluate websites 2 ̆ 7 data collection practices and allow, <b>reject,</b> or modify <b>cookies</b> based on sites 2 ̆ 7 privacy practices. CPs can provide a technical means to enforce users 2 ̆ 7 privacy preferences if CPs accurately reflect websites 2 ̆ 7 practices. Through automated analysis we can identify CPs that are erroneous due to syntax errors or semantic conflicts. We collected CPs from 33, 139 websites and detected errors in 11, 176 of them, including 134 TRUSTe-certified websites and 21 of the top 100 most-visited sites. Our work identifies potentially misleading practices by web administrators, as well as common accidental mistakes. We found thousands of sites using identical invalid CPs that had been recommended as workarounds for IE cookie blocking. Other sites had CPs with typos in their tokens, or other errors. 98...|$|R
