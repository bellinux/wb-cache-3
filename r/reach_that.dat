5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level tropospheric trough {{persisted in}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{developing}} a circulation by October 26 which quickly organized. On October 27, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about 860miles (1380kilometers) south-southwest of the western Azores. Moving westward, the depression was forecast to attain winds of at least 60mph (95km/h), although it failed to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> intensity. Banding features developed over the storm, and on October 30 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By early on October 31, convection had begun to separate from the circulation, {{and later in the}} day Lorenzo became extratropical; shortly thereafter, its remnants merged with a frontal system about 690mi (1,110km) west of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} his father and two uncles in playing hockey at Clarkson University for the Golden Knights. He enrolled at Clarkson in 1990 and played four seasons for the school. During his junior season of 1992–93, Conroy scored two goals in a 5–3 victory over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) semi-final to help lead his team to the conference championship game. Conroy reached 100 career points with the goals, joining his father Mike as the only such pair in Clarkson's history to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> milestone. Conroy and the Golden Knights then won the ECAC title with a 3–1 victory over Brown University.|$|E

He played over 1,000 games in the NHL and was the second-oldest player in League history to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> milestone. Conroy, who enjoyed his greatest offensive seasons with the Flames, is a former captain of the team and was twice honored by the organization for his leadership, dedication and humanitarian efforts.|$|E

5|$|In the 1929 season, Pennock saw his {{pitching}} {{time and}} pitching quality diminish. Over {{the rest of}} his career, he never posted more than 189 innings pitched in a season and his ERA rose to over 4.00. He suffered from bouts of neuritis in 1929 and 1930. Pennock won his 200th career game during the 1929 season, becoming the third left-handed pitcher to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> mark. He led the AL in walks per nine innings pitched in 1930 (1.151) and 1931 (1.426). Pennock pitched four innings of relief against the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series, recording two saves.

5|$|On September 28, 1925, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Joseph B. Aviles, Sr. (1897–1990), {{born in a}} {{farm near}} the town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico when the island was still a Spanish colony, became the first Hispanic chief petty officer in the Coast Guard. During World War II he {{received}} a war-time promotion to chief warrant officer, becoming the first Hispanic to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> level as well. Aviles joined the United States Navy in 1915 and served seven years and eight months, eventually reaching the rank of Chief Gunner's Mate. During the years that he served in the Navy, the United States Congress passed the Jones–Shafroth Act (1917) which conferred United States citizenship on all citizens of Puerto Rico. On September 28, 1925, he entered the United States Coast Guard with the rate of chief gunners mate and served for two years before re-enlisting on September 11, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Phantasmagoria {{finished}} 1995 as {{the ninth}} best-selling {{game of the}} year according to an analysis by PC Data of sales by 42 retail chains. In January 1996, Phantasmagoria was the fourth-best seller among MS-DOS and Windows games, behind Microsoft Flight Simulator, Myst and Command & Conquer, and it was number six among all computer software. By February 10 it was number five among MS-DOS and Windows games, and by February 24 it was number 10. It received a boost in June 1996, possibly due to the pending release of its sequel , and jumped back up to seventh among best-selling computer software programs according to Computer Life magazine. One year after Phantasmagoria was released, it still remained in the best-seller charts, and more than 1 million copies were ultimately sold, making it Sierra's first game to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> milestone.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{planned to}} have the K-25 plant in full {{production}} by June or July 1945. Having taken two years to get the prototype stages working, the British experts regarded this as incredibly optimistic, and felt that, barring a miracle, it {{would be unlikely to}} <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> point before the end of 1946. This opinion offended their American counterparts and dampened the enthusiasm for cooperation, and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944. Armed with the British Mission's report, Chadwick and Oliphant were able to persuade Groves to reduce K-25's enrichment target; the output of K-25 would be enriched to weapons grade by being fed into the electromagnetic plant. Despite the British Mission's pessimistic forecasts, K-25 was producing enriched uranium in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian spell {{ended with}} San Lorenzo's first title, beating Nacional of Paraguay in the finals. But another trend was born, as {{once again a}} new {{champion}} was crowned, {{for the third consecutive}} year. San Lorenzo's victory was then followed by another Argentine club's victory, River Plate, winning its third title on 2015. But Atletico Nacional stopped this new trend, by beating Ecuador's Independiente del Valle on a 2-1 aggregate. The Colombian team won their second title after 27 years and one former failure attempt in 1995 against Grêmio, becoming the first pacific team to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> achievement {{in the history of the}} tournament.|$|E
5|$|The forces {{commanded}} by the 7th SS Division were organised into northern, {{central and southern}} columns. The northern column consisted of Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion and included a company of tanks. It moved swiftly southwest from its start point near Banja Luka, and had reached Čađavica (at a crossroads halfway between Mrkonjić Grad and Ključ) by the evening of 25 May, brushing off the 16th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division deployed on the right flank of its axis of advance. The rapid advance meant that the 13th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division was unable to organise an effective defence. The 39th Krajina Division then ordered the 13th Krajina Brigade to block the road from Čađavica to Ključ {{in order to prevent}} the loss of Ključ, but only one battalion of the brigade managed to <b>reach</b> <b>that</b> position by dawn on 26 May.|$|E
