40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} reasons why lending by <b>regional</b> or sub-regional <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> can and should play an important and valuable complementary role in the international development architecture. We look at the specific strengths of multilateral, <b>regional</b> and sub-regional <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> and drawing on the successful experience of the European Investment Bank and the Andean Development Corporation conclude that the time is now for creating new <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> and expanding existing ones. Creating new institutions or expanding existing ones will have very clear benefits, as for instance providing regional public goods which are currently undersupplied, such as regional infrastructure. Very large pools of savings and foreign exchange reserves originate in developing countries these days and therefore the potential for a significant expansion of <b>regional</b> or sub-regional <b>development</b> <b>banks,</b> with only or mainly developing country members has grown significantly.

5000|$|Some {{voices in}} the administration, however, {{continued}} to point in the opposite direction: for example Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr. and the new ICA head, John Hollister, who represented more frugal attitudes. Given the lack of consensus, Pres. Eisenhower and Congress conducted in 1956 {{a number of studies}} to give foreign aid policy a more solid basis. Mainly delivered in early 1957, the reports included an updated version of the essay by Millikan & Rostow that C.D. Jackson had circulated in 1954. The overall view that emerged was that sustained development assistance would have long-term benefits for the U.S. position in the world and, more specifically, that developing countries needed substantial financial assistance in the form of low-interest loans. Developing countries particularly needed softer financing to invest in public health systems, schools, and economic infrastructure, for which [...] "hard," [...] commercial lending was unsuitable. Personnel changes soon reflected this change in the administration’s view: Christian Herter succeeded Herbert Hoover Jr. as Under Secretary of State in February 1957, Robert Anderson succeeded George Humphrey as Treasury Secretary in July 1957, and James H. Smith Jr. replaced John Hollister as ICA Director in September 1957. Pres. Eisenhower summarized the conclusions in his May 21, 1957 message to Congress: [...] "This past year ... Congressional Committees, the Executive Branch and distinguished private citizens have just examined these programs anew. ... I recommend the following legislative actions: ... economic development assistance should be provided primarily through loans, on a continuing basis, and related closely to technical assistance. ... I recommend a clear separation of military and defense support assistance on the one hand, from economic development assistance on the other. ... I recommend that longterm sic development assistance be provided from a Development Loan Fund. ... Such loans should not compete with or replace such existing sources of credit as private investors, the International Bank World Bank, or the Export-Import Bank. ... I believe the Fund should be established and administered in the International Cooperation Administration. ... The technical cooperation program {{is one of the most}} valuable elements of our entire mutual security effort. It also should be continued on a long-term basis and must be closely related to the work of the Fund." [...] As a result, the Development Loan Fund was established in August 1957. The DLF largely financed infrastructure (such as railroads, highways, and power plants), factories, and agriculture with loans whose terms were relatively [...] "soft" [...] in the sense of charging interest rates lower than commercial levels and being repayable in local currency rather than U.S. dollars. Some projects were financed by a combination of a DLF soft loan and a harder World Bank loan. Operationally, the DLF became administratively self-contained by 1959 after contracting for administrative support from ICA for its first two years. Also, the Export-Import Bank's lending limit was raised in 1958 from $5 billion to $7 billion, and the administration advocated in January 1959 an expanded [...] "food for peace" [...] program. In 1958, the administration's shift toward a more expansive policy on development assistance was joined by an increasing number of members of Congress. The President and Congress particularly shifted towards promoting multilateral development assistance, which the European countries and Japan had become able to co-finance thanks to their economic recoveries having reached the point by the late 1950s where they could resume convertibility of their currencies. The USG proposed doubling the World Bank's capitalization in 1958 and approved the final measure that raised it from $10 billion to $21 billion in September 1959. In addition, Senator Mike Monroney was instrumental in winning Congressional approval in July 1958 for a new soft-loan facility for the World Bank, the International Development Association (IDA). This had been recommended as early as 1949 and had been supported by the International Development Advisory Board established by President Truman in 1950 and chaired by Nelson Rockefeller, but it took years before it received Congressional backing. The IDA formally came into being in September 1960, with the U.S. contributing 42% of its initial resources. On the other hand, the U.S. did not support the proposal for a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED). The UN [...] "Special Fund" [...] that was created in 1957 was limited to developing projects for the UN's technical assistance program, EPTA, and could not finance public works. Assistance to developing countries took a different course in Latin America than in Asia, continuing through most of the 1950s to focus on technical assistance, with financial assistance sources being limited to the Eximbank and the World Bank. However, events in 1958 -- notably a riot during Vice President Nixon's visit to Caracas, Venezuela in May 1958 -- drew more USG attention back to the region. In August 1958, the USG reversed decades-long opposition to proposals for a <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> <b>bank,</b> and the Inter-American Development Bank was established by the Organization of American States in April 1959, with capital mostly contributed by the borrowing countries. To further engage other wealthy countries in global development assistance, the USG supported the creation of the Aid India Consortium in August 1958, the first of several informal groupings of donors. The USG also supported creation of the Development Assistance Group for the European Marshall Plan organization, the OEEC (Organization of European Economic Co-operation), in January 1960.|$|E
