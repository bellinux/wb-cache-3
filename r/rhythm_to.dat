25|$|Ujjayi {{breathing}} {{may be used}} continuously throughout Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, and {{is frequently}} used in Power Yoga and Vinyasa, or Flow Yoga. This breath enables the practitioner to maintain a <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> his or her practice, take in enough oxygen, and helps build energy to maintain practice, while clearing toxins out of the bodily system. This breath is especially important during transition {{into and out of}} asanas (postures), as it helps practitioners to stay present, self-aware and grounded in the practice, which lends it a meditative quality.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-table {{battle in}} Division Two, Yorkshire Phoenix went down despite an unbeaten 116 from England captain Michael Vaughan. Yorkshire were missing Ian Harvey for this game, and it showed, as no other batsman passed 30 and Vaughan was woefully alone {{in getting the}} target up. It was {{eventually}} set at 217 for Kent Spitfires, and as Matthew Walker found his <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> hit seven fours in an unbeaten 56, Kent got to that target with five wickets and four balls to spare, despite Vaughan's off-breaks yielding two wickets for 42 runs.|$|E

25|$|AF {{is often}} treated with {{medications}} {{to slow the}} heart rate to a near normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control).

Depending on the risk of stroke either aspirin or anti-clotting medications such as warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be recommended. While these medications reduce this risk, they increase rates of major bleeding.|$|E

25|$|La danse (Bacchante) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 73 x 54cm (28.75 by 21.25 in). The work represents a nude {{woman in a}} composition that contains {{a wide variety of}} exotic geometrized elements. Metzinger's bold use of color characteristic of his work between 1904 and 1907 is highly noticeable in Bacchante. His brushstrokes are practically all the same size but their directions and colors vary giving <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> the overall work. The depth of field is flattened; the foreground blending in with background components. The subject matter is classical—reminiscent of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (an artist Metzinger greatly admired)—yet its treatment is everything but classical.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} design the stair cores were moved {{near to the}} ends of the {{building}} to give views out on both the north and south façades. These, in conjunction with double-height galleries added to the top floor created a vertical <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> the façade. The number of recessed storeys was reduced to just one on the ground floor which gave the impression that the whole building was supported on the expressed columns. Verticality was further emphasised with the proportions of the windows which were slender and divided by precast concrete mullions. The stair towers have been compared with those of Charles Rennie Mackintosh at the western end of the Glasgow School of Art.|$|E
25|$|In their book, The Fourth Turning, however, Strauss and Howe {{say that}} the precise {{boundaries}} of generations and turnings are erratic. The generational rhythm is not like certain simple, inorganic cycles in physics or astronomy, where time and periodicity can be predicted to the second. Instead, it resembles the complex, organic cycles of biology, where basic intervals endure but precise timing is difficult to predict. Strauss and Howe compare the saecular <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> the four seasons, which they say similarly occur in the same order, but with slightly varying timing. Just as winter may come sooner or later, and {{be more or less}} severe in any given year, {{the same is true of}} a Fourth Turning in any given saeculum.|$|E

25|$|According to David Balan of Sequart Organization, webcomics with {{pages of}} limited size that use hyperlinks {{to move forward}} in the story {{consistently}} take the reader out of the experience, as there exists no visual link between any two pages. This issue is solved with a long, scrollable canvas, where the webcomic is presented as one long image. Such a webcomic may drag on, however, {{due to a lack}} of rhythm or punctuated story beats. Balan praised McCloud's 2003 webcomic The Right Number for its zooming interface, which would have the same benefits as other infinite canvas formats, but still allows for a certain <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> exist. Other artists known for making persistent use of the infinite canvas in the early 2000s include Cayetano Garza, demian5, Patrick Farley, Tristan A. Farnon and David Gaddis.|$|E
25|$|Music {{is central}} to a Kathakali performance. It sets the mood and {{triggers}} emotions resonant {{with the nature of}} the scene. It also sets the <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> which the actor-dancers perform the choreography and scenes. Some major musical patterns, according to Clifford and Betty, that go with the moods and content of the scene are: Cempata (most common and default that applies to a range of moods, in battles and fights between good and evil, also to conclude a scene); Campa music (depict tension, dispute, disagreement between lovers or competing ideas); Pancari (for odious, preparatory such as sharpening a sword); Triputa (thought provoking, scenes involving sages and teachers); Atanta (scenes involving kings or divine beings); Muri Atanta musical style (for comic, light hearted, or fast moving scenes involving heroic or anger-driven activity).|$|E
25|$|A Tribe Called Quest is an American hip hop group, {{formed in}} 1985. They have {{released}} six studio albums, five compilations, thirteen singles and five video albums. The group {{is made up}} of rapper/producer Q-Tip (Kamaal Ibn John Fareed, formerly Jonathan Davis), the late rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and DJ/producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad. Phife Dawg was only persuaded to join when a fourth member, rapper Jarobi White, joined the group. In 1989 they signed a demo deal with Geffen Records, but not given a full-fledged recording contract. After receiving many offers, they opted for the Jive Records label, an independent rap label. In under a year, they managed to produce People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of <b>Rhythm</b> <b>to</b> a lukewarm reception, reaching #91 on the Billboard 200, though it did achieve gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E

25|$|The next rower ('seven' in an eight) sits {{directly}} behind stroke and is typically both fit and skilled: this rower {{acts as a}} buffer between the stroke {{and the rest of}} the crew. They closely follow the rhythm set by the stroke and help transmit this <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> the rest of the boat, and particularly to the rowers rowing on the same side as seven, since rowers tend to look at the blades on their side of the boat to check their timing. If the strokeman increases or decreases the stroke rate it is essential that seven follows this change so that it is translated to the rest of the crew. Number seven usually watches the back of stroke so that they can time when to move up the slide and copy their rhythm. The job of seven is to emulate the rhythm of the strokeman.|$|E
25|$|It {{has already}} been {{discussed}} that qin music has a rhythm, {{and that it is}} only vaguely indicated in the tablature. Though there is an amount of guesswork involved, the tablature has clues to indicate rhythm, such as repeating motifs, indication of phrases or how the notation is arranged. Throughout the history of the qinpu, we see many attempts to indicate this rhythm more explicitly, involving devices like dots to make beats. Probably, one of the major projects to regulate the <b>rhythm</b> <b>to</b> a large scale was the compilers of the Qinxue Congshu tablature collection of the 1910s to 1930s. The construction of the written tablature was divided into two columns. The first was further divided into about three lines of a grid, each line indicating a varied combination of lyrics, gongche tablature, se tablature, pitch, and/or beats depending on the score used. The second column was devoted to qin tablature.|$|E
