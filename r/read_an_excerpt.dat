He {{described}} the story briefly in an appearance he {{made at the}} New York Public Library on April 19, 2013, and <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> from {{the first chapter of}} the book entitled “The Gone Haptics.” The story takes place in two eras, one about thirty years into the future and the other further in the future.

25|$|After {{producer}} Brian Grazer first <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> of Sylvia Nasar's book A Beautiful Mind in Vanity Fair magazine, {{he immediately}} purchased {{the rights to}} the film. He eventually brought the project to director Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many A-list directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was available only when Howard was also available. Grazer chose Howard.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was Randy Orton versus Rey Mysterio for Mysterio's world {{championship}} match at WrestleMania 22. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view three weeks before No Way Out. At the Royal Rumble, Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match and a world championship match at WrestleMania 22 by last eliminating Randy Orton. On the February 3 episode of SmackDown!, Orton claimed that there's {{no way he could}} beat him in a normal match and that he won the match because of some divine intervention. Orton then challenged Mysterio to a match at No Way Out for his title match at WrestleMania 22, and claimed that Eddie Guerrero was not in heaven, but in hell. Later that night, Orton along with Mark Henry defeated Mysterio and Kurt Angle. Midway through the match, Davari confronted Angle and was chased outside the ring and into the crowd. Henry followed, leaving Mysterio and Orton on their own. Orton gained the pinfall after sitting on Mysterio. After the match, Orton claimed that Mysterio had as much chance of defeating him as Guerrero did of coming back to life. Mysterio responded by accepting Orton's challenge on behalf of Guerrero. The next week on SmackDown!, Orton set the record straight about the comments he made about Eddie Guerrero. Backstage, he said that he only made the comments to get inside Mysterio's head, and {{that he did not know}} or care if Guerrero was in Hell. Orton later entered the arena in a lowrider to further explain his actions, and <b>read</b> <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> from Guerrero's book, Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story, but Mysterio attacked him, dropkicking his head into the steel ringpost. On the February 17 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio faced off against Sylvan, which Mysterio won after a West Coast Pop. After the match, Orton came out and said that Mysterio would never main event WrestleMania, he would never become World Champion and that he could never beat him.|$|E
