5000|$|By 1987, a new {{generation}} of country stars, such as Randy Travis, Ricky Van Shelton and Dwight Yoakam had emerged on the country music landscape. Consequently, some of the old guard were having a more difficult time remaining relevant on the charts, and this may help explain the modest showing of Jones's 47th studio album, which did not break the top ten on the Billboard albums chart and produced no hit singles. In a review upon its <b>release,</b> <b>Country</b> Music declared that Too Wild Too Long contained too many songs that relied on the myth of George Jones rather than the kind of songs that built the myth. Although none of the album's singles cracked the top 20, Jones's singing is characteristically stellar. Significant tracks include a cover of the Hank Williams song [...] "I'm A Long Gone Daddy" [...] and [...] "One Hell Of A Song". [...] "The U.S.A. Today", a rare foray for the singer into the political realm, points out America's virtues and faults. Jones also made his second music video for [...] "The Old Man No One Loves", a tearjerker that pulls on the same heartstrings as [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today".|$|E

"I Go to Pieces" [...] {{has twice}} {{appeared}} on the Billboard C&W chart, {{the first time in}} 1988 when Dean Dillon took the song to a number 39 peak, the track being a single off Dillon's Slick Nickel album. In 1990 an a cappella remake of [...] "I Go to Pieces" [...] by Southern Pacific reached number 31 C&W: the number had been a Southern Pacific concert staple since the band's 1984 inception before being recorded in the summer of 1989 for their January 1990 album <b>release</b> <b>Country</b> Line album with the track being issued as a single in February 1990 - the month of its composer Del Shannon's death - although it only gradually accrued support to reach the C&W Top 40 that May. Southern Pacific member Keith Knudsen would allege resistance to the band's version of [...] "I Go to Pieces" [...] from C&W radio: [...] "ten or so big C&W stations...wouldn't even test it. We heard directors say things like - 'Well, there's no music on it'...Or - 'Well, I liked it, but that's an old Pop song so we can't use it.' Meanwhile, on the stations that did play it, it was the most requested record that we ever had." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Back {{from the}} Dead" [...] and [...] "U Don't Know Me" [...] were {{released}} as singles. [...] "Back from the Dead" [...] was released {{as a single}} in 1992 before the album was released and was a minor hit on college radio. After disagreements between Kid Rock and his record label about whether to release [...] "Prodigal Son" [...] or [...] "U Don't Know Me" [...] as a single, the label won and released the latter. The label paid for the very low-budget music videos of [...] "U Don't Know Me" [...] and [...] "Back from the Dead", but due to poor promotion both videos received little to no airplay and performed badly. In 1993, [...] "Prodigal Son" [...] was a promotional single for the Fire It Up EP,as was My Oedipus Complex (Remix). The Back From The Dead single included a radio remix,extended version,instrumental and a cappella version. [...] "U Don't Know Me" [...] depending on the singles <b>release</b> <b>country</b> featured the remixes of radio mix,beyond the doors mix, beyond the doors mix edit, naked booty truth mix, cali boy mix, cali boy instrumental and alt funk mix.

[...] "Back From The Dead", [...] "3 Sheets To The Wind", [...] "Balls In Your Mouth" [...] was on a 1992 sampler of the album. Prodigal Son included a radio mix, down and dirty mix and the echo mix of [...] "In So Deep".

40|$|The {{rising trend}} in {{concentrations}} of ground-level ozone (O 3) â€“ a common air pollutant and phytotoxin â€“ currently being experienced in some world regions represents {{a threat to}} agricultural yield. Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is an O 3 -sensitive crop species and is experiencing increasing global demand as a dietary protein source and constituent of livestock feed. In this study, we collate O 3 exposure-yield data for 49 soybean cultivars, from 28 experimental studies published between 1982 and 2014, to produce an updated doseâ€“response function for soybean. Different cultivars were seen to vary considerably in their sensitivity to O 3, with estimated yield loss due to O 3 ranging from 13. 3 % for the least sensitive cultivar to 37. 9 % for the most sensitive, at a 7 -h mean O 3 concentration (M 7) of 55 ppb â€“ a level frequently observed in regions of the USA, India and China in recent years. The year of cultivar <b>release,</b> <b>country</b> of data collection and type of O 3 exposure used were all important explanatory variables in a multivariate regression model describing soybean yield response to O 3. The data show that the O 3 sensitivity of soybean cultivars increased {{by an average of}} 32. 5 % between 1960 and 2000, suggesting that selective breeding strategies targeting high yield and high stomatal conductance may have inadvertently selected for greater O 3 sensitivity over time. Higher sensitivity was observed in data from India and China compared to the USA, although {{it is difficult to determine}} whether this effect is the result of differential cultivar physiology, or related to local environmental factors such as co-occurring pollutants. Gaining further understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the sensitivity of soybean cultivars to O 3 will be important in shaping future strategies for breeding O 3 -tolerant cultivars...|$|E
