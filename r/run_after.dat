5|$|The final {{issue of}} the Journal was {{released}} on 25 November 1752. In its last months, poor sales had resulted in a transition from semi-weekly to weekly release. Ill-health and a disinclination to continue led Fielding to end its <b>run</b> <b>after</b> the Number 72 issue. He died two years later while staying in Lisbon, Portugal.|$|E
5|$|In its {{theatrical}} run, Karnan completed 100 days in four theatres, including Madurai Thangam (noted as {{the second}} largest theatre in Asia during 1964), and also completed 105 days at Ganesan's family-owned Shanthi theatre. In spite of a successful <b>run</b> <b>after</b> completing 80 days, the film was removed from twelve theatres to allow the release of Pachai Vilakku, another Sivaji Ganesan film. At Madurai Thangam, Karnan earned totally 186,805.62 after its 14-week run there. Since most films {{of the time in}} the Tamil film industry did not have box office reports, the film's exact collections are unknown, although critics like Baradwaj Rangan and M. Suganth state that the film was a box office failure during its release.|$|E

However, the kick was blocked by Robert Lester to {{preserve}} the shutout. Alabama extended their lead to 27–0 by the fourth quarter after Richardson scored his second touchdown of the evening on a 58-yard <b>run.</b> <b>After</b> Shelley missed a 42-yard field goal on the first play of the fourth quarter, Richardson scored again with a 71-yard touchdown run on Alabama's next offensive possession to extend their lead to 34–0. Lacy scored the final points of the game midway through the fourth with his second touchdown of the evening on a 67-yard run to give Alabama the 41–0 victory.|$|E
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed <b>run</b> <b>after</b> setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

5|$|With 11:23 {{remaining}} in the first half, Florida State returned the kick to its 18-yard line and began its first full possession of the second quarter. After a running play was stopped for no gain, Florida State gained a first down on a short pass and a short <b>run.</b> <b>After</b> a 10-yard holding penalty against the Seminoles, Rix scrambled for eight yards and completed a 19-yard pass for a first down at the 50-yard line. After Rix gained five yards on another scramble, he threw two incomplete passes and the Seminoles punted. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Tech's offense began a drive at its 20-yard line with 7:43 {{remaining in}} the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|With {{the game}} in hand midway through the second quarter, Alabama played many of its reserve players in the second half.

5|$|After a 91-minute rain delay, the offenses {{fought back}} and forth, scoring <b>run</b> <b>after</b> run in an up-and-down affair in Philadelphia. Ryan Howard ended his home run drought, hitting his first round-tripper {{since the end}} of September. Chase Utley and Carlos Ruiz also hit home runs for the Phillies, while Carl Crawford and Dioner Navarro contributed a double each for the Rays. Philadelphia starter Jamie Moyer turned in his first strong {{performance}} of the post-season, allowing three runs over 6⅓ innings. His counterpart Matt Garza allowed four runs over six innings, but neither would factor in the decision. After the Rays tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth, the Phillies loaded the bases on two intentional walks with Eric Bruntlett on third base. Even with a five-man infield, Ruiz was still able to engineer some late-game heroics, sneaking a dribbling ground ball down the third base line to score Bruntlett. Philadelphia took a 21 series lead.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Healy stumped leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj {{from the}} bowling of Sthalekar and was not {{required}} to bat as Australia reached their target of 120 with seven wickets and seven balls to spare. Australia elected to bat first in the final against New Zealand, but was top-order struggled and Healy came to the crease to join Elliott at 5/51 in the 13th over {{after the fall of}} two wickets in quick succession. The pair lifted the run rate by adding 21 runs in 18 balls. Healy scored 10 from as many balls, but was then run out attempting a second <b>run</b> <b>after</b> being dropped by Sara McGlashan in the outfield. This left the score at 6/72 in the 16th over, and Australia eventually ended on 8/106.|$|E

The ringleader behind this is Nadif Abdelrashid (Ariyon Bakare) who was previously responsible for similar attacks in Turkey and Somalia. Ben Kaplan is in his first undercover operation disguised as a recent convert to Islam and {{becomes part of the}} cell. As part of his cover, Ben shares a flat with Jawad (Tariq Jordan), another member.

In WBSC-sanctioned competitions, the run ahead rule (the WBSC terminology) is, for fast or modified fast pitch, 20 <b>runs</b> <b>after</b> three innings, 15 after four, or 7 after 5. In slow pitch, the margin is 20 <b>runs</b> <b>after</b> four innings or 15 after five. [...] The NCAA has also adopted the rule.|$|R
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the Tech kickoff {{and returned it}} to their 23-yard line. After an incomplete pass from Rix, Virginia Tech's defense was caught offsides, resulting in a five-yard gain for Florida State. A short <b>run</b> <b>after</b> the penalty gained a first down, but on the first play after the first down, the Seminoles fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's defense, and the Hokies began their second possession {{of the second half}} at the State 31-yard line. Tech was unable to capitalize on the field position, however. Noel threw an incomplete pass, was sacked, then threw a pass for a loss of yardage. Tech punted the ball, which was downed at the Florida State 12-yard line.|$|E
5|$|His first Davis Cup {{highlight}} came in 2003 as {{the newly}} crowned Wimbledon champion led his country to an historic semifinal <b>run.</b> <b>After</b> recording five wins in ties against the Netherlands and France, the Swiss team traveled to Melbourne {{to play the}} highly rated Australians. Federer once again defeated Wimbledon runner-up Mark Philippoussis in the second rubber but allowed the Australians to lead the tie 2–1 going into Day 3 after dropping the doubles rubber in five sets. Federer then played Lleyton Hewitt in a sudden death situation for Switzerland and despite leading two sets to love, succumbed to a fast finishing Hewitt in five sets. Australia {{would go on to}} claim the Davis Cup title months later as Federer's interest in Davis Cup began to wane and his focus shifted to his personal career. He would go on to skip many ties over the years but often competed in the World Group Playoffs each year in order for Switzerland to maintain their place in the top division.|$|E

Brewer followed his regular season by helping the Cougars go on a playoff <b>run.</b> <b>After</b> clinching the last spot in the West Division with a losing record, the Cougars defeated the number-one seed Portland Winter Hawks in the conference quarterfinals and the third-ranked Spokane Chiefs in the conference semifinals before finally losing to the second-ranked Seattle Thunderbirds in the Western Conference final. Brewer finished this run with six points in the Cougars' fifteen games.|$|E

5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama {{defeated}} the Mississippi State Bulldogs at Tuscaloosa on homecoming 38–7. The Crimson Tide led 21–0 {{early in the}} second quarter after they scored touchdowns on their first three offensive possessions. They opened the game with a 41-yard Cyrus Jones kickoff return that set up a 59-yard drive that ended with an 11-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown <b>run.</b> <b>After</b> Dee Milliner blocked a Devon Bell field goal attempt, the Crimson Tide took possession and six plays later led 14–0 on a 57-yard AJ McCarron touchdown pass to Kenny Bell. The Alabama defense then forced their first punt of the game, and {{for the third time in}} three possessions the Crimson Tide scored a touchdown on a nine-yard McCarron pass to Michael Williams for a 21–0 lead. Each team then traded three-and-outs until nearly the end of the second quarter when Alabama was able to convert a 34-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal for a 24–0 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and the Lions {{faced the}} Atlanta Falcons {{on the road}} on September 7, 2008, in the season opener at the Georgia Dome. As the {{official}} starting wide receiver behind Roy Williams, Johnson led the team in receptions and yards, collecting 7catches for 107yards, which included one 38-yard catch-and-run in the Lions' 34–21 loss. During Week2 versus the Green Bay Packers, he had two key touchdowns late in the game, which sparked a large comeback, though the Lions eventually lost the game, 4825. Both touchdowns catches included a <b>run</b> <b>after</b> the catch (the first catch going for 38yards and the second going for 47yards, both over the middle) displaying Johnson's speed and breakaway ability. He ended the game with 6receptions for 129yards and 2touchdowns. In the following two games, losses to San Francisco and Chicago, Johnson failed to score a touchdown or gain over 50yards receiving. However, against the Minnesota Vikings, Johnson had 4receptions for 85yards and his third touchdown of the season.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{came in and}} {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick <b>run</b> <b>after</b> the ball was hit to third man. Morris was called through for a run by Don Tallon, {{but he was too}} slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Australia went on to finish with 389. Morris had scored more than half the runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 40 Test series triumph.|$|E
