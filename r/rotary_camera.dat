50|$|To create {{microform}} media, {{a planetary}} camera is mounted with the vertical axis above a copy that is stationary during exposure. High volume output is possible with a <b>rotary</b> <b>camera</b> which moves the copy smoothly through {{the camera to}} expose film which moves with the reduced image. Alternatively, it may be produced by computers, i.e. COM (computer output microfilm).|$|E
40|$|The Image Pattern Correlation Technique (IPCT) is a {{powerful}} optical tool to measure the surface shape and deformation of aircraft structures, e. g. wings, propeller or rotor blades, non-intrusively in flight. The latest development of this technique is its application to 360 ° propeller deformation measurements. Therefore a special stereo camera system rotating with the propeller at its full rotational speed was designed, whereby the system was exposed to extreme vibration and centrifugal forces. By beginning of 2014 the whole system had been successfully tested on an Evektor VUT 100 COBRA airplane. In the paper, this highly sophisticated <b>rotary</b> <b>camera</b> system and the measurement technique IPCT is described. Furthermore some results of the first flight tests are presented...|$|E
40|$|Within the EU project AIM² {{project a}} {{rotating}} stereoscopic camera system was designed, build and successfully flight tested {{in order to}} apply the non-intrusive Image Pattern Correlation Technique (IPCT) to 360 ° propeller deformation measurements. The complete system was affixed to the axis of the aircraft engine rotating together with the propeller at its full rotational speed. It enabled the direct measurement of the propeller blades shape {{as well as its}} local pitch angle under real operating conditions. Although the system was exposed to extreme vibration and centrifugal forces it delivered good images and demonstrated the applicability of the method to flight testing. During the paper presentation, this highly sophisticated <b>rotary</b> <b>camera</b> system and the measurement technique IPCT will be described. Some results of the first flight tests will be given and the next steps for the future applications will be introduced...|$|E
40|$|Rotating mirror cameras {{have been}} the {{mainstay}} of mega-frame per second imaging for decades. There is still no electronic camera that can match a film based <b>rotary</b> mirror <b>camera</b> for the combination of frame count, speed, resolution and dynamic range. The <b>rotary</b> mirror <b>cameras</b> are predominantly used {{in the range of}} 0. 1 to 100 micro-seconds per frame, for 25 to more than a hundred frames. Electron tube gated cameras dominate the sub microsecond regime but are frame count limited. Video cameras are pushing into the microsecond regime but are resolution limited by the high data rates. An all solid state architecture, dubbed ''In-situ Storage Image Sensor'' or ''ISIS'', by Prof. Goji Etoh, has made its first appearance into the market and its evaluation is discussed. Recent work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has concentrated both on evaluation of the presently available technologies and exploring the capabilities of the ISIS architecture. It is clear though there is presently no single chip camera that can simultaneously match the <b>rotary</b> mirror <b>cameras,</b> the ISIS architecture has the potential to approach their performance...|$|R
50|$|By {{removing}} the prism from a <b>rotary</b> prism <b>camera</b> {{and using a}} very narrow slit {{in place of the}} shutter, it is possible to take images whose exposure is essentially one dimension of spatial information recorded continuously over time. Streak records are therefore a space vs. time graphical record. The image that results allows for very precise measurement of velocities. It is also possible to capture streak records using rotating mirror technology at much faster speeds. Digital line sensors can be used for this effect as well, as can some two-dimensional sensors with a slit mask.|$|R
50|$|Each film type is {{available}} in many load sizes. These may be cut down and placed in magazines for easier loading. A 1200 ft magazine is typically the longest available for the 35 mm and 70 mm cameras. A 400 ft magazine is typical for 16 mm cameras, though 1000 ft magazines are available. Typically <b>rotary</b> prism <b>cameras</b> use 100 ft (30m) film loads. The images on 35 mm high-speed film are typically more rectangular with the long side between the sprocket holes instead of parallel to the edges as in standard photography. 16 mm and 70 mm images are typically more square rather than rectangular. A list of ANSI formats and sizes {{is available}}.|$|R
30|$|Owing to {{differences}} in the image capturing distance and in the illuminationed environment, {{the size of the}} subject’s pupil and the iris region of interest in the captured images are highly diverging. An accumulation of this, there is discrepancies of the same eye images owing to stretches of the iris. Additional criteria that cause dilation are eye <b>rotary</b> motion, revolving <b>camera</b> and head inclination. Such a deformation of the iris texture broadens intra-class dissimilarities and raises the FRR.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>rotary</b> prism <b>camera</b> allowed higher frame rates without placing as {{much stress}} on the film or {{transport}} mechanism. The film moves continuously past a rotating prism which is synchronized to the main film sprocket such that {{the speed of the}} film and the speed of the prism are always running at the same proportional speed. The prism is located between the objective lens and the film, such that the revolution of the prism [...] "paints" [...] a frame onto the film for each face of the prism. Prisms are typically cubic, or four sided, for full frame exposure. Since exposure occurs as the prism rotates, images near the top or bottom of the frame, where the prism is substantially off axis, suffer from significant aberration. A shutter can improve the results by gating the exposure more tightly around the point where the prism faces are nearly parallel.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ways in which the use of {{microfilm}} served as a precursor to later computerized information systems in business, education, and science. This accessible and inexpensive photographic technology allowed scientists, scholars, and others to experiment with ideas for information storage and retrieval that were not ultimately realized until the 1990 s. In 1926, George McCarthy, vice president of a New York bank, invented a <b>rotary</b> microfilm <b>camera</b> for copying bank checks automatically. This camera paved the way for the microfilm industry to record large volumes of documents very rapidly. Microfilm was quickly adopted by banks in the 1930 s and by other businesses, industries, and government agencies. Libraries, eager to expand access to resources required by a burgeoning research community, also adopted microfilm. Although academic enthusiasts predicted that microfilm would revolutionize scholarship, the limitations of reading machinery precluded an unmitigated success. Users in academia, business, technology, and science also sought to improve on {{the ways in}} which data could be retrieved from microfilm. This paper discusses three specific attempts to overcome output limitations: the struggle for good reading machines; the pursuit of more standardized and sortable formats, i. e., microcards and aperture cards; and finally the use of microfilm as an expendable element in new computerized information systems...|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{horizontal}} Leica and vertical Square FP shutters, {{other types of}} FP shutters exist. The most prominent is the rotary or sector FP shutter. The rotary disc shutter is common in film movie cameras, but rare in still cameras. These spin a round metal plate with a sector cutout {{in front of the}} film. In theory, rotary shutters can control their speeds by narrowing or widening the sector cutout (by using two overlapping plates and varying the overlap) and/or by spinning the plate faster or slower. However, for simplicity's sake, most still <b>camera</b> <b>rotary</b> shutters have fixed cutouts and vary the spinning speed. The Olympus Pen F and Pen FT (1963 and 1966, both from Japan) half frame 35 mm SLRs spun a semicircular titanium plate to 1/500 s.|$|R
40|$|A {{machine vision}} system is {{proposed}} {{to measure the}} diameter of a mini milling cutter on line, and the measurement uncertainty is analyzed in this paper. The system consists of a back-light source, a rotate stage, a <b>rotary</b> encoder, a <b>camera</b> and corresponding software. While the milling cutter rotates, the camera is triggered by the rotary encoder {{and a series of}} images are captured. The sources of uncertainty and their effects are analyzed, including the parallelism of the light source, lens distortion, CCD noise, focusing situation, the geometric properties of tested objects and the algorithm design. According to results of experiments, the uncertainty mainly depends on the geometric property of the tested object when sampling rate is not enough, otherwise, it is mainly relative to the parallelism of the light source. In the experiment performed, the system uncertainty is 4 渭m with a sampling rate of 33 frame/circle, both accuracy and efficiency meet the requirement of manufacturing...|$|R
