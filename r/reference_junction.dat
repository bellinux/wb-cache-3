Refractometry at the 10 − 9 level is only valid if air temperature gradients are controlled at the millikelvin (mK) level. Very precise tests of second-generation National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) refractometers involve comparing two instruments (two optical cavities made from ultralow expansion glass) that are located in nominally the same environment; temperature gradients must be kept below a few millikelvin to achieve satisfactory precision of these tests.

The thermopile sensor array, which {{was developed in the}} project, consists of 16 miniaturized multi-junction thermopile sensors made by modern thin-film technology on Si wafers.

40|$|An {{isotonic}} {{potassium chloride}} liquid junction minimises {{the effects of}} ionic strength, protein and haematocrit on ionised calcium measurement RBPAYNE From the Department of Chemical Pathology, St James's University Hospital, Leeds LS 9 7 TF, UK SUMMARY. When the <b>reference</b> electrode liquid <b>junction</b> of a Nova 2 analyser was changed to isotonic potassium chloride, increasing the ionic strength of aqueous solutions containing a constant total calcium concentration had a negligible effect on measured ionised calcium. In contrast, measurements using hypertonic potassium chloride, hypertonic sodium formate and isotonic sodium chloride liquid junctions showed significant sample ionic strength effects. Interferences by sample protein concentration and haematocrit were marked with hypertonic, but negligible with isotonic junctions. Ionised calcium values in samples containing 25 mmoVL acetate, bicarbonate, ~-hydroxybutyrate, lactate or pyruvate were all lower by fr. 7 % with an isotonic than a hypertonic potassium chloride junction. Thus, anions that replace bicarbonate during metabolic acidosis have a similar effect on residual liquid junction potential. The clinical usefulness of an isotonic potassium chloride liquid junction needs to be evaluated. The clinically significant positive interference with the measurement of ionised calcium by sample protein concentration I. 2 was suggested by others to be a Donnan effect. ? However, subsequent experiments showed that it dis-appeared when the <b>reference</b> electrodes liquid <b>junction</b> was changed from 2 · 0 moVL KCI or 4 · 6 moUKg HCOONa to 150 mmoVL NaCI; in addition, measurements became significantly more reproducible. " Isotonic NaCI bridges are not used in clinical analysers because their residual liquid junction potential varies with the ionic strength of the sample and is said to vary with its anionic composition. Preliminary ex-periments suggested that variation in ionic strength had little effect when the brid~e was 150 mmoVL KCI rather than NaCI.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the National Launch System (NLS) program was to design an operationally efficient, highly {{reliable}} vehicle with minimal recurring launch costs. To achieve this goal, trade studies of key main propulsion subsystems were performed to specify vehicle design requirements. These requirements {{include the use of}} passive recirculation to thermally condition the liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LO 2) propellant feed systems and Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) fuel pumps. Rockwell International (RI) proposed a joint independent research and development (JIRAD) program with Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to study the LH 2 feed system passive recirculation concept. The testing was started in July 1992 and completed in November 1992. Vertical and sloped feedline designs were used. An engine simulator was attached {{at the bottom of the}} feedline. This simulator had strip heaters that were set to equal the corresponding heat input from different engines. A computer program is currently being used to analyze the passive recirculation concept in the LH 2 vertical feedline tests. Four tests, where the heater setting is the independent variable, were chosen. While the JIRAD with RI was underway, General Dynamics Space Systems (GDSS) proposed a JIRAD with MSFC to explore passive recirculation in the LO 2 feed system. Liquid nitrogen (LN 2) is being used instead of LO 2 for safety and economic concerns. To date, three sets of calibration tests have been completed on the sloped LN 2 test article. The environmental heat was calculated from the calibration tests in which the strip heaters were turned off. During the LH 2 testing, the environmental heat was assumed to be constant. Therefore, the total heat was equal to the environmental heat flux plus the heater input. However, the first two sets of LN 2 calibration tests have shown that the environmental heat flux varies with heater input. A Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer and Fluid Integrator (SINDA/FLUINT) model is currently being built to determine if this variation in environmental heat is due to a change in the wall temperature.

We used stimuli based on a cross moving within an occluding aperture. The two bars of the cross appear to cohere or move separately depending on the context; in accord with prior literature, motion interpretation depends in part on whether the bar endpoints appear to be occluded. To test the importance of junctions in motion interpretation, we explored the effect of changing the junctions generated at the occlusion points in our stimuli, from T-junctions to L-junctions. In some cases, this change had a large effect on perceived motion; in others, it made little difference, suggesting junctions are not the critical variable.
