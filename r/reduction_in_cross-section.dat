These elements {{were part of an}} industrial hall raised in the 1970 's in Belgium, to be submitted intentionally to a real scale fire test. During the fire which approximated the ISO 834 temperature curve, temperatures were recorded inside the building and the elements. Most of the elements only suffered from limited spalling, except the pretensioned girder for which spalling depths up to 8 cm were noticed, resulting in naked prestressing strands and penetrations through the web. After the fire, the precast elements were visually inspected for spalling and submitted to a loading test up to failure. For a small pretensioned beam, the bearing resistance is calculated based on the residual material properties obtained from drilled cores and by taking into account the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>cross-section</b> due to spalling. Additionally, the resisting bending moment is calculated based on the 500 °C isotherm method. An adequate agreement is found between the experimental and calculated results...|$|E

The strain rate increases after its minimum {{mainly because of}} the softening of the material which microstructure evolves strongly during creep deformation. An interrupted creep test shows that necking significantly affects the acceleration of the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>cross-section</b> only during the last 10 % of the creep lifetime. The Hoff model based on homogeneous reduction of cross-section correctly predicts lifetimes only for high applied stress. The Hart necking model using the Norton power-law allows fair predictions of lifetimes up to 60 × 103 h at 500 °C. The necking model using a modified Norton power-law combined with a material softening term allows predictions of lifetimes for all creep tests, differing from the experimental results by less than 50 %, which is consistent with the experimental scatter. The evolution of the cross-section predicted by this model is in agreement with measurements carried out during the interrupted creep test. Two prediction rules for the lifetime prediction are deduced from the necking model that takes into account the material softening. For a large number of tempered martensitic steels, these two criteria bound the experimental lifetimes up to 200 × 103 h at 500 - 700 °C...|$|E
40|$|Wave filters may be {{employed}} in laboratory facilities to attenuate oscillatory surface waves reflected from a test model, or {{to improve the quality}} of generated waves. When used for these purposes, they are placed between the generator and the test model, usually quite close to the generator. The studies reported herein consisted of experimental tests of the attenuation and reflection characteristics of plate and wire-mesh filters. The results indicated that high attenuations can be achieved with either type filter without serious reflections. The attenuation and reflection depend, in addition to other factors, upon the plate spacing of plate type filters and the porosity of wire-mesh filters. Very dense or closely spaced filters produced high attenuations and high reflections. The best over-all performance was obtained by plate spacings or porosities selected to utilizee a filter length equal to or in excess of the wave length. Reflection produced by plate filters depended, to a considerable extent, on the blockage or <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>cross-section</b> of the channel, as well as on the ratio of wave length to filter length. Reflections from plate filters were reduced when the filter was constructed of plates of various lengths. The experimental results were compared with available theory. Very good agreement was obtained with the plate-type filter when the spacing was not too small. Brief comparisons between the data on wire-mesh filters and two suggested theories were not successful. The majority of the filter tests were conducted in a relatively small wave channel. limited tests were conducted on wire-mesh filters in a large channel; a comparison of data from the two sources indicated that porosity was not the sole factor affecting the attenuation and that the resistance of the wire mesh probably varied as a function of Reynolds number.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this report is {{accidental}} iceberg collision with the bow shoulder area of a 150000 ton membrane-type LNG carrier. It is expected that the traffic of LNG-carriers will increase in the arctic areas {{in the years to}} come, and ice collisions are considered to be a real hazard. A finite element model of the ship side have been developed, where the area in question is the foremost tank of the ship. The collision point is assumed to be in the forward part of the tank, close to the collision bulkhead. However in the FE-analyses the collision point is moved to the centre of the tank, to avoid interference from the boundary conditions. A maximum size criterion for icebergs is used, where it is assumed that all icebergs with less than 2 meter sailing height are hazardous. This means that the ship is assumed to hit these iceberg at its cruising speed of 19. 5 knots. 2 meter sail height corresponds to 5 meter radius for a spherical iceberg. The steel material used is based on power-law formulations. This allows the material model to take into account increase in stress due to <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>cross-section</b> area. The ice material uses the elliptical Tsai-Wu yield surface. Elements are deleted when they violate the fracture criterion. The FE-analyses are carried out to find the critical energy levels. The analyses were done with spherically shaped icebergs, with radii of 1, 2, 5 and 10 meter. Failure of the ship structure is based on preventing the gas from leaking out due to fracture of the membranes in the cargo containment system. The criterion which is used is 700 mm deection of the inner hull {{in the middle of the}} tank. The internal energy for the ship structure when the failure criterion is reached is found to be approximately 70 MJ. The actual collision energy levels are found using a 3 D external mechanics model. The results indicate that the critical energy levels are not reached. The levels for 1 and 2 meter radius icebergs are negligible. For the 5 meter radius the level is 8 MJ, or 11 % of the critical value. For the 10 meter iceberg the margin is quite small, with 57 MJ or 81 % of critical value. The critical size is found to be 11 meter radius, although it is very conservative since icebergs larger than 5 meter radius will probably be detected before impact. In previous studies of ship-iceberg impacts, inner hull accelerations are found to be very high, up to 2000 g. There has also been concern about accelerations causing problems far from the impact zone. The accelerations have been investigated on several location on the inner hull, and none show higher levels than 200 g. Displacements corresponding to these accelerations show no rapid jumps or fluctuations in the curves. This should indicate that the accelerations cause no serious problems for the membrane and are more of a numerical issue than a real life problem.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory drug {{delivery}} {{has been under}} the research spotlight {{for the past few}} decades, mainly due to the high incidence of pulmonary diseases and the fact that this type of delivery offers the highest efficiency for treatment. Despite its invaluable benefits, there are some major drawbacks to respiratory {{drug delivery}}- the most important of which being poor delivery efficiency and relatively high drug deposition in undesirable regions, such as the oral cavity. This study focused on improving inhalation therapy devices function using the results and findings obtained from CFD simulations. Particle transport and deposition in an idealized oral airway geometry to better optimize the spacer one way-valve shape and design was studied {{in the second part of}} this research. A key issue in pulmonary drug delivery is improving the medical delivery device for effective and targeted treatment. Spacers are clear plastic containers attached to inhalers aimed at delivering more drug particles to the respiratory tract. The spacer&rsquo;s one way-valve plays an important role in controlling and initializing the particles into the oral cavity. Three steady flow rates were used 15, 30 and 60 l/min and a Lagrangian, one-way coupled particle tracking model with near wall turbulence fluctuation correction was used to determine the deposition rates. For all three breathing rates, the velocity field in the mid-sagittal plane showed similar gross fluid dynamics characteristics, such as the separation and recirculation regions that occur after the larynx. The particle deposition rates compared reasonably well with available experiments. Most particles deposited at the larynx, where the airway has a decreasing cross-sectional area. For different particles sizes, most particles introduced at the lower region of the mouth produces higher possibility to pass through upper airway and enter the trachea and lung airways. The particle deposition patterns in the airway were traced back to its initial inlet position at the oral inlet; and this information provides the background for a conceptual and optimized design of the spacer one way valve. Pressurized-metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) are the most popular aerosol therapy device for treating lung diseases. Despite its popularity, they are inefficient in delivering drug particles to the lung. Improving its performance involves ongoing investigations in the fields of engineering and medical science. In the last part of this research, the effect of two spray characteristics (injection velocity and spray cone angle) on the drug delivery efficiency was discussed. An idealized oral airway geometry, extending from mouth to the main bronchus, was connected to a pMDI device. Inhalation flow rates of 15, 30 and 60 l/min were used and the drug particle tracking was a one-way coupled Lagrangian model. The results showed that most particles deposited in the pharynx, where the airway has a reduced cross-sectional area. Particle deposition generally decreased with initial spray velocity, and with increased spray cone angle for 30 l/min and 60 l/min flow rates. However for 15 l/min flow rate the deposition increased slightly with an increase in the spray velocity and cone angle. The effect of spray cone angle was greater than the injection velocity on particle deposition. Overall drug delivery to the lungs was best achieved for 30 l/min, which produced on average 5 % increase in pulmonary delivery compared to inhalation rates of 15 and 60 l/min. Conventional inhalation therapy devices such as inhalers and nebulizers, nevertheless, suffer from low delivery efficiencies wherein only a small fraction of the inhaled drug reaches the lower respiratory tract. This is primarily because these devices are not able to produce a sufficiently fine drug mist that has aerodynamic diameters on the order of a few microns. The last part of this study employs using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to investigate the transport and deposition of the drug particles produced by a new aerosolization technique driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) into an in silico lung model geometrically reconstructed using computed tomography (CT) scanning. The particles generated by the SAW are released in different locations in a spacer chamber attached to a lung model extending from the mouth to the 6 th generation of the lung bronchial tree. An Eulerian approach is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations that govern the airflow within the respiratory tract and a Lagrangian approach is adopted to track the particles, which are assumed to be spherical and inert. Due to the complexity of the lung geometry, the airflow patterns vary as it penetrates deeper into the lung. In particular, we find that larger particles above 10 &micro;m are unable to follow the airflow stream immediately after a sharp change in the geometry. As such, these particles tend to deposit at locations where the geometry experiences a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>cross-section.</b> The findings, nevertheless, show that the injection location can influence the delivery efficiency: injection points close to the spacer centerline result in deeper penetration into the lung. Additionally, we found that the ratio of drug particles entering the right lung is significantly higher than the left lung independent of the injection location...|$|E

Large plastic strains can be applied during this operation (up to 1. 5) and greatly changes the mechanical properties of the resulting material. This study focuses {{on the impact of}} cold extrusion process parameters on the multiaxial fatigue behaviour of steel components. A specific set of forward rod extrusion tools was developed to get original fatigue specimen able to characterise the effect of the manufacturing process on the fatigue behaviour. The specimens were extruded from two different initial diameters, giving two different <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>cross-section</b> of 18 % and 75 % respectively. To understand the influence of cold extrusion, the following analyses have been undertaken for each condition and on the initial material: monotonic tensile properties, microstructure, EBSD, residual stresses and hardness. Simulation of the forming process and microstructural observations show that the plastic strain is homogeneous in the specimen section. For both reduction factors, the forming process has a positive effect on the components properties: induced residual stresses in compression and improved hardness and roughness (Ra decreasing). Tension, plane bending and torsion fatigue tests show that the fatigue strength is about 30 % higher for the batch with 75 % reduced cross-section.

Additional {{studies have shown that}} podocyte injury and loss occurs in both diabetic animals and humans. However, most studies in animals have examined relatively long-term changes in podocyte number and density and have not examined effects early after initiation of diabetes. We hypothesized that streptozotocin diabetes in rats and mice would result <b>in</b> an early <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> podocyte density and that this reduction would be prevented by antioxidants. Methods The number of podocytes per glomerular section and the podocyte density in glomeruli from rats and mice with streptozotocin (STZ) -diabetes mellitus was determined at several time points based on detection of the glomerular podocyte specific antigens, WT- 1 and GLEPP 1. The effect of insulin administration or treatment with the antioxidant, α-lipoic acid, on podocyte number was assessed. Results Experimental diabetes resulted in a rapid decline in apparent podocyte number and podocyte density. A significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> podocytes/glomerular <b>cross-section</b> was found <b>in</b> STZ diabetes in rats at 2 weeks (14 %), 6 weeks (18 %) and 8 weeks (34 %) following STZ injection. Similar declines in apparent podocyte number were found in STZ diabetes in C 57 BL/ 6 mice at 2 weeks, but not at 3 days after injection. Treatment with α-lipoic acid substantially prevented podocyte loss in diabetic rats but treatment with insulin had only a modest effect.

Prevention of these effects with antioxidant therapy suggests that this early <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> podocyte density {{is due in part to}} increased levels of reactive oxygen species as well as hyperglycemia. </p...|$|R

40|$|Modulation of the endocannabinoid {{system as}} an anti-obesity {{therapeutic}} is well established; however, the direct effects of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB 1) antagonism on renal function and structure {{in a model}} of diet-induced obesity (DIO) are unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterise the renal effects of the CB 1 antagonist AM 251 in a model of DIO. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were fed a low- or high-fat diet (HFD: 40 % digestible energy from lipids) for 10 weeks to elicit DIO (n= 9). In a different cohort, rats were fed a HFD for 15 weeks. After 9 weeks consuming a HFD, rats were injected daily for 6 weeks with 3  mg/kg AM 251 (n= 9) or saline via i. p. injection (n= 9). After 10 weeks consuming a HFD, CB 1 and megalin protein expression were significantly increased in the kidneys of obese rats. Antagonism of CB 1 with AM 251 significantly reduced weight gain, systolic blood pressure, plasma leptin, and reduced albuminuria and plasma creatinine levels in obese rats. Importantly, there was a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> tubular <b>cross-section</b> diameter <b>in</b> the obese rats treated with AM 251. An improvement in albuminuria was likely due to the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> tubular size, reduced leptinaemia and maintenance of megalin expression levels. In obese rats, AM 251 did not alter diastolic blood pressure, sodium excretion, creatinine clearance or expression of the fibrotic proteins VEGFA, TGFB 1 and collagen IV in the kidney. This study demonstrates that treatment with CB 1 antagonist AM 251 improves renal outcomes in obese rats. No Full Tex...|$|R

In this work, {{the spring}} back, {{dimensional}} change, internal structure and morphology of extruded polypropylene were investigated {{in order to}} consider the rolling characteristic. It {{was found that the}} internal structure, molecular orientation and crystallinity were changed a little by high spring back under low <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> thickness. Crystal structure was extended along the rolling direction with high <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> thickness due to the increase of plastic deformation. As a result, molecular orientation increased and crystallinity decreased at over 30 % of <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> thickness.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study reports, {{for the first}} time, the radiation characteristics of the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain CC 125 and its truncated chlorophyll antenna transformants tla 1, tlaX, and tla 1 -CW+. Photobiological hydrogen production is a sustainable alternative to thermochemical and electrolytic technologies with the possible advantage of carbon dioxide mitigation. However, scale-up of photobioreactors from bench top to industrial scale is made difficult by excessive absorption and waste of light energy as heat and fluorescence. This results in limited light penetration into the photobioreactor and low solar to hydrogen energy conversion efficiency. To overcome these challenges, the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been genetically engineered with reduced pigment concentrations in their photosystems. This can improve the performance of photobioreactors by increasing the saturation irradiance of algae and quantum efficiency of photobiological hydrogen production. The extinction and absorption coefficients of all strains studied are obtained from normal-normal and normal-hemispherical transmittance measurements over the spectral range from 300 to 1, 300 nm. Moreover, a polar nephelometer is {{used to measure the}} scattering phase function of the microorganisms at 632. 8 nm. It is established that the wild strain C. reinhardtii CC 125 has major absorption peaks at 435 and 676 nm, corresponding to the in vivo absorption peaks of chlorophyll a, and at 475 and 650 nm corresponding to those of chlorophyll b. The genetically engineered strains have less chlorophyll pigments than the wild strain and thus have smaller absorption <b>cross-sections.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the mutant tlaX features a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> chlorophyll b concentration. For all mutants, however the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the absorption <b>cross-section</b> is accompanied by an increase <b>in</b> scattering <b>cross-section.</b> Although scattering becomes the dominant phenomenon contributing to the overall extinction of light, it is mainly in the forward direction. Thus, to fully assess the effect of genetic engineering on light transport in the photobioreactor requires careful radiation transfer analysis using the radiation characteristics reported in this study...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article tries gaining insight in {{the effect}} of the partial factor {{starting}} by the analysis of a steel cable net structure according to Eurocode 3. Eurocode specifies a value of 1. 35 for the partial factor for prestress. A cable net structure built in 1958, was used as a case study. In spite of the lack of design guidelines and calculation tools 58 years ago, the analysis according to the current design standard Eurocode 3 for steel shows that the results match quite well with the original calculation. Generally speaking, a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the <b>cross-section</b> areas is observed using Eurocode 3. For the considered steel cable net structure a weight saving of 17 % for a partial factor for prestress 1. 35 is obtained. If a partial factor for the prestress 1. 0 could be considered, the weight reduction would be 4 % more. Furthermore, the article investigates {{the effect of}} the partial factor for prestress (1. 0 or 1. 35), there prestress contributes to the stiffness in the non-lineair structural behaviour of membrane structures. The value of the partial factor for prestress to be considered is a source of disagreement between experts in different countries. With a similar geometry as the steel cable net structure, a membrane structure is designed and analysed. For the primary steel structure the partial factor for prestress 1. 35 has to be applied. A 2 % weight saving for the pretension factor 1. 0 versus 1. 35 is obtained if the tensile surface including the membrane and the edge cables is considered separate from the primary structure. A sound conclusion though requires a thorough in-depth study for different shapes and for different membrane types...|$|R

Based on observations I section reinforced concrete beam is quite complicated and takes much longer time for the manufacturing. Therefore another form of cross-section which is equivalent to weight <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> I <b>cross-section</b> concrete beam, with hollow square {{cross-section of}} reinforced concrete beam. It is expected that hollow square cross-section of reinforced concrete has a same strength with I cross-section of reinforced concrete. So this research may provide an alternative lightweight concrete beam, efficient in materials, easy installation {{in the implementation of}} shear reinforcement, and easy in formwork manufacture. This research was conducted to identify and compare the behavior of the shear of hollow core reinforced concrete beam with an I cross-section beam that equivalent with its. This experiment is using four reinforced concrete beam length 2000 mm, a T beam with bottom flange as control beam (BK) with measurement: bfa = 600 mm, bw = 125 mm, bfb = 200 mm, h = 300 mm, tf = 100 mm and three hollow core T beam as test beam (BB 1, BB 2 and BB 3) with measurement: bf = 600 mm, bw = 200 mm, blubang = 75 mm h = 300 mm, tf = 100 mm. This experiment is testing the static and dynamic. Static loading is performed with a four-point system load, static loads are given by the hydraulic jack. Observations on the static load carried on the first crack and at each initial crack addition until the ultimate fracture. With the parameters used is the amount of deflection, the strain of reinforcing steel and concrete, the crack pattern that has happened. From the results of the experiments can be concluded that the hollow core reinforced concrete beam can be used as an alternative to I section reinforced concrete beam. It is seen from the difference in the shear load capacity is not much different between control beam (BK) and hollow beam (BB), with the difference between BK (299. 3 kN) and BB 1 (337. 6 kN) is 12. 79 %, with BB 2 (350, 6 kN) or 17. 14 % and with BB 3 (289. 4 kN) or - 3. 31 %...|$|R
