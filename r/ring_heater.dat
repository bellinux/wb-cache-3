40|$|Abstract. The {{output port}} of GEO 600 is {{dominated}} by unwanted high order modes (HOMs). The current thermal actuation system, a <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> {{behind one of the}} folding mirrors, causes a significant amount of astigmatism, which produces HOMs. We have built and installed an astigmatism correction system, based on heating this folding mirror at the sides (laterally). With these side heaters and the <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> behind the mirror, it is possible to tune its radius of curvature in the horizontal and the vertical degree of freedom. We use this system to match the mirrors in the two arms of GEO 600 to each other, thereby reducing the contrast defect. The use of the side heaters reduces the power of the HOMs at the output of GEO 600 by approximately 37 %. 1...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe thermocapillary driven {{flows in}} a {{floating}} zone radially heated by a <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> are numerically {{studied in the}} presence of an axial magnetic field. A closed-form solution (without magnetic field) is obtained by solving a linear (Stokes-type) problem. Steady axisymmetric flows are presented through numerical simulations with a finite difference method applied to a velocity-pressure-temperature formulation. This work investigates the free surface deformation and its effect of the flow field. The results indicate that the amplitude of the free surface deformation from its originalb shape linearly increases respectively with capillary force and buoyant forc...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{presented}} the MELCOR preliminary calculation, which {{was performed to}} investigate behavior of the parameters during the Boil-off test at QUENCHfacility. The experiment QUENCH-II on boil-off and subsequent quenching is dedicated to investigate degraded core refiood situations with a rather low mass flow rate. MELCOR 1. 8. 5 computer code {{has been used to}} simulate the investigated transient. The MELCOR 1. 8. 5 base tine input model was providedfrom Forschungszentrum, Karlsruhe. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE QUENCH FACILITY The scheme of the QUENCH facility is presented on Figure 1. In radial direction the QUENCH fuel rod bundle is composed of an unheated rod at center position, an inner <b>ring</b> of 8 <b>heater</b> rods connected to an electric power supply, an outer <b>ring</b> of 12 <b>heater</b> rods connected to another electric power supply system, and a set of 4 corner rods at the vacant rod positions. The test section is made from 20 heated fuel rod simulators, approximately 2. S m long, and an unheated rod in the center. They are filled with a mixture of 95 vol % Argon and 5 vol % krypton at a pressure slightly about fluid pressure in the bundle and connected to a compensating volume at room temperature. The bundle is enclosed in a shroud, which is composed of Zircaloy liner (2. 38 mm thick), ZK> 2 fiber insulation (37 mm thick) and the inner cooling jacket, made of stainless steel. The region between the shroud and the inner cooling jacket, i. e. the Z 1 O 2 fiber insulation and the region (space) above this insulation are flooded with argon before the test, the pressure being about 2 bar...|$|R
40|$|Changes in life, {{culture and}} {{industry}} {{for food and}} nutrition in rural areas in Iwate prefecture were investigated by comparing with those about 50 years ago. This {{study was conducted in}} four typical rural areas running agriculture, forestry and fisheries. On the transformation of the life and culture for food and nutrition, we surveyed the source or market of the daily food, changes in the utilization of ten kinds of the items and appliances related to the eating habits (electric refrigerator, microwave oven, gas <b>ring,</b> IH <b>heater,</b> electric rice cooker, tableware dryer, tableware washing machine, hearth, furnace and well), and in the production of four kinds of the processed foods (miso, soy sauce, rice cake and pickle) and rice. Among the social changes that were investigated on the transformation of the industry for food and nutrition include worker of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries, places to ship and transport the farm and marine products, changes in use of the machines for the agriculture, forestry and fisheries, and in breeding of eight kinds of the domestic animals, utilization of the internet at work, and the continuity of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries. In some investigation contents, there have been changes for a period of about 50 years in the present survey, and these changes might be brought by the declining birthrate and aging of population and by the depopulation of the area which are the representative social changes in Japan...|$|R
40|$|Drift {{effects and}} cross sensitivities seriously hinder the {{application}} of numerous sensor coatings based on organic or organically modified substances. A temperature modulated mode of sensor operation is investigated to reduce or overcome drift and humidity influence on organic gas-sensitive coatings. The transducers are interdigital capacitance structures with <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> (IDC). As sensitive material a CO 2 sensitive organically modified heteropolysiloxane is used. Heteropolysiloxanes are well known materials for gas-sensing, however, they also have common weaknesses of organic sensor coatings.

40|$|This is an {{overview}} of the adaptive optics used in Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), known as the thermal compensation system (TCS). The TCS was designed to minimize thermally induced spatial distortions in the interferometer optical modes and to provide some correction for static curvature errors in the core optics of aLIGO. The TCS is comprised of <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> actuators, spatially tunable CO_ 2 laser projectors, and Hartmann wavefront sensors. The system meets the requirements of correcting for nominal distortion in aLIGO to a maximum residual error of 5. 4 nm rms, weighted across the laser beam, for up to 125 W of laser input power into the interferometer...|$|E
40|$|A model {{problem is}} posed {{to study the}} {{influence}} of flow on the interfacial stability of a nearly cylindrical liquid bridge for lengths near its circumference (the Plateau-Rayleigh limit). The flow is generated by a shear stress imposed on the deformable interface. The symmetry of the imposed shear stress mimics the thermocapillary stress induced on a float-zone by a <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> (i. e. a full zone). Principal assumptions are (1) zero gravity, (2) creeping flow, and (3) that the imposed coupling at the free surface between flow and temperature fields is the only such coupling. A numerical solution, complemented by a bifurcation analysis, shows that bridges substantially longer than the Plateau-Rayleigh limit are possible. An interaction {{of the first two}} capillary instabilities through the stress-induced flow is responsible. Time-periodic standing waves are also predicted in certain parameter ranges. Motivation comes from extra-long float-zones observed in MEPHISTO space lab experiments (June 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|High-reflectivity {{fused silica}} mirrors {{are at the}} {{epicentre}} of current advanced gravitational wave detectors. In these detectors, the mirrors interact with high power laser beams. As a result of finite absorption in the high reflectivity coatings the mirrors suffer {{from a variety of}} thermal effects that impact on the detectors performance. We propose a model of the Advanced LIGO mirrors that introduces an empirical term to account for the radiative heat transfer between the mirror and its surroundings. The mechanical mode frequency is used as a probe for the overall temperature of the mirror. The thermal transient after power build-up in the optical cavities is used to refine and test the model. The model provides a coating absorption estimate of 1. 5 to 2. 0 ppm and estimates that 0. 3 to 1. 3 ppm of the circulating light is scattered on to the <b>ring</b> <b>heater.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|Floating-zone {{crystal growth}} under microgravity, though free from natural convection, {{can still be}} {{susceptible}} to Marangoni convection. The use of a <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> in contact {{with most of the}} surface of the melt zone, has recently been considered as one way of reducing Marangoni convection in the melt zone. In order to study Marangoni convection in the melt zone in this modified floating-zone crystal growth process, a half-zone system was adopted. Computer simulation and direct observation of Marangoni convection in the half-zone system were carried out for two different cases. In the first case, the surface of the melt zone was completely free, while in the second it was mostly in contact with a quartz ring. The results of computer simulation and direct observation both indicated that in the second case Marangoni convection was significantly reduced near the melt/solid interface {{as well as in the}} bulk melt...|$|E
40|$|Advanced laser {{interferometer}} gravitational-wave detectors use high laser power to achieve design sensitivity. A {{small part of}} this power is absorbed in the interferometer cavity mirrors where it creates thermal lenses, causing aberrations in the main laser beam that must be minimized by the actuation of "ring heaters," which are additional heater elements that are aimed to reduce the temperature gradients in the mirrors. In this article we derive the first, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, analytical model of the temperature field generated by an ideal <b>ring</b> <b>heater.</b> We express the resulting optical aberration contribution to the main laser beam in this axisymmetric case. Used in conjunction with wavefront measurements, our model provides a more complete understanding of the thermal state of the cavity mirrors and will allow a more efficient use of the ring heaters in the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.

40|$|Drift {{effects and}} cross sensitivities hinder the {{application}} of chemical sensor, especially with coatings based on organic or organically modified substances. A temperature modulated mode of sensor operation (AT-mode) is investigated to reduce drift and humidity influence on organic gas-sensitive coatings. The transducers are interdigital capacitance structures with <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> (IDC). As sensitive material a CO 2 sensitive organically modified heteropolysiloxane is used. Heteropolysiloxanes are well known materials for gas-sensing. They also have common weaknesses of organic sensor coatings. Different kinds and patterns of temperature modulation together with adapted signal-processing were used to reduce long time drift effects and diminsh cross-sensitivities. A typical application for CO 2 sensors is the field of home automation. The hardware and software realization of the system will be discussed for two systems: First as a subpart of a complex, flexible, intelligent multi-gas sensor system based on the CAN field bus and secondly as stand-alone low cost solution for a CO 2 alarm device...|$|E
40|$|Results {{of three}} {{problems}} {{are summarized in}} this contribution. Each involves the fundamental capillary instability of an interfacial bridge and {{is an extension of}} previous work. The first two problems concern equilibrium shapes of liquid bridges near the stability boundary corresponding to maximum length (Plateau-Rayleigh limit). For the first problem, a previously formulated nonlinear theory to account for imposed gravity and interfacial shear disturbances in an isothermal environment is quantitatively tested in experiment. For the second problem, the liquid bridge is subjected to a shear that models the effect of a thermocapillary flow generated by a <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> in a liquid encapsulated float-zone configuration. In the absence of gravity, this symmetric perturbation can stabilize the bridge to lengths on the order of 30 percent beyond the Plateau-Rayleigh limit, which is on the order of heretofore unexplained Shuttle observations. The third problem considers the dynamics of collapse and pinchoff of a film bridge (no gravity), which happens in the absence of stabilization. Here, we summarize experimental efforts to measure the self-similar cone-and-crater structure predicted by a previous theory...|$|E
40|$|Monolithically-integrated {{optical link}} is a {{disruptive}} technology {{which has the}} promising potential to remove memory bandwidth bottleneck in the deep multicore regime. Although with the advantages of high bandwidth-density and energy-efficiency, it comes with design challenges from device, architecture and system perspectives. High thermal sensitivity of the essential optical ring resonator imposes constraints on the applicability of optical links in the electro-optical systems. To investigate the thermal dynamics {{as well as to}} develop advanced ring thermal-tuning mechanisms, real-time thermal monitoring at design stage is required. In this work we propose a thermal simulation platform which integrates system modeling aspects including the high-level architectural performance model, the physical device evaluation model, and the thermal analysis model. By introducing the compact thermal model with linear transient thermal analysis solver, system thermal dynamics can be monitored at high efficiency. We demonstrate the temperature profile of a multi-core microprocessor system running real workloads.

40|$|An {{electromigration}} (EM) test mask {{was designed}} to utilize both standard ASTM and Standard Wafer-level Electromigration Accelerated Test Structures (SWEAT) fourterminal EM test structures of varying line-widths. The mask was used to pattern 4 ” test wafers consisting of 300 nm of sputtered aluminum- 1 % silicon on a thermal SiO 2 layer. A custom thermal setup was developed for a Micromanipulator 6000 manual probe station. A new 4 ” brass chuck was machined to include cooling channels, wafer vacuum, and a thermocouple monitoring system. A resistive <b>ring</b> <b>heater</b> was bonded to the chuck and was controlled via a process temperature controller. Extensive electrical test of interconnect structures was necessary to generate EM lifetime data for the alloy film. Multiple measurements on a given type of test structure were used to generate acceptable sample sizes for mean-time-fail (MTF) statistics. Test data for both ASTM and SWEAT structures demonstrated a lognormal distribution for cumulative failure with a decrease in mean fail time for increased test temperatures. The activation energy for Al-Si at RIT was approximately 0. 5 eV for 2. 7 μm lines of both types of test structures. A test station and methodology are now in place for future EM lifetime studies to be completed at RIT...|$|E
