5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions.

California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's <b>ruling</b> was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E

50|$|Rabbi Binyamin Lau {{disagrees with}} both of the {{preceding}} interpretations. According to Lau, Yosef claims that all Sephardic Jews accepted the <b>rulings</b> of Karo as binding in the Diaspora, but over time deviated from them. Presently, upon their return to the Land of Israel where Karo is the Mara D'atra, they should return to adhering to his <b>rulings.</b> Thus, Lau believes that Yosef directs his <b>rulings</b> only at Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, since the Ashkenazi Jews never accepted upon themselves the <b>rulings</b> of Karo. Lau views Yosef as operating on two fronts: the first against the Ashkenzi leadership which seeks to apply Ashkenazi <b>rulings</b> and customs to the Sephardim, and the second against the Sephardic and Mizrahi communities themselves, in demanding that they unite under the <b>rulings</b> of Karo.|$|R

40|$|The {{language}} of the Internal Revenue Code is subject to continuous interpretation by courts and administrators. On a seemingly daily basis, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issue departmental positions on selected statutory provisions. Treasury pronouncements most commonly {{take the form of}} regulations and revenue <b>rulings.</b> Regulations are issued in accordance with formal publication, notice, and comment procedures dictated by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Revenue <b>rulings,</b> however, emerge through a process that takes place solely within agency confines. Free from the burden of formal issuance procedures, the IRS may promulgate revenue <b>rulings</b> frequently and expeditiously. These pronouncements {{play a vital role in}} statutory administration by providing uniform guidelines for administrative enforcement and voluntary public compliance. Courts have traditionally accorded less consideration to revenue <b>rulings</b> than to regulations construing statutory ambiguities. Although courts have repeatedly stated that revenue <b>rulings</b> do not have the force and effect of Treasury regulations, the legal status of revenue <b>rulings</b> has not been characterized with consistency. Most courts have regarded revenue <b>rulings</b> as representing merely the opinion of one party to litigation, deserving no special treatment.
