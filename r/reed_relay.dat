50|$|For {{high-speed}} use, the mercury-wetted relay is used instead. This {{combines the}} speed of a low-mass relay, together with the fast wetting of mercury contacts. A relay, usually a <b>reed</b> <b>relay,</b> has its contacts coated with a small quantity of mercury. This gives the low bounce advantage of mercury, although the current capacity is still limited to broadly that of the original <b>reed</b> <b>relay.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{few million}} <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> were used from the 1930s to the 1960s for memory {{functions}} in Bell System electromechanical telephone exchanges. Often a multiple-reed relay was used, {{with one of}} the <b>reeds</b> latching the <b>relay,</b> and the other or others performing logic or memory functions. Most <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> in the crossbar switching systems of the 1940s through the 1970s were packaged in groups of five. Such a [...] "reed pack" [...] was able to store one decimal digit, encoded in a two-out-of-five code (74210 variant) for easy validity checking by wire spring relay logic.|$|R

50|$|A mercury-wetted <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> {{is a form}} of <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> {{in which}} the {{contacts}} are wetted with mercury. Such relays are used to switch low-voltage signals (one volt or less) where the mercury reduces the contact resistance and associated voltage drop, for low-current signals where surface contamination may make for a poor contact, or for high-speed applications where the mercury eliminates contact bounce. Mercury wetted relays are position-sensitive and must be mounted vertically to work properly. Because of the toxicity and expense of liquid mercury, these relays are now rarely used.|$|E
50|$|A mercury-wetted relay {{is a form}} of relay, {{usually a}} <b>reed</b> <b>relay,</b> in which the {{contacts}} are wetted with mercury. These are not considered contactors because they are not intended for currents above 15 amps.|$|E
50|$|As {{the moving}} parts are small and lightweight, <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> can switch much faster than relays with armatures.They are {{mechanically}} simple, making for reliability and long life.|$|R
50|$|The {{manager at}} AEI (W G Patterson) decided that reed-electronic space-division {{switching}} {{was the way}} to go, and it was then that the term 'TXE'(Telephone eXchange Electronic) was coined, even although the <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> themselves were not regarded as electronic components.|$|R
50|$|Reed arrays {{passed out}} of use in the mid-1990s, being {{unnecessary}} in true electronic (digital) telephone systems such as DMS-100 and 5ESS switch. <b>Reed</b> <b>relays</b> have continued in their uses outside the telephone industry such as for automatic test equipment and electronic instrumentation due to their hermetic seal, fast operate time, extended life to 109 operations and highly consistent contact performance. <b>Reed</b> <b>relays</b> have also found numerous applications in RF and microwave switching applications. They are also used in applications which make use of their extremely low leakage current (in the order of femtoamperes) such as photomultiplier detectors and other extremely low current handling circuits. Reed switches can also be manufactured to withstand several kilovolts and are still used as high-voltage relays in place of more costly sulfur hexafluoride or vacuum relays.|$|R
50|$|Most wire spring relays have a {{permalloy}} core, {{and require}} continuous {{power to maintain}} state. Some have a steel core, making them magnetically latching relays, similar to the ferreed and remreed types of <b>reed</b> <b>relay.</b>|$|E
50|$|Reed relays {{are smaller}} and cheaper, thus {{better suited to}} data storage. They were used in {{conjunction}} with wire spring relays, for example to store digits for sending to other crossbar switching offices. In a multi-frequency sender (the part of a switch which sends routing information about outgoing calls over trunk lines), for example, wire spring relays direct the dialed digits one at a time from <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> packs to frequency generators, under sequential control of logic implemented with wire spring relays. At the other end, similar relays steered the incoming digits from the tone decoder to a <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> memory. In such uses two-out-of-five codes and similar schemes checked for errors at both ends.|$|E
50|$|A <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> is a {{reed switch}} {{enclosed}} in a solenoid. The switch has {{a set of}} contacts inside an evacuated or inert gas-filled glass tube which protects the contacts against atmospheric corrosion; the contacts are made of magnetic material that makes them move {{under the influence of}} the field of the enclosing solenoid or an external magnet.|$|E
50|$|The {{exchange}} {{went into}} service in 1968 and proved reasonably reliable, {{although it did}} have a few outages. Most of these were caused in the common control area. The common control equipment was divided into functional units, and each unit was duplicated, an A side and a B side, and each section was isolated by means of <b>reed</b> <b>relays.</b> Under either fault conditions or manual control or the predetermined time, the unit indicated would change over to its partner. The changeover of the relays was controlled {{by a series of}} <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> whose <b>reed</b> inserts were wetted with mercury. Periodically over some weeks, the mercury would migrate to the point of contact of the blades, leaving a mercuric bead giving “ON” and both A and B sides into service. The confusion generated caused the exchange to be isolated.|$|R
50|$|Some early {{computers}} used ordinary relays {{as a kind}} of latch—they store bits {{in ordinary}} wire spring <b>relays</b> or <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> by feeding an output wire back as an input, resulting in a feedback loop or sequential circuit. Such an electrically latching relay requires continuous power to maintain state, unlike magnetically latching relays or mechanically racheting relays.|$|R
5000|$|The 029's logic {{consisted}} of wire contact relays on later models and <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> and diodes on SMS cards for early ones. The more [...] "advanced" [...] <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> used at first {{proved to be}} less reliable than expected, causing IBM to revert to the older-style wire-contact relay-based design. All ran on 48 volts DC, and did not require the vacuum tubes {{that were used in}} the 024/026. A common additional feature made available (at additional cost) was the leading zeros feature (termed [...] "Left-Zero"). This was delivered by an additional set of four SMS cards. The field was programmed for leading zeros using the program card. If it was (say) a six digit field, the operator only had to key in the actual value (for example 73). The feature would then fill the field by punching the leading four zeros, followed by the 73, in effect right justifying the field, thus: 000073.|$|R
50|$|Bell System {{installations}} typically had alarm bells, gongs, or chimes {{to announce}} alarms {{calling attention to}} a failed switch element. A trouble reporting card system was connected to switch common control elements.

5000|$|Northern Electric {{introduced}} its first {{electronic central office}} system in 1969 with the SP1. The SP1 had a fully computer-based electronic control system, thus the name [...] "SP," [...] short for [...] "stored program." [...] Its switching matrix was still electromechanical. Rather than the <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> matrix of the 1ESS, it used the minibar, {{a version of the}} crossbar switch.|$|E
50|$|The PRX205 (PRX/A) is a {{processor}} controlled <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> telephone exchange developed by Philips Telecommunicatie Industrie BV (PTI) in Hilversum {{during the late}} 1960s and early 1970s. The first public switch was installed in Overvecht in Utrecht in 1972. About half of all sales were in the Netherlands. The last PRX switch {{was taken out of}} service on 7 December 2010 at Volendam in the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>relays</b> {{can switch}} faster than larger relays and require {{very little power}} from the control circuit. However, they have {{relatively}} low switching current and voltage ratings. Though rare, the reeds can become magnetized over time, which makes them stick 'on' even when no current is present; changing {{the orientation of the}} reeds with respect to the solenoid's magnetic field can resolve this problem.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{considerations}} {{involved in the}} correct selection of a control relay for a particular application. These considerations include factors such as speed of operation, sensitivity, and hysteresis. Although typical control relays operate in the 5 ms to 20 ms range, relays with switching speeds as fast as 100 us are available. <b>Reed</b> <b>relays</b> which are actuated by low currents and switch fast are suitable for controlling small currents.|$|R
50|$|The {{switching}} was via <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> and multi stage {{like the}} TXE1. The {{difference from the}} TXE1 design was that an extra switching stage called the D switch was added. Thus, a typical path would be ABC Link DCBA. There was much debate about the D switch and whether it was necessary {{and it was an}} idea that Jim Warman had worked hard to avoid, nevertheless it was used to simplify growth problems.|$|R
50|$|The Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS) was {{the first}} {{large-scale}} stored program control (SPC) telephone exchange or electronic switching system in the Bell System. It was manufactured by Western Electric and placed into service in Succasunna, New Jersey, in May 1965. The switching fabric was composed of a <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> matrix controlled by wire spring relays which in turn were controlled by a central processing unit (CPU).|$|E
50|$|The next {{system uses}} a {{powerful}} electromagnet in the tram and a <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> inlaid between the tracks {{to initiate the}} blade turning mechanism. The driver has a separate switch to control the magnet, thus switching is no longer dependent on power draw of the tram simplifying the procedure somewhat. Turning the switchblades always requires a magnetic field on the relay and its polarity dictates the direction. No magnetic field when passing the relay means retain the blades in whatever the position they were.|$|E
50|$|The PBX had the {{important}} feature {{that someone who}} received a call in error could jiggle the switchhook, causing a light to flash to recall the operator to connect the caller to the desired extension. The feature was implemented in Centrex with a timing circuit to detect this hook flash {{and set up a}} three way connection among outside party, inside party and operator. For this purpose the incoming trunk also needed its own data storage in the form of <b>reed</b> <b>relay</b> packs to store the identity of the connected line.|$|E
50|$|These {{systems were}} widely used until the 1960s, when the {{increasing}} use of solid state systems greatly simplified radio control. The electromechanical systems using <b>reed</b> <b>relays</b> were replaced by similar electronic ones, and the continued miniaturization of electronics allowed more signals, referred to as control channels, to be packed into the same package. While early control systems might have two or three channels using amplitude modulation, modern systems include 20 or more using frequency modulation.|$|R
25|$|A {{reed switch}} is an {{electrical}} switch {{consisting of two}} ferromagnetic and specially shaped contact blades (reeds) positioned in a hermetically sealed glass tube with a gap between them and in a protective atmosphere. Operated by an applied magnetic field, reed switches are used as <b>reed</b> <b>relays,</b> automotive sensors, robotics sensors, security sensors and are found in many toys and games. The reed switch was invented in 1936 by W. B. Elwood at Bell Telephone Laboratories.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{clock is}} described, which operates <b>reed</b> <b>relays,</b> microswitches, silicon controlled rectifiers, and Schmitt trigger circuits to provide output pulses at intervals ranging from 1 second to 24 hours. All outputs are gated {{back to the}} 1 -second timing pulses and therefore have the same basic accuracy. The mechanical accuracy is better than 10. 1 second; long-term accuracy is dependant entirely upon {{the accuracy of the}} ac power source for the drive motor.
