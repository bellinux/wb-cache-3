40|$|Controlled and {{reproducible}} doping {{is essential}} for nanowires (NWs) to realize their functions. However, for the widely used self-catalyzed vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth mode, the doping mechanism is far from clear, as {{the participation of the}} nanoscale liquid phase makes the doping environment highly complex and significantly {{different from that of the}} thin film growth. Here, the doping mechanism of self-catalyzed NWs and the influence of self-catalytic droplets on the doping process are systematically studied using beryllium (Be) doped GaAs NWs.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{resonance}} of Raman scattering by Si local vibrational modes (LVM's) in heavily doped GaAs prepared by ion implantation and rapid thermal annealing. For photon energies (1. 9 - 2. 7 eV) approaching the E 1 energy gap, similar resonance behavior was found for scattering by the Si on As site (Si sub As) LVM and by the longitudinal-optical phonon. Compared with undoped GaAs, both resonances are reduced in peak height and are broadened. This can be understood {{on the basis of}} a lowering and broadening of the (E 1,E 1 +Delta 1) gap resonance due to residual implantation damage and due to the high dopant concentration. Scattering by the Si <b>on</b> <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> (Si sub <b>Ga)</b> LVM, in contrast, shows no resonance enhancement for the above range of photon energies. However, excitation at 3. 00 eV, which is almost in resonance with the E 1 gap energy, also enhances scattering by the Si sub Ga LVM, indicating a rather narrow E 1 gap resonance for that LVM.

Stable ferrimagnetic martensite is found for systems with 0 (5) at% Co and a c=a ratio of 1. 31 (1. 28), respectively, leading to a strong competition of ferro- and antiferro-magnetic exchange interactions between nearest neighbor Mn atoms. The Monte Carlo simulations with ab initio exchange coupling constants as input parameters allow one to discuss the behavior at finite temperatures and to determine magnetic transition temperatures. The Curie temperature of austenite is found to increase with Co, while the Curie temperature of martensite decreases with increasing Co content. This behavior {{can be attributed to the}} stronger Co-Mn, Mn-Mn and Mn-Ni exchange coupling constants in austenite compared to the corresponding ones in martensite. The crossover from a direct to inverse magnetocaloric effect in Ni-Mn-Ga due to the substitution of Ni by Co leads to the appearance of a “paramagnetic gap” in the martensitic phase. Doping with In increases the magnetic jump at the martensitic transition temperature.

The lower symmetry should be detectable experimentally in cubic GaN with low Mn concentration, and should be affected by charge compensation (reductions of holes and conversion of Mn ions to d$^ 5 $ with no Jahn-Teller effect). Jahn-Teller effect is greatly reduced because the symmetry at each Mn site is lowered due to the Mn-Mn interaction.

For x equal or smaller than 0. 10 this shift is clearly higher than expected from a linear interpolation between the measured values in the binaries. The comparison between the Si subGa peak frequency measured in both a full strained layer and a relaxed layer with similar composition provides a rough determination of the deformation potentials for the Si subGa LVM in these layers: q/w high 2 /subLVM = - 2. 7 plus/minus 1 and p/w high 2 /subLVM = - 2. 5 plus/minus 1. As the In content becomes higher {{the width of the}} Si subGa peak increases much more than that of the GaAs-like longitudinal optical-phonon peak, revealing the splitting due to the loss of local symmetry introduced by the In.

The analysis of the integrated intensity of the LVM Raman peaks indicates that the degree of electrical compensation is clearly reduced for increasing In up to x equal or smaller than 0. 5, due to both an increase of the solubility limit for Si in these layers and a saturation or slight reduction of the Si subAs-related defect concentrations.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of extrinsic defects in semiconductors by ion implantation and appropriate annealing {{gives rise to}} instabilities that profoundly affect their electronic and optical properties. Consequently, the knowledge of site location and hence the chemical nature of these defects is vital for the understanding of new properties in doped compound semiconductors. These properties are important for possible applications in optoelectronic and high-frequency devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes, and monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and high power field effect transistors (FETs) for satellite and terrestrial communication. Mössbauer studies to investigate site location and nature of Fe complexes formed in GaAs and GaP single crystals following 57 Mn* implantation at temperatures 77 – 700 K were carried out at the ISOLDE facility, CERN, Switzerland. The set of temperature dependent spectra for each sample was analyzed with a simultaneous fitting routine. Best fits to the data required four components, an asymmetric doublet due to radiation damage attributed to Fe atoms in small amorphous pockets, two single lines, one assigned to Fe <b>on</b> substitutional <b>Ga</b> <b>sites</b> {{and the other to}} Fe in interstitial sites, and a low intensity symmetric doublet assigned to impurity-vacancy complexes. The isomer shift and quadrupole splitting values show the trivalent state of iron (57 Fe 3 +), with a 3 d 5 electronic configuration, <b>on</b> substitutional <b>Ga</b> <b>sites</b> in cubic environments and, near 3 d 5 and 3 d 6 electronic configurations in distorted environments and interstitial sites, respectively. The impurity-vacancy complex is tentatively assigned to 3 d 5 configuration because of its complex nature. The observed variations in the hyperfine parameters of the damage site in GaAs and GaP at temperatures above 400 K {{can be attributed to the}} changes in environment in the neighborhood of the Mössbauer atom and possibly in the Fe-defect bonding mechanism. Different annealing stages of the radiation damage in the two substrates were evident, with more pronounced healing observed in GaAs (350 – 550 K) as compared to GaP (465 – 600 K). This is attributed to Fe forming stronger bonds with P than As. This observation is further supported by the higher Debye temperatures that were extracted for the different components in GaP relative to GaAs. In the III-V semiconductors, Fe atoms on substitutional III sites are known to be deep acceptors and to have a tendency to interfere mainly with the optical functionality of the semiconductors.

Fortunately, annealing at 350 °C for 10 min. can largely restore the device performance, although not without some adverse effects. Point defects, or simple point defect complexes, can also exist in as-grown GaAs and affect devices in several different ways. For example, an As-rich stoichiometry can lead to an abundance of Ga vacancies, and thus to a higher Si donor activation in implanted MESFET devices; however, it can also promote an increase in unwanted impurities which sit <b>on</b> the <b>Ga</b> <b>site.</b> As another example, extremely high (3 ̆e 3 × 1019 cm− 3) concentrations of As antisites, which are found in MBE GaAs grown at 200 °C, lead to very unusual electrical and optical properties, and make possible a highly useful buffer material and a very fast photoconductive switch. However, there are also adverse effects here, such as slow-transients in some MODFET devices, which may result from defect diffusion. Thus, the effects of point defects in GaAs devices must be understood...|$|R

Full-scale in-mine were conducted at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Experimental Mine to determine the flow characteristics, stability and fire-suppression capability of gas-enhanced foam. The in-mine experimental work was designed to evaluate movement of gas-enhanced foam through mine workings closely simulating an underground coal mine environment and how long gas-enhanced foam would remain stable.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{substitution}} of Mn by Cu on the compound Ni 2 Mn 1 -xCuxGa 0. 9 Al 0. 1, showing that the substitution of a small amount of Al <b>on</b> the <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> does not affect the magnetic and magnetocaloric potential compared to Ni- 2 (Mn,Cu) Ga alloy. The samples were prepared with 10 % substitution of Al and with Cu concentrations of x = 0. 0, 0. 2, and 0. 3. Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature performed from 10 to 400 K, with an applied field of 0. 02 T showed a ferromagnetic state, with critical temperature T-c = 295 and 300 K for the samples with Cu, x = 0. 2 and 0. 3, respectively. For the sample without Cu, a complex behavior is observed at T-c = 370 K, with martensitic transition at 220 K and a premartensitic at 250 K. Analysis of x-rays diffractograms at room temperature show a L 2 (1) structure for x = 0. 0, while for x = 0. 2 a mixture of L 2 (1) and martensitic is present, and the sample with x = 0. 3 it is in a fully martensitic phase. Heat capacity measurements were performed in order to calculate magnetocaloric effect in the samples. The results indicate that in Ni(Mn,Cu) Ga alloys, a partial substitution of Ga by Al still produce a high refrigerant capacity while reducing the costs of fabrication.

40|$|GaAs {{crystals}} {{have been}} grown by the vertical Bridgman technique {{and have been}} analysed by various methods, particularly by near infrared microscopy. The main objective of the present work was to study defect zones which form in doped GaAs around dislocations {{as a result of}} reactions between impurities and dislocations. A new model for the formation of defect zones is proposed and experimental results are presented which provide strong evidence for the defect model. For this purpose crystals were doped with different impurities and the zone formation was also studied for different stoichiometric conditions. The new defect model assumes that impurities occupying the As sublattice exchange their substitutional position with As interstitials. This process provides fast diffusing interstitial impurities which can be gettered (probably by forming precipitates) at the dislocation. As a result a diluted defect zone is generated around dislocations. The zone becomes visible by NIR phase contrast through the change of the refractive index in the zone. This change in turn is due to the variation of the free carrier concentration which is proportional to the impurity concentration. According to our model we expect only those impurities to contribute to the formation of the defect zone which occupy As lattice sites (e. g. B_A_s, Si_A_s, Ge_A_s, S_A_s, Se_A_s, Te_A_s) but not those <b>on</b> <b>Ga</b> lattice <b>sites</b> (Zn_G_a, Sn_G_a, Si_G_a, Ge_G_a). This is confirmed by the experimental results 100 refs.

40|$|The {{impact of}} electronically-active native point defects on ZnO {{optoelectronic}} technologies at the nanoscale {{is only now}} being explored.

We clearly identify the optical transitions and energies of VZn and VZn clusters, <b>Ga</b> <b>on</b> Zn <b>site</b> donors, Li on Zn sites, the effects of different annealing methods on their spatial distributions in ion-implanted as well as Ga grown-in ZnO, and how VZn, VZn clusters, and VO complexes contribute to near- and sub-surface carrier density.
