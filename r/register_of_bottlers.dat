The remaining 40% were produced and distributed by independent <b>bottlers</b> (mainly consisting <b>of</b> Dr Pepper/Seven Up premerger regional bottlers) and the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group. Currently, the majority of Pepsi and Coke bottlers bottling Dr Pepper are owned by PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company after their buyouts <b>of</b> their major <b>bottlers.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the supply chain organization of Appellation of Origin wines, identify the typologies of economic agents and characterize their strategic behaviour, in order to identify the link between product range choices, procurement strategies and typologies of vertical relationship along the production, processing and bottling stages. The aim is to identify the possible strategic options for the valorization of Appellations of Origin on the final market. We first provide a descriptive analysis of the wine bottling stage, by distinguishing bottlers according to the types of vertical relationship with upstream production and processing stages. Afterwards, we describe bottlers’ structural characteristics and strategic decisions concerning product range and procurement strategies. Then, a cluster analysis is conducted, in order to identify typologies <b>of</b> <b>bottlers,</b> according to structural and organizational characteristics and strategic decision. On the basis of the clusters identified, a description of the possible strategic options for the valorization of Appellations of Origin is then provided. ...|$|R
