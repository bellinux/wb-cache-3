40|$|This thesis adopts an {{occupational}} health psychology approach toÃ‚Â· investigate work stress {{in a sample}} of U. K. bus drivers in several depots; Three studies were formulated and conducted. Study 1 (N = 24), based on five focus groups - to examine work stressors drawing upon the experiences of bus drivers. Stressors related to, inter alia, hindrance to the <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> and arrangement of shifts. The information, supplemented by a literature review, was used to develop ajob-specific stressor instrument. Study 2 (N = 186), centred on a survey of seven depots, used a questionnaire survey consisting of: Karasek's (1985) Job Demands/Control (IDC), Siegrist et aI's (2004) Effort-Reward Imbalance (BRI), social support, psychological and physical ill-health, and the newly developed stressor instrument. Outcome measures included intention to quit, work absence, bus vehicle accident rate, passenger complaints, and smoking/drinking levels. Analyses showed that high demands/low control predicted higher job strain (e. g., ill-health), as did higher effort/lower reward. Workload and fatigue was a major set of sy-essors. The ERI model demonstrated stronger predictive ability of the two stress models. Additionally, buffering effects of control and social support disappeared in high ERI conditions. In the third study (N = 246) of seven depots, a final questionnaire survey was administered, again using the ERI measure, combined with job satisfaction, driver coping behaviours, and bus driver orientation (in terms of safety or <b>running</b> <b>schedule).</b> Results indicated that ERI was related to reduced job satisfaction, more maladaptive driver coping behaviour, and greater driver orientation towards the <b>running</b> <b>schedule.</b> Job satisfaction was found to be important in the ERI - intention to quit relationship, and overcommitment - work absence/intention to quit relationship. Considered together, these studies provide strong evidence for the need for occupational stress to be managed. Stress research contributions, methodological limitations, and recommendations for industry are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

30|$|A bus non-on-time query {{provides}} {{statistics on}} the non-on-time arrivals of buses that happened under given conditions. Bus non-on-time queries are useful for the bus route design, online information systems on bus transportation, and the bus <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> optimization. In general, the non-on-time events {{can be divided into}} the early case (the arrival time is ahead of the scheduled time) and the delaying case (the arrival time is later than the scheduled time). Please note that the main concern of bus non-on-time query is the delaying case, since (i) the early case can be easily avoided by slowing or stopping buses in the real-life situation, and (ii) the techniques supporting the query for delaying cases can be used for early cases. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, we just discuss the delaying case hereafter. However, the results generalize to the early case.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{study on}} the damage of a 125 MW steam turbine rotor was carried out {{through a series of}} experiments. The unit was in service from May 1992. After 10 years of operation, the {{integrity}} of the rotor was threatened by material deterioration caused by fatigue and creep damage at certain critical locations. In this study, sophisticated thermoplastic finite element analysis (FEA) was employed to establish the transient strain/stress and temperature fields of the rotor during the experiments. Based on the results of the FEA and damage-evaluating model, the life loss of the rotor was evaluated and the residual service life of the rotor calculated. The study concluded that changing the <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> threatened the safety and reliability of the turbine rotor and would reduce its service life, but five more years of safe operation of the rotor could be guaranteed. Some operational suggestions are also presented in this paper, which help to decrease damage during operation...|$|E

40|$|Parameters of the {{distributed}} {{irrigation water}} management model FRAME are determined by an inverse method using evapotranspiration (ET) rates estimated from the SEBAL remote sensing procedure and in situ measurement of groundwater heads. The model simulates canal and on-farm water management as well as regional groundwater flow. The calibration is achieved in two phases. The data on ET were introduced with the primary intent of improving predictions of ET through better estimated soil hydraulic parameters. During the first phase, soil hydraulic parameters sensitive to ET were optimized. As per the canal <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> in the study area, the daily values of ET data were synthesized into 16 time periods with 15 periods each of 24 days and one period of 5 days. Use of cumulative (annual basis) ET data results in better estimates of soil hydraulic parameters as compared to temporal (24 -day period basis) ET data due to possible errors in other input data. During {{the second phase of}} calibration, aquifer drainable porosity and maximum allowable groundwater extraction were optimized against groundwater heads for five years. The calibration was very successful in about 70 % of the study area with a coefficient of correlation between simulated and observed groundwater levels of more than 80 %. Subsequently the model is validated against groundwater heads for nine years...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{fitness is}} {{associated}} with good health. A recent study by Blair, et aU found that a good fitness level prospectively predicted lower mortal-ity for cancer and heart disease. Physicians, like laypersons, often assume good health in those who exercise regularly. Although physicians ex-pect to find sports injuries in physically active individuals, they can overlook signs or symptoms that indicate systemic disease. Runners, for exam-ple, often develop injuries of the hips and lower extremities. Clement, et al. 2 found that 96 percent of running injurjes involved these areas and that most injuries occurred from overuse. Most lower extremity overuse injuries should cause character-istic physical findings and improve with appro-priate treatment. A runner who develops diffuse swelling of a lower extremity warrants examina-tion for systemic illness unless a specific sports injury can be identified. Case Report A 58 -year-old male marathon runner who had been running 5 to 10 miles each day began to have left leg swelling and tightness after exercise. There was no associated pain, and he continued his <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> and weight-training regi-men for 2 weeks before consulting his primary care physician. At that time, the patient recalled no changes in training to suggest overuse, no traumatic injury, and no recent illness or general-ized systemic symptoms. His physician tentatively diagnosed "muscle strain " and aspirin therapy was started. During the next 2 weeks, his leg tightness and swelling gradually increased, occurred with-out running, and eventually involved the thigh and entire left lower leg...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper studies a multi-criteria {{optimization}} problem which {{appears in the}} context of booking chemotherapy appointments. The main feature of the model under study is the requirement to book for each patient multiple appointments which should follow a pre-specified multi-day pattern. Each appointment involves several nurse activities which should also follow a pre-specified intra-day pattern. The main objectives are to minimize patients’ waiting times and peaks of nurses’ workload for an outpatient clinic. Our solution approach is based on the concept of a multi-level template schedule which is generated for a set of artificial patients with typical treatment patterns. There are two stages in template generation: the multi-day stage, which fixes appointment dates for all artificial patients, and the intra-day stage, which fixes for each day appointment starting times and patient allocation to nurses. The <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> is created by considering actual patients one by one as they arrive to the clinic. Booking appointments for each new patient is performed by assigning appropriate dates and times of the template schedule following the prescribed multi-day and intra-day patterns. Additional rescheduling procedure is used to re-optimize intra-day schedules on a treatment day or shortly beforehand. The key stages of the scheduling process are modeled as integer linear programs and solved using CPLEX solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case-based scenarios derived from a real clinic and discuss the advantages that the multi-level template can bring...|$|E
