40|$|A {{calculation}} procedure for formulating lauric and palmitic <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> {{has been developed}} based on grouping TAG melting points. This procedure offered more flexibility in choosing the initial fats and oils and eventually gave deeper insight into the existing chemical compositions and better prediction on the physicochemical properties and microstructure of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> The amount of high, medium and low melting TAGs could be adjusted using the given {{calculation procedure}} to obtain the desired functional properties in the <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> Solid <b>fat</b> contents and melting behavior of formulated <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> showed particular patterns with respect to ratio adjustments of the melting TAG groups. These outcomes also suggested that both TAG species and their quantity had a significant influence on the crystallization behavior of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> Palmitic <b>fat</b> <b>blends,</b> in general, were found to exhibit higher SFC values than those of Lauric <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> Instead of the similarity in crystal microstructure, lauric <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> were stabilized at β polymorph while palmitic <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> were stabilized at β’ polymorph...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Fat</b> <b>blends,</b> {{formulated}} by mixing a highly satu-rated fat (palm stearin or fully hydrogenated soybean oil) with a native vegetable oil (soybean oil) in different ratios from 10 : 90 to 75 : 25 (wt%), {{were subjected to}} chemical interesterification reactions on laboratory scale (0. 2 % sodium methoxide catalyst, time = 90 min, temperature = 90 °C). Starting and interesterified blends were investigated for triglyceride composition, solid fat content, free fatty acid content, and trans fatty acid (TFA) levels. Obtained values were compared to those of low- and high-trans commercial food <b>fats.</b> The interesterified <b>blends</b> with 30 – 50 % of hard stock had plasticity curves {{in the range of}} commercial shortenings and stick-type margarines, while interesterified blends with 20 % hard stock were suitable for use in soft tub-type margarines. Confectionery fat basestocks could be pre-pared from interesterified <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> with 40 % palm stearin or 25 % fully hydrogenated soybean oil. TFA levels of interesteri-fied blends were low (0. 1 %) compared to 1. 3 – 12. 1 % in com-mercial food fats. JAOCS 75, 489 – 493 (1998).

40|$|Shortening {{base stock}} was {{prepared}} by blending High Oleic Sunflower Oil/HOSO, Palm Kernel Oil {{and a hard}} fat (hard Palm Stearin or Fully Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil). The ternary blends were adjusted for having the same unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratios. Physicochemical properties of the <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> were then {{compared with those of}} its interesterified blend. Enzymatic interesterification was carried out using sn- 1, 3 specific lipase on its optimum condition. Silver-ion HPLC analysis showed that there was an increment on the degree of unsaturation based on the TAG composition after interesterification. As a result, the process significantly altered <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> properties, namely solid fat content/SFC, crystallization and melting behaviors, and crystal morphology. Interesterification by including HOSO gave the lowest SFC profile whilst its slope was the sharpest. The slopes of SFC profiles of interesterified blends without HOSO were found to be comparable to that of commercial shortening. Crystallization peaks of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> were also changed after interesterification. The peak at higher temperature was diminished, and as replacement, a broad peak at middle temperature was emerged for both interesterified blends with HOSO and without HOSO. The enzymatic interesterification reduced the melting temperature of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> However, the interesterified blends with HOSO gave lower melting temperatures than those of the interesterified blends without HOSO.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{intestinal}} mucosa {{functions as a}} barrier against harmful dietary and microbial antigens. An intact gut barrier forms a prerequisite for protection against infection and allergy. Both allergic and inflammatory mediators (e. g. IL- 4, IFN-gamma) are known to compromise the epithelial barrier integrity by enhancing permeability. Breast milk provides protection against infection and allergy and contains polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). AIM OF THE STUDY: Although PUFA are commonly used in infant formulas their effect on intestinal barrier is still poorly understood. Therefore the effects of distinct PUFA (n- 6 : LA, GLA, DGLA, AA; n- 3 : ALA, EPA, DHA) and a <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> with PUFA composition {{similar to that of}} the human breast milk fat fraction, on barrier integrity were investigated. METHODS: Human intestinal epithelial cells (T 84) were pre-incubated with individual PUFA or a lipase treated <b>fat</b> <b>blend,</b> with or without subsequent IL- 4 exposure. Barrier integrity was evaluated by measuring transepithelial resistance and permeability. Membrane phospholipid composition was determined by capillary gas chromatography. RESULTS: DGLA, AA, EPA, DHA and to a lesser extend GLA enhanced basal TER and strongly reduced IL- 4 mediated permeability, while LA and ALA were ineffective. Furthermore, the lipase treated <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> effectively supported barrier function. PUFA were incorporated in the membrane phospholipid fraction of T 84 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Long chain PUFA DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA were particularly effective in supporting barrier integrity by improving resistance and reducing IL- 4 mediated permeability. <b>Fat</b> <b>blends</b> that release specific PUFA upon digestion in the gastrointestinal tract may support natural resistance...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} effects of free access to <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> {{products}} or their full fat equivalents on fat and energy intake, body weight, plasma lipids and fat-soluble antioxidants concentrations and haemostasis variables. Design: A multicentre open randomised controlled trial in which intervention and control groups were followed in parallel for six months. Volunteers had free access to 44 different foods either in <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> or full fat version, covering between 30 and 40 % of energy intake. The remainder of energy intake was covered by foods bought in regular shops. Setting: Zeist, Wageningen and Maastricht, The Netherlands. Subjects: Two hundred and forty-one non-obese healthy volunteers who had no intention to lose weight. Main outcome measures: Food intake, body weight, plasma lipid, vitamin E, β-carotene, lycopene and fibrinogen concentrations, plasma factor VII clotting activity, and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-I antigen level. Results: One hundred and three volunteers in the full fat group and 117 volunteers in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group completed the study. Energy and fat intake from the free access products was lower in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group, but no difference in energy and fat intake of other products occurred. Body weight, energy-, fat- and vitamin E intake and percentage of energy derived from fat decreased in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group. No other statistical significant intervention effects were observed. Blood lipid concentrations, factor VII activity and plasminogen-inhibitor-activator- 1 level were reduced after consumption of <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products. Conclusions: When subjects without intention to lose weight limit fat intake by switching from ad libitum consumption of full <b>fat</b> products to <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products body weight gain is prevented, and fat and energy intake are reduced. Such a switch may have beneficial effects on biochemical cardiovascular risk factors. We concluded that <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products will help in a population strategy aimed at preventing overweight and obesity, they will also be effective in maintaining a lower body weight after slimming. Ad libitum consumption of <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products will be ineffective for those individuals that want to reduce body weight because they are currently overweight or obese.

In the meantime, the temperatures for isothermal crystallization were selected at 35 % solid fat content (SFC) for each <b>fat</b> <b>blend.</b> During isothermal crystallization at 35 % SFC, the ternary blend containing PS had one broad exothermic peak that reached its peak maximum after 21. 3 min.

Both PS and FHSO influenced the crystallization kinetics of the blends differently. The parameters of crystallization kinetics as calculated by the Foubert model were a (55 and 20 Jg- 1), t-ind (0. 351 and 0. 003 h), K (2. 89 and 42. 61 h- 1) and n (6. 2 and 6. 0), for blends containing PS and FHSO respectively.
