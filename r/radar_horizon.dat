[...] Illustrious completed launching Fulmar and Swordfish patrol aircraft as the attack developed. Illustrious was the main target and was enveloped in waterspouts and mist of exploding bombs. Some bombers diving from an altitude of 12,000 feet delayed bomb release until they pulled-out lower than the height of Illustrious funnel. The five air patrol Fulmars had not returned from chasing the SM.79s which attacked Valiant and the four recently launched Fulmars were unable to gain altitude rapidly enough {{to break up the}} attack.

A bomb striking a lowered elevator caused extensive hangar damage, with many casualties among aircraft maintenance personnel and destroyed nine Swordfish and five Fulmars. At 1530 Illustrious headed for Malta steering with engines. The bombing attacks continued. Seven SM.79s were discouraged by heavy anti-aircraft fire but an attack by six Italian Ju87s at 1600 scored another bomb hit and two near misses.

40|$|Within the {{percolation}} {{and soaked}} facies of the Greenland ice sheet, {{the relationship between}} radar-derived internal reflection horizons and the layered structure of the firn column is unclear. We conducted two small-scale ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys in conjunction with 10 m firn cores that we collected within the percolation and soaked facies of the Greenland ice sheet. The two surveys were separated by a distance of ∼ 50 km and ∼ 340 m of elevation leading to ∼ 40 days of difference in the duration of average annual melt. At the higher site (∼ 1997 m a. s. l.), which receives less melt, we found that internal reflection horizons identified in GPR data were largely laterally continuous over the grid; however, stratigraphic layers identified in cores could not be traced between cores over any distance from 1. 5 to 14. 0 m. Thus, we found no correlation between firn core stratigraphy observed directly and radar-derived internal reflection horizons. At the lower site (∼ 1660 m a. s. l.), which receives more melt, we found massive ice layers 3 ̆e 0. 5 m thick and stratigraphic boundaries that span 3 ̆e 15 m horizontally. Some ice layers and stratigraphic boundaries correlate well with internal reflection horizons that are laterally continuous over {{the area of the}} radar grid. Internal reflection horizons identified at ∼ 1997 m a. s. l. are likely annual isochrones, but the reflection horizons identified at ∼ 1660 m a. s. l. are likely multi-annual features. We find that mapping accumulation rates over long distances by tying core stratigraphy to <b>radar</b> <b>horizons</b> may lead to ambiguous results because: (1) there is no stratigraphic correlation between firn cores at the 1997 m location; and (2) the reflection horizons at the 1660 m location are multi-annual features...|$|R

40|$|Phase-sensitive radar (pRES) {{has become}} one of the mostly used tools to {{determine}} basal melt rates as well as vertical strain in ice sheets. Whereas most applications are performed on ice shelves, only few experiments were conducted on thick ice in Greenland or Antarctica. The technical constrains on an ice shelf to deduce basal melt rates are less demanding than on inland ice of more than 2 km thickness. First, the ice itself is usually only several 100 s of meters thick; and, second, the reflection coefficient at the basal interface between sea water and ice is the second strongest one possible. Although the presence of marine ice with higher conductivities might increase attenuation in the lower parts, most experiments on shelves were successful. To transfer this technology to inland regions, either for the investigation of basal melt rates of subglacial hydro- logical networks or for determining vertical strain rates in basal regions, a reliable estimate of the current system performance is necessary. To this end we conducted an experiment at and in the vicinity of the EPICA deep ice core drill site EDML in Dron- ning Maud Land, Antarctica. That site has been explored in extraordinary detail with different geophysical methods and provides an already well-studied ice core and borehole, in particular with respect to physical properties like crystal orientation fabric, dielectric properties and matching of internal <b>radar</b> <b>horizons</b> with conductivity signals. We present data from a commercially available pRES system initially recorded in January 2015 and repeated mea- surements in January 2016. The pRES data are matched to existing and already depth-calibrated airborne radar data. Apart from identifying prominent internal layers, e. g. the one originating from the deposits of the Toba erup- tion at around 75 ka, we put special focus on the identification of the basal reflection at multiple polarizations. We discuss the potential uncertainty estimates and requirements to unambiguously identify the basal melt rate on thick grounded ice in Antarctica...|$|R

The internal structure at ice domes often indicates upwarping internal layers in radar surveys (Raymond bumps). The crystal orientation fabric (COF) at larger depths at ice domes is probably highly anisotropic and the associated changes in the impedance contrast should be detectable with seismic methods.

40|$|Abstract:We {{will present}} {{preliminary}} results from geophysical and glaciological measurements on Potsdam Glacier, {{south of the}} Schirmacher Oasis, Central Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. The data were retrieved during the Antarctic summer season 2003 / 2004 and consist of ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys as well as shallow firn cores and snow pits. The GPR surveys were carried out using a central frequency of 500 MHz on the main flow line of Potsdam Glacier and perpendicular to that line. The total length of the GPR profiles was about 100 km, thus covering an area of ca. 400 km 2. Traces were recorded each 0. 5 m and the time window was chosen such that the upper 25 - 30 m of the snow pack could be covered in high resolution. The processed radar data show several internal reflection horizons indicating a change of density (or conductivity) in the subsurface. These horizons were traced throughout the profiles and will be dated {{by the results of}} the firn core analyses. The firn cores were drilled at five locations on the radar profile lines, each core being 12 - 13 m in length. At the same locations snow pits were digged with a depth of 2 m and a sampling interval of 5 cm, giving 40 snow samples per pit. On the firn cores dielectric profiling measurements were carried out in the laboratory to determine the real part of the dielectric permittivity and the conductivity. Furthermore the density was measured as well as the content of oxygen isotope, &# 948; 18 O. From the snow samples density and &# 948; 18 O were determined as well. Combining the geophysical and glaciologicaldata sets gives information about the accumulation pattern and internal structures in the upper snowpack. From the firn core data models were derived giving an estimation of the distribution of the radar velocity with depth. Using these models the radar data can be converted from traveltime- to depth-sections so the depths of the different horizons are known. Furthermore mass-depth relations were established yielding information about tht cumulative snow mass for the respective radar detected layers. &# 916; 18 O-peaks in the firn core data indicating summer times help to derive annual cycles covered by the firn cores. Comparing the depths of the <b>radar</b> <b>horizons</b> with the dated firn cores allows dating of the horizons. From the cumulative snow mass of the different reflection horizons and their respective ages the mean accumulation along the radar survey lines can be estimated. So the combination of geophysical and glaciological studies provides a powerfull tool for the determination of the accumulation pattern. On Potsdam Glacier the data indicate a high spatial variability of accumulation rate along the main flow line...|$|R
