An enhanced DQRUMA/MC-CDMA protocol using minislots for <b>request</b> accesses is proposed to reduce <b>request</b> collisions. In the proposed protocol, <b>request</b> attempts are transmitted concurrently with data packets of other calls. A random scheme (Scheme I) and a preallocated scheme (Scheme II) are distinguished depending on the methods selecting a <b>request</b> code and a <b>request</b> minislot based on a lattice pool for <b>request</b> accesses (LPRA). Both schemes yield low <b>request</b> access delay due to few or no collisions during <b>request</b> accesses. In Scheme I one of <b>request</b> minislots is selected with a randomly chosen code, while in Scheme II the minislot and the code uniquely used in <b>request</b> attempts can resolve a code collision problem during <b>request</b> accesses. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated by simulation and its result shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the original DQRUMA/MC-CDMA protocol in terms of average total delay...|$|R
