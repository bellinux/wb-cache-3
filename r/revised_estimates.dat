25|$|The {{orbit of}} each of the planets is {{slightly}} affected by the gravitational influences of the other planets. Discrepancies in the early 1900s between the observed and expected orbits of Uranus and Neptune suggested that there were one or more additional planets beyond Neptune. The search for these led to the discovery of Pluto in February 1930, which was too small to explain the discrepancies. <b>Revised</b> <b>estimates</b> of Neptune's mass from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989 showed that the problem was spurious.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} tagma of the Excubitors and its subdivisions can not be {{determined}} with certainty; as with the other tagmata, scholars are of differing opinions regarding its numerical strength. Drawing on the lists of officers and accounts of Arab geographers Ibn Khurdādhbah and Qudāmah, historian Warren Treadgold suggested an establishment strength of c. 4,000 men, which for the Scholae and the Excubitors rose to c. 6,000 with the division of the regiments in the mid-10th century. Other scholars, most prominently John Haldon, have <b>revised</b> <b>estimates</b> to some 1,000 men for each tagma. For security reasons, both the Scholae and the Excubitors were scattered in garrisons in Thrace and Bithynia rather than being stationed within Constantinople, making it harder for them to be used in mounting a coup.|$|E

25|$|The Service sector {{dominates the}} economy of Maharashtra, {{accounting}} for 61.4% of the value addition and 69.3% {{of the value of}} output in the country. The state's per-capita income is 40% higher than the all-India average. The gross state domestic product (GSDP) at current prices for 2011–12 is estimated at 11,995.48billion and contributes about 14.4% of the GDP. The agriculture and allied activities sector contributes 12.9% to the state's income. Net State Domestic Product (State Income), as per the first <b>revised</b> <b>estimates</b> was 10,827.51billion and Per Capita State Income was 95,339 during 2011–12. The percentage of fiscal deficit to GSDP was 1.7 per cent and debt stock to GSDP was 18.4 per cent during 2012–13, well within Consolidated Fiscal Reform Path stipulated by the Thirteenth Finance Commission. In 2012, Maharashtra reported a revenue surplus of 1524.9million (US$24million), with a total revenue of 1,367,117million (US$22billion) and a spending of 1,365,592.1million (US$22billion). Maharashtra ranks first in FDI equity and percentage share of total FDI inflows is 32.28%. Total FDI inflows into Maharashtra are US$53.48billion. Top countries that invested FDI equity in Maharashtra (from January 2000 to December 2011) were Mauritius (39%), Singapore (10%), United Kingdom (10%), United States (7%) and Netherlands (5%).|$|E
500|$|<b>Revised</b> <b>estimates</b> of {{the radar}} track and the aircraft's {{remaining}} fuel {{led to a}} move of the search [...] north-east of the previous area on 28 March, which was followed by another shift on 4 April. Between 2 and 17 April an {{effort was made to}} detect the underwater locator beacons (ULBs; informally known as [...] "pingers") attached to the aircraft's flight recorders, whose batteries were expected to expire around 7 April. Australian naval cutter ADV Ocean Shield equipped with a towed pinger locator (TPL); China's Haixun 01 equipped with a hand-held hydrophone; and the Royal Navy's HMS Echo equipped with a hull-mounted hydrophone; were utilized in the search. Operators considered it a shot in the dark, when comparing the vast search area with the fact that a TPL could only search up to [...] per day. Between 4–8 April several acoustic detections were made that were close to the frequency and rhythm of the sound emitted by the flight recorders' ULBs; analysis of the acoustic detections determined that, although unlikely, the detections could have come from a damaged ULB. A sonar search of the sea-floor near the detections was carried out between 14 April and 28 May without any sign of Flight 370. In a March 2015 report, it was revealed that the calendar life of the battery for the ULB attached to Flight 370's flight data recorder had expired in December 2012 and may not have been as capable.|$|E
