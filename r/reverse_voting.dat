5000|$|In 1976, an Ancaster Town Council <b>vote</b> <b>reversed</b> {{a long-standing}} {{policy that would}} finally allow Ancaster {{restaurants}} to apply for liquor licenses.

Ancaster's earlier pioneers however experienced an entirely different social environment. Again according to Dick-Lauder writing in 1897, [...] "Ancaster saw plenty of life during the rebellion of 1837, when it was quite a frequent thing for all the inns, five in number, and many of the private houses to be full over night of redcoats passing towards the west".|$|R
