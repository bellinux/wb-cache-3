40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century the term 'privacy' gained new prominence around the world, but in the legal arena it is still a concept in 'disarray'. Enclosing it within legal frameworks seems to be a particularly difficult task in the employment context, where encroachments upon privacy are not only potentially more frequent, but also, and most importantly, qualitatively different from those taking place in other areas of modern society. This book suggests that these problems can only be addressed by the development of a holistic approach to its protection, an approach that addresses the issue of not only contemporary regulation but also the conceptualization, adjudication, and common (public) perception of employees' privacy. The book draws on a comprehensive analysis of the conceptual as well as <b>regulatory</b> <b>convergences</b> and divergences between European, American and Canadian models of privacy protection, to reconsider the conceptual and normative foundations of the contemporary paradigm of employees' privacy and to elucidate the pillars of a holistic approach to the protection of right to privacy in employment. 1.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to map out and {{critically}} discuss the very recent phenomenon of "regulatory convergence" in EU securities regulation. "Regulatory convergence" is a new development in EU governance in financial services and markets regulation following the Financial Services Action Plan 1999 and the Lamfalussy Report of 2001. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>convergence</b> has 2 aspects, i. e. "regulatory" and "convergence". The thesis suggests that the "regulatory" aspect may be looked at in 4 parts, namely the source of regulation, the administration of regulation, the supervision of regulation, and {{the enforcement of the}} regulation. The thesis maps out and critically discusses each area of <b>regulatory</b> <b>convergence</b> in EU securities regulation, and the methodologies employed by policy and law-makers in securing convergence, which include EU legislation, Commission legislation and "soft law" produced by the Committee of European Securities Regulators. In particular, a cybernetic model of analysis is applied to discuss each aspect of regulation, and the methodologies used in securing "convergence". The application of the cybernetic model of analysis to the 4 aspects of <b>regulatory</b> <b>convergence</b> allows the drawing of some conclusions about the prospects of <b>regulatory</b> <b>convergence.</b> The thesis also examines whether and to what extent, there is an EU level regulatory system for EU securities regulation, {{and in the absence of}} such an EU level system for securities regulation, what forces or incentives would induce Member States to adopt divergent national regulation. The final chapter of the thesis explores theoretical frameworks in organisation theory to suggest how creating an EU agency for securities regulation may address the deficits in the current framework for securing <b>regulatory</b> <b>convergence</b> and lead the way forward to a cybernetically sufficient system for <b>regulatory</b> <b>convergence</b> in EU securities regulation...|$|E

Börzel, Freie Universität Berlin Prof. Jacint Jordana, Universitat Pompeu FabraThis thesis {{seeks to}} explain cross-sectoral {{variation}} in convergence with EU rules in countries outside the EU that lack regulatory capacities and democratic development. In contrast to accounts predominant in the Europeanization literature, this study presents {{evidence to suggest}} that regulatory change in non-accession countries is not doomed to failure despite high initial adaptation costs that cannot be mitigated by EU membership conditionality. Making use of qualitative research methods, I analyze variation in convergence with EU rules in Ukraine across four policy sectors (corporate governance, technical regulation, telecommunications and food safety). I find that cross-sectoral variation is a function of different patterns of transnationalization that can be deep, shallow or mixed, depending on the properties and combined effects of interactions between domestic and external actors. In policy sectors where the combined effects of strong economic conditionality, strong market incentives for European and local firms and multiplex capacity building increase the incentives and capacities of domestic public and private actors for <b>regulatory</b> change, <b>convergence</b> with EU rules is likely to reach high levels thanks to deep patterns of transnationalization. My findings have the following implications. 1) Instead of high-powered political incentives (membership conditionality), the EU has down-to-earth economic incentives at its disposal (economic conditionality) to shape regulatory change in non-accession countries. Tying market access to convergence with EU rules in an unambiguous manner is necessary to achieve high levels of convergence beyond the EU’s borders. 2) Analyzing the combined effects of conditionality, markets and capacity building is more fruitful for explaining cross-sectoral variation in convergence with EU rules than isolated analyses of each mechanism. 3) Convergence with EU rules is not just about creating another level of hierarchy in the markets and political systems of target countries. Rather, it is about creating institutions for governance arrangements in which public and private actors coordinate regulatory tasks. Hence, transnational interactions need to increase the incentives and capacities of public and private domestic actors for high levels of convergence. 4) In countries like Ukraine, Russia is not a countervailing hegemon that unfailingly seeks to obstruct convergence with EU rules. Rather, Russia should be conceived of as an adapative hegemon that promotes or obstructs convergence depending on the interests of Russian business...|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{regulatory process}} is global. Markets {{and the problems}} they generate—consumer privacy, chemicals safety, and many others—cross borders and so too do regulatory efforts to address those problems. The process, however, by which national and international jurisdictions decide common regulatory problems defies the traditional mold of hierarchical state law. There is no world government {{with the power to}} impose a single set of principles and procedures on the multiple jurisdictions, and therefore the global regulatory process is characterized as much by diversity and discord as it is by coordination and convergence. The new field of comparative law and regulation is devoted to understanding the global regulatory process. This introductory essay lays the groundwork for the volume and future research in the field by defining the object of study and by identifying three important avenues of theoretical inquiry. Comparative law and regulation covers the law of the regulatory function—legislative and administrative rulemaking, oversight, enforcement, and judicial review—in both domestic and international jurisdictions, and involving both public and private actors. Theoretically, the field tackles three critical features of the global <b>regulatory</b> process—jurisdictional variation, <b>convergence</b> (anddivergence) over time, and legal prescription based on comparison. Jurisdictional variation is best captured by classifications based on paradigms of public law and models of legitimate private involvement in public regulation. The question of whether and how convergence occurs should be studied using causal theories of legal transplants and diffusion. And legal prescription based on comparison, a favorite rhetorical device in the global regulatory process, should be evaluated based on a normatively explicit and empirically sensitive functional method of comparative law research. These conceptual and theoretical tools apply equally to domestic and international jurisdictions...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) {{has emerged}} on the European {{political}} agenda. It {{is an idea}} whose time has come. Both the member states and the institutions of the European Union (EU) are presently investing in programmes for "better regulation" and "good regulatory governance. " RIA is the cornerstone of these programmes. This paper explains how RIA is being diffused in Europe. Is the introduction of RIA in Europe simply the diffusion of an idea, the content of which remains very different in the various national contexts' Or, alternatively, has the diffusion of ideas brought about convergence at the level of how RIA is performed' As shown by Hahn and Litan (2004), European impact assessments are often different from North-American RIAs. This paper shows that the adoption of a common RIA "bottle" has not produced similar European wines. The language of RIA has produced a community of discourse for policy-makers and has stimulated the introduction of some instruments that are similarly labelled "impact assessment. " But RIA practice may exist only on paper, and in some cases the "RIA label" may reveal basic assessments of administrative burdens. The paper explains how ideas can be diffused without convergence of results. The argument here is not the trivial one that context matters, but how it matters. Hence the paper breaks down "context" into four dimensions, that is, institutions, models of the policy process, actors, and legitimacy. Institutional design, the capacity to deal with distributional problems, heterogeneity in multi-level governance systems, policy styles, and the "weights" given to the preferences of different RIA actors explain the lack of <b>convergence.</b> <b>Regulatory</b> Reform...|$|R

I argue that <b>regulatory</b> <b>convergence</b> in EU neighboring countries is more likely if external actors combine the application of policy-specific conditionality, such as access to the European market, with multiplex capacity-building measures that diversify demand among domestic state regulators and firms and empower them to make their claims. regulatory politics; neighbourhood policy...|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 24 February 2014 Examining Board: Professor Marie-Ange Moreau, Lumière University Lyon 2 (Supervisor) Professor Giovanni Sartor, European University Institute Professor Achim Seifert, University of Jena Professor Gilles Trudeau, Université de Montréal. At the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century the term 'privacy' is universally known nevertheless in the legal arena it is still a concept in 'disarray'. Enclosing it within legal frames seems to be a particularly difficult task in the employment context, where the Information Revolution, by altering the nature of work, and as a consequence the character and reach of traditional instruments of employer supervision, has considerably blurred the frontiers between employees' private and professional lives. Nowadays we are facing forms of control and of employee subordination that differ substantially from those that we have known until now. In the light of the above there is a growing need to reconsider the conceptual and normative dimensions of the right to privacy in employment, a context which is frequently ignored by the privacy literature and where the encroachments upon privacy are not only potentially more frequent, but most importantly, are qualitatively different than those taking places in other milieus in modern society. The thesis is centered around a comparative examination of the models of protection of the right to privacy in employment. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the European, American and Canadian frameworks of privacy protection, assesses the need for their further particularization and complementarity with regard to the employment context, and finally, uses the record of the conceptual as well as the <b>regulatory</b> divergences and <b>convergences</b> between the different models to distinguish the conceptual and normative foundations of contemporary employment-specific paradigm of the right to privacy, as well as the pillars of a holistic approach to the protection of employees' right to privacy...|$|R
40|$|The World Trade Organization (“WTO”) and {{bilateral}} investment treaties (“BITs”) {{are among the}} most significant legal developments in the history of international economic law. Never before in the history of international relations has trade and investment been supported by such powerful legal guarantees and adjudicative processes. In less than two decades the WTO and BITs have permanently altered the legal landscape with reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements designed to reduce barriers to trade and investment and eliminate discriminatory treatment in international economic relations. In most respects the worlds of trade and investment are on parallel tracks headed in the same direction. The ends are similar, but the means toward those ends are distinct. The purpose of this essay is to highlight discrete areas where a convergence of the two disciplines is emerging. These points of convergence are limited, but significant. The first point of convergence highlights the mutually reinforcing nature of trade and investment. The guarantees in BITs and the WTO are baseline protections that reflect international minimum standards that nations accord to every other trading partner. Preferential trade agreements with investment chapters promote deep vertical integration and efficient global production lines by minimizing trade costs, maximizing market access, and harmonizing cross-border <b>regulatory</b> standards. The <b>convergence</b> of trade and investment in deep preferential trade agreements {{is a reflection of the}} modern era of globalized chains of supply. The second point of convergence emphasizes the unifying commitment in both trade and investment regimes against discrimination and protectionism. While the WTO focuses on non-discrimination with respect to like products and services, BITs focus on non-discrimination with respect to the regulation of similarly-situated foreign and domestic investors. Despite the textual differences, in no other area of law has WTO jurisprudence influenced the resolution of investment claims more than with respect to BIT national treatment guarantees. The third point of convergence is the trend toward parallel WTO and BIT proceedings, which is only possible through the convergence of substantive norms. Thus far we have seen such parallel proceedings in less than a handful of cases, but the proliferation of BITs and investment arbitration will increase such opportunities. There is an obvious symmetry between the two types of proceedings, with one looking forward and the other looking backward. The fourth point of convergence is the use of trade remedies to enforce investment arbitration awards. Investment arbitration was designed in a manner such that recognition and enforcement of adverse investment awards was presumed. That is not how things have played out, and the Argentina kerfuffle suggests that foreign investors increasingly may pursue trade remedies to secure enforcement of investment arbitration awards. The final point of convergence is relying on investment arbitration to enforce international trade rights. Despite the assumption that international trade disputes must be resolved before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, the existence of broad umbrella clauses in BITs presents an emerging vehicle for enforcing investment commitments in trade agreements...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS 1. One of {{the major}} lessons from the current {{financial}} crisis refers to the systemic dimension of financial risk which had been almost completely neglected by bankers and supervisors in the pre- 2007 years. 2. Accordingly, the most needed change in financial regulation, {{in order to avoid}} a repetition of such a crisis in the future, consists of influencing individual bank behaviour such that systemic risk is decreased. This objective is new and distinct from what Basle II was intended to achieve. 3. It is important, therefore, to evaluate proposed new regulatory instruments on the ground of whether or not they contribute to a reduction, or containment of systemic risk. We see two new regulatory measures of paramount importance: the introduction of a Systemic Risk Charge (SRC), and the implementation of a transparent bank resolution regime. Both measures complement each other, thus both have to be realized to be effective. 4. We propose a Systemic Risk Charge (SRC), a levy capturing the contribution of any individual bank to the overall systemic risk which is distinct from the institution’s own default risk. The SRC is set up such that the more systemic risk a bank contributes, the higher is the cost it has to bear. Therefore, the SRC serves to internalize the cost of systemic risk which, up to now, was borne by the taxpayer. 5. Major details of our SRC refer to the use of debt that may be converted into equity when systemic risk threatens the stability of the banking system. Also, the SRC raises some revenues for government. 6. The SRC has to be compared to several bank levies currently debated. The Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) does not directly address systemic risk and is therefore inferior to a SRC. Nevertheless, a FTT may offer the opportunity to subsidize on-exchange trading at the expense of off-exchange (over-the-counter, OTC) transactions, thereby enhancing financial market stability. The Financial Activity Tax (FAT) is similar to a VAT on financial services. It is the least adequate instrument among all instruments discussed above to limit systemic risk. 7. Bank resolution regime: No instrument to contain systemic risk can be effective unless the restructuring of bank debt, and the ensuing loss given default to creditors, is a real possibility. As the crisis has taught, bank restructuring is very difficult in light of contagion risk between major banks. We therefore need a regulatory procedure that allows winding down banks, even large banks, on short notice. Among other things, the procedure will require to distinguish systemically relevant exposures from those that are irrelevant. Only the former will be saved with government money, and it will then be the task of the supervisor to ensure a sufficient amount of nonsystemically relevant debt on the balance sheet of all banks. 8. Further issues discussed in this policy paper and its appendices refer to the necessity of a global level playing field, or the lack thereof, for these new <b>regulatory</b> measures; the <b>convergence</b> of our SRC proposal with what is expected to be long-term outcome of Basle III discussions; as well as the role of global imbalances...|$|R

Among the core reforms proposed are: 	 	A press standards model that maintains self-regulation, but beefs up the role of the Press Council and clarifies its standing in relation to online as well as print media; 	 	 	The introduction of a Public Interest Test for future media takeovers and mergers, including the creation of a Public Interest Media Advocate (PIMA) to evaluate their implications for media diversity; 	 	 	Updating the ABC and SBS charters to explicitly incorporate their online activities as core to their public service mission; 	 	 	Continuing allocation of the sixth free-to-air channel to community television, or, put differently, a continuing prohibition on a fourth free-to-air commercial TV service; 	 	 	Making permanent the 50 % licence fees rebate for commercial television broadcasters, subject to their meeting new Australian content obligations, particularly on their digital multichannels. 	 Old world thinking This package of measures is hardly the “new policy and <b>regulatory</b> framework” the <b>Convergence</b> Review believed was the necessary response to technological and audience changes rendering the existing legislative framework redundant. Yes, the new policy recommends changes to media ownership, news standards, public broadcasting and Australian and local content that are largely with the convergence review recommendations, but these still largely sit within the established media “silos” of print, broadcasting and online media. More radical proposals, such as setting content standards for Google, or eliminating broadcasting licences altogether, are clearly off the agenda. Legislating the public interest The proposal for a public interest test for media mergers and acquisitions, {{and the creation of a}} Public Interest Media Advocate (PIMA), are the recommendations most consistent with the spirit of the convergence review. The review proposed that a revised media policy framework needed to be “technology-neutral”, avoiding structural biases for or against any particular media platform or service type, while recognising that public interest questions about media ownership concentration or the loss of local content still matter. The PIMA proposal walks the line between establishing more flexible, less prescriptive approaches to regulating media ownership, without fully abandoning controls in the interests of securing media diversity. It draws upon the concept of soft law, whereby legislation establishes a general principle – in this case media diversity – and grants decision makers a degree of autonomy in determining the scope of its application in particular cases. Soft law is seen by many as a necessary response to rapid technological change, where events are moving too quickly for parliaments to be able to regularly update legislation. The politics of change Senator Conroy indicated his personal preference for eliminating what he sees as legacy rules, such as the maximum 75 % audience reach rule for commercial broadcasters. This rule clearly assumes that services such as broadcast news are only accessed through broadcast media, whereas they are clearly now available to 100 % of Australian homes with a reasonably fast internet connection. It is worth remembering that almost no Australian homes had an internet connection when these initial restrictions were passed, let alone access to YouTube and on-demand media services. But the politics of legislating for changes to media laws in a political context where the government lacks a majority in either house, and where an election is six months away can also be seen in the Conroy’s response to the reviews. A modest proposal Rather than presenting a single set of legislative changes to parliament, Conroy has instead opted to unbundle the proposals. This means the licence fee rebate and the changes to the ABC and SBS charters do not hinge on how parliament responds to the PIMA proposal. The former could be passed even if the latter is rejected. What has finally emerged is a compromise set of changes; a very cautious, and in many ways piecemeal, response to the proposals of the Convergence and Finkelstein reviews. It has probably not modernised media laws sufficiently to “tackle the challenges of the future”, although it does make some overdue changes to existing law. Given the lack of community consensus as to what media laws should prioritise, it would have been hard to have advanced further without a clearer mandate for change than the federal government currently possesses. It would appear that a larger overhaul of media policy and regulation to meet the challenges of convergence will need to wait for another occasion.

This article examines the nature and limits of <b>regulatory</b> <b>convergence</b> {{in the field of}} agri-biotechnology and investigates the effects that international forces have on biotechnology and biosafety policies in developing countries. Based on detailed case studies of Mexico, China and South Africa this article shows that these three leading biotechnology countries in the South are exposed to powerful international influences but are responding to the regulatory challenges of genetically modified organisms (GMO) adoption in distinctive ways. The existing regulatory polarization between US and EU biotechnology approaches has not forced a convergence around either of these two international models. GMO policies in the South do not simply follow the binary logic of the US¿EU regulatory conflict. Instead, they integrate elements from both regulatory approaches and are steering a course that suggests substantial regulatory diversity in the South. The globalization of biotechnology thus {{goes hand in hand with}} regulatory diversity in the developing world. Furthermore, regulatory polarization between the EU and US has helped to open up political space in key developing countrie...|$|E
