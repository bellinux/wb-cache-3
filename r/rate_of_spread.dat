5|$|Increased fire {{monitoring}} through {{ground based}} and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed. Fire monitors first {{determine whether a}} fire is human-caused or natural. All human-caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural, while natural fires are monitored. Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels burning {{and the amount of}} fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread,</b> flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.|$|E

These wildland fire engines are traditionally smaller than standard fire apparatus and are primarily used for vegetation fires or wildland fires. They may also respond to emergencies in rough terrain where other vehicles cannot respond. Most wildland engines feature four-wheel drive capability to improve hill climbing and rough terrain capability.

The study comprised experiments that were conducted over 15 ˚and 30 ˚ inclined beds with depths ranging from 13. 3 mm to 39. 9 mm and consisting of average sand particle diameters ranging from 0. 5 mm to 5 mm under quiescent, assisted and opposed airflow conditions. Analysis of the resulting data indicate that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> flame <b>spread</b> is significantly decreased by increasing the bed inclination angle or the airflow velocity and is applicable for both assisted and opposed directions. Furthermore, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> flame <b>spread</b> is decreased to the minimum value and actually ceased halfway along the bed with a 30 ˚ inclination angle. This behaviour was observed mainly for beds containing coarse sand particles.

40|$|Sequential band- 6 {{imagery of}} the Zambesi Basin of {{southern}} Africa recorded substantial changes in burn patterns resulting from late dry season grass fires.

Another example from western Zambia indicates increased fire activity over a 19 -day period. Other examples clearly define the area of widespread grass fires in Angola, Botswana, Rhodesia and Zambia. From the fire patterns visible on the sequential portions of the imagery, and the time intervals involved, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the fires are estimated and compared with estimates derived from experimental burning plots in Zambia and Canada.

40|$|The {{spreading}} response {{induced by}} intradermal administration of hyaluronidase is influenced {{not only by}} enzyme concentration, {{but also by the}} volume and pressure of the injection.

40|$|International audienceAimPalaeoecological reconstructions {{document}} past vegetation change, with {{estimates of}} fast shifts in species distributions. The resulting <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> plant <b>spread</b> {{are often not}} matched by model simulations of climate-driven vegetation dynamics. Genetic surveys of extant plant populations document directions <b>of</b> the post-glacial <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> trees, challenging traditional interpretations. Our aim is to examine an updated continental pollen data set from Europe {{in the light of}} the new ideas about vegetation dynamics emerging from genetic research and vegetation modelling studies. LocationEurope. MethodsWe use pollen data from the European Pollen Database (EPD) to construct interpolated maps of pollen percentages documenting changes in the distribution and abundance of major plant genera and the grass family in Europe over the last 15, 000 years. ResultsOur analyses confirm high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> post-glacial <b>spread</b> with at least 1000 myear(- 1) for Corylus, Ulmus and Alnus and average <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> 400 myear(- 1) for Tilia, Quercus, Fagus and Carpinus. The late Holocene expansions of Picea and Fagus populations in many European regions cannot be explained by migrational lag. Both taxa shift their population centres towards the Atlantic coast suggesting that climate may have played a role in the timing of their expansions. The slowest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> were reconstructed for Abies. Main conclusionsThe calculated <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> post-glacial plant <b>spread</b> are higher in Europe than those from North America, which may be due to more rapid shifts in climate mediated by the Gulf Stream and westerly winds. Late Holocene anthropogenic land use practices in Europe had major effects on individual taxa, which in combination with climate change contributed to shifts in areas of abundance and dominance. The high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> calculated from the European pollen data are consistent with rapid tracking of early Holocene climate change by common tree species, documenting that plants can spread fast tracing their climate space, regardless of their dispersal strategy...|$|R
