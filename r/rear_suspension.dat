5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
5|$|Cornering weave tendencies are {{amplified by}} {{degraded}} damping of the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Cornering, camber stiffnesses and relaxation {{length of the}} rear tire make the largest contribution to weave damping. The same parameters of the front tire have a lesser effect. Rear loading also amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
50|$|Coilover shock {{absorbers}} are usually {{a kind of}} twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring. They are common on motorcycle and scooter <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> and widely used on front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> in cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} shock absorbers {{used on the}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> of motorcycles are {{essentially the same as}} those used in other vehicle applications.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{manufactures}} have produced vehicles or concepts utilizing independent front or <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> supported by transverse leaf springs {{that have an}} anti-roll effect.|$|R
5|$|Several teams {{made major}} {{technical}} updates to their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren and Ferrari altered the brake ducts on their cars, improving the cooling {{to manage the}} high brake temperatures encountered in Montreal. Ferrari and Mercedes revised their <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> layouts, while Red Bull brought a new front wing optimised for a lower downforce level. Renault and Williams brought new rear wings, which were designed specifically for low-downforce circuits such as Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and double wishbone suspension, supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost of}} ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|Conceived as a small, {{economical}} and sporty car, the MR2 employed straightforward design elements, including {{fully independent}} MacPherson strut front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> four wheel disc brakes, and transverse-mounted inline-four engines.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1970s, front {{suspensions}} {{have utilized}} MacPherson struts with control arms; for <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> {{the design of}} choice is a four-link suspension with coil over shock absorbers connected to a fixed rear axle.|$|R
50|$|A widened {{version of}} the E30 front {{suspension}} and the drivetrain from the E30 325i {{were used in the}} BMW Z1 roadster. The BMW Z3 (E36/4) and BMW Compact (E36/5) <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> are also very similar to the E30, but utilizing five-lug hubs. The BMW M Coupe uses a widened {{version of the}} same <b>rear</b> semi-trailing arm <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new underfloor and brought more powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying and the race. Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new engine cover, a titanium gearbox and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> geometry. The team decided to only test the gearbox during the first free practice session.|$|E
5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{as standard}} across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, {{in terms of}} suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E
5|$|To {{address the}} {{relatively}} poor {{reception of the}} preceding AU series, the BA series was heavily updated for launch in September 2002—the same time as its biggest rival, the Holden Commodore (VY). It featured a substantially revised and more conservative exterior styling, with every panel new except for the carry-over door skins. Interiors, too, were substantially revised, while mechanically, a new independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> setup was fitted to all sedan derivatives and the engine and transmissions received extensive upgrades. In October 2004, Ford introduced a Mark II update, bringing subtle styling and mechanical changes, and in October 2005, replaced the BA with the BF.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1998 {{introduction}} of Control Blade suspension and popularization by the Focus, other manufacturers (e.g. Volkswagen with the Golf V) began offering multi-link design <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> in the compact class, or small family car (European) class.|$|R
50|$|Half-shafts: In <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> {{wheel travel}} is {{constrained}} by the universal joints of the half shafts. Design the motion ratio such that at maximum bounce and rebound shocks are the first components that bottom out by hitting bump stops.|$|R
50|$|The Sabres, {{especially}} the V45, were technology showcases for Honda. Not {{only did they}} feature revolutionary water-cooled, DOHC, 90-degree-V four-cylinder engines, but they also featured hydraulically actuated, one-way clutches, TRAC anti-dive front <b>suspension,</b> Pro-link <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> and electronic speedometers and tachometers.|$|R
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Davidson {{missed out}} on the second session of qualifying, putting his Super Aguri in 17th position, 3 places behind his {{teammate}} Sato. Ralf Schumacher and his team were disappointed with qualifying in 18th. Heikki Kovalainen crashed into the wall at turn 5, damaging his <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> and losing his rear wing, resulting in the session being stopped temporarily. Once the debris had been cleared, Kovalainen in his repaired car managed one impressive lap that put him in 13th, after which six drivers outqualified him. Kovalainen then had to make an engine change due to an engine failure and was demoted {{to the back of}} the grid. Wurz, Sutil and Albers qualified in 19th, 20th and 21st respectively after being pushed up a place by Kovalainen's engine change.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Later 'New Series' Moulton {{bicycles}} are {{fitted with}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> systems marketed as 'Hydrolastic'. These are, in essence, miniaturised {{versions of the}} displacers used on Hydrolastic-equipped cars being a rubber cone spring with an internal fluid chamber to provide damping.|$|R
50|$|Front and <b>rear</b> <b>{{suspensions}}</b> {{were made}} by White Power (WP). Front suspensions (also known as forks) allow compression adjustment at the bottom as well as damping adjustments {{at the top of}} the forks. Spring preload can be adjusted by removing the top cap of the forks.|$|R
50|$|Swing axles were supplanted {{in general}} use by De Dion tube axles {{in the late}} 1960s, though live axles {{remained}} the most common. Most <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{have been replaced by}} more modern independent suspensions in recent years, and both swing and deDion types are virtually unused today.|$|R
5|$|Championship leader Michael Schumacher {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Jordan driver Jarno Trulli. The race was aborted {{due to a}} software glitch in the starting procedure and Jenson Button and Pedro de la Rosa collided which started a traffic jam. At the second start, Michael Schumacher maintained his lead into the first corner. After {{the second round of}} pit stops, Michael Schumacher's exhaust broke causing a left <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> failure and his retirement from the race. Coulthard, in second place, became the new race leader on lap 57. Coulthard maintained his lead throughout the remainder of the race and secured his second victory of the season, with Barrichello a further 15.8 seconds back.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Gordon {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner. Reutimann made contact with Johnson, forcing him to collide with the wall and damage his car's suspension on lap two. The first caution of the race was subsequently given. None of the leaders elected to make pit stops during the caution, and Johnson drove to his garage to change his front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Jeff Gordon maintained his lead on the lap eight restart. Kurt Busch passed Jeff Gordon on the low side of the track for the lead position four laps later. After starting twenty-ninth, Robby Gordon had moved up thirteen positions to sixteenth by lap 34. One lap later, Johnson's car was fitted with a new driveshaft.|$|E
5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E

5|$|Prost {{began his}} career with McLaren (being run by Teddy Mayer) in 1980 {{alongside}} Ulsterman John Watson. On his debut in Buenos Aires he finished in sixth place earning one point, something achieved by {{only a handful of}} drivers. Prost added four more points to his tally during the season, scoring points at Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the Canadian round in Montreal a week earlier because of <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday {{practice}} sessions were again held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest {{time of the}} third session, a 1:24.262. The Williams drivers were running quickly—Jenson Button in second and Ralf Schumacher fifth—they were separated by Coulthard and Barrichello in third and fourth. Fisichella recorded the sixth fastest lap time. Villeneuve, Häkkinen, Salo and Johnny Herbert rounded out the top ten. In the final practice session, Michael Schumacher again set the fastest time, a 1:23.904; Barrichello set the third fastest time. They were separated by Häkkinen with teammate Coulthard clinching the fourth fastest time. The Williams drivers continued to run quickly with Ralf Schumacher fifth, ahead of Button in sixth. Fisichella, Zonta, Villeneuve and Irvine (who suffered a <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> failure but regained control of his car) completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Mazzacane again suffered problems with his car when his engine ran out of air pressure {{and was forced to}} stop on the track while Wurz did not record any laps because of a fuel pick-up issue.|$|E
50|$|Journalist David E. Davis, in a 2009 {{article in}} Automobile Magazine, criticized Nader for purportedly {{focusing}} on the Corvair while ignoring other contemporary vehicles with swing-axle <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> including cars from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, notwithstanding the fact that Nader's Center for Auto Safety had published a book critical of the Beetle.|$|R
50|$|Prototypes of {{this class}} have rear wheel drive, Volkswagen-based 2-wheel drive, and most feature a 4130 chrome tube-frame chassis {{covered by a}} fiberglass, {{aluminum}} or other composite body. Single or two-seat vehicles are limited to prototype engines with a link-pin front suspension system with independent front suspension and trailing arm <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions.</b>|$|R
