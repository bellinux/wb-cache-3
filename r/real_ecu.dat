The <b>real</b> <b>ECU</b> hardware is combined with a downsized version of the multi-domain global system model, running in real time. This HiL approach allows engineers to complete upfront system and software troubleshooting to limit the total testing and calibration time and cost on the actual product prototype.|$|E

The empirical {{results indicate that}} most of the variation in relative output is caused by supply shocks while the shocks driving the <b>real</b> <b>ECU</b> exchange rate are mainly non-monetary demand shocks in nature. Therefore, the loss of the exchange rate as a shock absorber will not be great for the UK...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} number of electronic control units (ECUs) are nowadays networked in automotive vehicles to help achieve advanced vehicle control and eliminate bulky electrical wiring. This, however, inevitably leads to increased complexity in vehicle fault diagnostics. Traditional off-board fault diagnostics and repair at service centres, by using only diagnostic trouble codes logged by conventional onboard diagnostics, can become unwieldy especially when dealing with intermittent faults in complex networked electronic systems. This can result in inaccurate and time consuming diagnostics {{due to lack of}} real-time fault information of the interaction among ECUs in the network-wide perspective. This thesis proposes a new framework for on-board knowledge-based diagnostics focusing on network level faults, and presents an implementation of a real-time in-vehicle network diagnostic system, using case-based reasoning. A newly developed fault detection technique and the results from several practical experiments with the diagnostic system using a network simulation tool, a hardware- in-the- loop simulator, a disturbance simulator, simulated <b>ECUs</b> and <b>real</b> <b>ECUs</b> networked on a test rig are also presented. The results show that the new vehicle diagnostics scheme, based on the proposed new framework, can provide more real-time network level diagnostic data, and more detailed and self-explanatory diagnostic outcomes. This new system can provide increased diagnostic capability when compared with conventional diagnostic methods in terms of detecting message communication faults. In particular, the underlying incipient network problems that are ignored by the conventional on-board diagnostics are picked up for thorough fault diagnostics and prognostics which can be carried out by a whole-vehicle fault management system, contributing to the further development of intelligent and fault-tolerant vehicles...|$|R
40|$|In {{automotive}} electronics, complex automotive functionalities {{are managed}} by car's computers such as {{electronic control units}} (ECU). Albeit extremely rare, accidental drop impacts may occur during transportation or mounting ECUs on automobiles, damaging the built-in printed circuit board (PCB) /ball grid array (BGA) package assembly. However, due to larger package dimensions together with heavy components such as capacitors mounted on the board surface, higher acceleration and stress levels can be achieved on ECU electronic components than on hand-held electronic devices during a drop impact. In such cases, the board level drop test methodology defined in the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) standard needs to be modified in order to match the requirements in automotive applications. The experimental setup {{used in this study}} includes a test board clamped between two aluminum frames with the help of screws, in order to reproduce the real clamping condition s of the PCB in an ECU. Furthermore, the new board design allows mounting additional masses {{at the center of the}} PCB to take into account the effect of the mass of electronic components present in <b>real</b> <b>ECUs.</b> In this work, the mechanical behavior of PCB/BGA assemblies used in automotive applications when subjected to drop events is assessed. Numerical simulations of the board behavior are performed in order to analyze the transient structural response of the PCB and evaluate the local stresses on the board/joint interface responsible for pad cratering. By varying the loading conditions, different stress levels can be achieved on the PCB laminate directly under the solder joints and a stress-life curve for predicting the assembly lifetime is hence established...|$|R

40|$|The modern Engine Control Unit (or ECU) {{has become}} a complex and {{powerful}} electronic device, being able to manage all fundamental aspects of passenger cars. A typical ECU is characterized by computational activities that are periodic or triggered by {{the rotation of the}} crankshaft, thus generating a workload variable with the engine speed. To prevent overloads, a common practice with angular tasks is having a certain number of operational modes implemented, with different computational cost, that are activated at different speed intervals: for that reason they are also referred as Adaptive Variable Rate (AVR) tasks. Understanding how different choices of switching speeds and computational loads influence the behaviour of the engine is fundamental to obtain the best performances of the system. This thesis presents a mathematical model of a Diesel engine, created in Simulink environment, that is used to test the impact of Real-Time scheduling on a set of performance indices (thermodynamic efficiency, pollutant emission, noise). First, the schedulability problem for AVR task sets is presented, with the theoretical basis and state of the art. The mathematical model is then illustrated in detail: the dynamic of the engine is modelled using a simplified set of physical equations taken from specialized literature, while the controller is inspired by the <b>real</b> <b>ECU</b> using a mix of maps and robust control laws. The scheduler is integrated in the Simulink model using the T-Res framework (a RTSim Simulink interface), which has been modified to manage also the AVR tasks in its features. Finally, a series of tests are made, varying the switching speeds and control strategies, to show how performance indices are influenced. An experimental validation of the model is also presented to demonstrate the applicability of these results...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} that {{synthetic}} {{images can be}} used to preadjust a lane tracking algorithm which is developed by Audi. This was achieved by setting up a heterogeneous hardware-in-the-loop testbed. It includes the highly configurable and extendable simulation “Virtual Test Drive”. The main components are a traffic simulation, visualization and a sensor model which supplies ground truth data about the street lanes. Additionally, the visualization is used to generate synthetic camera sensor data. The testbed also contains a realistic driving dynamics simulation and a <b>real</b> image processing <b>ECU</b> (which is represented as a standard PC in the early development stages). One of the modules on the image processing ECU is a lane tracking algorithm. The algorithm is designed to calculate the transition curves while driving. This information can be used as input for driving assistance functions, e. g. lane departure warning. By running the lane tracker on a synthetic image it is possible to compare the results of the lane tracker with the ground truth data provided by the simulation. In this particular case, the information has been used to adjust the expected system error variance of one state variable...|$|R
