2500|$|The {{limitation}} of restriction sites in cassette mutagenesis may be overcome using {{polymerase chain reaction}} with oligonucleotide [...] "primers", such that a larger fragment may be generated, covering two convenient restriction sites. [...] The exponential amplification in PCR produces a fragment containing the desired mutation in sufficient quantity {{to be separated from}} the original, unmutated plasmid by gel electrophoresis, which may then be inserted in the original context using standard recombinant molecular biology techniques. [...] There are many variations of the same technique. [...] The simplest method places the mutation site toward one of the ends of the fragment whereby one of two oligonucleotides used for generating the fragment contains the mutation. [...] This involves a single step of PCR, but still has the inherent problem of requiring a suitable <b>restriction</b> <b>site</b> near the mutation site unless a very long primer is used. [...] Other variations, therefore, employ three or four oligonucleotides, two of which may be non-mutagenic oligonucleotides that cover two convenient restriction sites and generate a fragment that can be digested and ligated into a plasmid, whereas the mutagenic oligonucleotide may be complementary to a location within that fragment well away from any convenient <b>restriction</b> <b>site.</b> [...] These methods require multiple steps of PCR so that the final fragment to be ligated can contain the desired mutation. The design process for generating a fragment with the desired mutation and relevant restriction sites can be cumbersome. Software tools like SDM-Assist can simplify the process.|$|E

5000|$|Restriction enzymes are endonucleases from {{eubacteria}} and archaea that {{recognize a}} specific DNA sequence. [...] The nucleotide sequence recognized for cleavage by a restriction enzyme {{is called the}} <b>restriction</b> <b>site.</b> Typically, a <b>restriction</b> <b>site</b> will be a palindromic sequence about four to six nucleotides long. Most restriction endonucleases cleave the DNA strand unevenly, leaving complementary single-stranded ends. These ends can reconnect through hybridization and are termed [...] "sticky ends". Once paired, the phosphodiester bonds of the fragments can be joined by DNA ligase. There are hundreds of restriction endonucleases known, each attacking a different <b>restriction</b> <b>site.</b> The DNA fragments cleaved by the same endonuclease can be joined together regardless {{of the origin of}} the DNA. Such DNA is called recombinant DNA; DNA formed by the joining of genes into new combinations. Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are divided into three categories, Type I, Type II, and Type III, according to their mechanism of action. These enzymes are often used in genetic engineering to make recombinant DNA for introduction into bacterial, plant, or animal cells, as well as in synthetic biology.|$|E
50|$|AFLP-PCR or just AFLP is a PCR-based tool used in {{genetics}} research, DNA fingerprinting, and in {{the practice}} of genetic engineering. Developed in the early 1990s by Keygene, AFLP uses restriction enzymes to digest genomic DNA, followed by ligation of adaptors to the sticky ends of the restriction fragments. A subset of the restriction fragments is then selected to be amplified. This selection is achieved by using primers complementary to the adaptor sequence, the <b>restriction</b> <b>site</b> sequence and a few nucleotides inside the <b>restriction</b> <b>site</b> fragments (as described in detail below). The amplified fragments are separated and visualized on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, either through autoradiography or fluorescence methodologies, or via automated capillary sequencing instruments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Restriction</b> <b>site</b> {{associated}} DNA (RAD) markers are a type {{of genetic}} marker which are useful for association mapping, QTL-mapping, population genetics, ecological genetics and evolution. The use of RAD markers for genetic mapping is often called RAD mapping. An important aspect of RAD markers and mapping {{is the process of}} isolating RAD tags, which are the DNA sequences that immediately flank each instance of a particular <b>restriction</b> <b>site</b> of a restriction enzyme throughout the genome. Once RAD tags have been isolated, they can be used to identify and genotype DNA sequence polymorphisms mainly in form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Polymorphisms that are identified and genotyped by isolating and analyzing RAD tags are referred to as RAD markers.|$|E

40|$|Several Streptomyces {{species that}} produce {{restriction}} endonucleases were characterized {{for their ability}} to propagate 10 different broad host range bacteriophages. Each species displayed a different pattern of plaque formation. A restrictionless mutant of S. albus G allowed plaque formation by all 10 phages, whereas the wild-type strain showed plaques with only 2 phages. DNA isolated from three of the phages was analyzed for the presence of <b>restriction</b> <b>sites</b> for Streptomyces species-encoded enzymes, and a very strong correlation was established between the failure to form plaques on Streptomyces species that produced particular restriction enzymes and the presence of the corresponding <b>restriction</b> <b>sites</b> in the phage DNA. Also, the phages that lacked <b>restriction</b> <b>sites</b> in their DNA generally formed plaques on the corresponding restriction endonuclease-producing hosts at high efficiency. The DNAs from the three phages analyzed also generally contained either many or no <b>restriction</b> <b>sites</b> for the Streptomyces species-produced enzymes, suggesting a strong evolutionary trend to either eliminate all or tolerate many <b>restriction</b> <b>sites.</b> The data indicate that restriction {{plays a major role in}} host range determination for Streptomyces phages. Analysis of bacteriophage host ranges of many other uncharacterized Streptomyces hosts has identified four relatively nonrestricting hosts, at least two of which may be suitable hosts for gene cloning.
