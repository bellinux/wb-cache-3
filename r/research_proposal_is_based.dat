Our <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> on a landscape urbanism approach which combined with a social analysis will guide our decision making. A multi-scale landscape reading gives us a particular and specific image of {{the place to be}} inhabited. This research exercise explores the origins of the landscape in order to reveal the characteristics that create risks for the population. Analysing the Concepcion metropolitan settlements we acknowledge that people are living in the edge without too many opportunities {{in the way that they}} have been growing. This edge is defined by steep slopes and floodplains and consequently by landslide and flooding. Former informal settlements in Concepcion reveal key information in social networks and clustering patterns, this we will use in answering: How to change our “formal” way of growing while we live in the edge? How to build affordable houses in this dynamic landscape without losing social network patterns? So, by criticising the Chilean context we create a management model by re-balancing the stakeholders involve in the city growing process. Then we develop an urbanization exercise on how to inhabit this edge and a detailed example of building in the edge. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> on the {{understanding}} that male and female distance learners bring different ideas, expectations and experiences to a distance education class. Researchers {{continue to focus on}} the learning styles, motivations, obstacles and other characteristics of distance education students to determine who is more likely to succeed and how best to meet their needs. But a growing awareness of the role that gender plays in an online environment is becoming an important research topic. Much of the research conducted in this field involves students in mixed-gender classes. However, not as much research has been done on issues relating specifically to women’s experiences with distance education. The purpose of this research is to determine whether the barriers and challenges perceived by women in an online masters program are different or similar to those perceived by men. Research question The intent {{of this study is to}} answer the following question: Are the barriers and challenges identified by women in distance education different than or similar to those of men? Importance of knowledge to be gained Post-secondary distance education courses and enrollment in them continues to grow exponentially. A 1995 report by Lewis, Alexander & Farris (1997) found that one-third of higher education institutions provided distance education. By 2000 - 2001, 56 % of two and four-year institutions offered distance learning (Waits & Lewis, 2003).

40|$|Lean is an {{approach}} to improving business processes such as production. The overall objective of lean principles is to reduce waste and increase value. These principles have been developed and successfully applied within Toyota’s product development and production processes since the 1950 s. The benefits brought from the application of these principles have been investigated by academia and practitioners. Due to its successful results, the knowledge gathered is gradually being adapted and applied in different contexts such as construction, healthcare and education (Shingo, 1989). Lean has been mainly associated with the improvement of production processes. However, Toyota has applied the Lean principles within the whole organisation. The results have been widely disseminated and Toyota is recognised as being the more profitable car maker company in the world. The substantial reduction of the production time {{is one of the}} recognised achievements of Toyota. Other achievement, for instance, relates to the reduction of the time to market, which {{is the result of the}} faster car making product development process. Through the use of lean managerial principles, Toyota has increased its competitiveness. The lessons learnt from Toyota are now widely spread around the world. Lean is currently undergoing a process of generalisation, associated to the development of a theory‐based body of knowledge. The insight that the generic knowledge of lean principles has to be translated to match the requirements of the application context has grown in importance (Koskela, 2000). The penetration of explicit lean knowledge into service‐based industries has been, until recently, very modest. Initial studies and pioneering implementation projects have shown that the utilisation of Lean principles can give manifest benefits in terms of cost, value, client satisfaction and work motivation (De Vries et al., 1999; Lillrank et al. 2004; Sobek II and Jimmerson, 2004). Considering the underlying assumption of using lean principles for processes improvement, the aim of this research is to investigate how to apply lean principles to the development process of educational programs (theoretical contribution) and how the implementation of these principles can improve the development process of educational programs (practical contribution). Therefore, this <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> on mapping the referred development process and identifying different types of waste, such as over‐production; waiting; transporting; inventory; movement, inappropriate processing; defects proposed by Ohno (1988) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{review by}} Lillard et al. (2013) {{highlighted}} {{the need for}} additional research to better clarify {{the nature of the relationship}} between pretend play and development. However, the authors did not provide a proposal for how to structure the direction of this future work. Here, we provide a possible framework for generating additional <b>research.</b> This theoretical <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> on recent computational approaches to cognition, in which counterfactual reasoning plays a central role in causal learning. We propose that pretend play initially emerges as a product of the cognitive mechanisms underlying human learning and then feeds back to become critical for enhancing the optimal functioning of these same processes. More specifically, we argue that pretending is in fact 1 of several forms of counterfactual reasoning, which is essential to causal cognition-and that the act of engaging in pretend scenarios may provide early opportunities to practice the skills that were initially responsible for its appearance. Here, we provide a brief overview of this theoretical framework, consider how these ideas may be integrated with the previous work covered in Lillard et al. 's (2013) review, and suggest some empirically testable questions to direct future directions. © 2013 American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} various methods of treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In {{the first part}} of the thesis, the literary review, four evidence-based therapies of ASD are introduced. Also, the work outlines some of the alternative approaches to therapy with an emphasis on potentially dangerous methods. Furthermore, pharmacotherapeutic options which are commonly used to manage the comorbid symptoms such as anxiety, repetitive and automutilation behaviors are mentioned. The last chapter of the literary review is devoted to an overview of the latest research related to biological interventions and their potential to capture the cause of ASD. The main goal of the literary review is to outline various options for upbringing, education and overall improvement of the quality of life of people with ASD.

40|$|Esta tese propõe o delineamento da produção de conhecimento sobre ensino de Língua Portuguesa em dissertações de mestrado. Essa proposta de investigação foi construída a partir da pergunta: O ensino de Língua Portuguesa é uma disciplina?. O conceito de disciplina remete-se a Michel Foucault e está formulado no livro, publicado no Brasil, com o título A ordem do Discurso. Desde o tratamento inicial dos dados, verificamos que a resposta a essa pergunta era sim. Essa constatação fundamentou os procedimentos de análise que adotamos. Essa análise decorreu da depreensão de regularidades discursivas quanto aos objetos, às referências teóricas, às proposições e aos métodos de pesquisa validados no discurso científico-acadêmico sobre ensino de Língua Portuguesa. Esse discurso foi analisado em dissertações de mestrado, mapeadas em {{consulta}} ao Banco de Teses da CAPES. Nele, buscamos as dissertações publicadas, no período entre 2001 e 2010, por meio da expressão exata ensino de Língua Portuguesa no campo assunto. Localizamos o total de 321 dissertações, defendidas em Instituições do Ensino Superior de todo o país. A caracterização quantitativa desta produção foi apresentada no capítulo 1. Desse montante de trabalhos identificados na primeira etapa de nossa investigação, delimitamos o nosso corpus em 18 dissertações de mestrado, conforme tratamos no capítulo 2. Nesse capítulo, expusemos os aspectos envolvidos na formação do nosso corpus e abordamos distinções entre coleta de dados e composição do corpus. No terceiro e quarto capítulos, tratamos da configuração do discurso, no que diz respeito aos objetos e métodos de pesquisa recorrentes, ao quadro teórico legitimado e às formulações proposicionais defendidas. Da análise de suas regularidades, verificou-se a negação como componente elementar na constituição do discurso científico-acadêmico sobre ensino de Língua Portuguesa. No capítulo 5, analisamos como esta refutação compareceu em negações polêmicas que contrastam o que foi observado em sala de aula e em materiais didáticos ao quadro teórico referenciado. Por fim, expomos nossas considerações sobre a produção de conhecimento em ensino de Língua Portuguesa, tendo em vista o que tratamos como estabilização da polêmica. This dissertation aims {{to characterize}} the production {{of knowledge about the}} Teaching of Portuguese in Masters theses in Brazil. This <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on the following research question: Is the Teaching of Portuguese a discipline?. The concept of discipline refers to Michel Foucaults work and it is stated in the book The Discourse on Language, published in Brazil under the title of A Ordem do Discurso. From {{the very beginning of the}} data analysis, we found out that the answer to that question was affirmative. These findings gave us the bases for building the data analysis procedures. On the analysis of the data, we tried to find out discursive regularities with regard to research objects, theoretical frameworks adopted, basic propositions, and research methods validated by the academic and scientific discourse about the Teaching of Portuguese. Such discourse was analyzed on corpora composed by theses available on an academic database kept by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Education. In order to compose the corpora, we selected theses concluded in the period from 2001 to 2010 whose keywords include the expression Teaching of Portuguese. It was possible to identify 321 theses concluded in Brazilian Universities in this period. The quantitative characterization of this academic production is described on Chapter 1. From this total amount, 18 theses were selected to be analyzed as discussed on Chapter 2. Also on this chapter, we discussed some matters regarding the composition of our research corpora and the existing distinction between data gathering and corpora composition. On the Third and Fourth Chapters, we dealt with the configuration of discourse regarding the recurrent topics and methods of research, the theoretical framework legitimized by the authors, and the prepositional formulations defended by them. By analyzing the data, we found out that negation is a basic component on the organization of the scientificacademic discourse about the teaching of Portuguese. On Chapter 5, we analyzed the working of this feature on polemic negations that differs from the observed use of it in the classroom and on textbooks by establishing a contrast between those uses and the theoretical framework adopted by the authors. Lastly, we presented our considerations regarding the production of knowledge in the field of Portuguese Teaching taking into account what we have considered as the stabilization of the controversy...|$|R
40|$|Building with {{earth is}} still a living {{practice}} in Nigeria most especially in the northern region. Pear shaped sun-dried earth brick (tubali) was used traditionally by the Hausa in northern Nigeria. However, the use of tubali has ceased to exist in favour of the adobe blocks in both the urban and rural settlements in Nigeria. Sabon Gari, the study area {{is one of the}} urban areas in this region with buildings constructed with adobe. However, these adobe buildings are in deplorable conditions and in dire need of repair. Sabon Gari in Kaduna was selected as the thesis’ study area because of its strategic location and the dual function which the adobe buildings serve (i. e. residential and commercial purposes). This provided an opportunity to study the effect of the two activities on adobe building in an urban area. 20 compounds with buildings constructed with adobe blocks were selected and thoroughly examined. In the course of this study it was identified that the major factors inhibiting the repair of these buildings are social factors. This thesis therefore argued that with an appropriate framework these social factors can be corrected. Consequently, the adobe building in Sabon Gari can be repaired. This informed the decision to develop a repair framework through participatory approach involving the adobe building’s stakeholders, which include tenants, landlords, architects, masons and the planning authority. In the course of the development of this repair framework, this thesis draws on, and contextualises its argument on the fact that tried and tested repair strategies exists at international levels, which can be adapted to the situation in Sabon Gari. Consequently, ideas from relevant building repair literature, Terra conferences papers, earthen architecture conservation projects and adobe building repair projects were critically analysed and used in developing the proposed repair framework for Sabon Gari. To ensure the sustainability of the framework, {{which is one of the}} research aims, the content of the framework was validated by some of the stakeholders interviewed at the inception of this <b>research.</b> This <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> amended <b>based</b> on the stakeholders’ recommendations and now has the input and approval of the stakeholders.
