50|$|<b>Retrocomputing</b> {{is the use}} {{of older}} {{computer}} hardware and software in modern times. <b>Retrocomputing</b> is usually classed as a hobby and recreation rather than a practical application of technology; enthusiasts often collect rare and valuable hardware and software for sentimental reasons. However, some do make use of it. <b>Retrocomputing</b> often starts when a computer user realizes that formerly expensive fantasy systems like IBM mainframes, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) superminis, or Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstations have become affordable on the used computer market, usually in a relatively short time after the computers' era of use.|$|E

5000|$|Some <b>retrocomputing</b> enthusiasts also {{consider}} the 'Homebrewing' (designing and building of retro- and retro-styled computers or kits), {{to be an important}} aspect of the hobby, giving new enthusiasts an opportunity to experience more fully what the early years of hobby computing were like. [...] There are several different approaches to this end. Some are exact replicas of older systems, and some are newer designs based on the principles of <b>retrocomputing,</b> while others combine the two, with old and new features in the same package.

50|$|After Atari's 8-bit {{machines}} {{entered the}} realm of <b>retrocomputing</b> in the late 1990s, cross platform development tools such as XASM, TASM, and cc65, most commonly run on PCs, have been much used by enthusiasts to do programming intended for the machines.|$|E

50|$|A {{more serious}} line of <b>retrocomputing</b> {{is part of}} the history of {{computer}} hardware. It {{can be seen as the}} analogue of experimental archaeology in computing. Some notable examples include the reconstruction of Babbage's Difference engine (more than a century after its design) and the implementation of Plankalkül in 2000 (more than half a century since its inception).|$|E
50|$|Computers {{that are}} termed trashware in North America or totally {{reconditioned}} hardware in the UK and Ireland are computer equipment that has assembled from old hardware, using cleaned and checked parts from different computers, {{for use by}} disadvantaged people to bridge the digital divide. Trashware is different from <b>retrocomputing,</b> which has only cultural and recreational purposes.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{an active}} <b>retrocomputing</b> {{community}} of vintage Apple II collectors and users, continue to restore, maintain and develop {{hardware and software}} for daily use of these original computers. Numerous websites and support groups exist for these enthusiasts who maintain and use their machines. There is still a small annual convention, KansasFest, dedicated to the platform.|$|E
50|$|The tins are {{sometimes}} used to house electronic projects. BeagleBone, a single-board computer made by Texas Instruments, is deliberately shaped with rounded corners to fit inside the tin.

50|$|Counters {{were popular}} in the 1990s, later {{replaced}} by other web traffic measures, at first by self hosted scripts such as Analog, later on more typically remote systems that used JavaScript, like Google Analytics.

50|$|It {{was made}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s {{to make it easier for}} travel {{consultants}} to check availability and make bookings for holidays.A number of Viewdata bulletin board systems existed in the 1980s, predominantly in the UK due to the proliferation of the BBC Microcomputer, and a short-lived Viewdata Revival appeared in the late 1990s fuelled by the <b>retrocomputing</b> vogue. Some Viewdata boards still exist, with accessibility in the form of Java Telnet clients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Retrocomputing</b> {{is the use}} {{of vintage}} hardware, {{possibly}} performing modern tasks such as surfing the web and email. As programming techniques evolved and these systems were well understood after decades of use, it became possible to write software giving home computers capabilities undreamed of by their designers. The Contiki OS implements a GUI and TCP/IP stack on the Apple II, Commodore 8-bit and Atari ST (16-bit) platforms, allowing these home computers to function as both internet clients and servers.|$|E
50|$|Although now classed as abandonware, as {{development}} on it has ended, {{it is still}} in use by those who cannot upgrade to OS X due to hardware limitations, or prefer it to OS X. Mac OS 9 is also a popular choice for <b>retrocomputing</b> hobbyists. Mac gamers also sometimes revert to Classic (often via emulation) or native OS 9 in order to play games that aren't supported on OS X; for example: Bugdom, Nanosaur, Oregon Trail, Civilization II, and the Marathon Trilogy.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{mainstream}} <b>retrocomputing,</b> {{the activity}} of creating demos for old computers is more commonly associated with technical challenge than nostalgic feelings. The accomplishment of new and groundbreaking things is a major driving force on the demoscene, {{and the limits of}} various pieces of [...] "obsolete" [...] hardware are still being pushed forward by several groups. Even many PC-oriented democoders do some programming on more restricted platforms in order {{to get in touch with}} ways of democoding that are no longer available on modern PCs.|$|E

5000|$|H2K2, 12-14 July 2002, had a theme {{focused on}} U.S. Homeland Security Advisory System. H2K2 {{included}} two tracks of scheduled speakers, {{with a third}} track reserved for last-minute and self-scheduled speakers, a movie room, <b>retrocomputing,</b> musical performances, a State of the World Address by Jello Biafra, keynotes by Aaron McGruder and Siva Vaidhyanathan and discussions on the DMCA and DeCSS. Freedom Downtime premiered on Friday evening (14 July). The conference provided wireless 802.11b coverage and wired Ethernet, an open computer area for access to a 24-hour link to the Internet at [...] "T-1ish" [...] speeds, made available by the DataHaven Project and an internal network.|$|E
50|$|The Old School Emulation Center (TOSEC) is a <b>retrocomputing</b> {{initiative}} {{dedicated to}} the cataloging and preservation of software, firmware and resources for arcade machines, microcomputers, minicomputers and video game consoles. The goal of the TOSEC project is to maintain a database which describes all software and firmware images for all arcade machines, microcomputers, minicomputers and video game consoles. In addition to this, the project also catalogs other computing and gaming resources such as software and hardware manuals, magazine scans, computing catalogs, comics and videos. The catalogs provide an overview and cryptographic identification of media including applications, firmware, magazine cover disks, device drivers, games, operating systems, magazines, comic books, product box art, and videos of advertisements, training, and TV series.|$|E
50|$|Many hobbyists have {{personal}} computer museums, with collections of working vintage computers such as Apple IIs, IBM PCs, ZX Spectrums, Atari, Commodore, Amigas and BBC Micros. Early personal computers {{based on the}} S-100 bus are also very popular among collectors, {{as well as a}} wide variety of machines running the CP/M operating system, such as Kaypros and Osbornes. However, many users use emulation software on more modern computers rather than using real hardware, in order to enjoy the experience, while preserving the aging electronics of the original. This is not considered to be <b>retrocomputing</b> by some, as it is rather an application of modern computer hardware. A third option is the use of home computer remakes, dedicated appliances, which do the emulation using dedicated hardware.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, {{there have been}} three {{operating}} systems in widespread use on personal computers: Microsoft Windows, Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X, and the open source Linux. Since 2005 and Apple's transition to Intel processors, all have been developed mainly on the x86 platform, although Mac OS X retained PowerPC support until 2009 and Linux remains ported to a multitude of architectures including ones such as 68k, PA-RISC, and DEC Alpha, which have been long superseded and out of production, and SPARC and MIPS, which are used in servers or embedded systems but no longer for desktop computers. Other operating systems such as AmigaOS and OS/2 remain in use, if at all, mainly by <b>retrocomputing</b> enthusiasts or for specialized embedded applications.|$|E
