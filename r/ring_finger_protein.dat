40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 {{immediate}} early protein ICP 0 influences virus infection by inducing {{the degradation}} of specific cellular proteins via a mechanism requiring its <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Many <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{by virtue of their}} <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> domain, interact with E 2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and act as a component of an E 3 ubiquitin ligase. We have recently shown that ICP 0 induces the accumulation of colocalizing, conjugated ubiquitin, suggesting that ICP 0 can act as or contribute to an E 3 ubiquitin ligase. In this report we demonstrate that the ICP 0 -related <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins</b> encoded by other alphaherpesviruses also induce colocalizing, conjugated ubiquitin, thereby suggesting that they act by similar biochemical mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The genome of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is {{predicted}} to contain six <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> proteins: IAP 1, ORF 35, IAP 2, CG 30, IE 2, and PE 38. Several {{other members of the}} <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> family have recently been shown to have the ubiquitin-ligase (E 3) activity. We thus examined whether BmNPV <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins</b> have the E 3 activity. In vitro ubiquitination assay with the rabbit reticulocyte lysates and BmNPV <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins</b> fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP) showed that four of them (IAP 2, IE 2, PE 38, and CG 30) were polyubiquitinated in the presence of zinc ion. Furthermore, MBP-IAP 2, MBP-IE 2, and MBP-PE 38 were able to reconstitute ubiquitination activity in cooperation with the Ubc 4 / 5 subfamily of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Mutational analysis also showed that ubiquitination activity of MBP-IAP 2, MBP-IE 2, and MBP-PE 38 were dependent on their <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> motif. Therefore, these results suggest that IAP 2, IE 2, and PE 38 may function as E 3 enzymes during BmNPV infection...|$|R

40|$|Two ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, RAD 6 and the heteromeric UBC 13 –MMS 2 complex, {{have been}} implicated in post-replicative DNA damage repair in yeast. Here we provide a {{mechanistic}} basis for cooperation between the two enzymes. We show that two chromatin-associated <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins,</b> RAD 18 and RAD 5, {{play a central role}} in mediating physical contacts between the members of the RAD 6 pathway. RAD 5 recruits the UBC 13 –MMS 2 complex to DNA by means of its <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> domain. Moreover, RAD 5 association with RAD 18 brings UBC 13 –MMS 2 into contact with the RAD 6 –RAD 18 complex. Interaction between the two <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins</b> thus promotes the formation of a heteromeric complex in which the two distinct ubiquitin-conjugating activities of RAD 6 and UBC 13 –MMS 2 can be closely coordinated. Surprisingly, UBC 13 and MMS 2 are largely cytosolic proteins, but DNA damage triggers their redistribution to the nucleus. These findings suggest a mechanism by which the activity of this DNA repair pathway could be regulated...|$|R

This interaction was observed in yeast as well as in mammalian cells. With one exception, all UbcM 4 -interacting proteins (UIPs) belong to a family of proteins that contain a <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> motif. As they are structurally related to <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins</b> that have recently been shown to play an essential role in protein ubiquitylation and degradation, the possibility is discussed that UIPs are involved in the specific recognition of substrate proteins of UbcM 4...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{vertebrate}} {{zinc finger}} factors of the Kruppel type (C 2 H 2 zinc fingers) contain in their N-terminus a conserved sequence {{referred to as}} the KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain that, when tethered to DNA, efficiently represses transcription. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have isolated an 835 amino acid <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> (C 3 HC 4 zinc <b>finger)</b> <b>protein,</b> TIF 1 beta (also named KAP- 1), that specifically interacts with the KRAB domain of the human zinc finger factor KOX 1 /ZNF 10.

Like TIF 1 alpha, TIF 1 beta also contains an additional Cys/His cluster (PHD finger) and a bromo-related domain. When tethered to DNA, TIF 1 beta can repress transcription in transiently transfected mammalian cells both from promoter-proximal and remote (enhancer) positions, similarly to the KRAB domain itself. We propose that TIF 1 beta is a mediator of the transcriptional repression exerted by the KRAB domain...|$|R
40|$|Opitz {{syndrome}} (OS) is {{a genetically}} heterogeneous disorder characterized by defects of the ventral midline, including hypertelorism, cleft lip and palate, heart defects, and mental retardation. We recently identified the gene responsible for X-linked OS. The ubiquitously expressed gene product, MID 1, {{is a member}} of the <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> family. These <b>proteins</b> are characterized by an N-terminal tripartite protein–protein interaction domain and a conserved C terminus of unknown function. Unlike other <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins</b> for which diverse cellular functions have been proposed, the function of MID 1 is as yet undefined. By using the green fluorescent protein as a tag, we show here that MID 1 is a microtubule-associated protein that influences microtubule dynamics in MID 1 -overexpressing cells. We confirm this observation by demonstrating a colocalization of MID 1 and tubulin in subcellular fractions and the association of endogenous MID 1 with microtubules after in vitro assembly. Furthermore, overexpressed MID 1 proteins harboring mutations described in OS patients lack the capability to associate with microtubules, forming cytoplasmic clumps instead. These data give an idea of the possible molecular pathomechanism underlying the OS phenotype...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF 6) is {{an important}} signaling molecule involved in a diverse array of physiological processes. It has been proposed that TRAF 6, a RING finger-containing protein, acts as a ubiquitin ligase (E 3) and a target for Lys- 63 linked polyubiquitination mediated by Ubc 13 –Uev, a ubiquitin conjugating (E 2) complex. However, the physical interaction between TRAF 6 and this E 2 complex has not been reported. We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to demonstrate that TRAF 6 indeed interacts with the E 2 complex through its direct binding to Ubc 13. Either a single Cys-to-Ser substitution within the TRAF 6 <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> domain or an amino acid substitution on the Ubc 13 surface, that is predicted to interact with <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins,</b> is able to abolish the interaction. In addition, we found that TRAF 6 can interact with itself and this self-interaction domain is mapped to the N-terminus containing the <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> motif. Based on this study and our previous Ubc 13 –Uev structural analysis, the interface of Ubc 13 -TRAF 6 <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> can be predicted...|$|R

40|$|The {{ubiquitin}} system plays {{important roles}} in the regulation of numerous cellular processes by conjugating ubiquitin to target proteins. In most cases, conjugation of polyubiquitin to target proteins regulates their function. In the polyubiquitin chains reported to date, ubiquitin monomers are linked via isopeptide bonds between an internal Lys and a C-terminal Gly. Here, we report that a protein complex consisting of two <b>RING</b> <b>finger</b> <b>proteins,</b> HOIL- 1 L and HOIP, exhibits ubiquitin polymerization activity by recognizing ubiquitin moieties of proteins. The polyubiquitin chain generated by the complex is not formed by Lys linkages, but by linkages between the C- and N-termini of ubiquitin, indicating that the ligase complex possesses a unique feature to assemble a novel head-to-tail linear polyubiquitin chain. Moreover, the complex regulates the stability of Ub-GFP (a GFP fusion protein with an N-terminal ubiquitin). The linear polyubiquitin chain generated post-translationally may function as a new modulator of proteins...|$|R
