50|$|PHEDRA is a plasma {{ground test}} {{facility}} used to simulate low pressure flight {{conditions in the}} upper layer of the planetary atmospheres. An arc-jet generator operates in a cylindrical chamber of 1;1 m in diameter and 4.3 m length, pumped with 3 primary pumps and 3 Roots pumps, which capacity (27 000 m3/h) insures a residual pressure ranged between 1 and 100 Pa. Different working gases can be used like Argon, nitrogen, CO2, CH4 Air, allowing the simulation of several planetary entry conditions like earth (80%N2-20%O2), Mars (97%CO2-3%N2) or Titan (99% N2-1% CH4).

This study aimed to calculate the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> blood culture <b>contamination</b> and associated factors at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, KSA. MethodsThis is a retrospective cross-sectional study. The total study population was calculated based on a review of all of the request sheets for blood cultures submitted to the microbiology laboratory from 1 st of January to 31 st of December, 2012, at KKUH, Riyadh, KSA. ResultsThe <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> blood culture <b>contamination</b> (false positive) was 1. 9 %, while 8. 71 % of the blood culture samples had true infections (true positive).

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> microbial <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> solutions and lens accessories of existing ortho-k lens wearers {{and the effect}} on <b>contamination</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> monthly replacement and warnings. To investigate self-reported levels of compliance with care of the lenses and lens accessories and correlation of these levels with the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> microbial <b>contamination.</b> Methods. Asymptomatic ortho-k lens wearers with at least 6 -month successful use were requested to bring their lenses, solutions, and accessories to their next aftercare visit. All items, except the lenses, were replaced at each data collection visit. Samples collected from the lens surface, solution, and accessories were cultured for pathogens. These procedures were repeated twice at 1 -month intervals. At the first visit, each subject and/or parent was interviewed about the care/use of the lens and accessories. Results. Thirty-eight subjects completed the study. Initial <b>contamination</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> the lenses, lens cases, and tweezers were 29, 34, and 46 %, respectively. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> dropped for lenses, suction holders, and tweezers during the three-visit intervention. Contact lens solutions, except lens cleaner were contaminated on all occasions with the most contaminated product being artificial tears [33 % (n = 18) ]. There was no improvement in the <b>contamination</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the lens cases. The most common pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens. Compliance was lowest for care of lens cases and highest for care of lenses. However, correlation between reported compliance and presence of pathogens failed to reach significance. Conclusions.

However, attitudes toward cleaning of accessories was far less satisfactory and while replacement and warnings resulted in significant improvements <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> tweezers and suction holders, more emphasis should be placed on educating patients on correct care of lens accessories.

Os resultados evidenciaram elevados percentuais de contaminação em todas as variedades de hortaliças analisadas, porém as freqüências de protozoários foram maiores no agrião. As amostras de alfaces apresentaram os menores percentuais de contaminação, enquanto que a escarola apresentou valores geralmente situados entre o agrião e as alfaces. Observou-se uma grande variedade de protozoários, cujas freqüências de ocorrência na população residente na Região Metropolitana de São Paulo são igualmente elevadas. Os mais freqüentes foram Entamoeba sp (com 4 e 8 núcleos) e Giardia sp. Foram também isolados cistos de Iodamoeba sp, Endolimax sp e Chilomastix sp.

The {{results of the present}} investigation revealed that out of 150 samples, 35 samples (23. 33 %) were found contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus. The highest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> was recorded from the samples of Rabri that is 9 samples (30 %), followed by Khoa 8 (26. 67 %), Mawa 7 (23. 33 %), Gulabjaman 6 (20 %) and Rasgulla 5 (16. 67 %) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 120 mycobacterial {{isolates}} were recovered from 1, 068 clinical specimens. Of these, 82. 5 % were in MGIT 960, 83. 3 % were in MB/BacT, 80 % were in BACTEC 460, and 70 % were on Löwenstein-Jensen medium. Mean times to detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 96) were significantly shorter with MGIT 960 (12. 6 days, P = 0. 003) and BACTEC 460 (11. 8 days, P < 0. 001) than with MB/BacT (15. 9 days). Although, MGIT 960 showed the lowest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> recovery of M. kansasii genotype I (64. 3 %), the earliest growth was detected with this system (8. 9 days). Low and similar <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> were obtained with MGIT 960 (3. 3 %) and MB/BacT (3 %). The AccuProbe test for identification showed excellent sensitivities with MGIT 960 (96. 8 %) and MB/BacT (100 %) cultures. In {{addition to being}} nonradiometric, both MGIT 960 and MB/BacT are accurate, rapid, and labor-saving detection systems which could replace the radiometric method...|$|R
40|$|Using two {{different}} liquid media and one conventional solid medium, {{a total of}} 57 mycobacterial isolates (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, n = 55; nontuberculous mycobacteria, n = 2) were recovered from 377 clinical specimens. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> recovery of M. tuberculosis were 96. 4 % with the BACTEC MGIT 960 liquid medium, 92. 7 % with BACTEC 12 B liquid medium, and 81. 8 % with the Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium. The mean time to detection of M. tuberculosis in smear-positive specimens was 12. 6 days for BACTEC MGIT 960 medium, 13. 8 days for BACTEC 12 B medium, and 20. 1 days for LJ medium, and in smear-negative specimens it was 15. 8 days for BACTEC MGIT 960 medium, 17. 7 days for BACTEC 12 B medium, and 42. 2 days for LJ medium. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> were 3. 7, 2. 9, and 1. 2 % for the BACTEC MGIT 960, BACTEC 12 B, and LJ media, respectively. In conclusion, the nonradiometric, fully automated 7 -ml BACTEC MGIT 960 system {{can be considered a}} viable alternative to the semiautomated, radiometric BACTEC 460 TB system...|$|R
40|$|The effects <b>of</b> {{evolving}} surface <b>contamination</b> on spacecraft charging {{have been}} investigated through (i) ground-based measurements {{of the change in}} electron emission properties of a conducting surface undergoing contamination and (ii) modeling of the charging of such surfaces using the NASCAP code. Specifically, we studied a Au surface as adsorbed species were removed and a very thin disordered carbon film was deposited as a result of exposure to an intense, normal incidence electron beam. As a result <b>of</b> this <b>contamination,</b> we found an ~ 50 % decrease in secondary electron yield and an ~ 20 % reduction in backscattered yield. The type and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> observed are similar to those encountered by operational spacecraft. Charging potentials of an isolated panel of the material were determined under both sunlit and eclipse conditions in geosynchronous orbits for typical and extreme environments. In all environments studied, just monolayers <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> lead to predictions of an abrupt threshold effect for spacecraft charging; panels that charged to small positive values when uncontaminated developed kilovolt negative potentials. The relative effect of NASCAP parameters for modeling secondary and backscattered electron emission and plasma electron distributions were also investigated. We conclude that surface contamination must be considered to avoid the serious detrimental effects associated with severe spacecraft charging...|$|R
