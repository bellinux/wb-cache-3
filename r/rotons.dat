50|$|In {{superfluid}} 4He {{the elementary}} collective excitations are phonons and <b>rotons.</b> A particle striking an electron or nucleus in this superfluid can produce <b>rotons,</b> {{which may be}} detected bolometrically or by the evaporation of helium atoms when they reach a free surface. 4He is intrinsically very pure so the <b>rotons</b> travel ballistically and are stable, so that large volumes of fluid can be used.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rotons,</b> an {{elementary}} excitation in superfluid 4He introduced by Landau, were discussed by Feynman and others. [...] <b>Rotons</b> condense at low temperature.

40|$|<b>Roton</b> {{excitations}} {{constitute a}} key feature of dipolar gases, connecting these gases with superfluid helium. We {{show that the}} density dependence of the <b>roton</b> minimum results in a spatial <b>roton</b> confinement, particularly relevant in pancake dipolar condensates with large aspect ratios. We show that <b>roton</b> confinement {{plays a crucial role}} in the dynamics after <b>roton</b> instability, and that arresting the instability may create a trapped <b>roton</b> gas revealed by confined density modulations. We discuss the local susceptibility against density perturbations, which we illustrate for the case of vortices. <b>Roton</b> confinement is expected to play a key role in experiments.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that measurements of atom-number fluctuations in a trapped dipolar condensate can reveal {{the presence of}} the elusive <b>roton</b> excitation. The key signature is a super-Poissonian peak in the fluctuations as the size of the measurement cell is varied, with the maximum occurring when the size is comparable to the <b>roton</b> wavelength. The magnitude of this <b>roton</b> feature is enhanced with temperature. The variation in fluctuations across the condensate demonstrates that the <b>roton</b> excitations are effectively confined to propagate in the densest central region, realizing a density trapped <b>roton</b> gas. While our main results are based on full numerical solutions of the meanfield equations, we also develop and validate a simple local density theory. Finally, we consider fluctuations measured within a washer-shaped cell which filters out the contribution of modes with nonzero angular momentum and provides a signal sensitive to individual <b>roton</b> modes.

40|$|The <b>roton</b> {{excitation}} in the superfluid He- 4 {{does not}} possess a stationary dipole moment. However, a <b>roton</b> has an instantaneous dipole moment, such {{that at any}} given moment one can find it in the state either with positive or with negative dipole moment projection on its momentum direction. The instantaneous value of electric dipole moment of <b>roton</b> excitation is evaluated. The result is in reasonable agreement with recent experimental observation of the splitting of microwave resonance absorption line at <b>roton</b> frequency under external electric field. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} by {{neutron scattering}} that a localized superfluid component exists at high pressures within solid helium in aerogel. Its existence is deduced from {{the observation of}} two sharp phonon-roton spectra which are clearly distinguishable from modes in bulk superfluid helium. These <b>roton</b> excitations exhibit different <b>roton</b> gap parameters than the <b>roton</b> observed in the bulk fluid at freezing pressure. One of the <b>roton</b> modes disappears after annealing the samples. Comparison with theoretical calculations suggests that the model that reproduces the observed data best is that of superfluid double layers within the solid and at the helium-substrate interface...|$|R

50|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, a roton is {{an elementary}} excitation, or quasiparticle, in superfluid helium-4. The dispersion relation of elementary excitations in this superfluid shows a linear {{increase from the}} origin, but exhibits first a maximum and then a minimum in energy as the momentum increases. Excitations with momenta in the linear region are called phonons; those with momenta close to the minimum are called <b>rotons.</b> Excitations with momenta near the maximum are sometimes called maxons.|$|E
50|$|This initial {{version of}} the <b>Roton</b> had been {{designed}} with the small communications satellite market in mind.

40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, artificially {{engineered}} Bose Einstein Condensation {{has been achieved}} in atomic systems. Bose Einstein Condensates are superfluids just like bosonic Helium is and all interacting bosonic fluids {{are expected to be}} at low enough temperatures. One difference between the two systems is that superfluid Helium exhibits <b>roton</b> excitations while Bose Einstein Condensates have never been observed to have such excitations. The reason for the <b>roton</b> minimum in Helium is its proximity to a solid phase. The <b>roton</b> minimum is a consequence of enhanced density fluctuations at the reciprocal lattice vector of the stillborn solid. Bose Einstein Condensates in atomic traps are not near a solid phase and therefore do not exhibit <b>roton</b> minimum. We conclude that if Bose Einstein Condensates in an optical lattice are tuned near a transition to a Mott insulating phase, a <b>roton</b> minimum will develop at a reciprocal lattice vector of the lattice. Equivalently, a peak in the structure factor will appear at such a wavevector. The smallness of the <b>roton</b> gap or the largeness of the structure factor peak are experimental signatures of the proximity to the Mott transition. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|Originally, the <b>roton</b> {{spectrum}} was phenomenologically {{introduced by}} Lev Landau. Currently there exist different models which {{try to explain}} the <b>roton</b> spectrum, with a different degree of success and fundamentality. The requirement for any model of such kind is that it must explain not only {{the shape of the}} spectrum itself but also other related observables, such as the speed of sound and structure factor of superfluid helium-4. Microwave and Bragg spectroscopy has been conducted on helium to study <b>roton</b> spectrum.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} cited reason for operating any sensor at low temperature is {{the reduction in}} thermal noise, which {{is proportional to the}} square root of the absolute temperature. However, at very low temperature, certain material properties become very sensitive to energy deposited by particles in their passage through the sensor, and the gain from these changes may be even more than that from reduction in thermal noise. Two such commonly used properties are heat capacity and electrical resistivity, particularly superconductivity; other designs are based on superconducting tunnel junctions, quasiparticle trapping, <b>rotons</b> in superfluids, magnetic bolometers, and other principles.|$|E
5000|$|Physical {{models of}} {{phyllotaxis}} {{date back to}} Airy's experiment of packing hard spheres. Gerrit van Iterson diagrammed grids imagined on a cylinder (Rhombic Lattices). Douady et al. showed that phyllotactic patterns emerge as self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. In 1991, Levitov proposed that lowest energy configurations of repulsive particles in cylindrical geometries reproduce the spirals of botanical phyllotaxis. More recently, Nisoli et al. (2009) showed that to be true by constructing a [...] "magnetic cactus" [...] made of magnetic dipoles mounted on bearings stacked along a [...] "stem". They demonstrated that these interacting particles can access novel dynamical phenomena beyond what botany yields: a [...] "Dynamical Phyllotaxis" [...] family of non local topological solitons emerge in the nonlinear regime of these systems, as well as purely classical <b>rotons</b> and maxons in the spectrum of linear excitations.|$|E
40|$|We {{find the}} pressure, {{due to the}} thermal {{excitations}} of superfluid helium, at the interface with a solid. The separate contributions of phonons, $R^-$ <b>rotons</b> and $R^+$ <b>rotons</b> are derived. The pressure due to $R^-$ <b>rotons</b> is shown to be negative and partially compensates the positive contribution of $R^+$ <b>rotons,</b> so the total roton pressure is positive but several times less than the separate $R^-$ and $R^+$ roton contributions. The pressure of the quasiparticle gas is shown {{to account for the}} fountain effect in $HeI I$. An experiment is proposed to observe the negative pressure due to $R^-$ <b>rotons.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{proposed}} a model of <b>roton</b> cluster excitations in liquid helium II based on a Schrödingertype equation with a self-consistent confining potential. We have derived an equation {{for the number of}} atoms in <b>roton</b> excitations, which can be treated as quantum 3 D solitons, depending on vibrational quantum numbers. It is shown that the smallest <b>roton</b> cluster is in the symmetric vibrational quantum state and consists of 13 helium atoms. We have also used a modified Born approximation to calculate the s-scattering length for helium atoms. This allows us to calculate all parameters of Landau’s <b>roton</b> excitation spectrum, in agreement to high accuracy with experimental measurements from neutron scattering. PACS numbers: 67. 40.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of a quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (dBEC) that is perturbed by a weak lattice potential along its axis. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that systems exhibiting a roton-maxon structure destabilize readily when the lattice wavelength equals either half the <b>roton</b> wavelength or a low <b>roton</b> subharmonic. We apply perturbation theory to the Gross-Pitaevskii and Bogoliubov de Gennes equations to illustrate the mechanisms behind the instability threshold. The features of our stability diagram {{may be used as}} a direct measurement of the <b>roton</b> wavelength for quasi-one-dimensional geometries. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{solve the}} problem of the {{transmission}} and reflection of phonons and <b>rotons</b> at the interface between superfluid helium and a solid, for all angles of incidence and in both directions. A consistent solution of the problem is presented which allows us to rigorously describe the simultaneous creation of phonons, $R^-$, and $R^+$ <b>rotons</b> in helium by either a phonon from the solid or a helium quasiparticle incident on the interface. The interaction of all $HeII$ quasiparticles with the interface, and their transmission, reflection and conversion into each other, is described in a unified way. The angles of propagation and the probabilities of creating quasiparticles are obtained for all cases. Andreev reflection of helium phonons and <b>rotons</b> is predicted. The energy flows through the interface due to phonons, $R^-$, and $R^+$ <b>rotons</b> are derived. The small contribution of the $R^-$ <b>rotons</b> is due to the small probability of an $R^-$ roton being created by a phonon in the solid, and vice versa. This explains the failure to directly create beams of $R^-$ <b>rotons</b> prior to the experiments of Tucker and Wyatt in 1999. New experiments for creating $R^-$ <b>rotons,</b> by beams of high-energy phonons (h-phonons), are suggested. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|A new {{physical}} model of liquid He^ 4 {{based on the}} hypothesis that <b>rotons</b> behave like tiny quantized circular vortex rings is presented. It is shown that the energy of a state will not only depend on the distribution in numbers of <b>rotons</b> with various momenta, {{but also on the}} arrangements and orientations of the <b>rotons.</b> The λ-transition then can be interpreted to reveal two aspects: T_λ is both the lowest temperature at which all helium atoms partake in excitation, and the point of the initiation of the general destruction of order, i. e. the general randomization of the orientation of the <b>rotons.</b> Other implications from the theory are also discussed...|$|E

Novel phenomena, such as oscillatory shielding of external localized electric charge, <b>rotons</b> and charge density waves (charge stripes in two dimensions), occur in any dimensions.

On the other hand, <b>rotons</b> and charge density waves are due to attractive local self-interaction of bosons. <b>Rotons</b> {{can be regarded as}} a finite size charge density wave packet without any back flow.
