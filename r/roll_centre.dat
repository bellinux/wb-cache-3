50|$|The three {{adjacent}} {{rolls of}} a {{three roll mill}} (called the feed <b>roll,</b> <b>centre</b> roll and apron roll) rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, usually {{in the form of}} paste, is fed between the feed roll and the center roll. Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center roll moves through the second nip between the center roll and apron roll. This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron roll and typically, a smaller gap than between the feed and centre rolls. A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron roll and the paste rolls down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|E

Conversely if a hull having {{a perfectly}} rectangular cross section has its centre of mass at the water line, the centre of mass stays at the same height, but the centre of buoyancy goes down as the hull heels, again storing potential energy.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: This report {{investigates the}} {{suspension}} parameters required to alter a modified mass produced car {{for use in}} the short circuit racing environment. The cornering force and handling characteristics of the car are to be altered to result in faster cornering speeds and resultantly reduce lap times. The required research was undertaken and the necessary modifications were evaluated. The <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> locations were found to have the largest effect on the cars weight transfer characteristics and balance, and hence the investigation into their location was undertaken in the interest of increasing their optimization. The fitment of front <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> adjusters was analysed and the positive results justified their fitment to the front suspension. A Watts Linkage was designed and fitted to the rear suspension and the modification and adjustability of the rear <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> was the result. The roll centres were effectively raised in the front and lowered in the rear to alter the weight transfer and jacking forces. The race car was physically tested {{both before and after the}} modifications were completed to ensure that a fair ground for comparison was available. The differences in tyre temperatures, cornering g forces and the driver’s evaluation of the modifications have resulted in positive outcomes for the cornering potential and handling parameters. The new <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> locations have resulted in a car that is more neutral in its handling characteristics. The modified <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> locations have also introduced a new situation for the suspension development and further testing and suspension modification are recommended. Recommendations for supplementary investigations are included in the interest of further increasing the effectiveness of the performed modifications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{enhancement}} of vehicle handling characteristics through the active kinematic control system (AKCS) is investigated. AKCS can improve the stability and ride comfort of a vehicle by automatically controlling suspension geometry {{in accordance with the}} running con-ditions of a vehicle. The variable <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> suspension concept in a McPherson strut suspension is proposed, and lateral acceleration feedback control is derived to calculate the control input. The independent rear wheel steering system, which controls both rear wheels independently and actively, is also proposed. To achieve this, three suggested positions for controlling the suspension geometry are considered. The rst position is between the mounting point of the lower arm of a McPherson front suspension and the vehicle body. The second position is between the mounting point of the strut and the vehicle body. The third position is between the mounting point of the lateral link of the multilink rear suspension and the vehicle body. In order to evaluate the handling performance, a 15 degrees of freedom full vehicle model is constructed using the commercial multibody analysis program ADAMS. The control inputs for integrated control of the front and rear suspensions are dened, and <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> migration and vehicle behaviour are investigated. In step steering and double lane change manoeuvres, the simulation results demonstrate that integrated kinematic control can adjust the <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> migration, by which the handling characteristics of the AKCS vehicle such as roll angle, lateral acceleration and yaw rate are much improved...|$|E

40|$|Seeking {{the right}} level of help {{at the right}} time can support learning. However, in the context of online {{problem-solving}} environments, it is still not entirely clear which help-seeking strategies are desired. We use fine-grained data from 38 high school students who worked with the Geometry Cognitive Tutor for 2 months to better understand the associations between specific help-seeking patterns and learn-ing. We evaluate how students ’ help-seeking behaviors on each step in a tutored problem are associated with their success on subsequent steps that require the same skills. Analyzing learning at the skill level allows us to compare different help-seek-ing patterns within a single student, controlling for between-student variations. Overall, asking for help on challenging steps is associated with productive learning, and overusing help is associated with poorer learning. However, contrary to many help-seeking theories, avoiding help (and failing repeatedly) is associated with better Correspondence should be addressed to Ido <b>Roll,</b> <b>Centre</b> for Teaching, Learning, & Technology...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of 4 th International Conference on Fracture Fatigue and Wear, FFW 2015, Ghent University, Belgium, 27 - 28 August 2015 Composite rolls {{are widely}} used in hot rolling mill because of the {{excellent}} hardness, wear resistance and high temperature properties. During hot rolling process, composite rolls are subjected to heating-cooling thermal cycles from the hot strip contact and water cooling. The thermal stress is added to already existing residual stress. The thermal fatigue cracking appears at roll surface, and the fracture is possible happen in <b>roll</b> <b>centre</b> when the tensile stress exceeds the centre strength. Therefore, residual stress {{plays an important role}} in composite roll. In this paper, FEM (finite element method) simulation is performed to investigate the generation mechanism of the residual stress during quenching process. It should be noted that a large number of experimental data of the core and shell materials are utilized for the wide range of temperature considering the quenching process. The results verify that initially the tensile stress appears on the roll surface but finally the compressive stress occurs...|$|E
