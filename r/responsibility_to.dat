5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe.

At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the statute's {{enactment}} in 1710, copying {{restrictions were}} {{authorized by the}} Licensing of the Press Act 1662.
