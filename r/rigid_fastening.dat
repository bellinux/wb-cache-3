40|$|The {{article is}} an {{overview}} of various designs developed for joints of rod elements of space structures. Designs under consideration include those developed by domestic and foreign researchers and structural engineers. Space joints are clustered {{on the basis of}} their characteristic features, and their principal strengths and weaknesses are specified by the authors. The authors’ overview serves as the basis for an advanced structural solution developed for modular joints of space elements. A space joint consists of four space details having holes that are fastened to the central element by two bolts (screws). A flat plate with holes is attached to the edge of the central element. Space details and the core element are to have a gap between them. Rod ends are inserted into gaps and fastened to joints with bolts. The proposed solution may be used to reduce the material consumption rate (steel and plastic) and to simplify the assembly of structures. The solution proposed by the authors also improves the reliability of joints due to the integrity of elements, their <b>rigid</b> <b>fastening</b> to the central element, and the use of two cross-section bolts. Обобщен и проанализирован накопленный опыт конструкторских разработок, проведенных отечественными и зарубежными авторами в направлении сопряжения стержневых элементов пространственных конструкций. Узловые элементы сгруппированы и отмечены основные их достоинства и недостатки. На основании сделанных выводов разработано новое конструктивное решение сборно-разборного узлового соединения, которое позволяет сократить расход материалов (стали или пластмасс) на его изготовление, упростить сборку конструкции, повысить надежность узлового элемента...|$|E

It was constructed in 1909 {{and is one of}} the state's earliest surviving bridges to use rigid rather than pinned connections. Moreover it is Minnesota's only known road bridge in which some of the <b>rigid</b> connections are <b>fastened</b> with bolts rather than rivets.|$|R
