Golden eagles nest on rocky ledges, and sometimes in trees. Wallcreeper are found on steep cliffs. There are black woodpeckers and nutcrackers in the park's woodlands.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan,</b> lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the Arctic hare, Arctic fox, stoat, and <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> have snow camouflage, {{changing}} their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E

50|$|Dinets' early zoological {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in remote areas of the USSR, China and South America; he also participated {{in a number of}} conservation projects in Russia, Mongolia, Israel and Peru. In 1992 he solved the mystery of the ability of <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigans</b> to winter on Arctic islands in total darkness: they survive by feeding on rich vegetation on sea cliffs where seabird colonies are located in summer.|$|R
5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> change their coat colour (by {{moulting}} and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
25|$|Few animals live {{in these}} areas; birds, mostly, {{such as the}} willow warbler, the meadow pipit, the {{northern}} wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European golden plover, the Eurasian dotterel, the snow bunting, and the Lapland longspur. The willow ptarmigan is relatively common, whereas the <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufjället is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|The furry-legged <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> is a {{widespread}} bird in this region. Typical birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and snowy owl. Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, ruddy turnstone, red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary redpoll, common redpoll, snow bunting, and Lapland longspur. The snow goose, common and king eider, and red-throated loon are some species of waterfowl {{that live in the}} region.|$|E

25|$|The rocks {{around the}} Zugspitze are a habitat for chamois, whilst marmots are {{widespread}} {{on the southern}} side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently alpine choughs, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are mountain hare and the hazel dormouse. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the golden eagle, <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan,</b> snow finch, alpine accentor and brambling. The crag martin which has given {{its name to the}} Schwalbenwand ("Swallows' Wall") at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes.|$|E
25|$|Benzoic acid occurs {{naturally}} as do its esters in many {{plant and}} animal species. Appreciable amounts {{have been found in}} most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several Vaccinium species (e.g., cranberry, V. vitis macrocarpon; bilberry, V. myrtillus) contain as much as 0.03–0.13% free benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is also formed in apples after infection with the fungus Nectria galligena. Among animals, benzoic acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus muta) as well as in gland secretions of male muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) or Asian bull elephants (Elephas maximus).|$|E
25|$|Migratory {{waterfowl}} (ducks, geese, and swans) and upland {{game birds}} (ptarmigans and grouse) were a valued source of fresh meat. Grouse (spruce grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, ruffed grouse Lower Tanana deyh Tanacross deyh, ch'ehtêeg, tsą́ą' ts'uug Upper Tanana daih, ch'ahtagn, tsąą'ts'uu) and ptarmigan (willow ptarmigan and <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> Lower Tanana k'orrh'eba, ddhełk'ola Tanacross k'étmah, ddheł k'aal Upper Tanana k'atbah) were taken opportunistically throughhout {{the year with}} bow and arrows or with snares and fence-snare arrangements. Ducks and geese were easily captured when molting. Men in birchbark canoes quietly approached waterfowl in bays and coves and shot them with bow and arrows. Women and children then caught the birds and collected eggs from their nests.|$|E
50|$|The park protects a large {{population}} of mountain goats and bighorn sheep (20% {{of the total population}} in Alberta). Other mammals commonly found here include grizzly bears, mountain caribou, elk, deer, cougars and wolves. Coyotes, wolverines, lynx and black bears are also present in the sub-alpine region, while marmots, <b>rock</b> pika, <b>ptarmigan</b> and Rocky Mountain goats {{can be found in the}} higher alpine areas.|$|R
50|$|Alpine bistort is a {{perennial}} herb that grows to 5 to 15 cm tall. It has a thick rhizomatous rootstock and an erect, unbranched, hairless stem. The leaves are hairless {{on the upper}} surfaces, but hairy and greyish-green below. The basal ones are longish-elliptical with long stalks and rounded bases; the upper ones are few and are linear and stalkless. The tiny flowers are white or pink in {{the upper part of}} the spike with five perianth segments, eight stamens with purple anthers and three fused carpels. The lower ones are replaced by bulbils. Flowers rarely produce viable seeds and reproduction is normally by the bulbils, which are small bulb-like structures that develop in the axils of the leaves and may develop into new plants. Very often, a small leaf develops when the bulbil is still attached to the mother plant. The bulbils are rich in starch and are a preferred food for <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigans</b> (Lagopus mutus) and reindeer; they are also occasionally used by Arctic people. Alpine bistort flowers in June and July.|$|R
25|$|Although absent or rare in {{some areas}} where the golden eagle occurs, this {{is by far the}} most {{significant}} family of birds in the diet of golden eagles, making up 10.3% of their known prey. In Scandinavia and the Baltic States, grouse are the primary prey for these eagles, comprising between 47.6% and 63.3% of their diet, and displacing mammals altogether. The main prey species in most of this sizeable area is the largest species of grouse, the western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), supplemented by its cousins, the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia). However, in the northernmost parts of Scandinavia, these are replaced by the smaller willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus muta). A study in Belarus showed grouse were the most common family of prey at 47.8% of the eagle diet. In Estonia, the prey base is more varied, but grouse were still the most represented bird family, comprising 18.1%. The red grouse, a race of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus scotica), and the <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (also called just ptarmigan) occur heavily in the golden eagle's diet in parts of Scotland, up to 47.8% in one study. One paper in Alaska showed that the two ptarmigan species (primarily the more abundant willow) made up 49.1% of the remains in a golden eagle pair's nest, making it the only known study in North America where birds were more prevalent in the diet than mammals. Other reports from Alaska show the willow ptarmigan as secondary prey. In some other areas, grouse are taken only as supplemental prey. A study in the Italian Alps revealed grouse made up 19.4% of nest remains and were the most common avian prey. In eastern Washington state, sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus) was the second most significant prey species (at 13%) after yellow-bellied marmot. Considered globally, it is likely that every species of grouse is prey of the golden eagle at least somewhere.|$|E
500|$|About thirty {{species of}} bird are found on Svalbard, {{most of which}} are migratory. The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabirds, with about 20 million {{individuals}} during late summer. The most common are little auk, northern fulmar, thick-billed murre and black-legged kittiwake. Sixteen species are on the IUCN Red List. Particularly Bjørnøya, Storfjorden, Nordvest-Spitsbergen and Hopen are important breeding ground for seabirds. The Arctic tern has the furthest migration, all the way to Antarctica. Only two songbirds migrate to Svalbard to breed: the snow bunting and the wheatear. <b>Rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> is the only bird to overwinter.

2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl may hunt {{at least}} 300 species of bird. In Europe, {{the most common}} avian prey species are the {{normally}} feral or domestic [...] rock pigeons (Columba livia), although the [...] common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) can be locally even more significant. In the Netherlands, the common wood pigeon {{is the most important}} prey species, making up 37.3% by number and 38.3% by biomass. Yet another, smaller study of the Netherlands found the rock pigeon to be the primary prey species. In a dietary study from Luxembourg, the common wood pigeon was the most frequent prey species, making 19% of the remains by number. A study from Romania listed the rock pigeon was the second most frequently recorded prey behind only the Romanian hamster and the largest contributed of biomass. Unusually, in the Netherlands, birds were the primary food in both number (77.6%) and biomass (72%). Also, in Luxembourg, eagle-owls hunted birds in general were more regularly than mammals, as nearly 70% of prey remains there were avian. At least six other species of pigeon and dove have also been recorded as prey. However, perhaps the most significant contributor of prey at the family level is the corvids. The [...] carrion crow (Corvus corone) is the second most widely recorded avian prey species in Europe and, locally, good numbers are also taken of [...] hooded crow (Corvus cornix), [...] western jackdaws (Corvus monedula), [...] Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), [...] common ravens (Corvus corax), [...] rooks (Corvus corone), two species each of magpie and chough and the [...] spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), in rough descending order of reportage in the eagle-owl’s diet. In Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the carrion crow was the most frequently recorded bird among an exceptionally diverse recorded prey base including than 65 bird species there (although birds only comprised 27% of the prey numbers overall). Unlike smaller passerines, corvids roost in numbers in relatively open spots, which make them fairly vulnerable to a predator as stealthy and powerful as the eagle-owl. [...] More than 17 species of gamebirds have been recorded in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet but they are normally taken in small numbers. There are, however, exceptions. In one study conducted in lower Austria, the most frequently identified prey species was the [...] grey partridge (Perdix perdix), which is the most widely reported gamebird prey for eagle-owls in Europe. One study of a “primeval” forested region of Finland found various grouse species to be the most significant contributor of biomass, namely in descending order the [...] western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the [...] black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the [...] hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). In inland areas of Norway, the large forest grouse were also significant biomass contributors. The same forest grouse species were also found to be significant to diet along the Pechora River in Russia. Other gamebirds can be important secondary prey species in different parts of Europe: the [...] red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) in western Europe, the [...] rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and the [...] <b>rock</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus mutus) in alpine highlands, the [...] ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) in eastern Europe and the [...] willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in the sub-Arctic zone. In Turkey, the most significant prey by number was the [...] chukar (Alectoris chukar), comprising 20.5% of remains. A Korean study in two habitat types (forest and field) found that ring-necked pheasants were the main prey species, making up an average of 19.33% by number and 34.81% by biomass. Other birds of prey are perhaps second only to pigeons and corvids amongst avian contributors to the diet (their ecological relationships with eagle-owls are explored in more detail below).|$|E
