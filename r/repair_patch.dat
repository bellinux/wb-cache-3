This study determines key mechanical properties of rotator cuff <b>repair</b> <b>patches,</b> including establishing values for toughness and measuring the shear properties of <b>repair</b> <b>patches</b> and human rotator cuff tendons. We hypothesized that different repair grafts would (1) have varying material parameters, and (2) not all have mechanical properties similar to human rotator cuff tendons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight specimens each from the Restore, GraftJacket, Zimmer Collagen Repair, and SportsMesh <b>repair</b> <b>patches</b> were tested to failure in tension and for suture pullout. We assessed ultimate tensile strength, tensile (Young's) modulus, and failure strain. This study also established toughness values and shear data. Storage modulus was calculated using dynamic shear analysis for the patches and 18 samples of normal rotator cuff tendon. RESULTS: We report significant variability in important mechanical properties of <b>repair</b> <b>patches,</b> with the mechanical parameters of the patches diverting variously-and often significantly-from values for human rotator cuff tendon. CONCLUSIONS: The repair grafts tested all displayed significant variation in their mechanical properties and had at least some reduced parameters compared with human rotator cuff tendons.

40|$|Abstract: Concrete <b>patch</b> <b>repair</b> is {{becoming}} an very important facet of the civil construction industry when considering the very large quantity of exposed concrete surfaces requiring maintenance and rehabilitation during its design life cycle. <b>Patch</b> <b>repairs</b> are {{more often than not}} done with a specialized polymer-modified mortar which requires adequate quality control and quality assurance during application and curing to ensure long-term success. Unfortunately, there have been many <b>patch</b> <b>repair</b> projects where there has been poor performance of the <b>patch</b> <b>repairs</b> resulting in. Ddebonding, cracking and discolouration. are evidence of such poor performance. In this paper, poor or inadequate quality control during the <b>patch</b> <b>repair</b> process is investigated as one of the possible reasons for this poor performance and premature failure. It is postulated that {{because of the lack of}} adequate knowledge and understanding of the repair material and the repair process by the various stakeholders (applicator, supplier, consultant and client), deficiencies in the quality control and quality assurance before, during and after the repair project often exists. In many <b>patch</b> <b>repair</b> projects, the responsibility for the successful completion of the <b>patch</b> <b>repair</b> work and the assessment of long term performance of <b>patch</b> <b>repairs</b> is not fully embraced by all of the parties involved. This postulation has led to the research, by using questionnaires designed specifically for the four different stakeholder categories of the concrete repair industry. The results indicate that there is very little discussion amongst the stakeholders regarding quality control and acceptance criteria when performing concrete <b>patch</b> <b>repairs,</b> neither for the identification of <b>patch</b> <b>repair</b> failure directly after the completion of the <b>patch</b> <b>repair,</b> nor for long term performance of the <b>patch</b> <b>repairs...</b>|$|R

50|$|In humans, {{mutations}} {{affecting the}} NER DNA repair pathway cause the disease xeroderma pigmentosum or XP. Normal UV and sunlight exposure generates DNA mutations (particularly pyrimidine dimers) in epidermal cells {{that must be}} continually repaired through NER. XP patients are particularly sensitive to sun exposure and generally must stay indoors during the day, using heavy sunscreens to prevent skin damage and susceptibility to skin cancer. NER occurs through a programmed set of steps that includes recognition of the damaged site (probably by sensing an unpaired bubble at the mutation site), nicking the DNA at upstream and downstream sites, excising the damaged DNA, then filling in the single-stranded DNA gap using a polymerase, with the opposite strand serving as a template for the proper sequence for the <b>repair</b> <b>patch.</b> Since multiple proteins are involved in NER, different XP patients may have different gene mutations. Cells having different NER gene mutations can complement each other, when the cells are fused together, to reestablish DNA repair since one cell line has an intact enzyme that is defective or missing in the other cell line. Thus, XP {{can be divided into}} complementation groups based on which enzyme is defective in the NER pathway http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/20/5/991.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} two {{procedures for}} determining the interfacial shrinkage stresses in a <b>repair</b> <b>patch.</b> The first is an analytical approach based on the analogy of a bimetallic strip undergoing contraction (shrinkage). The second is a semi-empirical procedure based on strain monitoring of in situ repairs to in-service bridges. The procedures determine conversion factors to relate the specified properties of the repair materials to their in situ properties in a field <b>repair</b> <b>patch.</b> For example, the shrinkage of a <b>repair</b> <b>patch</b> {{is influenced by the}} volume–surface effect, site temperature and relative humidity which are not considered in repair material specification. Creep is initiated in situ by differential shrinkage stresses in the repair material and is determined by adopting an effective elastic modulus approach. Both procedures require the basic material properties (elastic modulus, shrinkage, creep) and geometrical details (width, depth) of the <b>repair</b> <b>patch.</b> The analytical approach incorporates the repair material creep coefficient to predict the interfacial tensile stresses. Alternatively, it uses a less rigorous, elastic approach that omits creep. The creep approach provides higher accuracy whereas the elastic approach overestimates stresses since relaxation by creep is neglected. The elastic approach is recommended for design due to its simplicity and the in-built factor of safety provided by the overestimation of tensile stress. The semi-empirical approach uses an expression derived from long-term field data to determine the strain (and consequently stresses) at the interface of the <b>repair</b> <b>patch</b> and the substrate concrete. The procedures predict the maximum interfacial tensile stress during the service life of a <b>repair</b> <b>patch.</b> They can be used to design crack-free repair patches and optimise repair material selection through {{a better understanding of the}} interaction between the <b>repair</b> <b>patch</b> and substrate concrete. </p...|$|E

Various kinds of <b>patch</b> <b>repair</b> materials with short fibers have been developed and used. Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) which provides multiple cracking and strain hardening behavior {{is also one of}} the attractive materials for a <b>patching</b> <b>repair.</b> It promotes the narrow crack width that gives resistance to penetration of substances such as chloride ions, water and so forth, and tensile capacity and anti-spalling performance to repaired structures.

In the laboratory beams were repaired using hand-applied repairs. Repairs to beams in two highway, bridges were carried out using both hand-applied and flowing repairs. The repair materials used were commercial products of wide-ranging properties (shrinkage, creep and elastic modulus). Both low stiffness repair materials of elastic modulus, E-rm, less than the substrate E-sub, and high stiffness repair materials (E-rm > E-sub) were used. The repairs were applied in the tensile zone of the beams. Strain distributions in the different phases of repair patches were monitored under service loading for a period of up to 240 weeks.
