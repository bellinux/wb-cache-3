The Royal Star Venture has a 67.1 in wheelbase. Among the {{standard}} features are a trunk-mounted CD player, a full AM/FM/tape stereo system with integrated CB (not available on Australian imports), and electronic cruise control. The bike's sound system consists of a four speaker, surround-sound stereo with two speakers mounted in the fairing and a further two mounted in the pillion back rest. Volume automatically regulates once the bike is mobile and reaches cruising speed. The shock absorbers are air adjustable for pre-load to compensate for different loads. The bike has a large trunk and side panniers, all lockable with the ignition key. There are two helmet locks, one on either side beneath the trunk that are also operated by the ignition key. The seats are either traditional flat panel, or pillow top depending on the model and year.|$|E

Authentication and security based on “what you are? ” rather than what you have? Like Identity Card, Physical Key and what you know? Like Password. Iris recognition a relatively new biometric technology, has great advantages, such as variability, stability and security, thus {{it is the most}} promising for high security environments. To determine the performance and recognition system a database grayscale eye images were used. Iris is part of eye between eyelids and surrounding. Four different algorithms were designed for verifying Irises viz., 1. Circular-Mellin algorithm, 2. Canny edge detection algorithm, these two algorithms are used for detect the Iris boundaries, 3. Harr wavelet algorithm, 4. Embedded-tree zero wavelet algorithms, 5. Fuzzy neural network algorithm used to extract the deterministic patterns in a person’s Iris in the form of feature vector. Identity is done {{with the help of the}} Hamming Distance operator...|$|E

50|$|Grisone is {{well known}} for his rather forceful, {{sometimes}} cruel, methods of training. He was influenced by the famous general Xenophon, especially in the positioning of the <b>rider's</b> <b>seat</b> and aids, but he appears to have given up the part where Greek master advocates the gentle training and riding of the horse.|$|R
5000|$|Accordingly, {{a saddle}} {{designed}} for a specific discipline will attempt to place a rider naturally at the most suitable position for the anticipated activity of the horse.

5|$|The ride {{consists}} of a single Maurer Söhne X-Car train which holds 12 riders. The train features two cars, each of which <b>seats</b> <b>riders</b> in three rows of two. <b>Riders</b> are <b>seated</b> in the open carriage and are restrained by a lap bar.|$|R
50|$|The Western Pleasure <b>rider's</b> <b>seat</b> is deep, {{with a long}} stirrup, {{to assist}} the horse in driving deeply from the rear and {{elevating}} the shoulders. Reins are kept loose and relaxed, though quiet and subtle rein signals are still used. While equitation of the rider is not judged in a pleasure class, a properly positioned rider will obtain a better performance from the horse.|$|R
50|$|Key West Rapids is a one-or-two person {{water slide}} at Adventure Island in Tampa, Florida, {{operated}} by SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment. The 700 ft.-long slide takes its <b>riders,</b> <b>seated</b> on tubes, down {{a course that}} includes gushers, pools, water mines, and 3 terraces of water, that slow the tubes to a near halt so that staffers can redirect the tubes down {{the remainder of the}} course.|$|R
50|$|The ride has two 16-foot long arms, {{each with}} an {{enclosed}} car {{at one end}} and a counterweight at the other. Each car holds four <b>riders</b> <b>seated</b> in pairs facing opposite directions making the maximum occupancy eight riders. Propelled by an electric motor, the arms swing in directions opposite to each other until they 'loop' taking the riders upside down. The minimum rider height requirement is 46 inches tall.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{lasts for}} 36 seconds and {{is made up}} of a 1,300 foot-long steel track that reaches speeds of up to 38 miles per hour and heights of up to 44 feet. Each train has 8 rows, with 2 seats in each row, and the ride can {{accommodate}} up to 900 passengers per hour. Each <b>rider's</b> <b>seat</b> is shaped like a horse, and the rider straddles the saddle seat to create the feeling that they are riding on a horse. An automated restraint system secures the <b>rider</b> in their <b>seat,</b> pressing against his/her lower back, allowing the upper body to move fairly freely.|$|R

50|$|First, The Messenger statue, a {{sculpture}} in bronze with very dark patination completed by David Wynne, OBE in 1981 {{of a large}} horse and rider. The horse, with a slightly raised left leg, looks towards the railway station. The <b>rider,</b> <b>seated</b> bareback, raises his left {{hand in the air}} above his head and his right hand to his mouth, as if calling. It is fully life-size and mounted on a 7-foot plinth of marble and granite slabs. The total height is 150 inches.|$|R
25|$|In a half-seat position, the <b>rider's</b> <b>seat</b> {{bones are}} lifted {{out of the}} saddle, and only the pelvis has contact. It is used for jumping when some seat aid may be necessary, {{especially}} for sharp turns, when riding downhills, on the approach to potentially spooky fences, or when the rider wishes to collect the stride. This seat is a compromise, allowing the jumping rider to have greater control than in two-point, but still keeping {{the majority of the}} rider's weight off the horse's back.|$|R
2500|$|To {{lengthen}} the canter, {{the rider}} uses {{his or her}} legs against the horse's sides in rhythm with the gait. The leg aids should be applied as the hind legs are engaging. This {{is the time when}} the <b>rider's</b> <b>seat</b> moves forward in the canter stride. Additionally, the rider should engage the seat {{at the same time as}} the leg aids are used, [...] "rolling" [...] is forward with the canter motion. Contact may be lightened, but should not be dropped. The rider should not lean forward.|$|R
50|$|In {{only one}} {{significant}} respect does the underbone {{differ from the}} conventional motorcycle - there is no frame member or fuel tank between the seat base and the headstock. Generally the fuel tank is under the <b>riders</b> <b>seat.</b> The underbone arrangement improves ease of mounting and dismounting and contributes to the cross-gender appeal of the layout as an around-town shopping and commuter vehicle. The engine size of a typical underbone is generally between 50 cc and up to about 150 cc, though much bigger ones are available.|$|R

50|$|Proponents of bareback riding {{argue that}} riding {{in this fashion}} is natural, allows {{considerable}} communication with the horse, and improves a rider's balance. The drawbacks include {{a higher risk of}} injury due to an increased risk of falling off the horse, the potential to develop poor riding form, and the possibility of considerable discomfort to both horse and rider due to the absence of a supporting tree and any padding between the <b>rider's</b> <b>seat</b> bones and the horse's spine. Over time, it is more fatiguing to both horse and rider to ride bareback.|$|R
50|$|The statue {{features}} {{a horse and}} rider, created in bronze with very dark patination. It is located directly outside the main entrance to Quadrant House (in the Quadrant), adjacent to Sutton railway station. The horse, with a slightly raised left leg, looks towards the station. The <b>rider,</b> <b>seated</b> bareback, raises his left {{hand in the air}} above his head and his right hand to his mouth, as if calling out. It is fully life-size and mounted on a 7-foot plinth of marble and granite slabs. The total height is 150 inches.|$|R
5000|$|Between fences, {{the rider}} may ride in {{two-point}} position, where the thighs take up weight of rider, not the seatbones. Another position used in galloping, when additional control is needed, is the [...] "half seat," [...] which resembles two-point position, but the <b>rider's</b> <b>seat</b> bones lightly touch the saddle. At slower speeds, or if considerable control is needed, the rider may {{sit down on}} the horse, where the seat bones touch the saddle. (Depending on regional terminology, both the half seat and a full seat are sometimes referred to as [...] "three point" [...] position) ...|$|R
5000|$|In the rotatory gait, {{often called}} [...] "cross-firing," [...] "cross-cantering," [...] or a [...] "disunited canter," [...] the horse {{balances}} in beat two on both legs {{on one side}} of its body, and in beats one and three on the other side. This produces a distinctive rotary or twisting motion in the <b>rider's</b> <b>seat.</b> For the majority of horses and riders this rotary motion is awkward, unbalanced and could be dangerous. [...] Eadweard Muybridge illustrated both rotatory and transverse canters but did not stress the difference of lead.|$|R

25|$|The {{nephew of}} one of the men {{responsible}} for popularity of the penny-farthing was largely responsible for its demise. James Starley had built the Ariel (spirit of the air) high-wheeler in 1870; but this was a time of innovation, and when chain drives were upgraded so that each link had a small roller, higher and higher speeds became possible without the large wheel. In 1885, Starley's nephew John Kemp Starley took these new developments to launch the Rover Safety Bicycle, so-called because the <b>rider,</b> <b>seated</b> much lower and farther behind the front wheel contact point, was less prone to a header.|$|R
2500|$|The canter may be ridden {{in three}} ways: sitting, half-seat, and {{two-point}}. In a half-seat and/or two-point position, as described below, the <b>rider's</b> <b>seat</b> is raised {{out of the}} saddle to some extent, the upper body leaning forward slightly, enough to balance over the horse's center of gravity, and more weight is carried in the stirrups. [...] This position provides more freedom for the horse, especially over rough terrain or when jumping. [...] When a rider sits the canter, the seat remains firmly in the saddle at all times, allowing a more secure position and greater control over the horse.|$|R
5000|$|A Feet First (FF) Motorcycle is a {{class of}} {{motorcycle}} design that seeks {{to look at the}} two-wheeled concept afresh, and create a new form of practical personal transport. The name [...] "feet first" [...] (also referred to as [...] "feet forward") was first used by Royce Creasey and refers to the <b>rider's</b> <b>seating</b> position, with feet ahead in a position (like a car), rather than below and astride, as with conventional bikes. As there are other types of motorcycle (e.g. choppers) that have a 'feet forward' position, an alternative term sometimes used is Advanced Single Track Vehicle.|$|R
