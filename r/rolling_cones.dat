5000|$|Rolling cone {{motion is}} the rolling motion {{generated}} by a <b>cone</b> <b>rolling</b> over another <b>cone.</b> In <b>rolling</b> <b>cone</b> motion, {{at least one of}} the cones is convex, while the other cone may be either convex, or concave, or a flat surface (a flat surface can be regarded as a special case of a cone whose apex angle equals [...] ). The distinguishing characteristic of a <b>rolling</b> <b>cone,</b> in relation to other axially symmetrical rollers (cylinder, sphere, round disk), is that while rolling on a flat surface, the cone's center of gravity performs a circular motion rather than a linear one. Another unique characteristic is that one of its points (its apex) is at rest throughout the entire motion.|$|R

40|$|Anomalous {{spectral}} shift of transmission peaks is {{observed in a}} Fabry-P´ erot cavity filled with a chiral anisotropic medium. The effective refractive index value resides out of the interval between the ordinary and the extraordinary refractive indices. The {{spectral shift}} is explained by contribution of a geometric phase. The problem is solved analytically using the approximate Jones matrix method, numerically using the accurate Berreman method, and geometrically using the generalized Mauguin-Poincar´ e <b>rolling</b> <b>cone</b> method. The o-mode blueshift is measured for a 4 -methoxybenzylidene- 4 ?-n-butylaniline twisted-nematic layer inside the Fabry-P´ erot cavity. The twist is electrically induced due to the homeoplanar-twisted configuration transition in an ionic-surfactant-doped liquid crystal layer.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel sphericon-shaped {{magnetic}} millirobot (SSMM) that can roll {{on a variety}} of surfaces. The SSMM comprises four identical half cones with a cylindrical magnet inserted into the geometric center. It can roll forward or backward on a surface with repeated <b>rolling</b> <b>cone</b> motions (wobbling motions). Since a rolling SSMM develops its entire surface by means of line contact, a relatively large maximum static friction force can make the SSMM move on a surface steadily and effectively. In this work, a new type of external wobbling magnetic field (EWMF) was also derived to manipulate the SSMM’s rolling motions precisely. Then, the controlled rolling motions of prototype SSMMs under various surface conditions were demonstrated to examine the rolling ability of the proposed SSMM...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{properties}} of a precessing rotor or a coupled system of precessing rotors (gyroscopes), where a special chaotic behavior in the precession angle can be found if the change of rotor angular velocity is linearly coupled by (an) holonomy to the precession angular velocity and angle. The linear coupling provides for <b>rolling</b> <b>cone</b> paths and allows spinning up and controlling the rotor simply by forcing precession at special quantum magic precession angles. The geometric phase induced by the curved path of the rotor or external curvature {{and part of the}} coupling increases with precession angle. This leads to bifurcations in coupling strength resulting in chaotic precession. As an alternative to the SO(3) matrix or quaternion representation the treatment of the three coupled rotations is here based on Euler’s dynamical equations. First, the classical Magic Angle Precession (MAP) dynamics is realized by a geometric or mechanical condition (type I, transcendental solutions), where it can be experimentally demonstrated how MAP can “slave” angular degrees of freedom allowing the external control of high-frequent spin by slow oscillations. MAP is found in a commercial fitness device and is conceptually approached via Chua’s electric circuit. Second, the quantum-gravitational MAP (type II, rational solutions) with discrete precession angles is analyzed on a deeper level requiring intrinsic curvature/relativistic effects adjusting holonomy to quantum numbers. Third, a macroscopic network of MAP elements is presented as a discretetime recurrent neural network synchronizing to one common MAP I/II dynamics under special pairing and symmetry conditions (type III). In all three cases MAP can be treated as a time-discrete chaotic system with singularities given by the cosine map with several possible links to interesting applications on all scales...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{advanced}} and exact geometric description of nonlinear precession dynamics modeling very accurately natural and artificial couplings showing Lorentz symmetry is derived. In the linear description {{it is usually}} ignored that the geometric phase of relativistic motion couples back to the orbital motion providing for a non-linear recursive precession dynamics. The high coupling strength in the nonlinear case {{is found to be}} a gravitomagnetic charge proportional to the precession angle and angular velocity generated by geometric phases, which are induced by highspeed relativistic rotations and are relevant to propulsion technologies but also to basic interactions. In the quantum range some magic precession angles indicating strong coupling in a phase-locked chaotic system are identified, emerging from a discrete time dynamical system known as the cosine map showing bifurcations at special precession angles relevant to heavy nuclei stability. The “Magic Angle Precession ” (MAP) dynamics can be simulated and visualized by <b>cones</b> <b>rolling</b> in or on each other, where the apex and precession angles are indexed by spin, charge or precession quantum numbers, and corresponding magic angles. The most extreme relativistic warping and twisting effect is given by the Dirac spinor half spin constellation with “Hyperdiamond ” MAP, which resembles quark confinement...|$|R
40|$|High value {{crops such as}} peas for {{the frozen}} {{vegetable}} market have to be harvested at the optimum point for quality, regardless of field conditions. Six wheeled pea harvesters with a gross weight of 27 t, giving a wheel load of 4. 5 t are required to move from field to field with optimum timeliness. In order to achieve road speeds of 25 km/h an inflation pressure of 2. 2 bar {{is required for the}} specific tyre load speed rating. Typically, in field conditions, this inflation pressure is not reduced and therefore the likelihood of soil damage is increased. This study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} tyre section width and inflation pressure on rolling resistance, rut depth and sub-surface soil deformation. Under controlled laboratory conditions three tyres, at three inflation pressures, with a load of 4. 5 t were passed over a soil at three different initial bulk densities. Measurements of dry bulk density, rut depth, <b>rolling</b> resistance, <b>cone</b> penetrometer resistance and soil deformation through the profile were taken before and after the passage of the tyres. The results show that by increasing the tyre size and reducing the inflation pressure the depth at which compaction occurs and rut depth decrease by 44 %. The 800 mm section tyre causes less compaction than any of the other tyres tested especially when inflated to 1. 6 bar. Rolling resistance is reduced when the tyre is inflated to the optimum for each tyre. The change in bulk density when plotted against either initial bulk density or penetration resistance results in a set of curves which can be used by the manufacturer, farmer or operator to select the correct tyre section width and inflation pressure for field conditions. As a result of this study the harvester manufacturers are investigating the engineering requirements of increasing tyre section width to 800 mm and are now equipping pea harvesters with central tyre inflation systems. The benefits of which would be to significantly reduce the amount of soil compaction, reduce rolling resistance and save the operator £ 455 000 per annum in fuel costs...|$|R

40|$|Lightning, one of nature’s most {{destructive}} forces, continues to wreck havoc on lives and property especially in today’s electronic environment. It {{has been shown}} by field experiences that telecommunication towers {{are one of the}} preferential points for direct lightning strike. This is mainly connected with the specific features of their construction where the presence of high telecommunication towers and their topographical location mostly at an open area or at hills. The potential of lightning strike toward communication tower is high. A telecommunication tower located at Parit Raja town was chosen as a case study. The location of the tower is good to channel the coverage toward the community. Unfortunately this tower is very vulnerable to lightning strike and can giving impact to the surrounding buildings located nearby the tower itself such as mosque, petrol pump, post office and the Bank Simpanan National (BSN) bank. This thesis presents work that look at the current protection scheme against the lightning strike and the effect on a telecommunication tower system and the surrounding. Analysis study had been made towards existing protection component or system and their effectiveness in mitigating the lightning strike impact on the Parit Raja tower system. The investigation of the lightning protection system used by the communication tower is sufficient enough to direct the overload voltages of a lightning strike. Also, the analysis on the existing grounding earthing system is able to accommodate and dissipate the surge current to the earth. The method such as <b>rolling</b> sphere and <b>cone</b> protection had been used to identify the safety area on the site due to direct strike. Some suggestions to enhance the tower system protection such as installation external ground bus bar, radial system, and new installation for connection of coaxial cable and underground cable. Overall from this project, the weaknesses of system protection were identified in the tower Parit Raja and the proposal as improvement for the protection scheme in the future...|$|R
