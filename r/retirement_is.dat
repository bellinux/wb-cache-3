5|$|After Ottawa {{lost the}} Stanley Cup to the Montreal Wanderers in 1906, McGee retired at just 23years old. His <b>retirement</b> <b>is</b> {{attributed}} to his government position not {{allowing him to}} travel. He had briefly retired after his brother Jim's death in 1904. McGee retired after scoring 135 goals in only 45games (both league and challenge). Only Russell Bowie rivals his average of 3 goals per game.|$|E

5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of <b>Retirement</b> <b>is</b> a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, the poem {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature {{in order to fulfill}} a moral obligation to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis.|$|E

25|$|Overall, income after {{retirement}} {{can come}} from state pensions, occupational pensions, private savings and investments (private pension funds, owned housing), donations (e.g., by children), and social benefits. On a personal level, {{the rising cost of}} living during <b>retirement</b> <b>is</b> a serious concern to many older adults. Health care costs play an important role.|$|E
25|$|The cost {{of health}} care in <b>retirement</b> <b>is</b> large because people tend to be ill more {{frequently}} in later life. Most countries provide universal health insurance coverage for seniors, although in the United States many people retire before they become eligible for Medicare at age 65. In 2006, Medicare Part D went into effect in the United States, expanding benefits to include prescription drug coverage.|$|E

25|$|Early {{retirement}} {{can be at}} any age, but {{is generally}} before the age (or tenure) needed for eligibility for support and funds from government or employer-provided sources. Thus, early-retirees rely on their own savings and investments to be initially self-supporting, until they start receiving such external support. Early <b>retirement</b> <b>is</b> also a euphemistic term for accepting termination of employment before retirement age {{as part of the}} employer's labor force rationalization. In this case, a monetary inducement may be involved.|$|E
25|$|In the aftermath, the Army sent {{hundreds}} of soldiers {{to capture the}} rebels.

Later Humala was pardoned by Congress and allowed to return to military duty. He was sent as military attaché to Paris, then to Seoul until December 2004, when he was forcibly retired.

25|$|Many {{people choose}} to retire when they are {{eligible}} for private or public pension benefits, although some are forced to retire when physical conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer (by illness or accident) or {{as a result of}} legislation concerning their position. In most countries, the idea of <b>retirement</b> <b>is</b> of recent origin, being introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Previously, low life expectancy and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until death. Germany was the first country to introduce retirement, in 1889.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} then selects one of {{the three}} from the Commission's list to become a justice. If the Governor fails to make an appointment within 60 days the choice is then made by the Chief Justice of the Kansas Supreme Court. After the first year in office, the justice undergoes a retention vote in the next general election. If the justice receives approval from a majority of electors then he or she remain in office for a 6-year term. After the conclusion of each term the justice must face another retention vote. <b>Retirement</b> <b>is</b> mandatory at age 75 or upon completion of the justice's current term.|$|E
25|$|Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) using German Socio-Economic Panel and hazard model {{find that}} Socio-demographic {{factors such as}} health and gender have a strong impact on the {{retirement}} decision: women tend to retire earlier than men, and poor health makes people go into retirement, {{particularly in the case}} of disability retirement. The relationship between health status and <b>retirement</b> <b>is</b> significant for both self-assessed and objective indicators of health status. This is similar finding to the previous research of Blau and Riphahn (1997); using individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel as well, but controlling for different variables they found that if individual has chronic health condition, then he tends to retire. Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) use better measure for health status than Blau and Riphahn (1997), because self-assessed and objective indicators of health status are better measures than chronic health condition.|$|E

25|$|Along with earning salaries, {{senators}} receive {{retirement and}} health benefits that are identical to other federal employees, and are fully vested {{after five years}} of service. Senators are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). As it is for federal employees, congressional <b>retirement</b> <b>is</b> funded through taxes and the participants' contributions. Under FERS, senators contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2% of their salary in Social Security taxes. The amount of a senator's pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest 3 years of their salary. The starting amount of a senator's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of their final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under CSRS was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.|$|E
