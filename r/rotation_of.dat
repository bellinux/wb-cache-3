50|$|In any three {{dimensional}} <b>rotation</b> {{the plane}} <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is uniquely defined. Together with the angle <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> it fully describes the rotation. Or in a continuously rotating object the rotational properties {{such as the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> {{can be described in}} terms of the plane <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> It is perpendicular to, and so is defined by and defines, an axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> so any description <b>of</b> a <b>rotation</b> in terms <b>of</b> a plane <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> can be described in terms of an axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> and vice versa. But unlike the axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> the plane generalises into other, in particular higher, dimensions.|$|R

5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E

40|$|In {{conventional}} frame methods, the lintel beams {{are assumed to}} be rigidly connected to the horizontal rigid arms such that the <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> the beams at the joints are equal to those of the rigid arms. However, this would lead to incompatibility at the joints. It is found in this study that the <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> the beams at the joints should instead be taken as the <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> the wall axis. Reformulation of the method accordingly reveals that the shear deformation of the walls should really be allowed for in the rigid arms rather than in the column elements. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|In {{classical}} physics, {{energy is}} a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate to time.

5|$|The first acyclic {{persistent}} carbene {{was reported}} in 1996, thus showing that a cyclic backbone was not necessary for their stability. Unlike the cyclic derivatives, the acyclic carbenes are flexible with respect to <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the bonds to the carbenic atom. By measuring the barrier to <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> these bonds, {{the extent of their}} double bond character could be measured, and the ylidic nature of this carbene could be determined. Like the cyclic diaminocarbenes, unhindered variants tend to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiative}} {{zone and}} the convective zone {{are separated by}} a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the radiative zone and the differential <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.|$|E
