40|$|Many {{inhalation}} exposure {{studies have}} been performed with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in different animal species. Many were targeted at respiratory irritation and/or sensitisation. As {{there is still no}} broadly accepted guideline for the performance of respiratory sensitisation tests, protocols used and endpoints investigated are numerous. In this review we collected data from those respiratory sensitisation and/or irritation studies that provided threshold or doseresponse information. Against this aim, and as TDI is a model substance for a <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitiser,</b> a great number of mechanistic studies are not cited in this paper, although they were checked for relevant information. The literature data available allow the conclusion that both respiratory irritation and sensitisation may be interdependent, and both irritation and sensitisation by TDI is a threshold phenomenon. Across species, the majority of NOAECs for respiratory sensitisation are in the range of 0. 005 to 0. 03 ppm, whereas the LOAEC is about 0. 02 to 0. 4 ppm...|$|E

This species is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strain has been established and no resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent and the high dusting potential of the preparation tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat this additive as a skin and <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> It is also considered an irritant.

The applicant seeks the re-evaluation of the product and the extension of its use to pigs for fattening, minor poultry and porcine species. Tolerance trials in chickens for fattening, laying hens and pigs showed that the animals tolerated well 100 -fold the recommended dose. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive is safe for these target species. The conclusions reached on those species can be extrapolated to minor poultry species and to minor porcine species for fattening. In the absence of adequate studies, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of Endofeed® DC for the consumer. No specific studies were provided regarding the safety for the user. Therefore, Endofeed® DC {{should be considered a}} potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential skin and <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> The results obtained in efficacy studies performed in chickens for fattening, laying hens and pigs for fattening showed that the additive has the potential to improve the performance of the animals.

The results of an in vitro chromosomal aberration test and of an in vivo comet assay indicate the presence of genotoxic activity in the product. The tolerance studies provided in target species did not indicate any adverse effect of the additive. However, due to the genotoxic hazard from the product, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on {{the safety of the}} additive for the target species. The results obtained in a repeated-dose oral toxicity study did not indicate any concern for consumer safety. However, the identity and fate of the substance causing the genotoxic effect is unknown; therefore, the source of the risk to the consumer cannot be established. Thus, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for the consumer. The product should be considered a potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential skin and <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Due to the presence of genotoxic activity in the product, any level of exposure to the additive by any route is considered hazardous. No risks to the environment are expected to result from the use of the additive in feed, and, therefore, no further environmental risk assessment is required. Based on the results obtained in the efficacy studies, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in chickens for fattening at a dose of 500 CU/kg feed and in weaned piglets at 350 CU/kg.

This speciesis considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strain has been established and as no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, for consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. The active agent is not an eye or skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent and the high dusting potential of the product tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat this additive as a <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> A total of 20 laboratory-scale ensiling studies were conducted with L. plantarum applied at 1 x 109 or 1 x 108 CFU/kg forage. In all the studies, forage containing the additive was compared with untreated control materials, and the duration of the studies was at least 90 days. L. plantarum has the potential to improve the production of silage by increasing lactic acid content and the preservation of dry matter, by reducing the pH and protein degradation. This was demonstrated in a range of easy and moderately difficult to ensile forage materials at a minimum concentration of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material and also in difficult to ensile forage materials when added at a concentration of 1 x 109 CFU/kg fresh material...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} formaldehyde is an {{aqueous solution}} containing 37 % formaldehyde and 14 % methanol. It {{is intended for}} use in all animal species at concentrations between 68 and 680 mg active substance/kg complete feed. Free and reversibly bound formaldehyde is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and joins the pool of endogenous formaldehyde. It is rapidly oxidised to formic acid further on to carbon dioxide and water. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen by inhalation. While local irritation is expected to strongly promote carcinogenesis, lower local concentrations of formaldehyde are known to produce DNA adducts. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel deems it prudent not to consider the exposure to non-irritant concentration as totally riskless. Moreover, {{on the basis of}} the present knowledge, a causal association between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia cannot be ruled out. The FEEDAP Panel estimated the oral intake of formaldehyde of consumers from food of animal origin to be 4 mg per person per day. A reliable additional exposure of consumers to formaldehyde from supplementing feedingstuffs cannot be calculated. However, the FEEDAP Panel considers that the proposed use of formaldehyde as a feed additive would not increase consumer exposure and consequently would not pose an additional risk for the consumer. A safe feed concentration for all animal species and categories could not be determined. Formaldehyde is a strong irritant, a potent skin and <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Measures should be taken to ensure that the respiratory tract, skin and eyes of any person handling the product are not exposed to any dust, mist or vapour generated by the use of formaldehyde. The use of formaldehyde in animal nutrition is not expected to pose a risk for the environment.

To this end, the best way forward would be to follow an integrated testing approach.

40|$|This is the 60 th Report of {{a series}} of {{workshops}} organised by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). The main goal of ECVAM, as defined in 1993 by its Scientific Advisory Committee, is to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods that have scientific relevance and that reduce, refine or replace the use of laboratory animals. One of the first measures taken by ECVAM was the implementation of procedures that would enable it to become better informed about the state-of-the-art of non-animal test development and validation, and the potential for the possible incorporation of alternative tests into regulatory procedures. The decision was taken that this would be best achieved by the organisation of ECVAM Workshops each addressing a specific topic, and at which selected groups of independent international experts would review the status of various types of in vitro tests and their potential application, and make recommendations about the best way forward. A workshop on Chemical Respiratory Allergy, chaired by Ian Kimber, was held at ECVAM from 11 – 13 October 2006. 	Chemical respiratory allergy, typically associated with rhinitis and/or asthma, is considered to be an adverse health effect of high concern. For example, under the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) system, <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisers</b> are included among substances of higher risk, together with CMRs (chemicals that are Carcinogenic, Mutagenic or toxic for Reproduction), and are regulated under Annex 1 of Directive 67 / 548 /EEC, which contains a list of dangerous substances, including <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> Although some animal methods (such as measurements of IgE antibody responses in mice, or specific pulmonary reactions in guinea-pigs) are mentioned in this Directive, these methods have not been validated, nor are they widely accepted by the scientific community. 	At present, chemical respiratory sensitisation hazard is assigned to chemicals on the basis of epidemiological evidence or, in the case of diisocyanates, as a default classification. Therefore, there is clearly a need to develop new and improved methods for hazard identification and characterisation, and it was the objective of this workshop to explore what opportunities might now be available.

40|$|PhD (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Background: Platinum group metal (PGM) {{mining and}} {{refining}} {{is a large}} constituent of the mining sector of South Africa and contributes significantly to the gross domestic product. The PGMs include the rare metals platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir) and osmium (Os). During the refining process workers are potentially exposed to various chemical forms of the PGMs via the respiratory and dermal exposure routes. Historically, emphasis has been on respiratory exposure while the extent of skin exposure is still unknown. Among the different forms of PGMs, the salts are potential sensitisers, with platinum being a known <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Workers occupationally exposed to platinum and rhodium have reported respiratory as well as skin symptoms. However, it is unknown if these metals in the salt form are permeable through human skin, and whether dermal exposure could contribute to sensitisation. Evidence regarding differences between African and Caucasian skin anatomy and structure, as well as permeation through skin is contradictory, and no information is available on metal permeation through African skin. The in vitro diffusion method has been utilised successfully in occupational toxicology to demonstrate that metals such as chromium, cobalt and nickel, to name a few, permeate through human skin. The permeability of platinum and rhodium has not been investigated previously. Aims and objectives: The research aim was to obtain insight into the permeability of platinum and rhodium through intact human skin and to provide information needed to determine the potential health risk following dermal exposure to these metals. The specific objectives included: (i) to critically review the in vitro diffusion method {{that is used to}} determine the permeability of metals through human skin, (ii) to investigate the permeation of potassium tetrachloroplatinate (K 2 PtCl 4) and rhodium chloride (RhCl 3) as representative PGM salts through intact human skin over a 24 -hour period, (iii) to evaluate the difference in permeability of platinum and rhodium through intact human skin, (iv) to evaluate the difference in permeability of platinum through intact African and Caucasian human skin. Methods: Abdominal skin obtained after cosmetic procedures was obtained from five female Caucasian and three female African donors between the ages of 28 and 52 with ethical approval from the North-West University. Full thickness skin tissue was mounted in a vertical Franz diffusion cell. Skin integrity was tested by measuring the electrical resistance across the skin before and after conclusion of the experiments, using a Tinsley LCR Data bridge Model 6401. The donor solution of 32. 46 mg K 2 PtCl 4 in 50 ml of synthetic sweat (pH 6. 5), and 43. 15 mg RhCl 3 in 50 ml of synthetic sweat (pH 6. 5) was prepared. The donor solution was applied to the stratum corneum side of the skin and physiological receptor solution (pH 7. 35) was added to the receptor compartment. The concentration of the metals in the receptor solution was determined by high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry after extraction at various intervals during the 24 hours of the study. After completion of the study, the skin was rinsed four times to remove any platinum or rhodium remaining on the skin surface. The skin was digested using hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid during different steps to determine the mass of the metals remaining in the skin by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Results: The comparison of published in vitro skin permeation studies involving metals is impeded by the variations in the experimental design and dissimilarity in the reporting of results. Differences in experimental design included, most noticeably, the use of various donor and receptor solutions, different temperatures wherein the receptor compartment was placed, differences in skin thickness and variations in exposed skin surface areas. The metals considered in the review, namely chromium, cobalt, gold, lead, mercury, nickel, platinum, rhodium and silver, permeate through intact human skin under physiological conditions. Large variations in the permeability results were observed, with the notable differences in methodology as the probable reason. Results obtained from the in vitro experiments indicate that platinum and rhodium permeated through intact Caucasian skin with flux values of 0. 12 and 0. 05 ng/cm 2 /h, respectively. The cumulative mass of platinum (2. 57 ng/cm 2) that permeated after 24 hours of exposure was statistically significantly (p = 0. 016) higher than rhodium permeation (1. 11 ng/cm 2). The mass of platinum (1 459. 47 ng/cm 2) retained in the skin after 24 hours of exposure was statistically significantly (p < 0. 001) higher than rhodium retention (757. 04 ng/cm 2). The comparison of permeability between two different racial groups indicates that platinum permeated through the skin of both racial groups with the flux through African skin found as 1. 93 ng/cm 2 /h and 0. 27 ng/cm 2 /h through Caucasian skin. The cumulative mass of platinum permeated after 24 hours of exposure was statistically significantly (p = 0. 044) higher through African skin (37. 52 ng/cm 2) than Caucasian skin (5. 05 ng/cm 2). The retention of platinum in African skin (3 064. 13 ng/cm 2) was more than twice the mass retained in Caucasian skin (1 486. 32 ng/cm 2). Conclusions: The in vitro diffusion method is an applicable method to determine skin permeability of metals. However, the experimental design and format of data reporting should be standardised to enable comparison of results from different studies. Platinum and rhodium permeated through intact human skin, with platinum permeation significantly higher. African skin was significantly more permeable by platinum than Caucasian skin. Both platinum and rhodium were retained inside the skin after 24 hours of exposure, possibly forming a reservoir which could contribute to continued permeation through the skin even after removal thereof from the skin. Platinum and rhodium permeated through full thickness skin and thereby could possibly contribute to local skin symptoms such as dermatitis and urticaria found in occupationally exposed workers. By permeating through the upper layers of the skin, these metals could potentially reach the viable epidermis and contribute to sensitisation. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFlavour {{ingredients}} are {{an essential part}} of e-liquids. Their responsible selection and inclusion levels in e-liquids must be guided by toxicological principles. We propose an approach to the screening and toxicological risk assessment of flavour ingredients for e-liquids. The screening involves purity requirements and avoiding ingredients that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. Additionally, owing to the uncertainties involved in potency determination and the derivation of a tolerable level for respiratory sensitisation, we propose excluding <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> After screening, toxicological data on the ingredients should be reviewed. Inhalation-specific toxicological issues, for which no reliable safe levels can currently be derived, can lead to further ingredient exclusions. We discuss the use of toxicological thresholds of concern for flavours that lack inhalation data suitable for quantitative risk assessment. Higher toxicological thresholds of concern are suggested for flavour ingredients (170 or 980 μg/day) than for contaminant assessment (1. 5 μg/day). Analytical detection limits for measurements of potential reaction and thermal breakdown products in vaping aerosol, should be informed by the contaminant threshold. This principle leads us to recommend 5 ng/puff as an appropriate limit of detection for untargeted aerosol measurements...|$|R

40|$|Background: National {{analyses}} of mortality in England and Wales have repeatedly shown excess deaths from pneumonia in welders. During 1979 - 90 the excess was attributable largely to deaths from lobar pneumonia and pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia, limited to men of working age and apparent in other occupations with exposure to metal fumes. The findings for 1991 - 2000 were assessed and {{compared with the}} mortality pattern from asthma in occupations exposed to known <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> Methods: The Office of National Statistics supplied data on deaths by underlying cause among men aged 16 - 74 years in England and Wales during 1991 - 2000, including age and last held occupation. Data were abstracted on pneumonia for occupations with exposure to metal fumes and on asthma for occupations commonly reported to surveillance schemes as at risk of occupational asthma. The expected numbers of deaths were estimated by applying age-specific proportions of deaths by cause in the population to the total deaths by age in each occupational group. Observed and expected numbers were compared for each cause of death. Results: Among men of working age in occupations with exposure to metal fumes there was excess mortality from pneumococcal and lobar pneumonia (54 deaths vs 27. 3 expected) and from pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia (71 vs 52. 4), but no excess from these causes at older ages or from bronchopneumonia at any age. The attributable mortality from metal fume exposure was 45. 3 excess deaths compared with an estimated 62. 6 deaths from occupational asthma.

In the absence of evidence, these additives should be regarded as skin and eye irritants and potential skin sensitisers. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat these additives as <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> Given the high dusting potential of the preparations tested, there is the need to take measures to minimise inhalation exposure of workers. Eight studies with laboratory-scale silos were conducted with P. pentosaceus applied at 1 x 108 CFU/kg forage. In all the studies, which lasted for at least 90 days, the effects of adding the additive to forage were compared to untreated control materials. All three strains of P. pentosaceus have the potential to improve the production of silage by reducing the pH and increasing lactic acid concentration, resulting in an increased preservation of dry matter. There was also evidence of a significant reduction in protein breakdown as shown by the change in the ratio of ammonia/total N.

40|$|The cost {{to society}} of sick leave and {{disability}} pensions {{is currently the}} most urgent economic problem in Sweden. The availability of a large sick-listing database, Collective Group Health Insurance, AGS (in Swedish: Avtalsgruppsjukförsäkring) provides {{a rare opportunity to}} study sick leave in Sweden. Periods of sick leave exceeding 14 days are recorded together with a mandatory diagnosis by a physician, gender, age, residential area, name of the employer, and occupation. Aim: The overall aim was to investigate some determinants of sick leave because of respiratory disease, and to validate the AGS sick leave register regarding asthma. Methods: In paper I data of sick leave periods exceeding 14 days, for all manual and service employees in the private sector in Sweden during 1992 - 94 (n [...] 221, 249) were analysed with special regard to respiratory diseases and occupation. In paper 11 a validated asthma qpestionnaire was distributed to persons less than 56 years of age registered with a sick leave period starting in 1994 due to a) asthma, b) any other respiratory diagnosis and c) a random sample of 8 % of all persons registered under any other diagnosis. In papers III, IV and V a diagnosis of asthma was made using a three-stage model (questionnaire, telephone interview and clinical examination) in persons less than 56 years of age on sick leave due to any respiratory disorder. In paper III the prevalence of obesity was investigated; in paper IV differences between subjects with and without a previous asthma diagnosis were studied and in paper V the long-term effects of a structured rehabilitation programme for asthmatics were analysed. Results: The incidence of long-term (>= 90 days) sick leave due to respiratory diseases differed three times between occupations. There was a high correlation (r= 0. 80) between the incidence of long-term sick leave due to respiratory disease and long-term sick leave due to other conditions, suggesting that market and selection factors may {{play an important role in}} determining the overall risk of sick leave in various occupations. Agricultural workers, industrial workers, food industry workers and painters were occupations with an increased risk of respiratory sick leave. In the questionnaire study, asthma was found to be an underreported diagnosis, approximately by a factor of three. In the study of obesity in paper III the prevalence of obesity in asthmatics on sick leave was 20. 7 %, compared with 13. 7 % in the non-specific pain patients on sick leave and in 6. 5 % of a random general population sample (p< 0. 001). In paper IV it was shown that smoking was more prevalent in persons not diagnosed as having asthma prior to the study, than in those with a previous asthma diagnosis, (60 % vs. 41 %, p=O. 006), and symptoms were less frequently reported (p< 0. 001) by those who had not been diagnosed with asthma by a physician prior to the study. In paper V it was reported that the median number of sick leave days in the rehabilitation group was 104, and in the usual care group 167. An analysis of a subgroup consisting of persons not currently smoking with a previous diagnosis of asthma by a physician (n= 57) showed a significant effect on sick leave at three years (median number of days 63 in the rehabilitation group vs. 361 in the control group, p= 0. 042). Conclusions: Major differences regarding long-term sick leave due to respiratory disease were found among manual and service occupations. Several occupations, where exposure to <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisers</b> and irritants are known to occur, were among those where workers had an increased risk of long-term respiratory disease. There is evidence that asthma is an underreported diagnosis among persons on sick leave due to respiratory diagnosis, either because the reason for an asthma exacerbation is stated on the certificates of illness, or that asthma is not diagnosed among persons seeking medical attention due to respiratory problems. This is most evident in mild disease but also among smokers. The prevalence of asthma among persons on sick leave due to respiratory symptoms was 27 % in the questionnaire study and 43 % when the structured three-stage model for an asthma diagnosis was employed. Persons on sick leave for more than 14 days due to respiratory symptoms should therefore be clinically investigated with the suspicion of asthma. Obesity is substantially more prevalent among persons with asthma than in a general population sample, especially among women. It is, however, not clear whether the increased prevalence of obesity among asthmatics reflects a true increase of obesity in persons with asthma or whether asthma-like symptoms occur because of obesity. Obesity and asthma could also have a common primary factor. Morphological studies on obese patients with asthmatic symptoms are needed. Smoking seems to worsen asthma symptoms during exacerbations in patients with mild disease, leading to periods of sick leave where the duration is similar to that which is found in patients with more severe asthma. The extensive in-patient asthma rehabilitation programme had major effects on sick leave only for those who did not currently smoke. This could indicate that smoking is the major determinant for respiratory sick leave, regardless of cause and regardless of treatment...|$|R
