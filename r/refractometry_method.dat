40|$|Fibrinogen is an {{important}} coagulation factor and a positive acute phase protein and its levels increases in cases of inflammation infection and stress. The present research was done {{to determine whether the}} fibrinogen concentration, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) can be affected by seasonal changes. In this study, the blood of ten apparently healthy cows from around Yasouj city were taken under aseptic conditions and, then the plasma was separated. The fibrinogen concentration, was assayed by sedimentation <b>refractometry</b> <b>method,</b> PT and APTT were measurement by coagolometric method. The statistical analysis indicated that there was significant difference between the mean concentration of fibrinogen in summer and winter (P 0. 05). It is concluded that seasonal changes can affect the fibrinogen concentration but does no affect PT and APTT significantly...|$|E
40|$|A poly(ethylene oxide) -b-poly(-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) diblock {{copolymer}} was micronized into small micelle-like particles (80 nm) via dialysis-induced microphase inversion. The enzymatic biodegradation of the PCL portion of these particles in water was in situ investigated inside a recently developed novel differential refractometer. Using this <b>refractometry</b> <b>method,</b> {{we were able}} to monitor the real-time biodegradation via the refractive index change (¢n) of the dispersion because ¢n is directly proportional to the particle mass concentration. We found that the degradation rate is proportional to either the polymer or enzyme concentration. Our results directly support previous speculation {{on the basis of the}} light-scattering data that the biodegradation follows the first-order kinetics for a given enzyme concentration. This study not only leads to a better understanding of the enzymatic biodegradation of PCL, but also demonstrates a novel, rapid, noninvasive, and convenient way to test the degradability of polymers...|$|E
40|$|In {{past few}} years {{numerous}} epidemiological studies bring new evidence {{on the effects of}} particle air pollution on cardiovascular hospitalizations. The aim of our paper was to investigate the association between ambient concentrations of black smoke (BS) and daily total non-accidental cardiovascular hospitalizations in elderly in Niš. The daily mean number of all age cardiovascular hospitalizations was 12. 46 ± 6. 26 (0 to 38) and 5. 92 ± 3. 29 (0 to 20) among person ≥ 65 yrs. Daily measurements for black smoke (BS) and SO 2, as well as the daily number of cardiovascular hospitalization among person ≥ 65 yrs of age, have been collected. BS (μg/m 3) was measured by the <b>refractometry</b> <b>method</b> and SO 2 (μg/m 3) by spectrophotometer. Generalized linear model extending Poisson regression was applied. The effects of time trend, seasonal variations, day of week, temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure were adjusted. Estimated OR of unipolutant regression model for among person ≥ 65 yrs was 1. 00135 (95 % CI: 0, 97835 to 1, 02489), and estimated OR of bipolutant model was 1, 00975 (95 % CI: 0, 99457 to 1, 02394) per 10 μg/m 3. The results do not support findings from previous studies that had shown {{an increase in the number}} of cardiovascular hospitalization in elderly in association with black smoke.

40|$|Background: Noise is able {{to exert}} many adverse health effects, ranging from damages on various organs and systems to changes in {{biochemical}} and humoral markers. In literature, the effects of chronic exposure to noise on blood glucose levels have been reported, although these results are conflicting: some authors reported hyperglycaemia, others hypoglycaemia and many others recorded no changes in blood glucose levels. Objectives: Considering that the plasma glucose levels are not used as a biomarker of noise exposure, we conducted a pilot study on 6 subjects, 2 females and 4 males, working as clerks in a low noise environment in order to evaluate the possible occurrence of changes on plasma glucose levels in healthy subjects, non-diabetic and not accustomed to flight, exposed to noise and to flight-related stressors. Methods: The subjects completed a specific clinic-anamnestic questionnaire and underwent a general clinical examination. In {{the first phase of}} the study, participants underwent blood tests in order to assess the plasma glucose levels at three different times: at 8 : 00 a. m., on board of a turboprop transport aircraft before the take-off with the engine switched off, after 60 and 120 minutes’ flight. The second phase of the study was carried out one month after the first one and while working in the office; three blood tests were performed again, at fasting and after 60 and 120 minutes. The plasma glucose levels were measured on capillary blood by the <b>refractometry</b> <b>method</b> through the use of Glucoscan One Touch device. Results: The results show an increase of plasma glucose levels during the waiting for the flight and a statistically significant decrease of plasma glucose levels in the first hour of flight (p < 0. 001), persisting even at the second hour (p < 0. 001). No significant changes were found in the blood tests performed at work. Discussion: The data show an initial hyperglycaemic response, followed by a persistent and moderate decrease of glycaemia; a similar response was not observed in the same subjects during ordinary work activities. The Authors believe that the initial increase of the plasma glucose levels, recorded in absence of noise on board, could be related to the response to other stressors, such as anxiety linked to the waiting for the flight. The decrease of the plasma glucose levels observed after 60 and 120 minutes’ flight, that is in conditions of prolonged exposure to flight-related stressors and to noise, may be linked to the intervention of several mechanisms: partial phenomenon of adaptation-exhaustion of the neuroendocrine response to stress; hypoglycaemic effect of noise, CCK-mediated and VIP-mediated with consequent insulin release and decrease of the plasma glucose levels; synergistic action of the above mechanisms. The absence of changes on the plasma glucose levels during the usual work activity is probably due to the absence of those stressors considered able to induce the alterations of the plasma glucose levels recorded during {{the first phase of the}} study. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that exposure to flight-related stressors and in particular exposure to noise can cause a hypoglycaemic response...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{aspects of}} application of optical methods {{of physical and}} chemical analysis to determine {{the identity of the}} functional groups of substances extraction at different ways of making coffee. Infrared spectroscopy, diffusion reflectance spectrophotometry and <b>refractometry</b> <b>methods</b> were used for the researches. A comparison of coffee preparation methods was conducted in cupping and aeropresse Aerobie Aeropress Coffee Maker. Temperature of the water used to brew, and the punching speed of liquid by aeropressa piston were selected as variable parameters. According to the research data the refractive index of all the samples is almost identical, but TDS is slightly different, and only TDS of samples prepared at a water temperature of 96 °C lies in the optimal range (1, 15 – 1, 35 %). According to the infrared spectra of the samples the most complete recovery of caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, trigonelline and chlorogenic acid from the coffee beans is observed at a water temperature of 96 °C (at this temperature the absorption spectra of samples from cupping and aeropressa are almost identical). Typical for coffee peaks of caffeine, theobromine, theophylline and trigonelline (in the range of 270 – 275 nm) are observed in spectra of samples in the ultraviolet region, and they are most pronounced for the cupping. Sensory analysis of coffee samples showed that the samples prepared in cupping (96 °C) and aeropresse (96 °C, punching for 5 seconds) have optimal flavor, and their taste is practically identical, which is confirmed by the infrared spectroscopy data. The results show high prospects of using of optical methods of physical and chemical analysis to the quality and the identity of the coffee samples researches...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the reliability of}} dipstick measurements of urine specific gravity (U-SG). METHODS: Fresh urine specimens were tested for urine pH and osmolality (U-pH, U-Osm) by a pH meter and an osmometer, and for U-SG by three different <b>methods</b> (<b>refractometry,</b> automatic readout of a dipstick (Clinitek- 50), and (visual) change of colour of the dipstick). RESULTS: The correlations between the visual U-SG dipstick measurements and U-SG determined by a refractometer and the comparison of Clinitek((R)) - 50 dipstick U-SG measurements with U-Osm were less than optimal, showing very wide scatter of values. Only the U-SG refractometer values and U-Osm had a good linear correlation. The tested dipstick was unreliable for the bedside determination of U-SG, even after correction for U-pH, as recommended by the manufacturer. CONCLUSIONS: Among the bedside determinations, only refractometry gives reliable U-SG results. Dipstick U-SG measurements should be abandoned...|$|R

Numerous researches over serum proteins with the help of various <b>methods</b> (<b>refractometry)</b> have shown the presence of some changes in protein fractions of blood serum. These changes express the change of the normal ratio between these fractions, that means disorders in colloidal structure of blood. The results of the electrophoresis analysis, also in accordance with those from the scholarly literature, show that the changes in the condition of the blood serum are due to the increase in the globulins fractions which is linked to the growth of the immunological processes, the antibodies synthesis being especially closely linked to gammaglobulinic fractio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present recent advances at Onera in the spray diagnostic and simulation fields. In the context of the reduction of engine pollutant emissions, the optimization of fuel spray injection represents phenomena of great fundamental and practical interest and is an important feature in the design of new prototypes of turbojet injection devices. The physics of spray formation, transport, evaporation and combustion are not completely understood and the models must be improved to make better predictions of air fuel mixing inside combustion chambers. Onera, in cooperation with CNRS, has developed new optical diagnostics to obtain more detailed validation databases for validating numerical approaches. New techniques are presented for characterizing the dispersed liquid phase in sprays in terms of droplet temperature, size and velocity. During the last few years, important work has been done on measuring the mean and local droplet temperature, by coupling Standard Rainbow Refractometry (SRR) and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) for a monodisperse droplet stream [8]. Local characterizations of the discrete phase inside a polydisperse spray have also been carried out by the simultaneous use of the Global Rainbow <b>Refractometry</b> (GRR) <b>method</b> and the well known Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) technique. This paper describes the principle of these techniques and the different levels of application from basic configurations involving monodisperse droplet streams to polydisperse sprays in a high pressure and temperature environment. Experimental results are compared with the numerical ones for some simple configurations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Few hematologic and {{biochemical}} reference intervals {{for wild}} amphibians have been established. Reference values would aid in {{early detection of}} emerging infectious diseases, which are a significant problem for amphibian conservation efforts. Objective: We aimed to establish reference intervals {{for a wide range}} of hematologic and plasma biochemistry variables for 2 species of Australian tree frogs, describe morphologic features of leukocytes, and analyze the effects of season, year, and parasite status on blood values. Methods: Blood specimens were collected from reference populations of wild adult Australian tree frogs, Litoria caerulea and L infrafrenata, for analysis of hematologic (manual) variables, plasma biochemical (automated) analytes, and plasma and serum proteins using automated <b>methods,</b> <b>refractometry,</b> and electrophoresis. Results: Inter- and intraspecies differences were found in L caerulea (n = 80) and L infrafrenata (n = 66) frogs for hematologic and biochemical variables. Intraspecies differences were largely associated with seasonal variations. In the dry season, both species had higher WBC counts, with higher lymphocyte counts in L caerulea and higher neutrophil counts in L infrafrenata, and uric acid concentrations. In the wet season, both species had higher glucose and potassium concentrations, L caerulea frogs had higher neutrophil counts, and L infrafrenata frogs had higher total protein, phosphorus, and sodium concentrations, AST activity, PCV, hemoglobin concentration, and RBC, thrombocyte, and basophil counts.

40|$|Blood serum {{samples and}} {{colostrum}} of 17 Murrah water buffalo cows (Bubalus bubalis) were examined at birth {{as well as}} their offspring before the ingestion of colostrum at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after birth to determine the failure in the passive transfer of an-tibodies. The parameters studied included the total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), alphaglobulin (a GLO), beta-globulin (b GLO) and gamma-globulin (g GLO) concentration in the serum and colostrum through <b>refractometry</b> and biuret <b>method</b> and protein fractions, separated by electro-phoresis. At birth the calves presented a hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia followed by a considerable increase in the serum levels of TP and g GLO from birth until 96 hours after birth (r= 0. 9278). However by electrophoresis it could be detected six hours after co-lostrum ingestion and antibody levels thus being comparable to those in the adult animals, 3. 06 g/ 100 ml. Calves which had suckled showing values up to 0. 71 g/ml suggest a failure in the pas-sive transfer, g GLO values between 0. 85 and 1. 71 g/ 100 ml suggest a partial failure and levels above 3. 06 g/ 100 ml indicate an appropriate transfer of antibodies present in the colostrum, a si-tuation of extreme importance for the survival of the newborn calf due to the high content (approximately 82 %) of g GLO. 199...|$|R
40|$|Fragments {{of freshly}} {{obtained}} retinas of several vertebrate species were studied by refractometry, {{with reference to}} the structure of the rods and cones. The findings allowed a reassessment of previous descriptions based mainly on fixed material. The refractometric method was used also to measure the refractice indices and to calculate the concentrations of solids and water in the various cell segments. The main quantitative data were confirmed by interference microscopy. When examined by the <b>method</b> of <b>refractometry</b> the outer segments of freshly prepared retinal rods appear homogeneous. Within a few minutes a single eccentric longitudinal fiber appears, and transverse striations may develop. These changes are attributed to imbibition of water and swelling in structures normally too small for detection by light microscopy. The central "core" of outer segments and the chromophobic disc between outer and inner segments appear to be artifacts resulting from shrinkage during dehydration. The fresh outer segments of cones, and the inner segments of rods and cones also are described and illustrated. The volumes, refractive indices, concentrations of solids, and wet and dry weights of various segments of the photoreceptor cells were tabulated. Rod outer segments of the different species vary more than 100 -fold in volume and mass but all have concentrations of solids of 40 to 43 per cent. Cone outer segments contain only about 30 per cent solids. The myoids, paraboloids, and ellipsoids of the inner segments likewise have characteristic refractive indices and concentrations of solids. Some of the limitations and particular virtues of <b>refractometry</b> as a <b>method</b> for quantitative analysis of living cells are discussed in comparison with more conventional biochemical techniques. Also the shapes and refractive indices of the various segments of photoreceptor cells are considered in relation to the absorption and transmission of light. The Stiles-Crawford effect can be accounted for {{on the basis of the}} structure of cone cells...|$|R
