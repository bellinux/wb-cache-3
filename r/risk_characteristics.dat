2500|$|At {{the most}} basic level, initial ratemaking {{involves}} looking at the frequency and [...] of insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils.

Rating for different <b>risk</b> <b>characteristics</b> involves at {{the most basic}} level comparing the losses with [...] "loss relativities"—a policy with twice as many losses would therefore be charged twice as much. More complex multivariate analyses are sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} nonparametric Bayesian credibility without imposing stringent parametric assumptions on claim distributions. We {{suppose that}} a claim distribution {{associated with an}} unknown <b>risk</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a policyholder is an unknown parameter vector with infinite dimension. In this way, we incorporate {{the uncertainty of the}} functional form of the claim distribution associated with the unknown <b>risk</b> <b>characteristic</b> in calculating credibility premiums. Using the results of Ferguson (1973), formulas of the Bayesian credibility premiums are obtained. The formula for the Bayesian credibility pure premium is a linear combination of the overall mean and the sample mean of the claims. This is consistent with the result in the classical credibility theory. We perform a simulation study for the nonparametric Bayesian credibility pure premiums and compare them with the corresponding Bühlmann credibility premiums. Estimation results for the credibility premiums using Danish fire insurance loss data are presented. 22 page(s...|$|R

We employ a Kalman Filter to estimate time-varying betas, and apply a GARCH(1, 1) process on the one-step-ahead forecast error to estimate conditional diversifiable risk. An individual stock approach rather than the customary portfolio approach is adopted.

40|$|Abstract. Duration is an {{important}} and well-established <b>risk</b> <b>characteristic</b> for fixed income securities. We use recent developments in financial statement analysis research to construct a measure of duration for equity securities. We find that the standard empirical predictions and results for fixed income securities extend to equity securities. We show that stock price volatility and stock beta are both positively correlated with equity duration. Moreover, estimates of common shocks to expected equity returns extracted using our measure of equity duration capture a strong common factor in stock returns. Additional analysis shows that the book-to-market ratio provides a crude measure of equity duration and that our more refined measure of equity duration subsumes the Fama and French (1993) book-to-market factor in stock returns. Our research shows how structured financial statement analysis {{can be used to}} construct superior measures of equity security risk...|$|R
