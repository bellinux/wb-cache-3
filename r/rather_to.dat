5|$|In short, the Wrights {{discovered}} the true {{purpose of the}} movable vertical rudder. Its role was not to change the direction of flight (as a rudder does in sailing), but <b>rather,</b> <b>to</b> aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances. The actual turn—the change in direction—was done with roll control using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.|$|E

5|$|On the November 19, 1999, {{episode of}} Millionaire, Carpenter {{proceeded}} {{to advance to}} the million-dollar question without using any lifelines. He then used his Phone-A-Friend to call his father not for help, but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> tell him he was going to win the game. Carpenter answered the question correctly and became the show's first millionaire. His win gave him national recognition and led to multiple talk show appearances, as well as reappearances on Millionaire itself.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of a {{northern}} location counter that this site is {{not supported by}} the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.|$|E
5|$|The American Machinist {{not only}} {{provided}} information on Churchill's business activities but in January 1901 announced he (and {{his wife and}} daughter) had returned to London after {{a visit to the}} US which was not for business but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> see his ageing mother.|$|E

5|$|The Bureau of Meteorology had not issued {{warnings}} for Sydney Airport, {{located on}} the northern shore of Botany Bay, or {{the rest of the}} eastern suburbs to prepare for large hail.

5|$|These were {{difficulties}} {{which seemed}} <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> require the superior {{force of a}} Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of a raw and unexperienced pen; for I believe I may boast that none ever appeared so early upon the stage. However, such was the candour of the audience, the play was received with greater satisfaction than I should have promised myself from its merit, had it even preceded the Provoked Husband.|$|E
5|$|Tracing in English {{law is a}} {{procedure}} to identify property (such as money) that has been taken from the claimant involuntarily. It is not in itself a way to recover the property, but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> identify {{it so that the}} courts can decide what remedy to apply. The procedure is used in several situations, broadly demarcated by whether the property has been transferred because of theft, breach of trust, or mistake.|$|E

5|$|As the Muslim {{forces were}} {{geographically}} divided, Heraclius sought to exploit this situation {{and planned to}} attack. He {{did not wish to}} engage in a single pitched battle but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops. By forcing the Muslims to retreat, or by destroying Muslim forces separately, he would fulfill his strategy of recapturing lost territory. Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius' son Constantine III probably to tie down Yazid's forces which were besieging the town. The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria sometime in the middle of June 636.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E

5|$|Ginsburg {{was in the}} {{minority}} for Gonzales v. Carhart, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the veracity of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue. She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> impede women's access to abortions.|$|E
5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor of {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E
5|$|In mid-December, as Totti began regaining form post-injury, {{he started}} playing more regularly, {{often in a}} {{creative}} role as an attacking midfielder. On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi's opening goal in a 1–1 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match. He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo's goal in Roma's 3–1 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011, and also set up De Rossi's goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium. Playing in a deeper position on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> play more of a supporting role by bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership and experience in games to offer some much needed depth to the team.|$|E

5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> the expansion of space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be {{moving away from the}} Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but <b>rather,</b> <b>to</b> the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation from the Senate to the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from the Senate to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E
5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but <b>rather</b> <b>to</b> defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
