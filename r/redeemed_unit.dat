In addition, ETFs generally <b>redeem</b> Creation <b>Units</b> by giving investors the securities that comprise the portfolio instead of cash.

Existing ETFs have transparent portfolios, so institutional investors will know exactly what portfolio assets they must assemble {{if they wish to}} purchase a creation unit, and the exchange disseminates the updated net asset value of the shares throughout the trading day, typically at 15-second intervals.|$|R

40|$|The {{rule against}} perpetuities, more specifically, the rule against {{remoteness}} of vesting, invalidates future property interests {{which do not}} become effective within a defined &# 039;perpetuity period&# 039;. The rule also invalidates powers possessed by people to dispose of other&# 039;s property if those powers can be exercised outside the perpetuity period. Powers to appoint trust property conferred on most discretionary trustees are potentially invalid for this reason. The lifetimes of discretionary trusts must be limited to applicable perpetuity periods as modified by statute. Unit trusts are superficially similar. Powers for trustees and/or the responsible entities of unit trusts to issue new <b>units</b> or <b>redeem</b> existing <b>units</b> are often thought to be perpetuitous by analogy. The assumption is denied here. Arguing from functional as well as doctrinal perspectives, the author concludes that the rule against perpetuities has no application to unit trusts...|$|R
