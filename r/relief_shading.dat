50|$|Topography in {{a narrow}} sense {{involves}} the recording of relief or terrain, the three-dimensional quality of the surface, and the identification of specific landforms. This {{is also known as}} geomorphometry. In modern usage, this involves generation of elevation data in digital form (DEM).

5000|$|Eduard Imhof (25 January 1895 - 27 April 1986) was a {{professor}} of cartography at the [...] Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich, from 1925 - 1965. His fame, which extends far beyond the Institute of Technology, stems from his <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> work on school maps and atlases. Between 1922 and 1973 Imhof worked on many school maps. He drew and shaded maps of Switzerland as well her various cantons and the Austrian province of Vorarlberg.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, {{the first}} maps with <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> are published. In 1889, a {{photographic}} studio is appended to the bureau. In {{the years after}} 1894, a wall-map for schools is published, {{in response to a}} request from the parliament to do so. In 1898, the soundings of the major Swiss lakes are finished. In 1901, the bureau is moved into an independent division within the military, and the name Eidgenössische Landestopographie becomes customary, a name still used by some people until today, and a name which can be found on some older maps. Hermann Kümmerly publishes a relief wall-map for schools in the same year. In 1908, map trials are started to serve as a replacement for the Dufourkarten. Two years later, trials start to replace the Siegfriedkarten. Much of this military work would remain secret for many years. In 1913, 1922 and 1924, trials are done with aerial photogrammetry, first with balloons and later with aircraft, but only as of 1930 this is used for production of maps, and in 1940 terrestrial photogrammetry is abandoned.|$|E

5000|$|A {{masterpiece}} of cartography, this Soviet atlas {{was published in}} Moscow in 1967 by the Chief Directorate of Geodesy and Cartography under the Council of Ministers of the USSR (GUGK; Главное управление геодезии и картографии (ГУГК) при Совете министров СССР). [...] This was the second edition of The World Atlas, first published in 1954. Although {{a lot of other}} atlases were published during the years in the Soviet Union under the name [...] "Atlas Mira" [...] (including pocket atlases), this one is the biggest and most detailed and might be probably denoted as [...] "Great Atlas of the World" [...] to distinguish it from all other smaller editions. Still on the cover it simply reads The World Atlas below the coat of arms of the Soviet Union in relief. It was published simultaneously in Russian and English in 25,000 copies and was priced at 42 Soviet rubles. Special cartographic paper and special cartographic offset ink were used. The Atlas was dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The Atlas has a full 250 pages of colour maps, majority of them physical, the index being a separate book, comprising some 200,000 entries. The size of the Atlas is 55 x 32 cm. [...] The maps in the Atlas are arranged in groups starting with general world maps, maps of the Soviet Union and maps of the continents. The world maps are in the 1:50,000,000 scale. The Soviet Union is treated basically as a separate continent with its own physical, political, transportation and time zone maps. It is mentioned in the preface that the number of the maps of the Soviet Union is decreased compared to the previous edition, because of the interim publishing of a separate atlas specifically dedicated to the Soviet Union. For each continent there is a general physical map as an introduction (1:10,000,000 to 1:25,000,000), followed by political and communications maps. This is followed by a number of general regional maps (1:1,500,000 to 1:750,000) and supplemented for important areas by large scale maps (1:250,000 to 1:750,000). 18 different colours are used from deep blue for the ocean deeps to dark brown and white for the highest mountains and glaciers. <b>Relief</b> <b>shading</b> is used for delineating relief along with contour lines. All scales are metric. Tint for elevation is predominately used in larger scale maps: 1:1,500,000 and higher. The shadows and colours combined give an almost stereo impression, the relief popping up out of the pages. Many major cities in the world are shown on separate maps or insets, typically in 1:250,000 scale as well as important areas like the Panama Canal or Palestine, along with detailed maps of small islands in the world oceans.|$|E

40|$|Ocean and terra are {{the largest}} geomorphologic units on the earth, and there are {{essential}} differences between them. Hence, while we make the geomorphologic <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> map, {{it is necessary to}} make the ocean/terrestrial geomorphologic <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> map respectively. Then combining the ocean and terra map, we can get a whole geomorphologic map about the study area. However, the SRTM-DEM(Shuttle Radar Topography Mission-Digital Elevation Model) we get from USGS(United States Geological Survey) is clipped by SWBD(Shorelines and Water Bodies Database) coastline, so the coastline may be not accordance with the coastline we get about the study area. To solve this problem, we had to clip the DEM and patch the void data. Only in this way can we assure the DEM is accordance with the coastline. If the DEM is larger than the coastline, we can cut the spare parts by using the tool - extract by mask. However, if the DEM is smaller than the coastline, we have to patch the void data. This paper tries to find the best interpolating method to patch the void area according to the geomorphologic units.

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to provide an {{overview}} of recent developments in the fields of small-scale and multiscale relief mapping. Hypsometric tinting, <b>relief</b> <b>shading,</b> continuous color shading, plan oblique relief and other techniques are widely used for maps covering large territories at small scales. The main difference between these techniques and large-scale terrain cartography is that the representations become highly abstract at the observational scale and thus require a high level of generalization. At very small scales, the terrain is stylized to convey distinctive geographic and morphological features. The positional accuracy of valleys and mountain chains becomes less important, and terrain features are depicted as abstracted symbols at the smallest scales. Thus, two main topics are of interest in this chapter: the automation of representation techniques and the generalization of digital elevation models. We focus on both small-scale and multi-scale mapping, which are interrelated because related generalization techniques are specific to the representation techniques. The following sections first discuss general requirements for digital terrain generalization at small scales, then discuss terrain visualization with (a) traditional <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> and plan oblique relief, (b) continuous color shading and (c) hypsometric tinting...|$|E
40|$|Many colour maps {{provided}} by vendors have highly uneven perceptual contrast over their range. It {{is not uncommon}} for colour maps to have perceptual flat spots that can hide a feature as large as one tenth of the total data range. Colour maps may also have perceptual discontinuities that induce the appearance of false features. Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the construction of ternary images are presented. Unlike the RGB primaries these basis colours produce images whereby the salience of structures are consistent irrespective of the assignment of basis colours to data channels.

40|$|Shaded relief derived {{automatically}} from {{digital elevation}} models differs distinctly from traditional manual shading. Particularly at small scales, many small topographic details that {{are present in}} terrain models disturb the clear portrayal of the main relief features. Automatic shading is therefore not appropriate for high-quality cartographic products. This paper proposes a new method of generalizing digital elevation models for deriving small-scale shaded relief that resembles the manual style. The procedure consists of the following raster operations: undesirable topographic details are smoothed with low-pass filters, and the main landforms, such as ridgelines and valleys, are detected by curvature coefficients. Two secondary grids are derived, one exaggerating ridgelines, the other deepening valley bottoms, and the two grids are combined according {{to the character of}} the terrain; the grid with exaggerated ridgelines is used in mountainous areas, and the grid with deepened valley bottoms in lowland areas. Finally, shaded relief is derived from the combined elevation model. Following these processing steps, only a few manual corrections are necessary to produce high-quality small-scale <b>relief</b> <b>shading...</b>|$|E
