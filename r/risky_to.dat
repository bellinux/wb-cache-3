Its similarity to some other (inedible or toxic) webcaps renders it <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> eat. The taste after cooking is reportedly bitter.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began to {{distance}} himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín thought that it was <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E

5|$|This, {{and other}} {{successful}} hit-and-run raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed {{that they were}} still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to be drawn into an all-out battle. Yamamoto reasoned that another air attack on the main U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, considering the increased strength of American land-based air power on the Hawaiian Islands since the December 7 attack the previous year, he judged that it was now too <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> attack Pearl Harbor directly.|$|E
5|$|However, an {{analysis}} in 2009 using both morphological and molecular phylogenetics comparisons concluded the molluscs are not monophyletic; in particular, Scaphopoda and Bivalvia are both separate, monophyletic lineages {{unrelated to the}} remaining molluscan classes; the traditional phylum Mollusca is polyphyletic, and {{it can only be}} made monophyletic if scaphopods and bivalves are excluded. A 2010 analysis recovered the traditional conchiferan and aculiferan groups, and showed molluscs were monophyletic, demonstrating that available data for solenogastres was contaminated. Current molecular data are insufficient to constrain the molluscan phylogeny, and since the methods used to determine the confidence in clades are prone to overestimation, it is <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> place too much emphasis even on the areas of which different studies agree. Rather than eliminating unlikely relationships, the latest studies add new permutations of internal molluscan relationships, even bringing the conchiferan hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|In giving {{attention}} to national affairs, McKinley neglected his home front in Ohio, {{and when the}} Republican state convention met in Zanesville in May 1895, {{it proved to be}} controlled by the resurgent Foraker, who sought the Senate seat to be filled by the Ohio General Assembly in January 1896. That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker for Senate, and nominated Foraker supporters for state and party offices, including Asa Bushnell to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized that it would be <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> have a faction hostile to the presidential candidate within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature that would send Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home.|$|E

5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E
5|$|Sing's marksmanship at Gallipoli saw him dubbed 'The Assassin' or 'The Murderer' by his comrades. He {{reportedly}} {{acquired the}} latter nickname {{due to his}} callous attitude towards the enemy. By early September 1915, he had taken 119 kills, according to Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie, commanding officer of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Regimental records list Sing as having taken 150 confirmed kills, but on 23 October 1915, General William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC forces, issued an order complimenting him on his 201 unconfirmed kills. Historian Bob Courtney noted that an official kill was recorded only if the spotter saw the target fall. If the first shot missed the target, it was very <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> take a second shot, as this could give away the sniper team's position.|$|E
5|$|Smith headed west, {{across the}} Ligurian Alps, towards {{southern}} France, which he knew {{had just been}} invaded by Allied troops, principally Americans, Free French and British. He and Bill were assisted along the way by Italian partisan groups and other locals. After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith and Bill at a partisan camp. The lingua franca of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean Batiste Chambrin, who gave them {{instructions on how to}} pass the German sentries guarding the border with France. The soldiers decided that because it would be too <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> try to cross all together, Smith and Bill would go first, with the Frenchman, Austrian and Pole following the next day.|$|E

5|$|With nightfall, the ceasefire {{imposed by}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 338 came into effect at 6:52pm, ending the battle. A {{large number of}} Israeli wounded {{were still on the}} battlefield. Sharon {{requested}} helicopters to evacuate the wounded, but Bar-Lev replied in the negative, as it was dark and too <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> land helicopters near the battlefield. The Israelis worked to extract the wounded from the battlefield anyway, and the rescue operations took some four hours before most of the wounded were finally evacuated. When sunrise arrived, Israeli paratroopers and Egyptian Sa'iqa sometimes found that there were no more than 20 meters separating their positions, but the ceasefire held.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, the Harwich Force sortied in {{an attempt}} to {{intercept}} a German raid on Sunderland. The British had decoded German radio messages and knew the High Seas Fleet had sailed, but not its target or purpose and failed to locate the Germans. In contrast, German reconnaissance Zeppelins spotted the Harwich Force several times, but reported it as a force of battleships and cruisers, when, in actuality, it consisted of cruisers and destroyers. These reports, however, did persuade Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of the High Seas Fleet, to abandon his attack and turn for home. Losses to submarines and mines during the operation persuaded the British that it was too <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> deploy major forces {{in the southern part of}} the North Sea. This left the defence of the southern part of the English coast solely to local defence forces like the Harwich Force. This policy was tested when Scheer attempted another raid on 18–19 October; Tyrwhitt's force was ordered to sea based on German radio signals, but did not locate the Germans. Scheer turned around after one of his cruisers was torpedoed by a British submarine and the High Seas Fleet never again made a sortie into the North Sea in force.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to Tirpitz {{were carried}} out using improvised {{facilities}} at Kaafjord as it was considered too <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> attempt to move the damaged warship to Germany. Instead, equipment and work crews were shipped to the fjord from German ports. On the night of 10/11 February 1944, 15 Soviet aircraft attacked the battleship, but did not cause any damage. By 17 March, the repairs to Tirpitzs armament, machinery and hull were complete, but several minor repair tasks were outstanding. During the period the ship was under repair, Scharnhorst, the only remaining operational German battleship, was sunk on 26 December during the Battle of the North Cape. Following this engagement the Royal Navy stopped deploying battleships to cover convoys travelling {{to and from the}} Soviet Union. By this stage of the war the Allies also had large numbers of anti-submarine and anti-aircraft escort ships available, and were able to assign strong forces to protect all of the Arctic convoys. German submarines operating in the Norwegian Sea were rarely able to evade the convoy escorts, and few merchant vessels suffered damage from enemy attack.|$|E

40|$|Theories of asset {{allocation}} predict that higher forecasts of returns on <b>risky</b> assets lead <b>to</b> a higher share of <b>risky</b> assets <b>to</b> wealth. This study tests this prediction on household {{asset allocation}} {{by examining the}} relationship between the share of risky assets held by households and their forecasts of returns on risky assets by using a household survey that asks respondents their highest and lowest forecasts for the Nikkei 225 index. Constructing the median forecasts from these two forecasts, the share of <b>risky</b> assets <b>to</b> wealth is regressed on the three forecast variables: the highest, median and lowest. It was found that the share of <b>risky</b> assets <b>to</b> wealth is positively but weakly correlated with the forecast variables as the theories predict. Moreover, the lowest forecast has a greater effect on the share than the other two forecasts. These results indicate that households determine the amount they hold in risky assets based on the lowest forecast rather than the highest or median forecasts of returns on risky assets...|$|R
5|$|The {{two ships}} of the Baltic Fleet {{did not play}} a {{prominent}} role in the Winter War, but did have their anti-aircraft guns significantly increased before Operation Barbarossa in 1941. However this did not help either ship as they attempted to provide fire support for the defenders of Leningrad. Marat had her bow blown off and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was badly damaged by multiple bomb hits in September. The former was sunk, but later raised and became a floating battery {{for the duration of the}} Siege of Leningrad while the latter spent over a year under repair, although this was lengthened by subsequent bomb hits while in the hands of the shipyard. Both ships bombarded German and Finnish troops so long as they remained within reach, but Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya did not venture away from Kronstadt for the duration of the war. Parizhskaya Kommuna remained in Sevastopol until forced to evacuate by advancing German troops. She made one trip to besieged Sevastopol in December 1941 and made a number of bombardments in support of the Kerch Offensive during January–March 1942. She was withdrawn from combat in April as German aerial supremacy had made it too <b>risky</b> <b>to</b> risk such a large target.|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{investigated}} the risk {{preferences of the}} Chinese company managers in kinds of simulated decision situations and their perceptions of risk concerning types of business decisions. Four studies are conducted: Study I is utility analysis. 214 company managers and 46 middle - school headmasters have responded to Utility Measurement Survey. The results indicate: (1) The risk preferences of the managers vary in the different decision situations. In most of the situations, most of the managers are risk aversion; In few situations, they are risk-seeking. (2) In some of the decision situations, there are significant differences on risk preference between business managers and school headmasters, male managers and female managers, senior managers and junior managers, managers with high qualifications and managers with low qualifications, non-state-owned firms&# 39; managers and state-owned firms&# 39; managers, medium-small sized firms&# 39; managers and large-sized firms&# 39; managers. In the other situations there aren&# 39;t significant differences between them. (3) In all of the decision situations, so significant differences on risk preference are found among managers with different marriage, experience, age and education. Study II is risky decision simulation. The Risky Decision Situations Simulation Survey is administered to 82 company managers. The result indicates that firm culture, business condition, survival limit and risk preference of the superior influence the managers&# 39; risk decision-making behavior. Study III is perceptions of business decision risks. 68 company managers have filled in Decision Cases Risk Perception Inventory. The results indicate: (1) Inaccurate market analysis and prediction, instable politics and the changes of economic policy are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> strategy decision. (2) Erroneous market analysis and prediction, appearance of new technology and the changes of market demands are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> investment decision. (3) Poor quality control, backward technology and too large stocks are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> production decision. (4) Shortage of development fund, wrong choice in development project and limitation of the development ability are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> new production development decision. (5) No payment of the foreign partner&# 39;s capital, the changes of national relevant policy, difficulty in marketing, too high selling prices of foreign partner&# 39;s equipments are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> joint-venture decision. (6) Unfamilarity with oneself and misjudgement in qualification of oneself are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> personnel decision. (7) Bad market of the product, defects in product quality and the changes of consumers demands are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> marketing decision. (8) Wrong strategy and ambiguous goals are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> public relation decision. (9) Violation of the law, ambiguous goals and poor creation are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> advertisement decision. (10) Deterioration of diplomatic relations, unsuitable products for foreign consumers and unfamilarity with foreign market are the more <b>risky</b> elements <b>to</b> international business decision. Study IV is structured interview. 5 company managers have answered all questions of the Interview Questionnaire. The results indicate: (1) The managers think that risks are the possible unfavourable consequences of decisions; (2) The self-ratings of the managers coordinate {{with the results of}} utility measurement; (3) The managers admit that risks always accompany bussiness decision; (4) Individual difference is found among managers on risk perception. This thesis has also pointed out the important implications of the research and discussed several further questions. 本文系统深入地研究了我国企业经营管理人员在各种决策情景下的风险偏好和对各种经营决策风险的认知与评估。共有四项研究：研究一是效用分析。 214 名企业经理和 46 名中学校长填答了效用测量表。结果表示：（ 1 ）在不同决策情景下，被试的风险偏好会发生变化。在多数情景下，大多数被试表现出风险厌恶；在个别情景下，大多数被试倾向于冒险。（ 2 ）在一些决策情景下，企业经理与中学校长、男经理与女经理、资历高的经理与资历低的经理、职位高的经理与职位低的经理、非国有企业的经理与国有企业的经理、中小企业的经理与大型企业的经理在风险偏好方面存在显著差异；而在其他决策情景下则没有显著差异。（ 3 ）在所有决策情景下，不同年龄、婚姻状况、工龄、学历的经理在风险偏好方面均不存在显著差异。研究二是风险决策情景模拟。 82 名企业经理填答了风险决策情景模拟表。结果发现，企业文化、企业经营状况、生存度和上偏好等因素能够影响企业经理的风险决策行为。研究三是决策风险认知。 69 名企业经理填答了决策案例风险认知表。结果表明：（ 1 ）对于企业战略决策，企业经理认为市场分析与预测不准、政治不稳定、经济政策调整等因素风险较大；（ 2 ）对于投资决策，企业经理认为市场分析与预测有误、新技术新工艺出现、市场需求变化等因素风险较大；（ 3 ）对于生产决策，企业经理认为质量控制欠佳、技术落后、产品积压等因素风险较大；（ 4 ）对于新产品开发决策，企业经理认为开发资金不足、开发项目选择有误、开发能力有限等因素风险较大；（ 5 ）对于合资经营决策，企业经理认为外方资金不到位、国家有关政策变化、产品无销路、外方技术设备高报价等因素风险较大；（ 6 ）对于人事决策，企业经理认为对该人了解有误、对该人适合与否判断失误等因素风险较大；（ 7 ）对于营销决策，企业经理认为产品不适销对路、产品质量有问题、消费需求变化等因素风险较大；（ 8 ）对于公关决策，企业经理认为公关战略失误、公关目标模糊等因素风险较大；（ 9 ）对于广告决策，企业经理认为违反法律法规、广告目标模糊、创意策划欠佳等因素风险较大；（ 10 ）对于国际经营决策，企业经理认为两国外交关系恶化、产品不适合国外消费者、国外行情不熟悉因素风险较大。研究四是有结构访谈。 5 名企业经理分别回答了访谈表中的所有问题。结果表明：（ 1 ）被试认为风险是决策可能的不利后果。（ 2 ）被试的自我评估与效用测量的结果基本一致；（ 3 ）被试承认风险是企业经营的必然伴生物；（ 4 ）被试在风险认知方面存在个别差异。本文还讨论了研究的重要意义，指出了需要进一步探讨的问题...|$|R
