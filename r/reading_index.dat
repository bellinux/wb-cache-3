Distance visual acuity, near visual acuity, reading speed, and contrast sensitivity were measured in all patients. In addition, a new measure of reading ability was derived, designated the <b>reading</b> <b>index.</b> This takes into account both the size of the text read and the time to read it and is equivalent to the reading speed in words per minute divided by text size in M.  RESULTS—The <b>reading</b> <b>index</b> was found to show best associations with the majority of items within the DLTV. Stepwise regression identified the combination of <b>reading</b> <b>index</b> and distance visual acuity as having the best associations with DLTV items. The present study also demonstrated that specific levels of vision as measured by acuity, <b>reading</b> <b>index,</b> and contrast sensitivity corresponded with different perceived amounts of difficulty in the performance of daily living tasks.  CONCLUSIONS—This study showed that <b>reading</b> <b>index</b> is valuable in predicting the ability to perform daily living tasks and therefore may be useful in the visual assessment of the visually impaired individual. In addition, this study identified specific levels of vision at which individuals reported different degrees of difficulty in performing daily living tasks. ...|$|E

40|$|Time-travel queries that couple {{temporal}} constraints with keyword {{queries are}} useful in searching large-scale archives of time-evolving content such as the web archives or wikis. Typical approaches for efficient evaluation of these queries involve slicing either the entire collection [100] or individual index lists [32] along the time-axis. Both these methods are not satisfactory since they sacrifice compactness of index for processing efficiency making them either too big or, otherwise, too slow. We present a novel index organization scheme that shards each index list with almost zero increase in index size but still minimizes the cost of <b>reading</b> <b>index</b> entries during query processing. Based on the optimal sharding thus obtained, we develop a practically efficient sharding {{that takes into account}} the different costs of random and sequential accesses.

40|$|Abstract—The memristor device {{technology}} has created {{waves in the}} research community {{and led to the}} consideration of using the device in multiple avenues. The most likely candidate for early adoption is the nonvolatile memory due to the small cell size (in-creased scaling potential), increased density as compared to flash, and ability to stack these devices in a crossbar structure. This pa-per analyzes the feasibility of a memristor memory and introduces an adaptive read, write, and erase method that may be used to realize a more resilient memory system in the face of low yield in the nanotechnology regime. The proposed method is evaluated in simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) and a hand analysis model is extracted to help explain the sources of power and energy consumption. Finally, the power metrics are compared to flash memory technology, and the memristor memory is shown to have an energy per bit consumption about one-tenth that of flash when programming, comparable to flash when erasing, and about one-fourth of flash when <b>reading.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Memristor, resistive random access memory (RAM).

This study proposes a non-destructive quantification of the photosynthetic pigment concentration in cotton leaves using two portable chlorophyll meters, the SPAD- 502 and the CLOROFILOG 1030. After obtaining 200 leaf discs, each with an area of 113 mm 2, the greening rate in each disc was determined by the average of five readings from both meters. Immediately after measurement, 5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added, and the samples were kept in a water bath at 70 ºC for 30 min. After cooling, 3 mL of the liquid extract was used for analyses by spectrophotometry at 470, 646 and 663 nm. Mathematical models were adjusted from analytical results using the <b>reading</b> <b>index</b> obtained from both devices to predict the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotenoids. Based on these results, it was concluded that both portable chlorophyll meters are an effective way to estimate the concentration of photosynthetic pigments in cotton leaves, thus saving time, space and the resources that are often required for these analyses.

40|$|Motivation: Pooling {{multiple}} samples {{increases the}} efficiency and lowers the cost of DNA sequenc-ing. One approach to multiplexing is to use short DNA indices to uniquely identify each sample. After sequencing, reads must be assigned in silico to the sample of origin, a process referred to as demultiplexing. Demultiplexing software typically identifies the sample of origin using a fixed number of mismatches between the <b>read</b> <b>index</b> and a reference index set. This approach may fail or misassign reads when the sequencing quality of the indices is poor. Results: We introduce deML, a maximum likelihood algorithm that demultiplexes Illumina sequences. deML computes the likelihood of an observed index sequence being derived from a specified sample. A quality score which reflects the probability of the assignment being correct is generated for each read. Using these quality scores, even very problematic datasets can be demultiplexed and an error threshold can be set. Availability and implementation: deML is freely available for use under the GP...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess and compare the predictive values of group membership for rapid automatized naming (RAN) and phonemic awareness (PA) in Dutch school children with and without reading disabilities (RD) or specific language impairment (SLI). A composite word <b>reading</b> <b>index</b> and a formal SLI diagnosis were used to classify a total of 1, 267 children aged 8 to 13 years old either as RD-only (n = 126), SLI-only (n = 21), comorbid (RD + SLI; n = 30), or typically developing (n = 1, 090). RAN and PA were assessed with four standardized subtests. The clinical subgroups were compared to each other and contrasted with the control group. For each subgroup, results indicate substantial effect sizes of RAN and PA. However, the RD-only group seems to be more affected by poor RAN than the SLI-only group, whereas the two groups perform equally poorly on PA. The comorbid group was revealed as most severely impaired on all measurements. In studying RD and SLI, this research indicates that it is important to distinguish between RD-only, SLI-only, and comorbid groups. The comorbid group shows additive effects of both disorders...|$|E
