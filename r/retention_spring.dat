40|$|The {{mechanisms}} affecting metal retention by surface-flow wetlands {{were investigated}} by relating variations in metal retention to {{variables such as}} hydraulic residence time, temperature (i. e. seasonal effects), phytoplankton biomass, photosynthesis {{and the presence of}} emergent vegetation. The importance of hydraulic residence time was investigated at the Monahan surface-flow wetland in Kanata, Ontario. This wetland retained metals best during summer and fall whereas during winter, the metal retention was significantly lower. The first-order removal model predicted Fe and Mn <b>retention</b> in the <b>spring</b> and Zn <b>retention</b> from <b>spring</b> to fall in both years of the study. Hydraulic residence times, greater than 7 days, provided the maximum retention of Fe, Mn, and Zn. However, first-order removal models failed to fit summer, fall and winter data for almost every metal under investigation (Fe, Mn, Cu, As) suggesting that hydraulic residence time (< 1 [...] 25 days) do not regulate metal retention during these seasons. The Monahan wetland also affected the partitioning of metals between particulate and dissolved phases thus potentially affecting the bioavailability of metals to downstream systems. On a yearly basis, the wetland showed significant retention of the dissolved phase, but the retention of total Fe and Mn was poor. The wetland transformed dissolved into particulate metals from spring to fall whereas during the winter, dissolved metals were released. Changes in pH, alkalinity and temperature could explain 11 % and 40 % of the variation in the ratio of dissolved to total Fe and Mn respectively. Furthermore, from spring to late summer, planktonic algal biomass was negatively related to the ratio of dissolved to total Fe and Mn, which suggests the importance of phytoplankton in affecting the partitioning of metal in young plankton-dominated wetlands. In the Monahan wetland and in an acid mine drainage wetland (Falconbridge) near Sudbury, Ontario, diel changes in metal concentrations followed diel changes in pH and oxygen induced by photosynthesis. During the day, metal concentrations in the water column were low because high pH and oxygen favored the precipitation of Fe and Mn oxides at the sediment-water interface. At night, Fe and Mn oxides were reduced and released to the water column because intense biological respiration decreased oxygen and pH. Diel changes in metal concentrations have to be considered when evaluating the retention performance by surface-flow wetlands. Finally, the effect of emergent vegetation on the concentration and partitioning of metals in surface sediments of four wetlands was investigated. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{estimated}} phosphate uptake in an eutrophic and macrophyte-rich Pampean stream, in a basin where {{dominant land}} use was agricultural activity. Our hypothesis was that phosphate retention {{may be linked}} to macrophyte abundance, especially that of submerged plants. Four short-term constant-rate phosphate addition experiments were carried out in late spring, summer, autumn and winter under different discharge, background phosphate concentration and macrophyte abundance. Changes in added soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration were monitored along the studied reach and corrected for dilution to estimate phosphate uptake length (Sw) and other spiraling metrics (Vf or mass transfer coefficient, and U or nutrient uptake rate). All spiraling metrics indicated a higher SRP <b>retention</b> in <b>spring</b> than in autumn, despite macrophyte cover was similar in both sampling dates (39 % and 51 %, respectively). Phosphate retention was not detected neither in summer (when macrophyte biomass and especially that of submerged plants was the highest one) nor in winter. Ambient SRP concentrations in the stream were an order of magnitude higher than concentrations observed in pristine streams; nevertheless, under the varying conditions of discharge and phosphate levels observed in our study, we found no retention in summer and winter, a phosphate uptake comparable with those measured in impaired streams in autumn, and with those measured in pristine streams in late spring...|$|R

40|$|Chalk streams provide unique, {{environmentally}} important habitats, but {{are particularly}} susceptible to human activities, {{such as water}} abstraction, fish farming and intensive agricultural activity on their fertile flood-meadows, resulting in increased nutrient concentrations. Weekly phosphorus, nitrate, dissolved silicon, chloride and flow measurements were made at nine sites along a 32 km stretch of the River Frome and its tributaries, over a 15 month period. The stretch was divided into two sections (termed the middle and lower reach) and mass balances were calculated for each determinand by totalling the inputs from upstream, tributaries, sewage treatment works and an estimate of groundwater input, and subtracting this from the load exported from each reach. Phosphorus and nitrate were retained within the river channel during the summer months, due to bioaccumulation into river biota and adsorption of phosphorus to bed sediments. During the autumn to spring periods, there was a net export, attributed to increased diffuse inputs from the catchment during storms, decomposition of channel biomass and remobilisation of phosphorus from the bed sediment. This seasonality of retention and remobilisation was higher in the lower reach than the middle reach, which was attributed to downstream changes in land use and fine sediment availability. Silicon showed much less seasonality, but did have periods of rapid <b>retention</b> in <b>spring,</b> due to diatom uptake within the river channel, and a subsequent release from the bed sediments during storm events. Chloride did not produce a seasonal pattern, indicating that the observed phosphor-us and nitrate seasonality {{was a product of}} annual variation in diffuse inputs and internal riverine processes, rather than an artefact of sampling, flow gauging and analytical errors...|$|R

[...] School of Education and Social Science. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2010. There has been considerable debate {{in community colleges}} over {{the last forty years}} regarding the impact of increased use of part-time faculty (PTF) on student learning. It has been argued that part-time faculty fail to provide the same level of teaching quality as full-time faculty (FTF). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the impact of part-time faculty on student retention at an average-sized urban community college, Kansas City Kansas Community College. Archival data obtained from the college for 2, 030 first-time full-time students (FTFTS) enrolled by the first day of the Fall semester for academic years: 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, were retrospectively analyzed for <b>retention</b> to the <b>Spring</b> semester, and the next Fall semester in each academic year, and for all years combined. This study applies a multi-step method for model building and a quantitative, descriptive, ex post facto design. The first step involved univariable analysis of six independent variables suggested in the literature to be correlated with retention of all first-time full-time students: (1) exposure to part-time faculty, (2) ethnicity, (3) gender, (4) degree seeking status, (5) developmental or non-developmental learner status, and (6) number of credit hours enrolled during the first semester. Pearson correlations, t tests, and analysis of variance statistical methods were employed in order to obtain Chi Square, means, standard deviations, t values and significance scores. The second step involved binary logistic regression for multi-variable analysis of each academic year in order to assess the six independent variables with the dependent variable, retention, to the respective Spring, and next Fall semester. The final step employed logistic regression to determine what independent variables predicted the likelihood of student <b>retention</b> to the <b>Spring,</b> and next Fall semester with all academic years combined. Statistical results of the final logistic regression analysis predicted the likelihood of a decrease in first-time full-time student retention with increased exposure to part-time faculty to the next Fall semester and with all academic years combined.

Nonetheless, little is known {{on the performance of}} the different commercial cultivars of Paspalum vaginatum in this climatic zone. Furthermore, considering the high degree of variability of this species, ecotypes have the potential to supply new plant material with desired turf characteristics. The research aimed at comparing growth characteristics and morphological traits of eight commercial cultivars of seashore paspalum (Platinum, Salam, SeadDwarf, Sea Isle 1, Sea Isle 2000, Velvetene, Marina and Sea Spray) and four ecotypes (CeRTES 101, CeRTES 102, CeRTES 103, CeRTES 104), during establishment and on mature turf grown in two italian locations (Pisa and Palermo). Probably due to higher mean minimum temperatures a clear effect of location was recorded during the establishment year with fastest stolon growth rate and higher ground cover at 133 Days After Planting (DAP) being registered in Palermo. Internode length and diameter, node density, horizontal stem density, turf quality and colour gave instead higher values in Pisa. On mature turf best colour ratings were of SeaDwarf and the ecotype CeRTES 104. The finest leaves were found in Sea Isle 2000 (1. 5 mm) while the denser cultivars, and potentially the most wear resistant, were Sea Isle 1, CeRTES 104, and Platinum.

We assessed movement for 21 fish species in seven families through culvert, slab, open-box, and ford crossings and through natural reaches. We detected no seasonal or directional bias in fish movement through any crossing type or the natural reaches. Overall fish movement was an order of magnitude lower through culverts than through other crossings or natural reaches, except no movement was detected through the slab crossing. In contrast, open-box and ford crossings showed little difference from natural reaches in overall movement of fishes. Numbers of species that traversed crossings and movement within three of four dominant fish families (Centrarchidae, Cyprinidae, and Fundulidae) also were reduced at culverts relative to ford and open-box crossings and natural reaches. In <b>spring,</b> <b>retention</b> of fishes was consistently highest in stream segments upstream of crossings and lowest in downstream segments for all crossing types, a response attributed to scouring associated with spring spates.

This group carried on online discussions and met twice between the Spring of 2010 and The Spring of 2011. The task force recommended, among other things, that a committee be formed to identify the potential for a collaborative print retention project in the region, develop educational resources on the topic of print retention, and recommend future directions. Methods: The ad-hoc committee met, brainstormed ideas, and developed a survey for resource and primary access libraries. The committee received responses from 128 libraries. Conclusions: An interesting and encouraging discovery was that almost one and a half times as many libraries expressed an interest in participating in a print retention project as were feeling pressure to give back space to their parent institution. This led the committee to conclude that space pressures and the resulting loss of print resources are a continuing concern for health sciences libraries. Even those who are not now facing pressures are interested in collaboration. Moreover, {{only a small number of}} the libraries were currently participating in print retention projects.

40|$|The Rjecina {{spring is}} one of the major springs in the Dinaric Karst. It appears at the contact between {{permeable}} carbonate and impermeable clastic rocks, with a discharge of up to 120 m 3 /s but it dries up during the dry summer seasons. The spring occurs close to the town of Rijeka, 325 m above sea level and offers an outstanding opportunity to cover gravitationally the public water demand of a town of about 200, 000 inhabitants, and the touristic needs of the whole region. This hydrogeological research project is a part of efforts to solve the problems of water deficiency during the dry summer seasons up to a maximum of three months. It was necessary to enter the parts of a karst aquifer that are active even in time of any outflow from the Rjecina spring by complex geological, hydrogeological and geophysical exploration accompanied with deep exploratory boreholes. During earlier exploration, it was determined that there are no active inflows in the immediate hinterland of the spring and that it is necessary to discover the inflows from other karst structures, that behave as <b>retentions</b> of karst <b>springs</b> in the zones of permanent discharge. The presence of multiple overthrusted structures in the zone around the spring site suggest the existence of deep zones of water retention, which may be reached by an access gallery from the Rjecina canyon.

40|$|Warm-season grasses go dormant {{in winter}} months under Mediterranean conditions, but they require less water {{and have a}} higher heat and drought {{resistance}} than cool-season species. The objectives of this study were: to assess the adaptation, drought resistance, and effects of seasonal trinexapac-ethyl (TE) application (summer vs. fall) on turfgrass characteristics using 19 cultivars of six warm-season turfgrass species. The species were Cynodon dactylon L. Pers. (bermudagrass), Buchloë dactyloides Engelm. (buffalograss), Zoysia japonica Steudel (zoysiagrass), Eremochloa ophiurioides Hack. (bahiagrass), Paspalum vaginatum Swartz (seashore paspalum) and Paspalum notatum (Flügge) (centipedegrass). Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (tall fescue) {{was used as the}} cool-season control. The plots were established in two locations, the West Mediterranean Agricultural Research Institute, Antalya and the Alata Horticultural Research Institute, Mersin, located on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey in 2005. The studies were conducted for two years. For the drought study, plots were subjected to drought stress for 90 d from June 15 to September 15 and irrigation was resumed thereafter. Applications of TE were made at a 0. 38 kg a. i. ha- 1 rate in summer or fall where a single application was followed by zero or one sequential application at 4 -wk intervals. Seashore paspalum, bermudagrasses, buffalograss, and zoysiagrass exhibited superior color and turfgrass quality throughout the growing season and the species stayed fully dormant for less than two months. Bahiagrass, bermudagrass, and buffalograss exhibited superior drought resistance. TE enhanced turfgrass color and quality in the summer and sequential application gave an added advantage. Conversely, fall TE application decreased the quality, green color <b>retention</b> and delayed <b>spring</b> green-up by 15 to 30 d. The results support the use of warm-season species in this region for summer and fall utilization when heat stress and water limitations exist, show that some of the species possess high drought resistance that can be utilized for water-efficient turf management, and support the use of sequential application of TE for reducing mowing requirements and improving turfgrass color and quality in the summer. ...|$|R
40|$|Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is {{transferred}} to sea at different times during the year. Independently of time after sea transfer, the salmon experience a period of low performance, characterized by reduced appetite, feed efficiency, growth rate, condition factor, muscle fat and fat <b>retention</b> during first <b>spring</b> in sea (Paper I). In addition, such low-performing periods may be a predisposing factor for outbreak of diseases, such as infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) (Paper III) and heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) (Paper IV). The temporary reduction in muscle fat content observed during first spring in sea may indicate a higher demand for available energy than what is obtained from traditional salmon feed. In the present thesis tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) is used in both 1 + and 0 + farmed Atlantic salmon, during first spring in sea, to enhance muscle fatty acid oxidation capacity. In contrast to previous studies with TTA in fish feed, the idea with the present work was to use diets supplemented with {{a low level of}} TTA and only during short periods, where more energy might be needed. Dietary supplementation of TTA significantly reduced the frequency of sexual mature 1 + male Atlantic salmon first autumn in sea (Paper II). Compared to control, dietary supplementation of TTA resulted in a three-fold reduction in incidence of sexual mature males (0. 6 % versus 1. 8 %). The final body weight was not affected. As muscle fat was reduced by dietary TTA in spring, the effect on maturation is probably a consequence of lower energy status at this time, too low to initiate the maturation process. In 1 + smolt transferred to sea in spring, a natural outbreak of IPN occurred eight weeks after sea transfer. Relative percent survival for the fish fed TTA in sea water was 70 % compared with the un supplemented groups, significantly reducing mortality from 7. 8 % to 2. 3 % (Paper III). Plasma chloride was reduced by dietary TTA and related to increased IPN survival, which may suggest an improved osmoregulatory capacity in fish fed a TTA-supplemented diet. Reduced fat and enhanced β-oxidation rate were further observed in white muscle following administration of TTA, indicating that TTA resulted in a re-allocation of dietary fatty acids from storage to energy producing oxidation. In addition to the effect on survival during the IPN-outbreak, TTA was found to significantly reduce mortality during a natural outbreak of HSMI in 0 + smolt. The mortality was reduced from 4. 7 % in the un-supplemented to 2. 5 % in the TTA-supplemented groups (Paper IV). Expression of several genes related to lipid metabolism (Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) α and β, carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT I) and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO)) were higher in ventricles from salmon fed TTA. At the same time, urea content in plasma was found to be lower in fish fed TTA. Taken together, these results indicate that the dietary effect on survival may partly be due to an altered metabolic balance, with better protein conservation due to increased lipid oxidation. In addition, 0 + salmon previously fed a TTA-supplemented diet had a higher growth rate during the disease period, compared to the control. In conclusion, TTA reveals a range of biological and physiological effects in salmon, resulting in better resistance to diseases such as IPN and HSMI, reduced sexual maturation and similar or better growth performance. The presented thesis may exemplify the importance of developing functional feed ingredients in modern fish farming for achieving better growth, reduced sexual maturation and improved health...|$|R
