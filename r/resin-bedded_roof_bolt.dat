Based on this information, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems will be developed for implementation in real time. For the prediction of roof geology and stability condition in real time, a micro processor was used and a program developed to monitor and record the drilling parameters of roof bolter. These parameters include feed pressure, feed flow (penetration rate), rotation pressure, rotation rate, vacuum pressure, oil temperature of hydraulic circuit, and signals for controlling machine. From the results of a series of laboratory and underground tests so far, feed pressure is found to be a good indicator for identifying the voids/fractures and estimating the roof rock strength. The method for determining quantitatively the location and the size of void/fracture and estimating the roof rock strength from the drilling parameters of roof bolter was developed. Also, a set of computational rules has been developed for in-mine roof using measured roof drilling parameters and implemented in MRGIS (Mine Roof Geology Information System), a software package developed to allow mine engineers {{to make use of the}} large amount of roof drilling parameters for predicting roof geology properties automatically. For the development of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> criteria, finite element models were developed for tensioned and fully grouted bolting designs. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the mechanisms of modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems including both the tension and fully grouted bolts. Parameters to be studied are: bolt length, bolt spacing, bolt size/strength, grout annulus, in-situ stress condition, overburden depth, and roof geology (massive strata, fractured, and laminated or thinly-bedded). Based on the analysis of the mechanisms of both bolting systems and failure modes of the <b>bolted</b> strata, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria and programs for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems were developed.

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} development in coal mine ground control during the last century was the introduction of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> during the late 1940 s and 1950 s. From an engineering standpoint, <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are inherently {{more effective than the}} wood timbers they replaced. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolts</b> promised to dramatically reduce the number of roof fall accidents, which then claimed hundreds of lives each year, and they were initially hailed {{as one of the great}} social advances of our time. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> also emerged at a time of rapid technologic transformation of the coal industry, and greatly accelerated the transition to trackless, rubber-tired face haulage. The U. S. Bureau of Mines quickly became the new roof support s strongest advocate. Some state agencies and miners were skeptical at first, but nearly everyone was soon won over. Case histories were reported showing that roof falls could be largely eliminated while productivity increased dramatically. Little wonder that, in the words of one contemporary observer, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> has been adopted more rapidly than any other new technology in the history of coal mine mechanization. Yet by the end of the 1950 s, it was clear that roof fall fatality incidence rates had actually increased. It would be another decade before the superior ground support provided by <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> would clearly save lives. The story of how <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> was implemented by the mining industry, but took so long to live up to its promise, is a fascinating example of the interaction between economics, technology, regulation, and science.

40|$|Among {{underground}} coal miners, {{hearing loss}} {{remains one of}} the most common occupational illnesses. In response, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research to reduce the noise emission of various underground coal mining equipment, an example of which is a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine (RBM). After the removal of coal or rock, the remaining strata may be subject to fall, either from overhead (the roof) or from the side (the rib). One method used in underground coal-mines to prevent failures requires the installation of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts.</b> The <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operator trams the machine to the required location, drills a hole into the strata, and then installs a <b>roof</b> <b>bolt,</b> supporting the <b>roof</b> or the rib, as the case may be. Field studies support the premise that, on average, drilling noise is the loudest noise that a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operator would be exposed to and contributes significantly to the operators 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 noise exposure. NIOSH has determined that the drill steel radiates a significant amount of noise during drilling. NIOSH is developing bit and chuck isolators to reduce vibration, and thus noise radiation of the drill steel, with the longer-term goal of reducing <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operator noise exposure.

30|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> is {{the primary}} roof support system in US {{underground}} mines. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> usually consists two major processes: drilling and bolting. In the drilling process, a hole is drilled to the desired length into the mine roof at the required location. In the bolting process, bolts, either conventional bolts, cable <b>bolts</b> or resin <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are inserted into the drilled hole for roof support. The fundamental problem of rock drilling is the breakage of fragments out of {{the face of a}} solid wall of rock (Teale 1965). The breakage of fragments generates particles of a wide size range out of the face of the rock surface.|$|R

40|$|It is arguable {{that the}} {{development}} of reinforcing <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems has largely stagnated in recent times primarily due to the prevailing industry view that few, if any further improvements can be made to {{the current state of the}} art. On the contrary, this paper will contend that reinforcing <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems can be further refined by considering both the specific manner by which horizontally bedded roof strata loses its natural self-supporting ability and the specific means by which reinforcing <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> act to promote or retain this natural self-supporting ability. The Australian coal industry’s seeming insistence on minimising bolt-hole diameter to maximise load transfer and targeting full-encapsulation by any means has led to a significant, albeit unintended consequence in terms of overall <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> effectiveness, namely the promotion of increased resin-pressures during bolt installation and the associated potential for the opening up of bedding planes that may otherwise remain closed during the bolt installation process. Given that the natural self-supporting ability of roof strata is strongly linked to whether bedding planes remain open or closed, it stands to reason that minimising resin pressures should be of significant benefit. Three issues are primarily focused on three key issues that relate directly to the function of the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> system itself, namely: (i) the importance of proper resin mixing in the context of maximising load transfer strength and stiffness, (ii) the importance of minimising resin pressures developed during bolt installation and (iii) the importance of maximising the effectiveness of the available bolt pre-tension. The logic being that if: the reliability of resin mixing with varying hole diameter is substantially improved, if resin pressures generated during bolt installation are substantially reduced, if the length of the bolted interval directly influenced by high resin pressures generated during bolt installation is substantially reduced, and if <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-tension levels are increased, why wouldn’t individual <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> effectiveness and thus roof reinforcement improve? The potential benefits to the mining industry of improving the individual effectiveness of each installed <b>roof</b> <b>bolt,</b> even by relatively small incremental amounts, should be of interest to all mine operators and is an important topic for discussion amongst the mining community...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{more than}} half a century of {{experience}} with <b>roof</b> <b>bolting,</b> no design method has received wide acceptance. To begin to improve this situation, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a statistical study of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> performance at a number of mines throughout the U. S. Case histories were collected from 37 mines with a variety of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> types and patterns in a wide range of geologic environments. Performance was measured in terms of the number of roof falls that occurred per 10, 000 ft of drivage. The study found that roof falls are rare when the roof is strong and the stress is low, even with light <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> patterns. The focus of this paper is on the more difficult conditions, where the roof is weaker and/or the stress is higher. Analysis of the results led to guidelines that can be used to make preliminary estimates of the required bolt length, capacity, and pattern. The guidelines are based on the depth of cover (which correlates with stress) and the roof quality (measured by the Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR), and the intersection span.

During 2004 to 2013, roof bolter operators had the highest number of machinery-related injuries, accounting for 64. 7 percent, at underground coal mines. This paper analyzes U. S. roof bolter fatal and nonfatal lost-time injury data at underground work locations for all commodities from 2004 through 2013 and determines risk indices for six <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks. For fatal and nonfatal incidences combined, the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were bolting, handling of materials, setting the temporary roof support (TRS), drilling, tramming, and traversing. For fatalities, the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were handling of materials, setting the TRS, bolting, drilling, traversing, and tramming. Age was found to be a significant factor. Severity of injury, indicated by days lost, was found to increase with increasing age as well as with increasing experience, largely due to the confounding of age and experience. The operation of the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine used in underground mining should be a research priority given the high frequency and severity of incidents. The results also suggest that temporal factors may exist, so additional research is warranted to better understand these factors and potentially develop interventions.

Based on bolt loadings, shear, axial behavior and statistical analysis, initial results indicate that active <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> do not show superior performance for the added cost. Active bolts seem to show no difference from passive bolts in the initial loading phase either, indicating that tension bleed-off is a concern soon after installation; however, this observation was not captured, as the data loggers were not intrinsically safe.

The identified tasks were continuous miner (CM) cutting, construction, transfer of coal, tipping, and <b>roof</b> <b>bolting.</b> The respirable dust-generating hierarchy of the tasks from highest to lowest was: transfer of coal > CM right cutting > CM left cutting > CM face cutting > construction > <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> > tipping; and for respirable silica dust: CM left cutting > construction > transfer of coal > CM right cutting. Personal exposure levels were determined by sampling the exposures of workers performing tasks in the section. Respirable dust concentrations and low concentrations of respirable silica dust were found at the intake air side of the section, indicating that air entering the section is already contaminated. The hierarchy for personal respirable dust exposures was as follows, from highest to lowest: CM operator > cable handler > miner > <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> operator > shuttle car operator, and for respirable silica dust: shuttle car operator > CM operator > cable handler > <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> operator > miner. Dust control methods to lower exposures should include revision of the position of workers with regard to the task performed, positioning of the tasks with regard to the CM cutting, and proper use of the line curtains to direct ventilation appropriately. The correct use of respiratory protection should also be encouraged. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Effective strata control, utilising fully {{encapsulated}} <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> {{is dependent}} on the installed quality of the reinforcement elements. One mechanism by which <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> may become less than fully efficient is by glove fingering (gloving) and un-mixing of the resin. Following a routine installed bolt quality audit and some small roof failures containing gloved bolts, a work programme was initiated {{to determine the extent of}} the gloving and un-mixing problem and to develop an understanding of mechanisms involved. Results have shown that gloving and un-mixing is a systematic and widespread pheno mena, occurring across the range of resin and/or bolt manufacturers, and in a variety of roof types. Gloving was found in bolts installed using either hand held pneumatic or continuous miner mounted hydraulic bolting rigs, under run of mine (ROM) condition s by operators, and under controlled manufactures “best practice” conditions...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{constructed}} a full-scale {{model of a}} 15 -ft-wide coal mine entry to use in combination with finite-element analyses to investigate roof support systems and various types of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts.</b> The objective was to enhance understanding of the fundamental mechanics {{of the interaction between}} rock and supports and the relative integrity of <b>bolted</b> mine <b>roof</b> as a function of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> type, length, spacing, and tension, and the basic characteristics of the roof strata. The laboratory test results, when correlated with computer simulations using fmite-element analysis and underground verification tests, should provide a basis for desigillng safer, more cost-effective roof control systems and help to establish guidelines for employing fully grouted resin and mechanically anchored bolting systems. The background for this research, the research approach, the methods and equipment employed, and the results are described in this report...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical design method for the truss-bolt system in reinforcing underground fractured rock roofs in coal mines. The analytical design method {{is based on}} the mechanical analysis of the fractured rock roof with reinforcement by inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> and a horizontal tie-rod. The mechanical analysis for the system includes a non-linear bending model for the laterally inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> and three upper and lower bounds. The lateral resistance of the inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in a truss-bolt-supported roadway is examined using classical theory of a non-linear beam in bending. The paper analyses the arching action by lateral behavior of the inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in reinforcing the fractured roof. Based on mechanical models, the design formula concerning the lateral bolt forces, tensions in the tie-rod in the truss system, as well as the reinforcement behavior have been derived. In order to ensure that the roof truss-bolt system reinforces the coal roof effectively, a lower bound of pre-tightening forces must be applied on the tie-rod for stabilizing the fractured roof by arching action. The pre-tightening forces exerted via the tie-rod also cannot be greater than its upper bound, since the excessive tightening force will cause localized failure in the rock near the bolt tail at the abutment of the fractured roof beam. The analytical formulas for both lower and upper bounds for truss pre-tightening forces are put forward in this paper. Furthermore, the paper also {{presents an}}alytical equations for designing the axial forces and dimensions for bolts in this kind of system. Parametric studies and optimization analysis are also carried out {{on the basis of the}} proposed approach. A flow chart and procedures are presented to show the analytical design method for this truss-bolt system. Case studies are presented to show how the method can be used in actual coal mining tunnels. The predicted results compare well with those measured in the actual case studies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Groundfalls {{are much}} more likely to occur in coal mine intersections than in entries. NIOSH is using the {{experience}} of U. S. coal mines to determine the factors which influence intersection instability and provide guidelines for the safe excavation and support of intersections. Detailed field investigations have resulted in a database of U. S. coal mines containing 12 mines and 639 roof falls so far. By using the roof fall rate as the outcome variable, correlations between roof geology (CMRR), intersection span, and roof support have been established. Case studies have indicated that replacing 3 - way intersections with 4 -way intersections may not reduce the total number of roof falls. Additionally, the size of intersection spans tend to decrease with lower (weaker) CMRR. Protocols have been established for the collections of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> parameters. The performance of individual <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> can now be tracked with roof fall rate...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a laboratory investigation designed {{to evaluate the}} stress and deformation characteristics of fully grouted <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> subjected to various magnitudes of end loadings. The experiment and subsequent analysis were completed, utilizing axial deformation data obtained -ultrasonically from forty-one 4 -ft, grade 40 <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{with a total of}} 132 measurement locations along the lengths of the bolts. The ultrasonic measurement instrumentation used in this investigation allowed for elongation measurements without requiring extensive bolt modifications. The results indicate that approximately 39 pct o{ the applied end load dissipated within the first 3. 4 in of the bolts. However, only 3 pct of the applied load was realized beyond 28 in of the grout column. Data are presented individually for every 6 -in increment of bolt length, and analysis was performed using statistical, nonlinear equations developed for 5, 000 and 8, 000 lb loading conditions...|$|R
