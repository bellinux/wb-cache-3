5|$|The {{different}} districts produce {{grapes of}} varying characteristics that are blended by the Champagne houses {{to create their}} distinct house styles. The Pinots of the Montagne de Reims that are planted on northern facing slopes {{are known for their}} high levels of acid and the delicacy they add to the blend. The grapes on the southern facing slope add more power and character. Grapes across the district contribute to the bouquet and headiness. The abundance of southern facing slopes in the Vallée de la Marne produces the <b>ripest</b> <b>wines</b> with full aroma. The Côte des Blancs grapes are known for their finesse and the freshness they add to blends with the extension of the nearby Côte de Sézanne offering similar though slightly less distinguished traits.|$|R

And there are quantities of grapes on the vines, still. They are too <b>ripe</b> for <b>wine,</b> but they will last us, for eating, for months, and that is ever {{so much better than}} making them into wine--" ...|$|R
25|$|Smaragd: The <b>ripest</b> <b>wines</b> {{that must}} contain at least 12.5% APV. The maximum {{residual}} sugar level for these wines is 9 g/l. This designation {{was first used}} in 1986, right after the diethylene glycol scandal and was intended to denote the highest quality level of Wachau wines. All grapes destined for this designation must attain at least 18.5°KMW and all finished wine must be sealed with a long natural cork that is at least 49mm long and branded with vintage year, since 2007 also screwcaps are allowed. The wines have to be aged in bottle and not released till after May 1 following harvest though some producers will age their inventory longer. Smaragd wines {{tend to be the}} most sought after and critically acclaimed Wachau wines with well made examples from favorable vintages having the potential to age for more than 20 years. The symbol for this class is an emerald lizard that can found sunning itself on the stone terraces along the Danube.|$|R
5000|$|Parker's {{impact on}} the style of fine wines has {{generated}} controversy. Parker is highly critical of [...] "those who make 'industrial wines with little flavor and no authenticity'" [...] and he believes {{that there are still}} undiscovered regions and wines that can successfully challenge the wine establishment. Critics such as Golo Weber claim that Parker likes less-acidic, <b>riper</b> <b>wines</b> with significant amounts of oak, alcohol, and extract. This supposed [...] "Parker taste" [...] may be less the result of Parker's own preferences than of a trend initiated by Émile Peynaud, the French oenologist and father of the so-called [...] "international wines." [...] In the 1970s, winemakers avoided the late harvests, when the grapes were mature, {{in order to avoid the}} risks of end-of-season rains. Peynaud proposed that winemakers should wait to harvest until the grape was fully mature, or even over-mature. He also insisted on control of malolactic fermentation through the use of stainless steel vessels.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Whittier, if {{the most}} fervid of our poets, is {{sometimes}} hurried away by this very quality, in itself an excellence, into {{being the most}} careless. He draws off his verse while the fermentation is yet going on, and before it has had time to compose itself and clarify into the <b>ripe</b> <b>wine</b> of expression. His rhymes are often faulty beyond the most provincial license even of Burns himself. Vigor without elegance will never achieve permanent success in poetry. We think, also, that he has too often of late suffered himself to be seduced from the true path to which his nature set up finger-posts for him at every corner, into metaphysical labyrinths whose clue {{he is unable to}} grasp. The real life of his genius smoulders into what the woodmen call a smudge, and gives evidence of itself in smoke instead of flame. Where he follows his truer instincts, he is often admirable in the highest sense, and never without the interest of natural thought and feeling naturally expressed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final result}} is a very <b>ripe,</b> raisiny, {{full-bodied}} <b>wine</b> with very little acid. Alcohol content easily surpasses 15% (the legal minimum is 14%) and the resulting wine is rarely released until {{five years after the}} vintage, even though this is not a legal requirement.|$|R
25|$|Around Ukiah, in {{the center}} of the large Mendocino AVA to the east of the Mendocino Ranges, the climate can get very hot warm during the growing season with mean July {{temperatures}} during the peak ripening month often in excess of 73°F (23°C). The average annual rainfall of 38 inches (964mm) is mostly consolidated in the winter months, which means that drought is a common viticultural hazard that often requires supplemental irrigation. The warm allows this part of the county develop full bodied and very <b>ripe</b> red <b>wines</b> from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel.|$|R
2500|$|Melissa DOC - Calabrian DOC {{around the}} city of Melissa. The region names {{is derived from the}} Greek word for [...] "sweet" [...] which is used to {{describe}} the high level of <b>ripe</b> sugars that <b>wine</b> grapes can achieve in this wine climate region. Both Greco nero and Greco bianco are permitted in the red wine of this DOC from 5-25%. In the white blend, Greco makes up 80-05% along with Trebbiano and Malvasia bianca.|$|R
50|$|When {{produced}} from fully <b>ripe</b> grapes, Scheurebe <b>wines</b> {{are dominated by}} rich blackcurrant aromas supplemented by grapefruit. Well-made dry Scheurebe wines can be quite full-bodied, but dry wines made from not fully ripe grapes tend {{to be dominated by}} the grapefruit component, and display it in an aggressive manner which makes for a clumsy, unattractive wine. Scheurebe therefore tends to be easier to use for sweet wines made from grapes that are fully ripe, overripe or affected by noble rot. Well-made sweet Scheurebe wines can show intense aromas of blood grape and honey.|$|R
5000|$|California cult wines {{refers to}} any of the California wines [...] "typically but not {{exclusively}} Napa Valley Cabernets" [...] for which collectors, investors and highly enthusiastic consumers will pay very high prices. The emergence of the cult movement coincided with trends in the 1990s towards <b>riper</b> fruit and <b>wines</b> with bigger and more concentrated flavors. The producers of such wines include Araujo Estates, Bryant Family Vineyard, Colgin Cellars, Dalla Valle Vineyards, Grace Family Vineyards, Harlan Estate, Schrader Cellars, Screaming Eagle and Sine Qua Non. All have scored 100 point scores from wine critics.|$|R
6000|$|A {{diversion}} was now {{created at}} {{the other side of the}} room. The red wine, which is good in Sardinia, had been drunk freely. Directly facing us sat a rather stout man with pleasant blue eyes and a nicely shaped head: dressed like any other town man on a Sunday. The dog had waddled up to him and sat down statuesque in front of him. And the fat man, being mellow, began to play with the big, gentle, brindled animal. He took a piece of bread and held it before the dog's nose--and the dog tried to take it. But the man, like a boy now he was <b>ripe</b> with <b>wine,</b> put the mastiff back with a restraining finger, and told him not to snatch. Then he proceeded with a little conversation with the animal. The dog again tried to snatch, gently, and again the man started, saved the bread, and startled the dog, which backed and gave a sharp, sad yelp, as if to say: [...] "Why do you tease me!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The early {{focus of}} the Barossa Valley wine {{industry}} was on the production of Riesling, a German wine grape from the Rhineland. The hot valley floor contributed to a very <b>ripe,</b> alcoholic <b>wine</b> that would often turn brown. Some of this wine was eventually distilled in brandy which ushered {{in a period of}} fortified wine production that coincided with the plantings of many red grape wine varieties like Shiraz and Grenache. These [...] "port-style wines" [...] would become the center of the Barossa Valley wine industry for decades to come. When the focus on the Australian wine industry shifted in the mid-20th century to production of premium, non-fortified wines, the Barossa Valley was regarded as an [...] "inferior" [...] wine region compared to cooler climate regions such as Coonawarra and Padthaway. This was partly due to the extensive association that the Barossa Valley had with Shiraz, including vast old vines plantings that were several decades old. During this period Shiraz was considered a very [...] "common" [...] variety that was not as fashionable as the prestigious Cabernet Sauvignon that was popular in the world's wine market. Most of the grapes produced in the Barossa Valley during this time was used as part of anonymous blends with the name [...] "Barossa Valley" [...] rarely appearing on wine labels.|$|R
2500|$|Wine expert Jancis Robinson {{describes}} the French style of Malbec {{common in the}} Libournais (Bordeaux region) as a [...] "rustic" [...] version of Merlot, softer in tannins and lower in acidity with blackberry fruit in its youth. The Malbec of the Cahors region is much more tannic with more phenolic compounds that contribute to its dark color. Oz Clarke describes Cahors' Malbec as dark purple in color with aromas of damsons, tobacco, garlic, and raisin. In Argentina, Malbec becomes softer with a plusher texture and <b>riper</b> tannins. The <b>wines</b> tend to have juicy fruit notes with violet aromas. In very warm regions of Argentina, Chile, and Australia, the acidity of the wine may be too low which can cause a wine to taste flabby and weak. Malbec grown in Washington state tends to be characterized by dark fruit notes and herbal aromas.|$|R
40|$|Young white wines, of the Albariño variety, from {{different}} areas of Denomination of Origin Rías Baixas in Galicia (northwest Spain) were evaluated using sensory descriptive analyses {{by a panel of}} professional wine tasters. In the first phase of analysis, the wine tasters identified 37 aromatic descriptors in five sessions. The descriptors were then reduced to 17 using statistical methods. In the second phase, the wine tasters identified and rated the intensity of these descriptors for each wine evaluated. Characteristic aromatic descriptors were found in Albariño wines from each particular area. Seven sensory attributes were significantly different (p < 0. 05) between the <b>wines</b> (<b>Ripe</b> Fruit, Lactic, Pineapple, Banana, Pear, Citrus fruit and Floral). Principal component analysis of the sensory data permitted differentiation between Albarino wines {{from different}} geographic areas in Rías Baixas. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

25|$|Throughout the Cape, van der Stel {{set high}} {{standards}} for wine production. He issued official decrees that imposed a high penalty on growers harvesting grapes {{before they were}} <b>ripe</b> or fermenting <b>wine</b> in dirty barrels. Van der Stel's dedication to quality soon garnered the wines of Constantia – and by association the Cape – a reputation for quality across Europe. Wine expert Hugh Johnson has described Constantia as the first New World wine to enjoy international acclaim. The early tasting notes from Batavia in 1692 remarked that the Cape wines of Constantia were the highest quality that had ever been exported there. In his 1705 work, Description of the Cape of Good Hope, the Dutch writer Françcois Valentijn noted that the red wines of Constantia {{were on the same}} scale of quality as the best Persian wines or Lachryma Christi from Italy. He also went on to praise the quality of the Chenin blanc Steenwyn produced at the estate.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{producers}} in Collioure also produce wines under the Banyuls label, {{which tends to}} have more prestige and fetch a higher price on the international wine market. The nature of the vintage will usually determine what percentage of Collioure grapes are used for Banyuls and what percentage will remain Collioure. When grapes are destined to become Collioure they are usually harvested {{a couple of weeks}} earlier than the grapes that are destined to be fortified. This is because the warm climate of the region causes grape sugars to rise as acids in the grapes drastically fall. While fortified wines value the high percentage of residual sugar from very <b>ripe</b> grapes, non-fortified <b>wines</b> need more of the balance from the remaining acids. Often, though, winemakers will still need to add additional acids such as tartaric acid in a process known as acidification. In a typical vintage about one-third of the grapes harvested in the region will be used for Collioure AOC labeled wines.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} defend varietal aromas from {{oxidation}} before alcoholic fermentation, two musts were prepared from white grapes pre-cooled and added with ascorbic acid and solid CO 2 (trial ACO 2) or SO 2 (trial BSO 2). Experiments were performed with grapes {{of a white}} grape variety indigenous to western Sicily, the wines from which, obtained by vinification of musts protected from oxidation and poor in copper, as previously proven, have aroma descriptors ascribed to passion fruit and grapefruit skin. The smaller content in flavanols in the ACO 2 trial, demonstrated {{that the use of}} solid CO 2, instead of SO 2, reduced the extraction of such polyphenols from grape solids. The higher content in hydroxycinnamoyl tartaric acids of the wine from ACO 2 trial with respect to BSO 2 was ascribed to the minor grape polyphenol-oxidase activity induced by the loss of oxygen stripped by CO 2 in ACO 2 or to the combination of caftaric acid quinone to the SO 2 in BSO 2. Although the grapes were very <b>ripe</b> (alcohol in <b>wines</b> ~ 14. 5 % vol), wines made with musts prepared by the two techniques were characterised by aroma descriptors like passion fruit and grapefruit skin not detected in wines prepared from musts not protected from enzymatic oxidations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{more famous}} are the passito wines {{made from the}} blend of red wine grapes typical of Valpolicella : 40-70% Corvina, 20-40% Rondinella and 5-25% Molinara. The grapes are dried on {{traditional}} straw mats or on racks on the valley slopes.There are two styles of red passito produced in Veneto. If fermentation is complete, the result is Amarone della Valpolicella ("Amarone" [...] - literally [...] "extra bitter", as opposed to sweet). Amarone is a very <b>ripe,</b> raisiny red <b>wine</b> with very little acid, often >15% alcohol (the legal minimum is 14%). Typically Amarone is released {{five years after the}} vintage, even though this is not a legal requirement. The pomace left over from pressing off the Amarone is used in the production of ripasso Valpolicellas. Amarone was awarded Denominazione di Origine Controllata status in December 1990 and promoted to Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita status in December 2009.If fermentation is incomplete, the result is a sweet red wine called Recioto della Valpolicella. Fermentation may stop for several reasons including low nutrient levels, high alcohol, and Botrytis metabolites. Grapes dried in the valley bottoms are more prone to noble rot and are favored for Recioto, whereas grapes intended for Amarone are dried on the higher slopes to avoid Botrytis.|$|R
