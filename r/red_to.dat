5|$|Mycenastrum corium subsp. ferrugineum {{has a deep}} rusty <b>red</b> <b>to</b> {{reddish orange}} gleba, clearly {{distinguishing}} it from the glebal coloring of the main subspecies. M.corium var. diabolicum has an extremely spiny capillitium.|$|E
5|$|The flower as a {{whole is}} usually {{radially}} symmetrical (actinomorphic), but may be bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic) in some species. Flower colors range from white through yellow and <b>red</b> <b>to</b> magenta.|$|E
5|$|The kepi {{was also}} {{standard}} {{issue to the}} artillerymen, they were made <b>red</b> <b>to</b> match that {{of the rest of}} their uniforms. During the summer months they were also allowed to wear straw hats because of the heat.|$|E
5000|$|September 7, 1990: Butch Henry {{was sent}} by the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>to</b> the Houston Astros to {{complete}} an earlier deal made on August 30, 1990. Catcher Terry McGriff was also sent by the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>to</b> complete the deal.|$|R
50|$|November 11, 1997: Mike Kelly {{was traded}} by the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>to</b> the Tampa Bay Devil Rays {{for a player}} to be named later. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays sent Dmitri Young (November 18, 1997) <b>to</b> the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} the trade.|$|R

5|$|Variety borealis has a {{slightly}} darker color scheme than the main species. The coloration in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple <b>red</b> <b>to</b> a dark brick red with maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying coloration of orange <b>red</b> <b>to</b> red and becoming a dull brown red with age. The bruising coloration is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety borealis is relatively small, ranging from Michigan to the upper New England states. The similar distribution and coloration to Boletus carminiporus has caused the two to be confused. New molecular evidence shows that borealis is not closely related to Baorangia bicolor var. bicolor.|$|E

5|$|Except {{those with}} an {{advertising}} livery, the trams are painted a light blue. The first series was delivered with a deeper blue color than has been tradition with Oslo Sporveier trams, but all have since been repainted to match the standard livery. Prior to the delivery of the second series, a single tram was painted deep <b>red</b> <b>to</b> match the buses and the T1000 trains used on the Oslo Metro. Due to negative feedback from the riders, the historic color was kept.|$|E
5|$|From February 1922 the airfield, {{which was}} in use as an {{emergency}} landing ground, had an illuminated T {{as part of the}} illumination of the London-Paris airway. Also at the airfield were coloured lamps connected to an anemometer to indicate wind strength, green for no wind, white for moderate wind and <b>red</b> <b>to</b> indicate strong wind.|$|E
5|$|George placed B.aculeata in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} {{inflorescence}} {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B.ser. Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B.caleyi, from which it differs in having narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from <b>red</b> <b>to</b> cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E

5|$|Herbert Chapman won Arsenal's first {{national}} trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers, and added the white sleeves and brighter <b>red</b> <b>to</b> Arsenal's kit. Arsène Wenger {{has been the}} longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies. He has won a record 7 FA Cups, and his teams set English records for the longest win streak and longest unbeaten run.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from <b>red</b> <b>to</b> blue.|$|E
5|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Alex George placed B.caleyi in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike shape; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B.ser. Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B.aculeata, which has narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from <b>red</b> <b>to</b> cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2009, at {{a public}} sendoff in Phoenix for the Arizona Cardinals before they faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon {{produced}} a towel and called the Cardinals mascot, Big <b>Red</b> <b>to</b> the stage, where he used the towel to wipe his armpits. Gordon then blew his nose on the towel. The Cardinals then proceeded to lose the Super Bowl to the Steelers, 27-23.|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark <b>red</b> <b>to</b> blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous sulphate solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.|$|E
5|$|The Pasiphae {{group is}} quite dispersed, with a spread over 1.3Gm, inclinations between 144.5° and 158.3°, and eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43. The colors also vary significantly, from <b>red</b> <b>to</b> grey, {{which might be}} the result of {{multiple}} collisions. Sinope, sometimes included in the Pasiphae group, is red and, given the difference in inclination, it could have been captured independently; Pasiphae and Sinope are also trapped in secular resonances with Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and <b>red)</b> <b>to</b> constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|Two {{young couples}} {{trespass}} on the Place's lake shore, {{only to be}} driven off by the Master and Lad. A week later, Lad is taken {{to compete in a}} dog show in Beauville. One of the men from the lake is there to show his boss' champion Lochaber King. He plots to dye Lad's coat <b>red</b> <b>to</b> embarrass the Master for the earlier incident, but accidentally dyes Lochaber King's coat instead, after the two dogs change locations. He is left having to answer for the dog's ruined coat while Lad wins the silver trophy.|$|E
5|$|Universities are {{increasingly}} expected {{to exploit the}} intellectual property generated by their research activities and, in 2000, Bristol established the Research and Enterprise Division (<b>RED)</b> <b>to</b> further this cause (particularly for technology-based businesses). In 2001, the university signed a 25-year research funding deal with IP2IPO, an intellectual property commercialisation company. In 2007, research activities were expanded further {{with the opening of}} the Advanced Composites Centre for Innovation and Science (ACCIS) and The Bristol Institute for Public Affairs (BIPA).|$|E
