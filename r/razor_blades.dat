5|$|On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié {{to a local}} GP surgery. The {{practice}} nurse {{there did}} not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at {{her job at the}} hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a scar on Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

25|$|The rioting {{began when}} Saldivar mobilized {{a group of}} prisoners to attack rival leader Hernández, but they failed to reach his cell. The rioting took place in two {{separate}} units of the prison complex, and inmates used a combination of weapons such as wooden bats, sticks, <b>razor</b> <b>blades,</b> bottles, and chairs during the melee. Fire was set to a food storage and the blaze spread to a section housing prison cells.|$|E

25|$|Galena (lead sulfide) was {{probably}} the most common crystal used in cat's whisker detectors, but various other types of crystals were also used, the most common being iron pyrite (fool's gold, FeS2), silicon, molybdenite (MoS2), silicon carbide (carborundum, SiC), and a zincite-bornite (ZnO-Cu5FeS4) crystal-to-crystal junction trade-named Perikon. Crystal radios have also been improvised from a variety of common objects, such as blue steel <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> and lead pencils, rusty needles, and pennies In these, a semiconducting layer of oxide or sulfide on the metal surface is usually responsible for the rectifying action.|$|E

25|$|Another area of Gainsborough’s {{industry}} is Rose Brothers, after William German Rose and Walter Rose, the co-founders. In 1893 William Rose invented the world's first packaging machine, {{and two years}} later bought the Trentside Works site and started to rapidly expand his packaging machine business. Rose's diversified into many other areas, and for many years they were associated with many household brands which produced the demand items of the day, including starch, <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> and sweets, including Cadbury's chocolates after which the Roses selection is named. They produced seaside rock-making machines, cigarette-making machines and bread-slicing and wrapping machines. When the company closed, A.M.P Rose bought the confectionery packaging side of the business.|$|E

25|$|The {{country and}} border battalions welcomed {{the use of}} women as {{essential}} in the searching {{of women and children}} but the city based battalions were slower to see the advantages and to some extent resented the presence of Greenfinches at first. In the short-term all came to appreciate the value of having females with patrols. Through time the role of women was expanded as it was realised that their higher pitched voices were more suited to radio transmission than men. Tasked to relieve RMP women at the Belfast city centre segment gates they learned how to accept abuse from the public and how to avoid traps that could be set for them while they searched other women; i.e., <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> placed in pockets.|$|E
25|$|These events, {{along with}} the fear of atrocities stirred up by the Nazi {{propaganda}} before, caused a mass panic among the population. Many local and refugee families killed themselves together. The suicides were either performed with guns, <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> or poison, others hanged or drowned themselves in the Peene and Tollense rivers. Several mothers killed their children before killing themselves, or walked {{into one of the}} rivers with a rock in a backpack and their babies in their arms. Some families died by walking into the rivers, tied together. A local forester first shot three young children, then their mothers, then his wife and then himself, surviving as a blind man. In another recorded case, a daughter cut the wrists of her parents.|$|E
25|$|Following his conviction, Baker {{remained}} in the public spotlight after several further violent incidents inside Auckland Prison. In July 2008, while being returned to Auckland Prison from Auckland City Hospital after treatment for self-inflicted injuries, Baker pulled a concealed shiv on a prison officer {{in an attempt to}} escape. The prison officer received minor injuries and Baker was returned to Auckland Prison. On 27 August 2009, Baker took hostage a fellow inmate in Auckland Prison using a makeshift knife and two <b>razor</b> <b>blades.</b> Police managed to defuse the situation and nobody was harmed in the incident. In 2010, Baker was found guilty on charges that resulted from these two incidents and was subsequently sentenced to preventive detention with no possibility of parole for at least 16 years.|$|E
