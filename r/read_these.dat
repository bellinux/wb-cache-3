5|$|Mary Shelley {{was born}} as Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in Somers Town, London, in 1797. She {{was the second}} child of the feminist philosopher, educator, and writer Mary Wollstonecraft, and the first child of the philosopher, novelist, and {{journalist}} William Godwin. Wollstonecraft died of puerperal fever shortly after Mary was born. Godwin was left to bring up Mary, along with her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, Wollstonecraft's child by the American speculator Gilbert Imlay. A year after Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute. However, because the Memoirs revealed Wollstonecraft's affairs and her illegitimate child, they were seen as shocking. Mary Godwin <b>read</b> <b>these</b> memoirs and her mother's books, and was brought up to cherish her mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|The {{first team}} of writers {{assembled}} {{for the show}} consisted of Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker. The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it {{is given to the}} rest of the writers to <b>read.</b> <b>These</b> scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.|$|E

5|$|Outside North America {{it opened}} {{reasonably}} well. In Australia {{it was the}} highest-earning film in its opening weekend of October 9–12, 2008 with $2,104,319, ahead of Pixar Animation's Wall-E, which fell to second place, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua held third. In the United Kingdom, the film's earnings were the second-highest behind Quantum of Solace during November 21–23, its opening weekend. It earned £991,939 from 393 screens. Overall, while the film grossed only $40 million at the North American box office, it has grossed $115,097,286 worldwide. In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism. Brandon Gray pointed out that people <b>read</b> <b>these</b> themes {{in the news media}} already, and there is a perception that Hollywood films are biased.|$|E
25|$|During {{the seventh}} through the ninth centuries, many earlier {{parchment}} manuscripts were scrubbed and scoured {{to be ready}} for rewriting, and often the earlier writing can still be <b>read.</b> <b>These</b> recycled parchments are called palimpsests.

25|$|After {{this service}} of light, {{a number of}} {{readings}} from the Old Testament are <b>read.</b> <b>These</b> tell the stories of creation, the sacrifice of Isaac, the crossing of the Red Sea, and the foretold coming of the Messiah.

At this time, the lights are brought up and the church bells are rung, according to local custom. A sermon may be preached after the gospel.|$|E

In such cases, the Canon for the Saint would be read together with the Canon to the Theotokos, followed by the Stichera to the saint from Vespers. There are also particular days (such as certain Forefeasts, Afterfeasts, and days during the Pentecostarion) that have special Canons for Compline composed for them.|$|E
25|$|Research also {{indicated}} that BNP voters were more mistrustful of the establishment than average citizens. In 2002–06, 92% of BNP voters described themselves as being dissatisfied with the government, to 62% of the wider population. Over 80% of BNP voters were found to distrust their local Member of Parliament, council officials, and civil servants, and {{were also more likely}} than average to think that politicians were personally corrupt. There was also a tendency for BNP voters to read tabloids like the Daily Mail, Daily Express, and The Sun, all of which promote anti-immigration sentiment. Whether these voters gained such sentiment as a result of reading these tabloids or they <b>read</b> <b>these</b> tabloids because it endorsed their pre-existing views is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Furnivall {{believed}} that, {{since many}} printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, {{it would be}} impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the Early English Text Society in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts. Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to <b>read</b> <b>these</b> texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.|$|E

25|$|Despite the frequently-heard {{view that}} their ancient music is lost, {{the means to}} {{reconstruct}} it still exist. Fragments of temple psalmody are preserved in ancient church and synagogue chant, particularly in the tonus peregrinus melody to Psalm 114. Cantillation signs, to record the melody sung, were in use since ancient times; evidence {{of them can be}} found in the manuscripts of the oldest extant copies of Psalms in the Dead Sea Scrolls and are even more extensive in the Masoretic text, which dates to the Early Middle Ages and whose Tiberian scribes claimed to be basing their work on temple-period signs. (See Moshe ben Asher's 'Song of the Vine' colophon to the Codex Cairensis). However, any knowledge of how to <b>read</b> <b>these</b> signs was lost in ancient times, and modern Bible translations do not include any musical notation.|$|E

Refusing an offer of a highly paid permanent contract to cover both music and cricket for the SMH he considered his options; with some reluctance he agreed to cover the MCC's 1946–47 tour of Australia for the SMH and also for The Times and The Manchester Guardian.

500|$|George Bernard Shaw {{believed}} that Fielding was [...] "the greatest practising dramatist, {{with the single}} exception of Shakespeare, produced in England between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century." [...] However, modern critics rarely agree with Shaw, as Robert Hume points out, [...] "Few scholars have been much interested in Fielding's highly successful career as a dramatist. To most it has seemed a false start. Readers tend to find the conventional plays derivative and sentimental, the topical ones scrappy and superficial." [...] In particular, only one book until 1988 was published on the topic, which was Ducrocq's Le theatre de Fielding, 1728–1737, et ses prolongements dans l'oeuvre romanesque. This critical approach {{is not limited to}} just Fielding, but to the whole field; the reputation of Colley Cibber was ruined by Pope's characterising him as the Arch Dunce and [...] "Since the plays of Cibber's only serious rival, Henry Fielding, are hardly even <b>read</b> <b>these</b> days, let alone performed, the earlier eighteenth-century theater tends to be passed over with (at best) a polite cough." ...|$|E
