40|$|This {{dissertation}} has two goals: {{to examine}} the empirical determinants of share repurchase policy and {{to examine the}} reasons for the increase <b>in</b> share <b>repurchase</b> activity <b>in</b> the mid- 1980 s.

The main result is that firms that repurchase do not pay less in dividends than comparable firms which do not repurchase. High profitability and the presence of an ESOP are predictors of share repurchase activity. The increase <b>in</b> share <b>repurchase</b> activity <b>in</b> the mid- 1980 s appears to be the result, at least in part, of an increased use of share repurchases to distribute earnings. ...|$|R
