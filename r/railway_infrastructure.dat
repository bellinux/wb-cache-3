5|$|Though the {{accident}} {{did not result}} in a large number of deaths, it exposed major stewardship shortcomings of the privatised national <b>railway</b> <b>infrastructure</b> company Railtrack. Reports found {{there was a lack of}} communication and some staff were not aware of maintenance procedures. Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of {{the accident}} saw widespread speed limit reductions throughout the rail network and a tightening of health and safety procedures, the repercussions of which were still felt up to 15 years later. In 2005, both Network Rail and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws.|$|E
5|$|Railway traffic {{throughout}} the state was paralyzed, as some train bridges collapsed, and extensive damage {{was found in the}} track ballast in multiple rail lines. Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. The damage to the <b>railway</b> <b>infrastructure</b> caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the rail track damage. The damage to the road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E
5|$|Soviet rail {{transport}} became, after the Great Patriotic War, {{one of the}} most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639km a year from 1965 to 1980, while the growth of {{rail transport}} in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in rail transport {{can be explained by the}} country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling {{one of the most}} electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building <b>railway</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Siberia in the first place.|$|E

5|$|The Allies also {{conducted}} a major air offensive against the French railway network and bridges {{over the river}} Seine from April to June. Bomber Command made 53 raids against these targets, of which 25 involved the four Australian heavy bomber squadrons. A total of 17 Australian bombers were lost during these operations, including six that German fighters shot down during {{an attack on the}} marshalling yards at Lille on the night of 10/11 May. In addition, Australians took part in 29 of the 46 raids conducted by 2TAF's light bombers against French <b>railway</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Australian fighter pilots, including all of No.453 Squadron on occasion, escorted some of these raids and conducted ground attack sorties targeting railway rolling stock. 2TAF's fighter-bombers also attacked bridges over the river Seine from April {{as part of an effort}} to seal off the Normandy region, and Australian pilots posted to British squadrons were involved in a small number of these operations. No.453 Squadron attacked bridges and viaducts near Normandy on 27 April and 2 May.|$|E
5|$|Australian airmen were {{involved}} in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No.464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns on this night. While No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities, No.460 Squadron formed part of an attack on Vire, which sought to destroy the town to prevent the Germans from using the roads through it. Following these initial raids, Bomber Command continued to target <b>railway</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in France {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy. The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period. Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included {{at least one of the}} RAAF squadrons. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer raids on these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the V-1 flying bombs the Germans were launching against the UK. No.464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June. Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed. The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{condition}} of <b>railway</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Vietnam varies from poor to fair; {{most of the}} network remains in need of rehabilitation and upgrading, having received only temporary repair from damages suffered during decades of war. A joint Japanese-Vietnamese evaluation team found that the poor state of <b>railway</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was the fundamental cause for most railway accidents, of which the most common types are train crashes against vehicles and persons, especially at illegal level crossings; derailments caused by failure to decrease speed were also noted as a common cause of accidents.|$|E

This paper examines a possibility to determine the track access charge (TAC) for Indonesia <b>railways</b> <b>infrastructure</b> based on a benchmark to other countries. Compared to existing charge that used basic price and product factor, the alternative proposed concept also considers multiplicative surcharge and load component. In-depth interviews will be conducted with related stakeholders from government bodies, operator, and academics to gain more insights and further to validate the research outcomes. The result shows that the suitable TAC value for the railway’s operator ranging from 56 % to 66 % from total proposed payable TAC, while government subsidy will cover the rest of 34 % to 44 % of determined track access charge to liberalize railways industry in Indonesia...|$|R
