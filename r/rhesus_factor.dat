40|$|The TORC 1 complex {{controls}} cell growth upon integrating nutritional signals including amino-acid availability. TORC 1 notably adapts {{the plasma}} membrane protein content by regulating arrestin-mediated endocytosis of amino-acid transporters. Here we demonstrate that TORC 1 further fine tunes the inherent {{activity of the}} ammonium transport protein, Mep 2, a yeast homologue of mammalian <b>Rhesus</b> <b>factors,</b> independently of arrestin-mediated endocytosis. The TORC 1 effector kinase Npr 1 and the upstream TORC 1 regulator Npr 2 control Mep 2 transport activity by phospho-silencing a carboxy-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Under poor nitrogen supply, Npr 1 enables Mep 2 S 457 phosphorylation and thus ammonium transport activity. Supplementation of the preferred nitrogen source glutamine leads to Mep 2 inactivation and instant S 457 dephosphorylation via plasma membrane Psr 1 and Psr 2 redundant phosphatases. This study underscores that TORC 1 also adjusts nutrient permeability to regulate cell growth in a fast and flexible response to environmental perturbation, establishing a hierarchy in the transporters to be degraded, inactivated or maintained active at the plasma membrane.

40|$|Ammonium {{transport}} proteins of the Mep/Amt/Rh family include microbial {{and plant}} Mep/Amt members, crucial for ammonium scavenging, and animal <b>Rhesus</b> <b>factors</b> likely involved in ammonium disposal. Recent structural information on two bacterial Mep/Amt proteins has revealed the presence, in the hydrophobic conducting pore, {{of a pair}} of preserved histidines proposed {{to play an important role}} in substrate conductance, by participating either in NH(4) (+) deprotonation or in shaping the pore. Here we highlight the existence of two functional Mep/Amt subfamilies distinguishable according to whether the first of these histidines is conserved, as in yeast ScMep 2, or replaced by glutamate, as in ScMep 1. Replacement of the native histidine of ScMep 2 with glutamate leads to conversion from ScMep 2 to ScMep 1 -like properties. This includes a two-unit upshift of the optimal pH for transport and an increase of the transport rate, consistent with alleviation of an energy-limiting step. Similar effects are observed when the same substitution is introduced into the Escherichia coli AmtB protein. In contrast to ScMep 1, ScMep 2 is proposed to play an additional signaling role in the induction of filamentous growth, a dimorphic change often associated with virulence in pathogenic fungi. We show here that the histidine to glutamate substitution in ScMep 2 leads to uncoupling of the transport and sensor functions, suggesting that a ScMep 2 -specific transport mechanism might be responsible for filamentation. Our overall data suggest the existence of two functional groups of Mep/Amt-type proteins with different transport mechanisms and distinct impacts on cell physiology and signaling.

40|$|Proteins of the conserved Mep-Amt-Rh family, {{including}} mammalian <b>Rhesus</b> <b>factors,</b> mediate transmembrane ammonium transport. Ammonium is {{an important}} nitrogen source for the biosynthesis of amino acids but is also a metabolic waste product. Its disposal in urine plays {{a critical role in}} the regulation of the acid/base homeostasis, especially with an acid diet, a trait of Western countries. Ammonium accumulation above a certain concentration is however pathologic, the cytotoxicity causing fatal cerebral paralysis in acute cases. Alteration in ammonium transport via human Rh proteins could have clinical outcomes. We used a yeast-based expression assay to characterize human Rh variants resulting from non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) with known or unknown clinical phenotypes and assessed their ammonium transport efficiency, protein level, localization and potential trans-dominant impact. The HsRhAG variants (I 61 R, F 65 S) associated to overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (OHSt), a disease affecting erythrocytes, proved affected in intrinsic bidirectional ammonium transport. Moreover, this study reveals that the R 202 C variant of HsRhCG, the orthologue of mouse MmRhcg required for optimal urinary ammonium excretion and blood pH control, shows an impaired inherent ammonium transport activity. Urinary ammonium excretion was RHcg gene-dose dependent in mouse, highlighting MmRhcg as a limiting factor. HsRhCG(R 202 C) may confer susceptibility to disorders leading to metabolic acidosis for instance. Finally, the analogous R 211 C mutation in the yeast ScMep 2 homologue also impaired intrinsic activity consistent with a conserved functional role of the preserved arginine residue. The yeast expression assay used here constitutes an inexpensive, fast and easy tool to screen nsSNPs reported by high throughput sequencing or individual cases for functional alterations in Rh factors revealing potential causal variants.

Ammonium is {{an important}} nitrogen source for the biosynthesis of amino acids for instance but its accumulation {{is also known as}} cytotoxic in animals. Nevertheless, the controlled disposal of ammonium in urine plays a critical role in the regulation of the acid-base homeostasis. Alteration in ammonium transport via human Rh proteins could have clinical outcomes. In this work, we addressed aspects of structurefunction analysis of altered human Rhesus proteins using a heterologous expression system and further characterized aspects of the patho-physiological roles of Rh proteins using knockout mice models available in the laboratory. Using a yeast-based expression assay, we characterized human Rh variants resulting from non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) with known or unknown clinical phenotypes. The HsRhAG variants (I 61 R, F 65 S) associated to overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (OHSt), a disease affecting erythrocytes, proved affected in intrinsic bidirectional ammonium transport, suggesting altered ammonium transport as a potential hallmark of the disease. Moreover, these variants showed trans-dominant negative effects on the activity of their native HsRhAG counterpart, suggesting altered cooperation of the subunits in “heteromeric” transport complexes. On the other hand, we revealed that the R 202 C variant of HsRhCG, the orthologue of mouse Rhcg required for optimal urinary ammonium excretion and blood pH control, shows an impaired inherent ammonium transport activity. HsRhCGR 202 C may potentially confer susceptibility to disorders leading to metabolic acidosis for instance.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) chronically infects approximately 30 million people worldwide. HIV- 1 {{has become one}} of the most difficult viral infections to treat due to its high mutability and emerging drug resistance. Critical to our development of more effective therapeutic treatments, we must better understand the HIV life cycle in order to reveal better targets for drug development. Thus, the purpose of this work was to investigate the role of autophagy, a cellular homeostatic mechanism capable of eliminating intracellular pathogens, in HIV- 1 infection of two relevant hosts, the human and the Old World non-permissive primate, the rhesus macaque. The ability of autophagy to eliminate HIV- 1 in these two species was compared with the objective of identifying why rhesus macaques efficiently eliminate HIV- 1 and humans do not. Here we report that human cells have lost autophagic protection against HIV, and identify a role for autophagy in supporting HIV- 1 biogenesis and egress from human macrophages.

Transmembrane ammonium transport is a widely spread process ensured by the highly conserved proteins of the Mep-Amt-Rh superfamily, including the mammalian <b>Rhesus</b> (Rh) <b>factors.</b> The regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of RH genes expression remain poorly studied. Here we addressed the expression regulation {{of one of these}} factors, RHBG. We identify HepG 2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and SW 480 colon adenocarcinoma cells as expressing RHBG and show that its expression relies on β-catenin signaling. siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown resulted in significant reduction of RHBG mRNA in both cell lines. Pharmaceutical inhibition of the TCF 4 /β-catenin interaction or knockdown of the transcription factor TCF 4 also downregulated RHBG expression. We identify a minimal RHBG regulatory sequence displaying a promoter activity and show that β-catenin and TCF 4 bind to this fragment in vivo. We finally characterize the role of potential TCF 4 binding sites in RHBG regulation. Taken together, our results indicate RHBG expression as a direct target of β-catenin regulation, a pathway frequently deregulated in many cancers and associated with tumorigenesis. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Scanty literature is available in assessing the relative liability of blood group phenotypes to periodontal diseases. This research was conducted to determine the association of the ABO blood group and <b>Rhesus</b> (Rh) <b>factor</b> to periodontal diseases to assess whether they could be the predictors of periodontal diseases. Materials and Methods: A total of 1, 220 subjects aged between 20 and 55 years were selected on a random basis. The study populations were segregated into three groups according to Ramfjord&#x 2032;s periodontal disease index: Healthy, Gingivitis and Periodontitis. Blood samples were collected to identify the ABO blood groups and the Rh factor by the slide method. Results: Blood group A showed a significantly higher percentage in the gingivitis group and blood group O showed a higher percentage in the periodontitis group. The blood group AB showed the least percentage of periodontal diseases. The distribution of Rh factor in all groups showed a significantly higher distribution of Rh-positive. Conclusion: The genetic factors may alter the oral ecology and the process of periodontal disease. These data are suggestive of a broad correlation between periodontal diseases and blood groups, which may act as risk predictors for periodontal diseases. This will make it possible to better-understand the risk factors of diseases of the periodontal tissues and to predict the effective methods of prevention and treatment of periodontal diseases...|$|R

Understanding mechanisms of delayed HIV- 2 disease progression could provide {{new insights into}} HIV control. The Caio Community Cohort was established in Guinea-Bissau {{in the setting of}} high HIV- 2 prevalence. This thesis investigates the role of polymorphic host restriction factors of the TRIM family in HIV- 2 outcome. TRIM proteins are a family of E 3 ubiquitin-ligases, where closely-related TRIM 5 α and TRIM 22 are thought to inhibit HIV- 1 transcription, uncoating and budding. There was an association between TRIM 5 α amino acid substitution R 136 Q and reduced HIV- 2 viral load/prolonged survival. Conversely, P 479 L was enriched among HIV- 2 infected participants and progressors with CD 4 + T cell decline. TRIM 22 was highly polymorphic in this cohort, revealing three novel coding variants. Although most substitutions were located in the putative virus-interacting PRYSPRY domain, two in the coiled-coil, D 155 N and R 242 T, showed significant and divergent associations with survival. R 242 T was enriched in HIV- 2 infected participants, who progressed to death at twice the rate of wild-type controls. In silico studies predicted D 282, D 360, and R 321 of TRIM 22 to be highly conserved, exposed residues, for which polymorphisms would be deleterious. When aligned with sequences from the potent HIV- 1 restriction <b>factor,</b> <b>rhesus</b> macaque TRIM 5 α, TRIM 22 substitutions R 321 K, T 415 I, and D 360 Y were spatially relevant to residues involved in HIV- 1 restriction.

Retrospective analyses were performed by collecting data from the clinical records of patients submitted to elective digestive tract surgeries from June 2007 to December 2008 at these four hospital units. Eighty-one cases (42 % females and 58 % males) were included in this study. The average age was 55. 5 years old (Standard deviation ± 19. 11 years). The commonest reported underlying disease was neoplasia (42 %). Of these patients, 38 (47 %) were transfused in the immediate preoperative period, 28 (34. 6 %) during the surgery and 37 (45. 7 %) in the immediate postoperative period. In the univariate analysis, there was an association between the data of transfusions and the different institutions. In the surgical phase, there were correlations between transfusion and the reason for transfusion, RH <b>factor</b> (<b>Rhesus),</b> institutional policy and the underlying disease. In the postoperative phase, no association was identified. In all phases, there were not correlations between the type of surgical procedures, ASA index (American Society of Anesthesiology), and hemoglobin and hematocrit values. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the blood transfusions in elective digestive tract surgeries were heterogeneous between hospitals and were not related to specific laboratorial values; they were associated to the underlying pathology, but not with the type of surgical procedure and generally followed the criteria of the healthcare specialist...|$|R
5000|$|Karl Landsteiner, [...] (June 14, 1868 - June 26, 1943), was an Austrian {{biologist}} and physician and immunologist. He distinguished the main blood groups in 1900, having developed the modern system of classification of blood groups from his {{identification of the}} presence of agglutinins in the blood, and identified, with Alexander S. Wiener, the <b>Rhesus</b> <b>factor,</b> in 1937, thus enabling physicians to transfuse blood without endangering the patient's life. With Constantin Levaditi and Erwin Popper, he discovered the polio virus in 1909. He received the Aronson Prize in 1926. In 1930, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He was posthumously awarded the Lasker Award in 1946, and has been described as the father of transfusion medicine.|$|E
5000|$|Type 2 and Type 3 {{hypersensitivity}} both involve {{complications from}} auto-immune or low affinity antibodies. In {{both of these}} reactions, T cells may play an accomplice role in generating these auto-specific antibodies, although some of these reactions under Type 2 hypersensitivity would be considered normal in a healthy immune system (for example, <b>Rhesus</b> <b>factor</b> reactions during child-birth is a normal immune response against child antigens). The {{understanding of the role}} of helper T cells in these responses is limited but it is generally thought that Th2 cytokines would promote such disorders. For example, studies have suggested that lupus (SLE) and other auto-immune diseases of similar nature can be linked to the production of Th2 cytokines.|$|E
