40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{examined}} whether chronic severe diabetes may affect ischaemic and post-ischaemic regional myocardial dysfunction in vivo in the dog. Diabetes was chemically induced in <b>randomized</b> <b>animals</b> and major metabolic alterations were observed confirming the severity and chronicity of the diabetes. After 70 days, halothane-anaesthetized dogs underwent a 20 -min coronary occlusion, followed by reperfusion. During ischaemia, global left ventricle function (dP/dtmax) was more altered (P< 0. 005) in diabetics (n= 10) than in controls (n= 10), whereas area-at-risk (29 +/- 2. 5 % {{of the left}} ventricle in diabetics v 32. 4 +/- 1. 9 % in controls) and ischaemic subendocardial myocardial blood flow (radioactive microsphere technique, 0. 11 +/- 0. 02 v 0. 10 +/- 0. 03 ml/min/g) were similar. During reperfusion, both groups developed significant (P< 0. 05) regional myocardial dysfunction (somomicrometry, 41 +/- 14 % of baseline in controls and 66 +/- 8 % in diabetics), whereas the difference between groups was not significant. No dog of either group developed myocardial cell necrosis on tissue histology. Multivariate analyses, including the severity of prior ischaemia and the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation as covariables, confirmed that myocardial stunning was not increased in diabetics, although ischaemia was clearly less-well-tolerated in diabetic dogs as global (dP/dtmax) as well as regional myocardial function were significantly (P< 0. 05) more altered in diabetics during ischaemia. Whilst alteration of arachidonate and cholesterol metabolism may partly explain this apparent paradox, further studies are required to resolve this issue...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of carcass {{physical}} {{composition and}} physicochemical characteristics of meat from Nellore males distributed randomly into three treatments: males castrated at 13 {{months of age}} at puberty (n= 26); castrated at 18 months of age, 15 days before confinement (n= 26); and young bulls (n= 25). For the evaluation of meat chemical characteristics, we used samples of 12 animals taken at random from each treatment. The experimental design was completely <b>randomized.</b> <b>Animals</b> were slaughtered at 22 months of age after 100 days of confinement. The carcasses of young bulls showed higher contents of muscle (66. 46 %) and bone (16. 03 %), and lower fat content (17. 66 %), in relation to that of steers castrated at 13 (62. 83, 15. 28, and 22. 11 %, respectively) or 18 months (63. 99, 15. 29, and 21. 53 %, respectively), which did not differ amongst themselves. The meat of young bulls was darker (3. 07 points) than the meat from those castrated at 13 months of age (3. 43 points), while the meat from those castrated at 18 months displayed an intermediate color (3. 29 points), not differing from the others. Young bulls yielded meat with lower content of intramuscular fat (3. 18 points) and lipids (3. 81 %) in relation to those castrated at 13 (4. 58 points and 6. 77 %, respectively) or 18 months (4. 52 points and 5. 66 %, respectively). Protein content was higher (P 0. 05) {{by the age of}} castration, with young bulls having lower values in relation to the castrated males. Castration of Nellore young bulls in early puberty increases the edible portion of the carcass due to the higher body fat deposit...|$|E

Estes foram avaliados quanto ?? conformidade cranial, presen??a de c??lculo dent??rio, fraturas dent??rias, maloclus??o, halitose, sangramento gengival e mensura????o da profundidade de sulco peridontal. As amostras foram obtidas da mucosa gengival, biofilme dental e sulco periodontal, com diferentes formas de coletas: swab, cureta, sonda periodontal milimetrada e ponta de membrana em ??ster de celulose. O teste de suscetibilidade in vitro foi realizado pela t??cnica de microdilui????o em caldo testando o produto A (0, 12 % de gluconato de clorexidina, 0, 12 % de cloreto de benzalc??nio e 0, 10 % de extrato de clorofila) e, o produto B (0, 2 % de cloreto de benzalc??nio, 1 % de tintura de pr??polis e 0, 5 % de aroma hortel??pimenta) frente a 15 leveduras isoladas. Tamb??m foram avaliados os princ??pios ativos gluconato de clorexidina, cloreto de benzalc??nio e tintura de pr??polis isoladamente. As fraturas dent??rias foram mais frequentes nos animais com seis anos ou mais (p= 0, 0030). Nos c??es com at?? dois anos a presen??a de c??lculo dent??rio aresentou-se com menor frequ??ncia (p= 0, 0000) em rela????o aos outros dois grupos. Na rela????o entre o n??mero de locais de isolamento com idade, conformidade cranial, presen??a de fratura, c??lculo dent??rio, halitose, sangramento gengival e maloclus??o n??o foi encontrada diferen??a estatisticamente significativa. Foram isoladas 61 leveduras, M. pachydermatis (50, 82 %), Rhodotorula spp. (13, 11 %), C. albicans (4, 92 %), C. catenulata (3, 28 %), C. famata (1, 64 %), C. guilliermondii (1, 64 %), C. parapsilosis (1, 64 %), C. intermedia (1, 64 %), T. asahii (13, 11 %), T. mucoide (1, 64 %) e C. albidus (6, 56 %) distribu??das em 30 (50, 85 %) animais.

The aims {{of this study}} was the oral cavity evaluation of females stray dogs from Pelotas-RS, as well as yeast isolation and identification from three different areas of this cavity, comparison of two technique of sample collection (swabs and curettes) and test the in vitro susceptibility of isolated yeasts against common oral antiseptics used in pets. Fifty-nine <b>randomized</b> <b>animals</b> were included in the study. All of them were SRD, without age defined and from Pelotas-RS. They were divided in three groups of ages by the evaluation of dental arc, and were examined to determine the cranial morphology, presence of dental plaque, tooth fractures, malocclusion, halitosis and gingival bleeding. Measure of periodontal groove depth was also done. Samples were collected from three areas, gingival mucosa, dental biofilm and periodontal grooves, with different collection techniques: swab, curettes, millimeter periodontal probe and cellulose polymers membranes. In vitro susceptibility tests by microdilution methods was done with 15 of those yeasts against A product (0, 12 % chlorhexidine gluconate, 0, 12 % benzalkonium chloride and 0, 10 % chlorophila extract) and B product (0, 2 % benzalkonium chloride, 1 % propolis and 0, 5 % peppermint arome). It was also evaluated chemical principles of products in separated, as chlorhexidine gluconate, benzalkonium chloride and propolis. Tooth fractures was observed in higher proportion at animals with six or more years old (p= 0, 0030). Dogs younger than 2 years old had lower rate of dental plaques than the others groups (p= 0, 0000). The association of positive areas of yeast isolation with age, tooth fracture, dental plaque, halitosis, gingival bleeding or malocclusion was not statistically significant. Sixty-one yeasts were isolated, characterized by M. pachydermatis (50, 82 %), Rhodotorula spp. (13, 11 %), C. albicans (4, 92 %), C. catenulata (3, 28 %), C. famata (1, 64 %), C. guilliermondii (1, 64 %), C. parapsilosis (1, 64 %), C. intermedia (1, 64 %), T. asahii (13, 11 %), T. mucoide (1, 64 %) and C. albidus (6, 56 %), from 30 (50, 85 %) animals. Yeasts growing inhibition was observed in all products tested and in all concentrations of them, with exception of propolis that did not show activity against yeasts. In conclusion, at oral cavity exam of female dogs, the mainly alterations found were dental plaques, tooth fractures and malocclusion. Isolated yeasts are normal habitants from the three different areas of oral cavity studied, without resulting in clinical signs. In relation to the techniques, it was not found difference between swab and curettes for oral sample collection. Yeast isolation was higher in female dogs that show halitosis. Oral antiseptics tested, as well as chlorhexidine gluconate and benzalkonium chloride were effective against yeasts isolated from canine oral cavity in all dilution tested.

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of GMDZ decoction on neuropsychiatric disorders in an animal model. Methods: We searched seven databases for <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> studies published until April 2015 : Pubmed, four Korean databases (DBpia, Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System, Korean Studies Information Service System, and Research Information Sharing Service), and one Chinese database (China National Knowledge Infrastructure). The <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> studies were included if the effects of GMDZ decoction were tested on neuropsychiatric disorders. All articles were read in full and extracted predefined criteria by two independent reviewers. Results: From a total of 258 hits, six <b>randomized</b> controlled <b>animal</b> studies were included. Five studies used a Sprague Dawley rat model for acute psychological stress, post-traumatic stress disorders, and unpredictable mild stress depression whereas one study used a Kunming mouse model for prenatal depression. The results of the studies showed that GMDZ decoction improved the related outcomes. Conclusion: Regardless of the dose and concentration used, GMDZ decoction significantly improved neuropsychiatric disease-related outcomes in animal models.

40|$|Brain {{temperature}} monitoring {{is important in}} target temperature management for comatose survivors after cardiac arrest. Since acquisition of brain temperature is invasive and unrealistic in scene of resuscitation, we tried to sought out surrogate sites of temperature measurements that can precisely reflect cerebral temperature. Therefore, we designed this controlled, <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study to investigate whether esophageal temperature can better predict brain temperature in two different hypothermia protocols. The results indicated that esophageal temperature had a stronger correlation with brain temperature in the early phase of hypothermia in both whole and regional body cooling protocols. It means that esophageal temperature was considered as priority method for early monitoring once hypothermia is initiated. This clinical significance {{of this study is}} as follows. Since resuscitated patients have unstable hemodynamics, collecting temperature data from esophagus probe is cost-efficient and easier than the catheter in central vein. Moreover, it can prevent the risk of iatrogenic infection comparing with deep vein catheterization, especially in survivors with transient immunoexpressing in hypothermia protocol...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> {{study to determine}} whether there is a cumulative effect on hemodynamics, pulmonary function, and gas exchange when low-dose nitric oxide (NO) is added to partial liquid ventilation (PLV) in acute lung injury. Eighteen newborn piglets were saline-lavaged repeatedly, and randomly divided into two groups: PLV with perfluorocarbon group (n= 8) and lavage only (control) group (n= 10). Perfluorodecalin (30 mL/kg) was instilled into the endotracheal tube for 30 min, followed by 5 - 10 mL/kg/hr. Fifteen minutes after the completion of perfluorodecalin dosing, NO (10 ppm) was added to the inspiratory gas in an "on/off" manner. Perfluorodecalin instillation produced a significant improvement in gas exchange, pulmonary mechanics, shunt, and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). The addition of NO produced a further significant improvement in PaO 2 and PAP. The "on/off" response to NO was seen apparently in PAP, PaO 2, dynamic compliance, and shunt. All the variables in control group were remained at near the after-lavage levels without significant improvements {{until the end of the}} experiment.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective double-blind <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study in a university research laboratory. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS: Sixty C 57 BL/ 6 mice were given an aseptic intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide followed after 6 days by zymosan (day 0) at a dose of either 0. 9 or 1. 0 mg/g body weight. Starting on day 0 mice were administered PTX at a dose of 80 mg/kg body weight or saline per os every 8 h. On day 17 surviving animals were killed, and their liver, lungs, spleen, and kidneys were collected. RESULTS: Mortality, course of body temperature, body weight, and macroscopic lung damage were similar between zymosan-treated groups. Administration of PTX did not significantly alter survival, body temperature, body weight, or macroscopic lung damage. In addition, {{there were no significant}} differences in organ weights between mice that received PTX and mice that received PBS. Although PTX inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6 expression (but not interleukin 1 beta expression) at both mRNA and protein level in a murine macrophage cell line, tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA expression in the livers of PTX-treated mice was not significantly inhibited.

In spite of various physiological properties attributed to proteins, their functions have neither been addressed by assessing quality of proteins nor by nutrition and dietetic practices. Methods: Studies were included if they were <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> studies, clinical trials and systematic reviews/meta-analysis published in English language. Results: The effect of maternal diet in general and dietary proteins in particular during development on health of offspring has been well-studied. Protein content as well as source of protein in the diet consumed during pregnancy and lactation influenced the risk of metabolic syndrome characteristics in offspring. Both high and low protein diets showed detrimental effects on health of offspring. Moreover, comparison of maternal casein-based diet with soy protein-based diet showed more favorable effect on body weight, body composition, blood pressure, and glucose metabolism in offspring. However, the role of maternal dietary proteins in developing the risk of metabolic syndrome characteristics in offspring in gestational obesity is still unclear and needs further study.

Design: <b>Randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study. Settings: University research laboratory. Subjects: A total of 40 males 12 -week-old Wistar rats {{were subjected to}} ischemia-reperfusion and assigned to four groups: amniotic fluid stem cells, vascular endothelial growth factor-amniotic fluid stem cells in two different doses, and vehicle. Ten animals were used as sham-controls. Intervention: Six hours after induction of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, amniotic fluid stem cells, vascular endothelial growth factor-amniotic fluid stem cells in two different doses, or vehicle were injected intraarterially. Measurements and Main Results: Analyses were performed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 2 months after treatment. Outcome measures included serum creatinine, urine microprotenuira, and immunohistomorphometric analyses. Vascular endothelial growth factor-amniotic fluid stem cells induced a significantly higher nephroprotection than amniotic fluid stem cells. This effect was mediated mainly by immunomodulation, which led to lower macrophage infiltration and higher presence of regulatory T cell after ischemia-reperfusion injury. At medium term, it inhibited the progression toward chronic kidney disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor-amniotic fluid stem cells can worsen the ischemiareperfusion injury when delivered in a high dose.

OBJECTIVE: To establish functional recovery parameters after interposition autografting in a rodent facial nerve model. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study at a tertiary care facial nerve center using 16 female Wistar Hannover rats. INTERVENTION: The experimental group received reversed autograft reconstruction of a 20 -mm neural gap, and the control group received facial nerve transection and primary repair. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Whisker excursion was measured weekly for 70 postoperative days using laser micrometers. RESULTS: The control group exhibited the most rapid recovery, with substantial return of whisker movement occurring during the third postoperative week. The experimental group demonstrated return of function beginning in the fourth postoperative week, eventually achieving a degree of function comparable to that of the control group by the sixth postoperative week (P =. 68).

40|$|Objective: Sepsis is {{associated}} with a marked depression of cellular immune function. The steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is proposed to have immunoenhancing activities. We therefore, investigated the effect of DHEA on the mortality rate and:cellular immune functions in an experimental model of sepsis. Design: <b>Randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study. Setting: Level I trauma center, university research laboratory. Subjects: Male NMRI mice. Interventions: Mice were subjected to laparotomy (sham) or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice were treated with (sham/DHEA; CLP/DHEA) or without (sham; CLP) the steroid hormone DHEA (30 mg/kg sc). Animals were killed 48 hrs after the onset of sepsis. Measurements and Main Results: The survival rate of septic mice was determined 24 and 48 hrs after onset of sepsis. Forty-eight hours after the septic challenge, a white blood cell count was performed and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha and interleukin (IL) - 1 beta concentrations were monitored using ELISA. Furthermore, the delayed type of hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction was evaluated on the basis of ear pinna swelling after dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) administration, and clinical variables (body weight, temperature, heart rate, fluid input/output, food intake) were monitored using metabolic cages. DHEA administration improved the survival rate (87 % vs. 53 % after 48 hrs; p serum concentrations (20. 7 +/- 1. 4 pg/mL vs. 32. 4 +/- 6. 6 pg/mL). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that DHEA administration leads to an increased survival following a septic challenge. The immunoenhancing effect of DHEA is accompanied by a reduction of TNF-alpha release and an improved activity of T-cellular immunity. DHEA administration may, therefore, be beneficial in systemic inflammation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGenetically {{engineered}} mouse models (GEMMs) of {{lung cancer}} closely recapitulate the human disease but suffer from the difficulty of evaluating tumor growth by conventional methods. Herein, a novel automated image analysis method for estimating the lung tumor burden from in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) data is described. The proposed tumor burden metric is the segmented soft tissue volume contained within a chest space region of interest, excluding {{an estimate of the}} heart volume. The method was validated by comparison with previously published manual analysis methods and applied in two therapeutic studies in a mutant K-ras GEMM of non–small cell lung carcinoma. Mice were imaged by micro-CT pre-treatment and stratified into four treatment groups: an antibody inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), chemotherapy, combination of anti-VEGF and chemotherapy, or control antibody. In the first study, post-treatment imaging was performed 4 weeks later. In the second study, mice were scanned serially on a high-throughput scanner every 2 weeks for 8 weeks during treatment. In both studies, the automated tumor burden estimates were well correlated with manual metrics (r value range: 0. 83 - 0. 93, P <. 0001) and showed a similar, significant reduction in tumor growth in mice treated with anti-VEGF alone or in combination with chemotherapy.

40|$|Hypothesis: Infusion of ethyl {{pyruvate}} (EP) solution {{can improve}} outcome in a clinically relevant, large- animal model of septic shock resulting from fecal peritonitis. Design Prospective <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study. Setting University hospital animal research laboratory. Subjects Fourteen female sheep. Interventions Fourteen fasted, anesthetized, invasively monitored, mechanically ventilated female sheep weighing (mean 1 SD) 30. 4 1 3. 8 kg received 0. 5 g/kg of feces intraperitoneally to induce peritonitis, without administration of antibiotic agents or vasoactive drugs. After surgical preparation, the ewes were randomized {{to receive a}} continuous intravenous infusion at 15 mg/kg per hour of either EP combined with Ringer lactate solution or Ringer lactate solution only. Fluid resuscitation was titrated to maintain the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure at baseline levels throughout the experiment. All animals were monitored until they died spontaneously or for a maximum of 30 hours. Results: Compared with Ringer lactate solution alone, EP administration resulted in less tachycardia, longer time to development of arterial hypotension and oliguria (median, 27 vs 15 hours and 24 vs 16 hours, respectively; both P<. 01), and prolonged survival time (median, 29. 5 vs 17. 0 hours; P<. 001). Animals who received EP also had a smaller decrease in colloid osmotic pressure (P<. 05) and a tendency for lower serum interleukin 6 concentrations (P = 3 D. 08). Conclusions: In this clinically relevant model of septic shock in ewes, continuous EP infusion prolonged time to development of organ dysfunction and markedly prolonged survival.

40|$|Objective: Previous studies {{failed to}} show clear {{benefits}} of high-frequency ventilation compared with conventional positive pressure ventilation (PPVCON) in experimental meconium aspiration syndrome. However, none of these studies applied an open lung ventilation strategy (OLC), which aims to reduce intrapulmonary shunt due to alveolar collapse. We hypothesized that, if combined with an open lung strategy, both high-frequency oscillatory ventilaton (HFOVOLC) and positive pressure ventilation (PPVOLC) would improve gas exchange and attenuate ventilator-induced lung injury in experimental meconium aspiration syndrome. Design: Prospective, <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study. Setting: Research laboratory of a large university. Subjects: Forty-two newborn piglets. Interventions: Thirty minutes after intratracheal meconium instillation, 36 newborn piglets were {{assigned to one of}} three ventilation groups-PPVOLC, HFOVOLC, or PPVCON-and ventilated for 5 hrs. In both OLC groups, collapsed alveoli were actively recruited and thereafter stabilized using the lowest possible airway pressures. During PPVCON, ventilator settings were adjusted to prevent critical hypoxia (PaO 2 < 60 torr [8 kPa]). Six animals served as saline controls. Measurements and Main Results: Compared with the PPVCON group, arterial oxygenation and lung mechanics were superior in both OLC groups and the saline controls. Analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained after 5 hrs of ventilation showed increased myeloperoxidase activity in the PPVCON group compared with both OLC groups and saline controls. Alveolar protein influx was not different between the groups. Histologic analysis revealed a higher lung injury score in the PPVCON group compared with the PPVOLC and the HFOVOLC groups. Conclusions: Application of the OLC during PPV and HFOV is feasible in experimental meconium aspiration syndrome and results in superior oxygenation and less ventilator-induced lung injury compared with PPVCO...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the degree of}} plasma volume expansion by 0. 9 % NaCl {{in relation to the}} infused volume, in sepsis/SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), after a standardized hemorrhage, and in a normal condition. DESIGN: Prospective, <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study. SETTING: University hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS: Thirty anesthetized adult male rats. INTERVENTIONS: The study was performed in 3 groups: a sepsis/SIRS group (the S group), in which sepsis/SIRS was induced by cecal ligation and incision, a hemorrhage group (the H group), in which the rats were left without intervention for 4 hrs, and bled 8 mL/kg thereafter. The study also included a group that was left without intervention (the N group). Then, 4 hrs after baseline, all 3 groups were given an infusion of 0. 9 % NaCl (32 mL/kg) for 15 mins. Baseline was defined as the time point when the surgical preparation was finished. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma volumes were measured using I-albumin dilution technique at baseline, after 4 hrs, and 20 mins after the end of infusion. The plasma volume-expanding effect 20 mins after end of infusion was 0. 6 ± 2. 9 % in the S group, 20 ± 6. 4 % in the H group and 12 ± 11 % in the N group, compared to just before start of infusion. CONCLUSIONS: The present study in rats showed that the plasma volume-expanding effect after an infusion of 0. 9 % NaCl was smaller in a septic/SIRS state than after hemorrhage and in a normal state. This indicates that the plasma volume expanding effect of a crystalloid in sepsis/SIRS is dependent on pathophysiological changes...|$|R

INTERVENTIONS: Fifteen hours after cecal ligation and puncture, anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and instrumented mice (wild-type controls, n = 13; iNOS-/-, n = 12; wild-type mice receiving 5 mg. kg(- 1) i. p. of the selective iNOS inhibitor GW 274150 immediately after cecal ligation and puncture, n = 8) received continuous i. v. hydroxyethylstarch and norepinephrine to achieve normotensive and hyperdynamic hemodynamics. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Measurements were recorded 18, 21 and 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture. Liver microcirculatory perfusion and capillary hemoglobin O 2 saturation (laser Doppler flowmetry and remission spectrophotometry) were well maintained in all groups. Despite significantly lower norepinephrine doses required to achieve the hemodynamic targets, the rate of hepatic glucose production (gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry measurements of tissue isotope enrichment during continuous i. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - 13 C 6 -glucose infusion) at 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture was significantly higher in both iNOS-/- and GW 274150 -treated mice, which was concomitant with a significantly higher hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (spectrophotometry) in these animals. CONCLUSIONS: In normotensive, hyperdynamic septic shock, both pharmacologic and genetic deletion of the inducible nitric oxide synthase allowed maintenance of hepatic glucose production, most likely due to maintained activity of the key regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Nuclear factor (NF) -&# 954;B {{is central}} to the {{pathogenesis}} of inflammation in acute lung injury, but also to inflammation resolution and repair. We wished to determine whether overexpression of the NF-&# 954;B inhibitor I&# 954;B&# 945; could modulate the severity of acute and prolonged pneumonia-induced lung injury in a series of prospective <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> studies. Methods Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to undergo intratracheal instillation of (a) 5 &# 215; 109 adenoassociated virus (AAV) vectors encoding the I&# 954;B&# 945; transgene (5 &# 215; 109 AAV-I&# 954;B&# 945;); (b) 1 &# 215; 1010 AAV-I&# 954;B&# 945;; (c) 5 &# 215; 1010 AAV-I&# 954;B&# 945;; or (d) vehicle alone. After intratracheal inoculation with Escherichia coli, the severity of the lung injury was measured in one series over a 4 -hour period (acute pneumonia), and in a second series after 72 hours (prolonged pneumonia). Additional experiments examined the effects of I&# 954;B&# 945; and null-gene overexpression on E. coli-induced and sham pneumonia. Results In acute pneumonia, I&# 954;B&# 945; dose-dependently decreased lung injury, improving arterial oxygenation and lung static compliance, reducing alveolar protein leak and histologic injury, and decreasing alveolar IL- 1 &# 946; concentrations. Benefit was maximal at the intermediate (1 &# 215; 1010) I&# 954;B&# 945; vector dose; however, efficacy was diminished at the higher (5 &# 215; 1010) I&# 954;B&# 945; vector dose. In contrast, I&# 954;B&# 945; worsened prolonged pneumonia-induced lung injury, increased lung bacterial load, decreased lung compliance, and delayed resolution of the acute inflammatory response. Conclusions Inhibition of pulmonary NF-&# 954;B activity reduces early pneumonia-induced injury, but worsens injury and bacterial load during prolonged pneumonia...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s {{experiments}} on spinalized cats showed that exercise {{training on the}} treadmill could enhance locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). In this review, we summarize the evidence for the effectiveness of exercise training aimed at promoting locomotor recovery in animal models of SCI. We performed a systematic search of the literature using Medline, Web of Science, and Embase. Of the 362 studies screened, 41 were included. The adult female rat was {{the most widely used}} animal model. The majority of studies (73 %) reported that exercise training had a positive effect on some aspect of locomotor recovery. Studies employing a complete SCI were less likely to have positive outcomes. For incomplete SCI models, contusion was the most frequently employed method of lesion induction, and the degree of recovery depended on injury severity. Positive outcomes were associated with training regimens that involved partial weight-bearing activity, commenced within a critical period of 1 - 2 weeks after SCI, and maintained training for at least 8 weeks. Considerable heterogeneity in training paradigms and methods used to assess or quantify recovery was observed. A 13 -item checklist was developed and employed to assess the quality of reporting and study design; only 15 % of the studies had high methodological quality. We recommend that future studies include control groups, <b>randomize</b> <b>animals</b> to groups, conduct blinded assessments, report the extent of the SCI lesion, and report sample size calculations. A small battery of objective assessment methods including assessment of over-ground stepping should also be developed and routinely employed. This would allow future meta-analyses of the effectiveness of exercise interventions on locomotor recovery...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES A common {{potentially}} fatal {{disease of the}} pancreas is acute pancreatitis, {{for which there is}} no treatment. Most studies of this disorder focus on the damage to acinar cells since they are assumed to be the primary target of multiple stressors affecting the pancreas. However, increasing evidence suggests that the ducts may also have a crucial role in induction of the disease. To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine the specific role of the duct in the induction of acute pancreatitis using well-established disease models and mice with deletion of the Na/H exchanger regulatory factor- 1 that have selectively impaired ductal function. DESIGN <b>Randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study. SETTING Animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS Wild-type and Na/H exchanger regulatory factor- 1 knockout mice. INTERVENTIONS Acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by i. p. administration of cerulein or by intraductal administration of sodium taurocholate. The pancreatic expression of Na/H exchanger regulatory factor- 1 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (a key player in the control of ductal secretion) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In vivo pancreatic ductal secretion was studied in anesthetized mice. Functions of pancreatic acinar and ductal cells as well as inflammatory cells were analyzed in vitro. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Deletion of Na/H exchanger regulatory factor- 1 resulted in gross mislocalization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, causing marked reduction in pancreatic ductal fluid and bicarbonate secretion. Importantly, deletion of Na/H exchanger regulatory factor- 1 had no deleterious effect on functions of acinar and inflammatory cells. Deletion of Na/H exchanger regulatory factor- 1, which specifically impaired ductal function, increased the severity of acute pancreatitis in the two mouse models tested. CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide the first direct evidence for the crucial role of ductal secretion in protecting the pancreas from acute pancreatitis and strongly suggest that improved ductal function should be an important modality in prevention and treatment of the disease...|$|R

DESIGN:: Prospective, <b>randomized</b> <b>animal</b> study. SETTING:: University hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS:: Twenty adult, male cats. INTERVENTIONS:: Meningitis was induced by intrathecal injection of Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (0. 8 × 10 units/kg). Four {{hours after the}} lipopolysaccharide injection, the <b>animals</b> were <b>randomized</b> to intravenous treatment with 0. 4 mL/kg/hr of 20 % albumin or 7. 5 mL/kg/hr of 0. 9 % sodium chloride for 6 hrs (n = 7 per group). A control group receiving lipopolysaccharide but no fluid was also studied (n = 6). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Effects on intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, plasma volume (I-albumin technique), plasma oncotic pressure, and brain metabolism via cerebral interstitial lactate/pyruvate ratio and glycerol and glucose levels (microdialysis technique) were evaluated. Plasma volume decreased by approximately 20 % and intracranial pressure increased from 10 to approximately 20 mm Hg at 4 hrs after the lipopolysaccharide injection. Six hours later, plasma volume had returned to baseline in both fluid groups while there was a further reduction in the control group. Intracranial pressure was higher in the saline group than in the albumin and control groups and was 25. 8 ± 2. 8 mm Hg, 18. 3 ± 0. 6 mm Hg, and 20. 4 ± 1. 7 mm Hg, respectively. Plasma oncotic pressure was higher in the albumin group than in the saline and control groups. Mean arterial pressure and microdialysis data were within normal range and did not differ among the groups. CONCLUSIONS:: The {{results showed that the}} choice of resuscitation fluid may influence intracranial pressure in meningitis. The lower intracranial pressure in the colloid group may be explained by a higher plasma oncotic pressure and less fluid distribution to the brain interstitium...|$|R
