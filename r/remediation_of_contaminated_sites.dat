40|$|Policies for the <b>remediation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> emerged {{relatively}} late as a subfield {{of environmental}} protection. The policy area is adjacent to other policies, such as waste policy, which often includes provisions {{on how to}} deal with waste dumps, as well as soil and groundwater protection policies, which deal with the prevention of contamination. Nevertheless, most countries introduced policies for the clean-up of contaminated sites in the course of the 1990 s while only a handful already tackled this issue in the 1980 s. The policies on contaminated land developed initially at the domestic level. Although in a few cases contaminated sites gained international attention, such as the Love Canal in the USA and Lekkerkerk in the Netherlands, contaminated soil was considered a local problem and the responsibility of national (or subnational) governments. At the EU level up to today, national insistence on the subsidiarity principle prevented agreement on common regulations. Similarly, at the wider international level, we find no binding or non-binding international law or agreements on the <b>remediation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> However, several transnational networks have emerged that have played a role in the international convergence process of contaminated sites policy (see Section 6. 3) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} how {{the environmental and}} health risks posed by a contaminated site affected the probability that it would receive funding for remedial action under a Swedish subsidization scheme, the Local Investment Programme (LIP). The LIP, effective between 1998 and 2002, had a twofold purpose: to step up the pace at which Sweden becomes an ecologically sustainable society and to reduce unemployment. Under the LIP, almost € 43 million (SEK 400 million) were granted to various municipal projects aimed at <b>remediation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> In analyzing data on both subsidized and non-subsidized remediation projects, we unexpectedly find that the more hazardous a site, the less the probability of its receiving funding. Thus, contrary to the “worst things first” strategy officially adopted by the Swedish Parliament for <b>remediation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites,</b> our results reveal a risk-avoiding allocation of government subsidies. Furthermore, the number of employment opportunities generated by remediation projects positively affects the probability of receiving a LIP subsidy. Although more faithful observance of the official strategy would have been desirable, the most highly contaminated sites at least received the most money. Based on our findings, we believe that extensive information about the hazards posed by contaminated sites is necessary to ensure better decisions on remediation funding and more efficient use of public resources in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|In 1998 the Swedish {{government}} {{launched its}} largest ecological subsidization programme to date, the Local Investment Programme (LIP). By having two political objectives; {{to step up}} the pace at which Sweden transforms into an ecologically sustainable society and to reduce unemployment, the programme did not conform to the [modifier letter reversed comma][modifier letter reversed comma]one-instrument-per-objective" policy guideline often advocated by economists. Concentrating on {{a subset of the}} subsidized projects, the projects for <b>remediation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites,</b> we evaluate how effectively the LIP's separate political objectives were fulfilled. Between 1998 and 2002, [euro] 670 Â million (SEK 6. 2 Â billion) were allocated to over 1800 different projects under the LIP. Twenty-four, i. e. one percent, of the projects aimed at <b>remediation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> These projects received a disproportionate amount, six percent, of the total LIP subsidies. By using data on both accepted and rejected remediation projects, we find that the LIP's ecological sustainability objective could have been achieved better if the most hazardous sites had been prioritized to a greater extent. Furthermore, society's cost for the employment opportunities generated in the remediation projects was higher than society's cost for the equivalent number of employment opportunities generated in traditional labour market policies. Although other subsets of the LIP projects may have been more successful in achieving the programme's separate objectives, our results illustrate inefficiencies that may arise from a desire to attain several political objectives through a single policy instrument. ...|$|E
