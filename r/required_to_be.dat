5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detained until 9 am on the second day.
