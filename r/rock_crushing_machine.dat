40|$|Nordberg, {{a capital}} {{equipment}} manufacturer, performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study on its <b>rock</b> <b>crusher</b> {{to aid in}} making decisions on product design and energy improvements. LCA {{is a relatively new}} cutting edge environmental tool recently standardized by ISO that provides quantitative environmental and energy data on products or processes. This paper commences with a brief introduction to LCA and presents the system boundaries, modeling and assumptions for the <b>rock</b> <b>crusher</b> study. System boundaries include all major life cycle stages except manufacturing and assembly of the crusher. Results of the LCA show that over 99 % of most of the flows {{into and out of the}} system may be attributed to the use phase of the <b>rock</b> <b>crusher.</b> Within the use phase itself, over 95 % of each environmental inflow and outflow (with some exceptions) are attributed to electricity consumption, and not the replacement of spares/wears or lubricating oil over the lifetime of the crusher. Results tables and charts present selected environmental flows, including CO 2 NOx, SOx, particulate matter, and energy consumption, for each of the <b>rock</b> <b>crusher</b> life cycle stages and the use phase.

40|$|Abstract. Underbalance {{drilling}} {{has been}} applied to each oil field at home and abroad, due to the advantage of increasing the penetration rate substantially, protecting the reservoir effectively and reducing the drilling costs. But in respect of rock stress state characteristics near the bottom, relatively speaking, the study was rarely. Take the borehole near the bottom in underbalance drilling as the research object, analyze the influence of terrestrial stress, pore pressure and fluid column pressure on mechanics characteristic of rock in the bottom, to study the <b>rock</b> <b>crushing</b> efficiency, well deviation and hole stability of non-permeable wellbore and permeable wellbore in underbalanced drilling. The result shows that the mechanical properties of rocks near the bottom are subject to terrestrial stress, pore pressure and fluid column pressure. In non-permeable <b>rock,</b> the <b>rock</b> <b>crushing</b> efficiency, the penetration rate and the concentrated force of well trend to increase, the well trends to inclination. In permeable wellbore, with the permeability increasing, the <b>rock</b> <b>crushing</b> efficiency, the penetration rate and the concentrated force of well trend to decrease, the tendency of inclination becomes lower. ...|$|R
