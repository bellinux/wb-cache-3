5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length {{is much larger}} than their diameter. Consequently, as expected from the classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering)</b> by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering,</b> which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E
5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{sunlight}} is attenuated because of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably {{with the naked eye}} or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.|$|E

40|$|Cross-section <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> {{images have}} been {{obtained}} from a two-dimensional, compressible turbulent shear layer with isentropic convective Mach number M (i) c 1 ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 92. With both streams beeing subsonic, the same two-dimensional large-scale Brown-Roshko structures have been found as in the Schlieren pictures from earlier experiments conducted in the same facility. These structures disappear from the Schlieren pictures when the high speed stream becomes supersonic, but for low M sup (i) c 1 they are still visible in the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> images. At higher compressibility levels the interface between the stream becomes very irregular in the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> images. No strong shocks have been found inside the shear layer...|$|R
40|$|Rayleigh wave based NDE {{methods have}} been {{hampered}} {{by the lack of}} a theory to describe the scattering process. In previous meetings we have discussed numerical schemes which model the two dimensional problem of plane <b>Rayleigh</b> waves <b>scattering</b> from a plane defect [1], and recently we have presented preliminary details of a simple three-dimensional model [2] for plane <b>Rayleigh</b> wave <b>scattering</b> from surface features accommodated on a Cartesian grid of points.

5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E
5|$|The winds on Saturn are {{the second}} fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. Voyager data {{indicate}} peak easterly winds of 500m/s (1800km/h). In {{images from the}} Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering.</b> Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known {{example of such a}} phenomenon in the Solar System. Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185°C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as −122°C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area {{from the perspective of}} a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's stealth contouring and radar absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's claim of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf.|$|E

40|$|A hybrid fluorescence–Raman {{confocal}} microscopy {{platform is}} presented, which integrates low-wavenumber-resolution Raman imaging, <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> imaging and two-photon fluorescence (TPE) spectral imaging, fast ‘amplitude-only’ TPE-fluorescence imaging and high-spectral-resolution Raman imaging. This multi-dimensional fluorescence–Raman microscopy platform enables rapid imaging along the fluorescence emission and/or <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> dimensions. It is shown that optical contrast in these {{images can be}} used to select an area of interest prior to subsequent investigation with high spatially and spectrally resolved Raman imaging. This new microscopy platform combines the strengths of Raman ‘chemical’ imaging with light scattering microscopy and fluorescence microscopy and provides new modes of correlative light microscopy. Simultaneous acquisition of TPE hyperspectral fluorescence imaging and Raman imaging illustrates spatial relationships of fluorophores, water, lipid and protein in cells.

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for performing simultaneous multi-point measurements of multiple velocity components in a gas flow is described. Pulses of laser light are directed to a measurement region of unseeded gas to produce <b>Rayleigh</b> or Mie <b>scattered</b> {{light in a}} plurality of directions. The <b>Rayleigh</b> or Mie <b>scattered</b> light is collected from multiple directions and combined in a single collimated light beam. The <b>Rayleigh</b> or Mie <b>scattered</b> light is then mixed together with a reference laser light before it is passed through a single planar Fabry-Perot interferometer for spectral analysis. At {{the output of the}} interferometer, a high-sensitivity CCD camera images the interference fringe pattern. This pattern contains the spectral and spatial information from both the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattered</b> light and the reference laser light. Interferogram processing software extracts and analyzes spectral profiles to determine the velocity components of the gas flow at multiple points in the measurement region. The Rayleigh light rejected by the interferometer is recirculated to increase the accuracy and the applicability of the method for measurements at high temperatures without requiring an increase in the laser energy...|$|R
25|$|The slight color it {{does have}} is due to <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> of the shorter {{wavelengths}} of visible light by the nano-sized dendritic structure. This causes it to appear smoky blue against dark backgrounds and yellowish against bright backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|Glacial ice has a {{distinctive}} blue tint because it absorbs some red light {{due to an}} overtone of the infrared OH stretching mode of the water molecule. Liquid water is blue for the same reason. The blue of glacier ice is sometimes misattributed to <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> due to bubbles in the ice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> of {{molecular}} nitrogen and {{oxygen in the}} atmosphere includes elastic scattering {{as well as the}} inelastic contribution from rotational Raman scattering in air, since the changes in wavenumber of the scattered photon are typically smaller than 50cm−1. This can lead to changes in the rotational state of the molecules. Furthermore, the inelastic contribution has the same wavelengths dependency as the elastic part.|$|E
40|$|Methods have {{recently}} been developed that make use of electromagnetic radiation at terahertz (THz) frequencies, {{the region of the}} spectrum between millimetre wavelengths and the infrared, for imaging purposes. Radiation at these wavelengths is non-ionizing and subject to far less <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> than visible or infrared wavelengths, making it suitable for medical applications. This paper introduces THz pulsed imaging and discusses its potential for in vivo medical applications in comparison with existing modalitie...|$|R

25|$|Of the colours in {{the visible}} {{spectrum}} of light, blue {{has a very}} short wavelength, while red has the longest wavelength. When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. This effect is called <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering,</b> after Lord Rayleigh, the British physicist who discovered it. It was confirmed by Albert Einstein in 1911.|$|E
25|$|Iridophores, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} guanophores, are pigment cells that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine. When illuminated they generate iridescent colours {{because of the}} diffraction of light within the stacked plates. Orientation of the schemochrome determines {{the nature of the}} colour observed. By using biochromes as coloured filters, iridophores create an optical effect known as Tyndall or <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering,</b> producing bright-blue or -green colours.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{interact}} with matter in three main ways, through photoabsorption, Compton scattering, and <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering.</b> The strength of these interactions {{depends on the}} energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties, since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies. Photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism in the soft X-ray regime and for the lower hard X-ray energies. At higher energies, Compton scattering dominates.|$|E
40|$|A noise {{reduction}} scheme for long haul fiber amplitude modulation (AM) systems is proposed and analyzed. Such systems suffer from intensity noise which results from interference between the (twice) <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattered</b> {{light and the}} directly transmitted beam.

It is shown that a strong phase modulation of {{the output of the}} laser beam causes a large reduction of the detected signal noise {{in the vicinity of the}} detected signal component...|$|R

After establishing this basis, instructions are provided for operating the lidar, performing basic maintenance, and aligning various components...|$|R
25|$|As the Sun {{crosses the}} sky, {{it may appear}} to be red, orange, yellow or white, {{depending}} on its position. The changing color of the Sun {{over the course of the}} day is mainly a result of the scattering of light and is not due to changes in black-body radiation. The blue color of the sky is caused by <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> of the sunlight by the atmosphere, which tends to scatter blue light more than red light.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} pointing LIDAR detects multiple {{types of}} backscattering (for example <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> and Mie Scattering), with the delay between laser pulse generation {{and the return}} of light scattered by atmospheric particles determining the altitude at which scattering occurs. Additional information was obtained from backscattered light at different wavelengths (colors), and the Phoenix system transmitted both 532nm and 1064nm. Such wavelength dependence may make it possible to discriminate between ice and dust, and serve as an indicator of the effective particle size.|$|E
25|$|Scattering and {{absorption}} {{are major}} {{causes of the}} attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere. Scattering varies {{as a function of}} the ratio of the particle diameter of the wavelength of the radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> occurs. In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios, scattering varies in a complex fashion, described for spherical particles by the Mie theory; the laws of geometric optics begin to apply at a ratio of the order of 10.|$|E
