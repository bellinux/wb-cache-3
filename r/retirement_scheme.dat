5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman {{into a public}} limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of the}} restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary <b>retirement</b> <b>scheme</b> (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel {{would not be allowed to}} leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E

He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 24 May 1873 and promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 11 December 1875. The Admiralty suggested he retire when he reached his late nineties, as being on the active list meant he was liable for calling up for a seagoing command. Wallis instead replied he was ready to accept one.|$|E

500|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1739 due to London politics and a currency crisis in Massachusetts. [...] Belcher {{had been ordered}} to effect the retirement of {{a large amount of}} Massachusetts paper currency by 1741, and the legislation to accomplish this was rejected by the Board of Trade, leading to the introduction of competing banking proposals in the province. [...] One faction dominated by landowners proposed a land bank, while merchants proposed a bank that would issue silver-backed paper. [...] The proposals polarized the Massachusetts political establishment, and Belcher was unable to take sides for fear of alienating supporters on either side. [...] He instead sought without success to browbeat the assembly into passing a currency <b>retirement</b> <b>scheme</b> acceptable to London. [...] In 1740 elections land bank supporters swept into office, and the bank began issuing notes. [...] Merchant interests opposed to the land bank began widespread lobbying in London for Parliamentary relief (which came in 1741, when it passed legislation extending the 1720 Bubble Act, which disallowed unchartered companies, to the colonies) likely abetted by John Thomlinson.|$|E
2500|$|Kohl's chancellorship {{presided over}} a number of {{innovative}} policy measures. Extensions in unemployment benefit for older claimants were introduced, while the benefit for the young unemployed was extended to age 21. In 1986, a child-rearing allowance was introduced to benefit parents when at least one was employed. Informal carers were offered an attendance allowance together with tax incentives, both of which were established with the tax reforms of 1990, and were also guaranteed up to 25 hours a month of professional support, which was supplemented by four weeks of annual holiday relief. In 1984, an early <b>retirement</b> <b>scheme</b> was introduced that offered incentives to employers to replace elderly workers with applicants off the unemployment register. In 1989 a partial retirement plan was introduced under which elderly employees could work half-time and receive 70% of their former salary [...] "and be credited with 90 per cent of the full social insurance entitlement." [...] In 1984, a Mother and Child Fund was established, providing discretionary grants [...] "to forestall abortions on grounds of material hardship," [...] and in 1986 a 10 Bn DM package of Erziehungsgeld (childcare allowance) was introduced, although according to various studies, this latter initiative was heavily counterbalanced by cuts. In 1989, special provisions were introduced for the older unemployed.|$|E

40|$|This article empirically {{analyses}} {{the impact}} that tax induced retirement benefits (pension payouts) have on contractual saving and consumption behaviour in South Africa. By using a basic extended Ando-Modigliani life cycle model it is shown that pension payouts accumulated through deductible contributions to <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> contribute towards increased levels of consumption expenditure with the crowding out of discretionary household saving. The results also suggest that the taxing of retirement benefits under the current tax structure may discourage individuals to save through <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> and instead encourages increased levels of current consumption expenditure. The econometric technique used is the Engle-Granger (1987) method of estimation. Estimates {{of the impact of}} retirement benefits on consumption expenditure are robust also when regressed on per capita government deficit ratios and unemployment. Thus, the tax treatment of <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> in South Africa may have adverse effects on saving largely influenced by the discounted value of retirement benefits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Human capital theory {{predicts that}} older workers {{are less likely}} to {{participate}} in on-the-job training than younger workers, due to lower net returns on such investments. Early retirement institutions are likely to affect these returns. Using the European Community Household Panel we show that older workers participate less in training, and that early retirement institutions do indeed matter. Generous early <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> discourage older workers from taking part in training, whereas flexible early <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> encourage this. Finally, the results suggest that in most European countries training can keep older workers longer in the labour market. 1...|$|R

The specific objectives were: to establish the effect of determinants on the financial performance of <b>retirement</b> benefit <b>schemes</b> in Kenya and to investigate the perception of stakeholders regarding determinants on the financial performance of <b>retirement</b> benefit <b>schemes</b> in Kenya. This study used quantitative design to determine the financial performance relationship with determinants of performance. The population for this study were the 1262 <b>retirement</b> benefit <b>schemes</b> registered with the Retirement Benefit Authority, RBA by close of 2013. Simple random sampling was used and Fishers formula was used to come up with sample size of 48 private pension funds. The study used primary and secondary data. The secondary data is quantitative in nature and was collected from the annual financial statements of the pension funds. Primary data was both qualitative and quantitative in nature and was collected using questionnaires. The study findings revealed that age of contributors, leverage of fund, contributions received, fixed income investment, equity investment, offshore investment, fund liquidity does not have an influence on the financial performance of <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes.</b> The study recommended that future studies focus on corporate governance practices as determinants of the financial performance of <b>retirement</b> benefit <b>schemes</b> in Kenya...|$|R

30|$|The {{introduction}} of the bridging pensions did not extend the scale of early <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes.</b> Rather the opposite. This {{was a way to}} protect the withdrawal of the schemes. The way bridging pensions were defined (labour medical) and their clear cost meant that the number of potential cases was roughly 1 / 10 th of the previously possible early <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> 36. Moreover, early retirement was conditional on additional contributions paid earlier by employers. The entire scheme was temporal covering only those workers who had started working in special conditions or in a special capacity before 1999. The law on bridging pensions is commonly referred to as the most important achievement of the government during the term 2007 - 2011.|$|R

However, the legislation did not include regulations on how the bridging pensions would be organised and financed.

40|$|The main {{research}} questions {{dealt with in}} this paper are: Is the likelihood of early retirement according to the various routes different for different groups within the working population? To what extent do the existence of more flexible and more generous early <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> result in higher entry rates into early retirement for the working population? To what extent does the generosity differ between the various exit routes and between the countries or regime types? This will be analysed using three unique long-running panel studies, i. e. BHPS 1990 - 2004 (the United Kingdom), the GSOEP 1990 - 2005 (Germany) and the SEP 1990 - 2001 (Netherlands). Using a discrete-time competing-risks model the exit patterns of older workers are examined in these three very different countries {{in terms of their}} pension and social security systems. The results show that hazards into retirement and social security are significantly highest in Germany and the Netherlands reflecting the institutional support for these exit pathways. In the United Kingdom early exit is most common through the retirement route but restricted to specific ages. Furthermore, the observed differences in retirement hazards are related to the generosity of the routes.
