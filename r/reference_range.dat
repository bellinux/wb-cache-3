5|$|The current <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> for {{acceptable}} {{blood lead}} concentrations in healthy persons without excessive exposure to environmental {{sources of lead}} is less than 5µg/dL for children. It was less than 25µg/dL for adults. Previous to 2012 the value for children was 10 (µg/dl). The current biological exposure index (a level {{that should not be}} exceeded) for lead-exposed workers in the U.S. is 30µg/dL in a random blood specimen.|$|E
5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
50|$|Blood {{test results}} {{should always be}} {{interpreted}} using the <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> provided by the laboratory that performed the results. Example <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> are listed below.|$|R
50|$|<b>References</b> <b>range</b> {{may vary}} with age, sex, race, pregnancy, diet, use of {{prescribed}} or herbal drugs and stress. <b>Reference</b> <b>ranges</b> often {{depend on the}} analytical method used, for reasons such as inaccuracy, lack of standardisation, lack of certified reference material and differing antibody reactivity. Also, <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> may be inaccurate when the reference groups used to establish the ranges are small.|$|R
40|$|Current {{recommended}} <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for echocardiographic measurements may not {{be relevant}} to the diverse world population they are applied to. A new study, the echocardiographic normal <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> of the left heart (EchoNoRMAL) study, is an individual person data meta-analysis of standard echocardiographic measurements which aims to re-define normal <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> of left heart dimensions, areas, volumes, mitral inflow and tissue Doppler, and associated calculated variable...|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} method {{of establishing a}} <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> with the assumption of log-normal distribution {{is to use the}} arithmetic mean and arithmetic value of standard deviation. This is somewhat more tedious to perform, but may be useful for example in cases where a study that establishes a <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> presents only the arithmetic mean and standard deviation, leaving out the source data. If the original assumption of arithmetically normal distribution is shown to be less appropriate than the log-normal one, then, using the arithmetic mean and standard deviation may be the only available parameters to correct the <b>reference</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prediction {{intervals}} {{are commonly}} used as definitions of reference ranges, such as reference ranges for blood tests to give an idea of whether a blood test is normal or not. For this purpose, {{the most commonly used}} prediction interval is the 95% prediction interval, and a <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> based on it can be called a standard <b>reference</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{may be more}} {{appropriate}} to use for e.g. folate, since approximately 90 percent of North Americans may actually suffer more or less from folate deficiency, but only the 2.5 percent that have the lowest levels will fall below the standard <b>reference</b> <b>range.</b> In this case, the actual folate ranges for optimal health are substantially higher than the standard reference ranges. Vitamin D has a similar tendency. In contrast, for e.g. uric acid, having a level not exceeding the standard <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> still does not exclude the risk of getting gout or kidney stones. Furthermore, for most toxins, the standard <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> is generally lower than the level of toxic effect.|$|E
40|$|<b>Reference</b> <b>ranges</b> are a set {{of values}} that {{correctly}} include most of the subjects with characteristics similar to the reference group and exclude the others. When accurate, <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> aid physicians to interpret results of clinical measurements and thus establish diagnosis. However, obtaining accurate <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> is a very demanding procedure. This chapter provides basic definitions and theories {{as well as a}} step-by-step procedure for the analysis of reference values and determination of <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> of coagulation, focusing on quantitative clinical laboratory assays. Preanalytical and analytical factors as well as dependence on the age influencing reference values for coagulation assays and their transference are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Baseline <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> of serum {{chemistry}} and hematology {{data can be}} important indicators for the status of both individuals or populations of wild animals that are affected by emerging pathogens, toxicants, or other causes of disease. Frequently, <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for these values are not available for wildlife species or subspecies. We present hematologic and serum chemistry <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for moose (Alces alces) adults, yearlings, and calves in Norway sampled from 1992 – 2000. Additionally, we demonstrated that both induction time and chase time were correlated with initial rectal temperature, although they were not significantly correlated with cortisol, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, or creatine kinase. Overall, the <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> given here {{are similar to those}} given for American moose, with a few differences that can be attributed to environment, testing methodology, or subspecies or species status. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for moose in Norway...|$|R
25|$|However, <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> {{may also}} be {{established}} by taking samples from the whole population, with or without diseases and conditions. In some cases, diseased individuals are taken as the population, establishing <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> among those having a disease or condition. Preferably, there should be specific <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for each subgroup {{of the population that}} has any factor that affects the measurement, such as, for example, specific ranges for each sex, age group, race or any other general determinant.|$|R
25|$|Thus, the {{standard}} <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> for this example {{is estimated to}} be 4.4 to 6.3mmol/L.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{definition of}} a <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> (usually referred to if not otherwise specified) originates in what is most prevalent in a reference group taken from the general (i.e. total) population. This is the general <b>reference</b> <b>range.</b> However, there are also optimal health ranges (ranges that appear to have the optimal health impact) and ranges for particular conditions or statuses (such as pregnancy reference ranges for hormone levels).|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the lower}} {{limit of the}} <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> can be written as 4.4 (90% CI 4.1-4.7) mmol/L.|$|E
40|$|Published avian <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for plasma cholinesterase (ChE) {{and brain}} {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE) are numerous. However, a consistently reported recommendation {{is the need}} for species- and laboratory-specific <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> because of variables, including assay methods, sample storage conditions, season, and bird sex, age, and physiologic status. We developed normal <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for brain AChE and plasma total ChE (tChE) activity for Carnaby's Black-Cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) using a standardized protocol (substrate acetylthiocholine at 25 C).

This information will be of use in the ongoing field investigation of a paresis-paralysis syndrome in the endangered Carnaby's Black-Cockatoos, suspected to be associated with exposure to anticholinesterase compounds and add to the paucity of <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for plasma tChE and brain AChE in Australian psittacine birds...|$|R

25|$|Let's say, for example, that an {{individual}} takes a test that measures the ionized calcium in the blood, resulting in a value of 1.30mmol/L, and a reference group that appropriately represents the individual has established a <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> of 1.05 to 1.25mmol/L.

40|$|Introduction: Recently, {{multi-ethnic}} <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for spirometry {{have been}} created for use worldwide. In comparison, forced oscillation technique (FOT) reference values are limited to specific equipment and study populations, with current FOT <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> created in a Caucasian population. We aimed to develop FOT <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for preschool-aged Mexican children and to compare these with current FOT <b>reference</b> <b>ranges.</b> Patients and methods: Respiratory resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) was measured in healthy Mexican children {{three to five years}} of age using commercial FOT equipment. The relationship between height and Rrs and Xrs was determined using regression analyses, taking into account age, weight, sex, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Reference equations were calculated for the Mexican children and Z-scores determined for Rrs and Xrs at 6 and 8. Hz. A paired t-test assessed the difference in Z-scores between the Australian reference values and those created for the Mexican cohort. Results: FOT was successfully measured in 584. children. Height {{was a significant predictor of}} Rrs and Xrs at 6 and 8. Hz (P<. 05). Z-scores calculated using the Australian reference equations overestimated lung function in Mexican children for both Rrs and Xrs at 6 and 8. Hz (P<. 001). Conclusion: The development of FOT <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> specific to Mexican preschool-aged children will allow for the correct interpretation of FOT measurements. This study also showed that current FOT <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> overestimate lung function in Mexican children.

40|$|Tissue {{testing is}} a common {{practice}} in turfgrass management and is intended to guide nutrient applications. However, standard interpretations are a product of agricultural cropping systems and use yield as the primary metric. Yield is often of little importance in turfgrass systems and, thus, traditional test interpretations may be of little value. <b>Reference</b> <b>ranges</b> interpret test results by first defining a ‘normal’ population followed by analysis and determination of the 95 % confidence interval for each nutrient. Moreover, <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> can be determined for cultivar, season, and age-specific populations, which {{would result in a}} more precise interpretation and nutrient recommendation for turf managers. Because <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> use the accepted turf quality metric, <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> should be considered as an alternate option to traditional turfgrass tissue test interpretations...|$|R
25|$|Hypercalcemia (usually {{defined as}} a calcium level above the <b>reference</b> <b>range)</b> is mostly caused by either primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} or malignancy, and therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} include these in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> for {{prothrombin}} time {{depends on the}} analytical method used, but is usually around 12–13 seconds (results should always be interpreted using the <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> from the laboratory that performed the test), and the INR in absence of anticoagulation therapy is 0.8-1.2. The target range for INR in anticoagulant use (e.g. warfarin) is 2 to 3. In some cases, if more intense anticoagulation {{is thought to be}} required, the target range may be as high as 2.5-3.5 depending on the indication for anticoagulation. In The Netherlands, the target INR for 'low intensity' is between 2.0 and 3.0 and for 'high intensity' between 2.5 and 3.5.|$|E
25|$|Measured {{cortisol}} levels, {{and therefore}} reference ranges, {{depend on the}} analytical method used and factors such as age and sex. Test results should, therefore, always be interpreted using the <b>reference</b> <b>range</b> from the laboratory that produced the result.|$|E
40|$|Summary: <b>Reference</b> <b>ranges</b> for-amylase in serum, spontaneously voided urine, and 24 h urine were determined, using 4, 6 -ethylidene-(G 7) -l- 4 -nitrophenyl-(Gl) -a,£) -malthoheptaoside äs the Substrate (EPS method), at 25, 30, and 37 °C. The {{measured}} values were evaluated {{with and without}} the use of a factor which converts the results of the-amylase EPS method into values comparable to those obtained with the-amylase PNP method (substrate: 4 -nitrophenyl-a,£>-matoheptaoside); comparison with the established <b>reference</b> <b>ranges</b> of the PNP method was therefore possible. Ttie values for urine sometimes deviated markedly ffom the PNP <b>reference</b> <b>ranges,</b> but the values for serum showed close agreement.
