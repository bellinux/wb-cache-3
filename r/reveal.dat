5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to <b>reveal</b> whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, <b>reveal</b> whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and <b>reveal</b> and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E

30|$|In two studies, the <b>revealing</b> {{nature of}} Halloween costumes was investigated. In Study 1 124 pairs of men’s and women’s Halloween costumes were content analyzed. Analysis showed that women’s costumes were {{significantly}} more <b>revealing</b> than men’s in terms of tightness {{and the extent to}} which they uncovered the body. Researchers interested in studying SO in media presentations have often relied on <b>revealing</b> dress in those depictions as evidence for SO. Since women’s Halloween costumes were found to be more <b>revealing</b> than men’s in Study 1 and that SO in the media is assessed by the presence of <b>revealing</b> dress in media depictions, we reasoned that women’s <b>revealing</b> Halloween costumes could be sexually objectifying. In Study 2, we conducted an online experiment; participants from AMT viewed and rated three images of women wearing <b>revealing</b> or non-revealing Halloween costumes. Participants rated women wearing the <b>revealing</b> costumes higher on sexually objectifying traits (perceived women in terms of their sexual appeal) and lower on a set of positive traits than women wearing the non-revealing costumes. Thus, the women in the <b>revealing</b> costumes were sexually objectified (i.e., they were judged primarily for their sexual appeal). Although men rated women higher on the sexually objectifying traits, both men and women were affected by the <b>revealing</b> dress condition.|$|R
