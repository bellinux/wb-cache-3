The following quantities were measured {{in each of the}} three lattices studied: the ratio of the average epicadmium U 2 3 8 capture rate in the fuel rod to the average subcadmium U 2 3 8 capture rate in the fuel rod ([sigma] 28); the ratio of the average epicadmium U 2 3 o fission rate in the fuel rod 7 to the average subcadmium U 35 fission rate in the fuel rod (625); the ratio of the average U 2 3 8 capture rate in the fuel rod to the average U 2 3 5 fission rate in the fuel rod (C); the ratio of the average U 2 3 8 fission rate in the fuel rod to the average U 2 3 5 fission rate in the fuel rod (628); and the effective resonance integral of U 2 3 8 in a fuel rod (ER 12 8). The results of an investigation of systematic errors associated with these measurements have-led to many changes and adjustments in the experimental techniques and procedure which have improved the general precision of the experimental results. A new method was developed to measure the ratio C * which simplified the experiment, significantly reduced the experimental uncertainty associated with the measurement, and avoided systematic errors inherent in the method used to measure C* in earlier work. The value of ER 12 8 was also measured by a new method in which the results of measurements made in an epithermal flux which had a 1 /E energy dependence are combined with the results of measurements made in a lattice.

40|$|The {{formulation}} of an adequate description of neutron {{populations in the}} presence of boiling moderator or coolant is attempted. Starting from a framework of comprehensive stochastic descriptions we concentrate on the special requirements of the boiling system {{such as the use of}} transport theory and the retention of heterogeneity in our model. Working equations are derived which show how adequate corrections for boiling can be made to the approximate models currently used. The detailed distribution of bubbles in a boiling system should be accounted for in accurate evaluations of criticality, especially where the bubbles are large. Evaluations of leakage, <b>resonance</b> <b>escape</b> <b>probability</b> and thermal absorption are modified by the detailed bubble distribution. Explicit corrections are given for simple examples, while inclusion of the effects into a practical criticality code, such as WIMS, is discussed. The second moments of the neutron population {{in the presence of}} boiling media are also described. The power spectral density arising from the fission process is evaluated, showing how this spectrum is affected by the boiling. Usually more important sources of neutron noise in a boiling reactor are the fluctuations in cross-sections and collision probabilities arising directly from random local void ages. This 'bubble noise' is evaluated with particular emphasis on the detection of onset of boiling in a channel or change in boiling regime. The use of Monte Carlo techniques in calculating neutron transport in boiling media is discussed in some detail. The applicability of the analyses of neutron means and variances to fast reactor situations is considered. The bulk of the work treats critical reactors. However, a treatment of transients and feedback effects is also included. A new analysis is suggested whereby means and variances throughout the transient can be evaluated without extreme difficulty.

40|$|The nuclear {{parameters}} of a reactor lattice may {{be determined by}} critical experiments on that lattice, by theoretical calculations in which only cross sections are used as input, or by methods which combine theory and experiment. Of those methods which combine theory and experiment, the Single Element Method, abbreviated SEM, is shown to have great usefulness. As used here, the method combines experiments on the smallest meaningful unit of fuel - a single fuel element - with a theory which relates {{the behavior of a}} lattice of such elements to the experimentally determined behavior of the single element. This particular division of the problem into theory and experiment is useful for at least three reasons. First, several parameters which characterize a reactor lattice - the thermal utilization and <b>resonance</b> <b>escape</b> <b>probability,</b> for example - often depend strongly and in a complicated manner on the properties of individual fuel elements, but only depend weakly or in a simple manner on interactions between the fuel elements. In the Single Element Method, the largest contribution to these parameters is determined by measurements on a single fuel element, and only a relatively small correction to account for the presence {{of the rest of the}} fuel elements need be estimated theoretically. Second, the determination of lattice parameters in this way represents a desirable saving of time, money, effort, and material over their determination in critical or exponential experiments. Third, it is shown that the method provides an excellent way of correlating the results of experimental measurements, since it shows what pertinent variables must be used to express the quantity of interest in a linear or nearly linear fashion. Values obtained by the SEM for the thermal utilization of lattices of uranium rods in heavy water are accurate to about 0. 3 percent (by comparison with THERMOS). Values of P 28, 28, and C* are obtained by the SEM for the same lattices to an accuracy of between five and ten percent (by comparison with experiment). The same method yields values of 28 with are equally accurate in lattices moderated by light water. In addition, the theoretical development of the SEM predicts that P 28, 28, C*, and 625 should vary nearly linearly with the inverse of the unit cell volume (for a fixed size of fuel element). This explains the experimentally observed behavior and provides an important tool for the rational correlation of experimental results. Statement of responsibility on title page reads: Edward E.

In this paper we propose a physically based approach for separation of dominant forest type using hyperspectral data. The radiative transfer theory of canopy spectral invariants underlies the approach, which facilitates parameterization of the canopy reflectance in terms of the leaf spectral scattering and two spectrally invariant and structurally varying variables—recollision and directional <b>escape</b> <b>probabilities.</b> The methodology is based on the idea of retrieving spectrally invariant parameters from hyperspectral data first, and then relating their values to structural characteristics of three-dimensional canopy structure.

However, a full treatment with these two reaction coordinates is a challenging task and has been left mostly unsolved. In this work, we address this problem by developing a dynamic theory by combining the ideas from ET reaction literature and barrierless chemical reactions. Two-dimensional coupled Smoluchowski equations are employed to compute the time evolution of joint probability distribution for the reactant (P-(1) (X,R,t)) and the product (p((2)) (X,R,t)), where X, as is usual in ET reactions, describes the solvent polarization coordinate and R is {{the distance between the}} reacting ion pair. The reaction is described by a reaction line (sink) which is a function of X and R obtained by imposing a condition of equal energy on the initial and final states of a reacting ion pair. The resulting two-dimensional coupled equations of motion have been solved numerically using an alternate direction implicit (ADI) scheme (Peaceman and Rachford, J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1955, 3, 28). The results reveal interesting interplay between polarization relaxation and translational dynamics. The following new results have been obtained. (i) For solvents with slow longitudinal polarization relaxation, the <b>escape</b> <b>probability</b> decreases drastically as the polarization relaxation time increases. We attribute this to caging by polarization of the surrounding solvent, As expected, for the solvents having fast polarization relaxation, the <b>escape</b> <b>probability</b> is independent of the polarization relaxation time. (ii) In the slow relaxation limit, there is a significant dependence of <b>escape</b> <b>probability</b> and average rate on the initial solvent polarization, again displaying the effects of polarization caging. <b>Escape</b> <b>probability</b> increases, and the average rate decreases on increasing the initial polarization. Again, in the fast polarization relaxation limit, there is no effect of initial polarization on the <b>escape</b> <b>probability</b> and the average rate of IR. (iii) For normal and barrierless regions the dependence of <b>escape</b> <b>probability</b> and the rate of IR on initial polarization is stronger than in the inverted region. (iv) Because of the involvement of dynamics along R coordinate, the asymmetrical parabolic (that is, non-Marcus) energy gap dependence of the rate is observed...|$|R
