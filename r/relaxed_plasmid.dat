40|$|It {{is shown}} that anti-Z-DNA {{antibody}} binding can stabilize sequences of d(CG/GC) n and d(CA/GT) n in the Z-DNA conformation in a plasmid in the {{complete absence of}} supercoiling. This effect is quantitated by using antibody preparations of different affinities and varying concentrations. The d(CG/GC) n sequence can be stabilized under physiological conditions. This is the first demonstration that a region of Z-DNA can be stabilized by protein binding in a completely <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> under physiological conditions. The antibody-Z-DNA complex in the <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> is shown to be an equilibrium state and not a long-lived kinetic intermediate since specific binding of the antibody to linearized plasmids containing Z-forming sequences is observed...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a cell-free chromatin assembly system {{derived from the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which efficiently packages DNA into minichromosomes in a reaction dependent on exogenous core histones and an ATP-regenerating system. Both supercoiled and <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA serve as templates for nucleosomal loading in a gradual process that takes at least 6 h for completion at 30 °C. Micrococcal nuclease digestion of the assembled minichromosomes displays an extended nucleosomal ladder with a repeat length of 165 bp. The purified minichromosomes contain the four core histones in stoichiometric proportion and exhibit phased nucleosomes over the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. The progesterone receptor and NF 1 synergize on these minichromosomes resulting in efficient cell-free transcription. The ease of manipulation and the potential use of yeast strains carrying mutations in the chromatin handling machinery make this system suitable for detailed mechanistic studies...|$|E
40|$|Several plasmid DNAs {{have been}} {{isolated}} from mesophilic and thermophilic archaebacteria. Their superhelical densities were estimated at their host strain's optimal growth temperature, {{and in some}} representative strains, the presence of reverse gyrase activity (positive DNA supercoiling) was investigated. We show here that these plasmids can be grouped in two clusters {{with respect to their}} topological state. The group I plasmids have a highly negatively supercoiled DNA and belong to the mesophilic archaebacteria and all types of eubacteria. The group II plasmids have DNA which is close to the relaxed state and belong exclusively to the thermophilic archaebacteria. All archaebacteria containing a <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid,</b> {{with the exception of the}} moderately thermophilic methanogen Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Marburg, also exhibit reverse gyrase activity. These findings show that extrachromosomal DNAs with very different topological states coexist in the archaebacterial domain...|$|E

Preexisting gyrase molecules in these cells were responsible for this recovery. Stationary-phase rpoS cells showed a bimodal distribution of plasmids and failed to supercoil plasmids after the addition of nutrients, suggesting that rpoS plays a role in the regulation of plasmid topology during the stationary phase...|$|R
40|$|Novobiocin-Sepharose was {{prepared}} by coupling of novobiocin to Epoxy-activated Sepharose 6 B {{and used as}} an affinity adsorbent. Four novobiocin-binding proteins were isolated from crude extracts of Escherichia coli with molecular weights of 105, 92, 85 and 40 kdal. The two larger proteins were identified as the A subunit (gyrA protein) and the B subunit (gyrB protein) of DNA gyrase topoisomerase II). By this method the two gyrase components can be easily separated and purified in high yield. Although both proteins {{are involved in the}} ATP-dependent supercoiling of <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA, only the gyrB protein is required for catalyzing the cleavage of ATP.

40|$|The plasmid pGT 5 {{from the}} hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi {{replicates}} via the rolling circle mechanism. pGT 5 encodes the replication initiator protein Rep 75 that exhibits a nicking–closing (NC) activity in vitro on single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the pGT 5 double-stranded origin (dso) sequence. Some mesophilic Rep proteins present site-specific DNA topoisomerase-like activity on a negatively supercoiled plasmid harbouring the dso. We report here that Rep 75 also exhibits topoisomerase activity on a negatively supercoiled DNA substrate. This DNA topoisomerase-like activity {{is dependent on}} the amino acids involved in NC activity of Rep 75. However, in contrast with mesophilic Rep proteins, Rep 75 topoisomerase activity is not dso dependent. Moreover, although pGT 5 is known to be relaxed in vivo, Rep 75 was not able to act on a <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> in vitro, whether or not it contained the dso...|$|E
40|$|Atomic force microscopy, {{which is}} {{normally}} used for DNA imaging to gain qualitative results, {{can also be}} used for quantitative DNA research, at a single-molecular level. Here, we evaluate the performance of AFM imaging specifically for quantifying supercoiled and <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA fractions within a mixture, and compare the results with the bulk material analysis method, gel electrophoresis. The advantages and shortcomings of both methods are discussed in detail. Gel electrophoresis is a quick and well-established quantification method. However, it requires a large amount of DNA, and needs to be carefully calibrated for even slightly different experimental conditions for accurate quantification. AFM imaging is accurate, in that single DNA molecules in different conformations can be seen and counted. When used carefully with necessary correction, both methods provide consistent results. Thus, AFM imaging can be used for DNA quantification, as an alternative to gel electrophoresis...|$|E
40|$|Supercoiled pColIR 215 {{contains}} {{a site of}} pronounced hyper-reactivity towards modification by osmium tetroxide, a reagent known to be single-strand-selective. The site of hypersensitivity has been mapped to the ColE 1 inverted repeat, believed to extrude a cruciform in supercoiled DNA. Linear or <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmids</b> are not modified by the reagent. We conclude that cruciform formation {{is responsible for the}} site-selective modification. Fine mapping of the modification site as a function of time has revealed that the initial reaction occurs at the centre of the inverted repeat, i. e., the unpaired loop of the cruciform, but that the modification region rapidly expands outwards from this point...|$|R
40|$|The {{supercoiling}} {{levels of}} plasmid DNA were determined from Escherichia coli which was grown {{in ways that}} are known to alter global patterns of gene expression and metabolism. Changes in DNA supercoiling were shown to occur during several types of these nutrient upshifts and downshifts. The most dramatic change in supercoiling was seen in starved cells, in which two populations of differentially <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmids</b> were shown to coexist. Thus, some changes in the external nutritional environment that cause the cells to reorganize their global metabolism also cause accompanying changes in DNA supercoiling. Results of experiments with dinitrophenol suggested that the observed relaxations were probably not due to reduced pools of ATP. When rifampin was used to release supercoils restrained by RNA polymerase, the cellular topoisomerases responded by removing these new, unrestrained supercoils. We interpret these results as implying that the cellular topological machinery maintains a constant superhelical energy in the DNA except during certain growth transitions, when changes in metabolism and gene expression are accompanied by changes in DNA supercoiling...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, on {{the basis}} of the {{asymmetrical}} charge distribution of E. coli topoisomerase I, I developed a new rapid procedure to purify E. coli DNA topoismoerase I in the milligram range. The new procedure includes using both cation- and anion-exchange columns, i. e., SP-sepharose FF and Q-sepharose FF columns. E. coli topoisomerase I purified here is free of nuclease contamination. The kinetic constants of the DNA relaxation reaction of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I were determined as well. I also used isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the energetics of DNA supercoiling by using the unwinding properties of DNA intercalators, ethidium and daunomycin. After comparing the enthalpy changes of these DNA intercalators binding to supercoiled and nicked or <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA pXXZ 06, I determined the DNA supercoiling enthalpy is about 12 kcal/mol per turn of DNA supercoil, which is in good agreement with the previously published results...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of polyamine conjugates with DNA double helix has been studied. Binding properties were examined by ethidium bromide (EtBr) displacement and DNA unwinding/topoisomerase I/II (Topo I/II) activity assays, {{as well as}} dsDNA thermal stability studies and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Genotoxicity of the compounds was estimated by a comet assay. It {{has been shown that}} only compound 2 a can interact with dsDNA via an intercalative binding mode as it displaced EtBr from the dsDNA-dye complex, with Kapp = 4. 26 × 106 M− 1; caused an increase in melting temperature; changed the circular dichroism spectrum of dsDNA; converted <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA into a supercoiled molecule in the presence of Topo I and reduced the amount of short oligonucleotide fragments in the comet tail. Furthermore, preliminary theoretical study has shown that {{interaction of}} the discussed compounds with dsDNA depends on molecule linker length and charge distribution over terminal aromatic chromophores...|$|E
40|$|A <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA {{is shown}} to become {{positively}} supercoiled in cell extracts from top 1 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This positive supercoiling activity {{is dependent on the}} presence of bacterial DNA topoisomerase I and ATP (or dATP), and the positive supercoils generated in this reaction are not constrained by protein(s). Non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs cannot substitute for ATP in this supercoiling reaction, and the supercoiling activity is not due to RNA synthesis. The presence of an ARS sequence in the DNA does not alter the activity. Furthermore, this activity is equally active against UV irradiated or intact DNA. Extracts prepared from rad 50 and rad 52 mutant cells exhibited the same activity. Partial purification of this activity suggests that a protein factor with a native molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa is primarily responsible for the activity. The possibility that this supercoiling activity may be due to tracking of a protein along the intact duplex DNA is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The R-factor R 1 {{is present}} in a low number of copies per genome (near unity, {{so-called}} stringent control of replication). The replication of R 1 was studied in a density-shift experiment. One generation after the shift about 20 % of the R 1 copies had not replicated, whereas about 20 % had replicated at least twice. The results are in quantitative accordance with a random replication of R 1 in which the replicating molecules are taken from a cytoplasmic plasmid pool and transferred back to the pool after replication. This {{is analogous to the}} results obtained by Bazaral and Helinski (1970) and Rownd (1969) for plasmids that are present in 10 to 20 copies per genome (so-called relaxed control of replication). Hence, there seem to be no difference between stringent and <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmids</b> with respect to selection of plasmid molecules for replication. However, we cannot tell whether all R 1 copies in a cell replicate during a fraction of or throughout the cell cycle. The random selction of plasmid copies for replication has to be considered when models for control of replication are constructed...|$|R

The {{results show that}} interaction of TVP with circular DNA leads {{to the formation of}} perfect torus-shaped particles. The torus parameter measurements offer the possibility to conclude that DNA condensation observed is of intermolecular nature. On the basis of the analysis of the structures corresponding to the early stages of DNA compaction the model for intermolecular condensation of circular DNA into torus-shaped particles is proposed...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{supercoiling}} is {{a fundamental}} biological process occurring in all cells. We developed a theory of braiding (supercoiling) {{of a pair of}} DNA molecules that takes into account the contribution of the bending and the electrostatic energy. The electrostatic interaction was calculated {{within the framework of the}} Kornyshev-Leikin theory of DNA interactions, which takes into account realistic helical patterns of charge. Because of the chirality of the charge patterns, we predict that left-handed braiding of a pair of DNA molecules is more favourable than right-handed braiding. Applying our model to the case of closed loop DNA supercoiling and to single molecule DNA micromanipulations, we predict novel effects that have not yet been experimentally observed. We show that supercoiling may occur in topologically <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmids,</b> as a consequence of attractive chiral forces. We speculate about the potential biological role of the predicted effects in the case of topoisomerase action, and the occurrence of positively supercoiled DNA in hyperthermophilic bacteria and archea. Our findings also suggest alternative an explanation of well-known experiments that proved that divalent ions overwind DNA. We also give an explanation for pairing of homologous DNA molecules in monovalent salt, and explain the occurrence of tight supercoiling observed in cryo-electron and atomic force microscopy. The analysis of existing experimental data shows that in most cases the chiral effects that we predict remain elusive. The theory therefore awaits final experimental verification.

40|$|The DNA within spores of Bacillus subtilis is {{complexed}} with a {{large amount}} of alpha/beta-type small, acid-soluble spore protein (SASP). Measurement of the interaction of a purified alpha/beta-type SASP with DNA in vitro by a filter binding assay showed that the binding saturated at one molecule of SASP per approximately 5 bp. SASP-DNA binding did not require a divalent cation, was optimal at pH 6. 7, and was unaffected by salt up to 400 mM. Binding of SASP to <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I resulted in the introduction of 18 (for plasmid pUC 19) or 36 (for plasmid pUB 110) negative supertwists, a superhelical density similar to that found in several plasmids isolated from spores. The SASP-dependent introduction of negative supertwists did not require a divalent cation, was unaffected by salt, and also gave a value of one molecule of SASP per approximately 5 bp at saturation. There was at least one slow step in the binding of SASP to DNA as seen in both the filter binding and supercoiling assays...|$|E
40|$|Incubation of topologically <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA with {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) large tumor antigen (T antigen), ATP, and eubacterial DNA topoisomerase I {{resulted}} {{in the formation of}} highly positively supercoiled DNA. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I could not substitute for eubacterial DNA topoisomerase 1 in this reaction. Furthermore, the addition of eukaryotic topoisomerase I to a preincubated reaction mixture containing both T antigen and eubacterial topoisomerase I caused rapid relaxation of the positively supercoiled DNA. These results suggest that SV 40 T antigen can introduce topoisomerase-relaxable supercoils into DNA in a reaction coupled to ATP hydrolysis. We interpret the observed T antigen supercoiling reaction in terms of a recently proposed twin-supercoiled-domain model that describes the mechanics of DNA helix-tracking processes. According to this model positive and negative supercoils are generated ahead of and behind the moving SV 40 T antigen, respectively. The preferential relaxation of negative supercoils by eubacterial DNA topoisomerase I explains the accumulation of positive supercoils in the DNA template. The supercoiling assay using DNA conformation-specific eubacterial DNA topoisomerase I may be of general use for the detection of ATP-dependent DNA helix-tracking proteins...|$|E
40|$|Plasmids {{carrying}} 24 - or 32 -base-pair inserts of alternating (dG-dC) residues {{were used}} to analyze the level of methylation of the G-C-G-C sites by Hha I DNA methyltransferase and their cleavage by Hha I endonuclease in the B-DNA or Z-DNA conformation. In supercoiled plasmids in which the inserts formed Z-DNA, the extent of methylation at the insert G-C-G-C sites was dramatically lower than the level of methylation at the G-C-G-C sites located outside the insert in the same plasmid. Similarly, cleavage by Hha I endonuclease was sharply lowered when the insert was in the Z-DNA form. In the <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid,</b> all its G-C-G-C sites were methylated to the same extent and the unmethylated sites were readily cleaved. After treatment with the methylase, the supercoiled plasmid was linearized and then digested with Hha I restriction endonuclease. This exposed unmethylated G-C-G-C sites from the insert that had been protected against cleavage in the Z conformation. A chemical reaction was used to study the distribution of the unmethylated cytosine residues. No accumulation of unmethylated cytosine residues was found anywhere along the entire 32 -base-pair insert, which is consistent with a cooperative B-Z transition...|$|E
40|$|Topoisomerase I is {{the target}} for a potent class of {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs derived from the plant alkaloid camptothecin that includes irinotecan and topotecan. In this study we have identified a novel site of CK 2 -mediated topoisomerase I (topo I) phosphorylation at serine 506 (PS 506) that is relevant to topo I function and to cellular responses to these topo I-targeted drugs. CK 2 treatment induced hyperphosphorylation of recombinant topo I and expression of the PS 506 epitope, and resulted in increased binding of topo I to supercoiled plasmid DNA. Hyperphosphorylated topo I was approximately three times {{more effective than the}} basal phosphorylated enzyme at <b>relaxing</b> <b>plasmid</b> supercoils but had similar DNA cleavage activity once bound to DNA. The PS 506 epitope was expressed in cancer cell lines with elevated CK 2 activity, hyperphosphorylated topo I, and increased sensitivity to camptothecin. In contrast, PS 506 was not detected in normal cells or cancer cell lines with lower levels of CK 2 activity. By experimentally manipulating CK 2 activity in cancer cell lines, we demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between CK 2 activity, PS 506 expression, camptothecin-induced cellular DNA damage, and cellular camptothecin sensitivity. Our results show that the PS 506 epitope is an indicator of dysregulated, hyperphosphorylated topo I in cancer cells, and may thus serve as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker and predict tumor responsiveness to widely used topo I-targeted therapies...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis of}} DNA curvature remains elusive, because models for curvature based on crystallographic structures of molecules containing A tracts {{do not agree}} with any of the models for sequence-directed curvature based on solution studies. Here we demonstrate that the difference is probably due to MPD (2 -methyl- 2, 4 -pentanediol), the dehydrating agent commonly used in crystallography. One characteristic signature of curved DNA molecules is that they run anomalously slowly on polyacrylamide gels, appearing to be larger than they actually are. The gel anomalies of three curved DNAs from trypanosome kinetoplast minicircles drop monotonically with increasing MPD concentration, indicating that MPD straightens molecules that are curved in aqueous solution. This is not due to some non-specific effect of MPD on poly(dA) or polypurine tracts, because control molecules containing dA 70 and dG 43 run normally over the full range of MPD concentrations. Circular dichroism spectra are not affected by MPD, ruling out a conformational change to a structure outside the B-DNA family. The effect is not due to MPD-induced changes in phasing of the curved sequences, because MPD has virtually no effect on the linking numbers of <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing either curved sequences or dA 70. At the concentrations of MPD used in X-ray crystallography, the curvature of DNAs containing A tracts is substantially lower than in solution, which probably explains the ongoing discrepancies between the crystallographic results and models based on solution studies...|$|R
40|$|The topoisomerase (topo) III enzymes {{are found}} in organisms ranging from {{bacteria}} to humans, yet the precise cellular function of these enzymes remains to be determined. We previously found that Drosophila topo IIIβ can <b>relax</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA only if the DNA is first hypernegatively supercoiled. To investigate the possibility that topo IIIβ requires a single-stranded region for its relaxation activity, we formed R-loops and D-loops in plasmids. In addition to containing a single-stranded region, these R-loops and D-loops {{have the advantage of}} being covalently closed and supercoiled, thus allowing us to assay for supercoil relaxation. We found that topo IIIβ preferentially cleaves, rather than relaxes, these substrates. The cleavage of the R-loops and D-loops, which is primarily in the form of nicking, occurs to a greater extent at a temperature that is lower than the optimal temperature for relaxation of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid. In addition, the cleavage can be readily reversed by high salt or high temperature, and the products fail to enter the gel in the absence of proteinase K treatment and are not observed with an active-site Y 332 F mutant of topo IIIβ, indicating that the cleavage is mediated by a topoisomerase. We mapped the cleavage to the unpaired strand within the loop region and found that the cleavage occurs {{along the length of the}} unpaired strand. These studies suggest that the topo III enzyme behaves as a structure-specific endonuclease in vivo, providing a reversible DNA cleavage activity that is specific for unpaired regions in the DNA...|$|R
40|$|Plasmid DNA was {{incubated}} at 25 °C with aqueous solutions of dissolved Fe(II), S(-II), and nanoparticulate FeS with a mackinawite structure, FeSm. At ≥ 0. 1 mM total dissolved Fe(II) and S(-II), {{an increase}} in the proportion of the <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA occurs, through scission of the DNA backbone. In solutions where FeSm was precipitated, nanoparticulate FeSm binds to the DNA molecules. In solutions with concentrations below the FeSm solubility product, nicking of supercoiled pDNA occurs. Plasmid DNA appears to be a sensitive proxy for radical reactions. The reactant is proposed to be a sulfur-based radical produced from the iron-catalyzed decomposition of bisulfide, in a manner analogous to the Fenton reaction. This is further supported by experiments that suggest that sulfide free radicals are produced during the photolysis of aqueous solutions of polysulfides. Supercoiling of DNA affects nearly all DNA–protein transactions so the observation of relaxation of supercoiled forms through reaction with FeS solutions has direct implications to biochemistry. The results of this experimentation suggest that genotoxicity in FeS-rich systems is a further contributory factor to the limited survival of organisms in sulfidic environments. Mutations resulting from the interactions of organisms and mobile elements, such as plasmids, in sediments will also be affected in sulfide-rich environments...|$|E
40|$|Purified RNA {{polymerase}} II initiated transcription {{from the}} yeast CUP 1 promoter fused to a C-less cassette if the DNA was negatively supercoiled. <b>Relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> was not transcribed. Transcription {{did not require}} addition of any other transcription factors. TATA box-binding protein (TBP) was not detectable in the polymerase preparation and the TATA box was not required. Deletion analysis of the CUP 1 promoter revealed that a 25 -bp element containing the initiation region was sufficient for recognition by polymerase. Two transcription start sites were mapped, {{one of which is}} identical to one of the two major start sites observed in vivo. Our observations can be accounted for by using a theoretical analysis of the probability of DNA melting within the plasmid as a function of superhelix density: the CUP 1 initiation element is intrinsically unstable to superhelical stress, permitting entry of the polymerase, which then scans the DNA to locate the start site. In support of this analysis, the CUP 1 promoter was sensitive to mung bean nuclease. These observations and a previous theoretical analysis of yeast genes support the idea that promoters are stress points within the DNA superhelix. The role of transcription factors might be to mark the promoter and to regulate specific melting of promoter DNA...|$|E
40|$|The helicase {{action of}} the Escherichia coli UvrAB complex on a covalently closed {{circular}} DNA template was monitored using bacterial DNA topoisomerase I, which specifically removes negative supercoils. In the presence of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I and ATP, the UvrAB complex gradually introduced positive supercoils into the input <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA template. Positive supercoils were not produced when E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was replaced by eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I or when both E. coli and eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases I were added simultaneously. These results suggest that like other DNA helix-tracking processes, the ATP-dependent {{action of the}} UvrAB complex on duplex DNA simultaneously generates {{both positive and negative}} supercoils, which are not constrained by protein binding but are torsionally strained. The supercoiling activity of UvrAB on UV-damaged DNA was also studied using UV-damaged plasmid DNA and a mutant UvrA protein that lacks the 40 C-terminal amino acids and is defective in preferential binding to UV-damaged DNA. UvrAB was found to preferentially supercoil the UV-damaged DNA template, whereas the mutant protein supercoiled UV-damaged and undamaged DNA with equal efficiency. Our results therefore suggest that the DNA helix-tracking activity of UvrAB may be involved in searching and/or prepriming the damaged DNA for UvrC incision. A possible role of supercoiled domains in the incision process is discussed...|$|E

DNase I footprinting and the supercoiling of <b>relaxed</b> circular <b>plasmid</b> DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I revealed that LrpC induces DNA bending and constrains DNA supercoils in vitro. The LrpC protein cooperatively increases DNA binding of the bona fide DNA-binding and DNA-bending protein Hbsu. LrpC forms inter- and intramolecular bridges on linear and supercoiled DNA molecules, resulting in a large network and DNA compactation. Collectively, these findings suggest that LrpC is an architectural protein and that its activities could provide a means to modulate DNA transactions...|$|R

Derivatives susceptible to all drugs were also obtained. RIP 500 and RIP 501 have similar molecular weights (17. 9 × 106 and 20 × 106, respectively) and represent different percentages of total deoxyribonucleic acid (0. 4 and 4 %, respectively). The number of copies of RIP 500 and RIP 501 per cell is different, and these plasmids are likely replicated under different kinds of control (stringent and/or <b>relaxed).</b> No <b>plasmid</b> deoxyribonucleic acid {{was found in a}} derivative of strain B 96 susceptible to all drugs...|$|R

Analysis of partially purified fractions indicated that Hif 1 p-dependent chromatin assembly activity resided in RNA rather than protein. Fractionation of isolated RNA indicated that the chromatin assembly activity did not simply purify with bulk RNA. In addition, the RNA-mediated chromatin assembly activity was blocked by mutations in the human homolog of Hif 1 p, sNASP, that prevent the association of this histone chaperone with histone H 3 and H 4 without altering its electrostatic properties. These results suggest that specific RNA species may function in concert with histone chaperones to assemble chromatin...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{spermiogenesis}} {{is characterized}} by a striking restructuring of the spermatid chromatin caused by the replacement of nucleohistones with transition proteins and their subsequent replacement with nucleoprotamines. The onset of nuclear elongation and chromatin condensation in spermatids is accompanied by a general decrease in the transcriptional activity of the DNA. A recently identified testis-specific high-mobility-group (tsHMG) protein, similar to the human mitochondrial transcription factor I and to the linker-associated protein delta of Tetrahymena thermophila micronuclei, is thought to play a structural role in this process. We confirm by immunoblot analysis of fractionated germ cells that the presence of tsHMG is restricted to transcriptionally quiescent elongating and condensing spermatids. Purified recombinant tsHMG protein displays preferential binding to supercoiled plasmid DNA, which reversibly protects the DNA against the DNA-relaxing activity of eukaryotic topoisomerase I and also impairs the transcriptional activity of this template when assayed in vitro. The tsHMG protein can also introduce negative supercoils into a <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> substrate in a topoisomerase I-dependent manner. We also show that the tsHMG protein is the substrate of a Ca 2 +-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) present in testis extracts of adult mice and demonstrate that phosphorylation by protein kinase C is required for both the DNA-binding and the topoisomerase I-dependent supercoiling activities of tsHMG. Our results support the hypothesis that the spermatid tsHMG protein is a topological factor (transition protein) that can modulate the activity of topoisomerase I. This activity could contribute to the important transition in chromatin structure which leads to the decrease in DNA metabolism observed at the early stages of spermatid elongation...|$|E
40|$|Type I {{restriction}} enzymes cleave DNA at non-specific sites {{far from}} their recognition sequence {{as a consequence of}} ATP-dependent DNA translocation past the enzyme. During this reaction, the enzyme remains bound to the recognition sequence and translocates DNA towards itself simultaneously from both directions, generating DNA loops, which appear to be supercoiled when visualised by electron microscopy. To further investigate the mechanism of DNA translocation by type I restriction enzymes, we have probed the reaction intermediates with DNA topoisomerases. A DNA cleavage-deficient mutant of EcoAI, which has normal DNA translocation and ATPase activities, was used in these DNA supercoiling assays. In the presence of eubacterial DNA topoisomerase I, which specifically removes negative supercoils, the EcoAI mutant introduced positive supercoils into <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA substrate in a reaction dependent on ATP hydrolysis. The same DNA supercoiling activity followed by DNA cleavage was observed with the wild-type EcoAI endonuclease. Positive supercoils were not seen when eubacterial DNA topoisomerase I was replaced by eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I, which removes both positive and negative supercoils. Furthermore, addition of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I to the product of the supercoiling reaction resulted in its rapid relaxation. These results are consistent with a model in which EcoAI translocation along the helical path of closed circular DNA duplex simultaneously generates positive supercoils ahead and negative supercoils behind the moving complex in the contracting and expanding DNA loops, respectively. In addition, we show that the highly positively supercoiled DNA generated by the EcoAI mutant is cleaved by EcoAI wild-type endonuclease much more slowly than relaxed DNA. This suggests that the topological changes in the DNA substrate associated with DNA translocation by type I restriction enzymes {{do not appear to be}} the trigger for DNA cleavage...|$|E
40|$|The early {{steps in}} the {{transposition}} of Mu DNA have been examined in vitro using purified Mu A, Mu B and E. coli HU proteins, a mini-Mu donor plasmid and target DNA. Two stable protein-DNA complexes, or transpososomes, have been characterized. Type 1 complex formation requires a supercoiled mini-Mu donor plasmid, Mu A and HU protein. In the Type 1 complex the two ends of Mu are held together, creating two independent topological domains; a supercoiled Mu domain and a relaxed vector domain (due to nicking at the Mu ends). In the presence of Mu B protein, ATP, and target DNA, the Type 1 complex is converted into a Type 2 complex which is the protein associated product of the strand transfer reaction.;Type 1 complex formation with a mini-Mu plasmid with in vivo level of supercoiling (dollarσdollar = dollar-dollar 0. 025) was dependent on an additional E. coli protein factor which we named supercoiling relief factor (SRF). This protein was shown to be integration host factor (IHF). Low levels of IHF also {{reduce the amount of}} HU and Mu A required for the reaction and at high concentrations of IHF, HU is not required. The SRF activity of IHF is mediated through an IHF binding site in the Mu early promoter region. This site {{is part of a larger}} enhancer-like element which stimulates the initial rate of the in vitro reaction 100 -fold.;Point mutations at the terminal nucleotide of the Mu ends in a mini-Mu plasmid inhibit the introduction of nicks at the Mu ends in a reaction with Mu A, HU and IHF proteins. Addition of Mu B and ATP, however, dramatically stimulates the reaction of mutant mini-Mu plasmids carrying the mutation at one end. Two products are observed; a normal Type 1 complex which contains nicks at both Mu ends, and free <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmid</b> which is nicked only at the wild type end. Stable protein-DNA complexes characteristic of the first step in the in vitro transposition reaction require the introduction of nicks at both Mu ends...|$|E
40|$|Multi-drug {{tolerance}} {{is a key}} phenotypic {{property that}} complicates the sterilization of mammals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Previous studies have established that iniBAC, an operon that confers multi-drug tolerance to M. bovis BCG through an associated pump-like activity, is induced by the antibiotics isoniazid (INH) and ethambutol (EMB). An improved understanding of the functional role of antibiotic-induced genes and the regulation of drug tolerance may be gained by studying the factors that regulate antibiotic-mediated gene expression. An M. smegmatis strain containing a lacZ gene fused to the promoter of M. tuberculosis iniBAC (PiniBAC) was subjected to transposon mutagenesis. Mutants with constitutive expression and increased EMB-mediated induction of PiniBAC::lacZ mapped to the lsr 2 gene (MSMEG 6065), a small basic protein of unknown function that is highly conserved among mycobacteria. These mutants had a marked change in colony morphology and generated a new polar lipid. Complementation with multi-copy M. tuberculosis lsr 2 (Rv 3597 c) returned PiniBAC expression to baseline, reversed the observed morphological and lipid changes, and repressed PiniBAC induction by EMB to below that of the control M. smegmatis strain. Microarray analysis of an lsr 2 knockout confirmed upregulation of M. smegmatis iniA and demonstrated upregulation of genes involved in cell wall and metabolic functions. Fully 121 of 584 genes induced by EMB treatment in wild-type M. smegmatis were upregulated ("hyperinduced") to even higher levels by EMB in the M. smegmatis lsr 2 knockout. The most highly upregulated genes and gene clusters had adenine-thymine (AT) -rich 5 -prime untranslated regions. In M. tuberculosis, overexpression of lsr 2 repressed INH-mediated induction of all three iniBAC genes, as well as another annotated pump, efpA. The low molecular weight and basic properties of Lsr 2 (pI 10. 69) suggested {{that it was a}} histone-like protein, although it did not exhibit sequence homology with other proteins in this class. Consistent with other histone-like proteins, Lsr 2 bound DNA with a preference for circular DNA, forming large oligomers, inhibited DNase I activity, and introduced a modest degree of supercoiling into <b>relaxed</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Lsr 2 also inhibited in vitro transcription and topoisomerase I activity. Lsr 2 represents a novel class of histone-like proteins that inhibit a wide variety of DNA-interacting enzymes. Lsr 2 appears to regulate several important pathways in mycobacteria by preferentially binding to AT-rich sequences, including genes induced by antibiotics and those associated with inducible multi-drug tolerance. An improved understanding of the role of lsr 2 may provide important insights into the mechanisms of action of antibiotics and the way that mycobacteria adapt to stresses such as antibiotic treatment...|$|R
40|$|An {{affinity}} {{column for}} isolating Z-DNA binding proteins {{was made by}} attaching brominated poly(dG-dC) to Sephadex. Proteins from Drosophila nuclei were prepared and those that could bind to Escherichia coli B-DNA {{were removed from the}} solution. The remaining proteins were passed over the Z-DNA affinity column and then eluted with NaCl. Using both direct and competitive filter binding assays, we found that the eluted proteins bind to brominated poly(dG-dC) (Z-DNA) and poly(dG-m 5 dC) but not to poly(dG-dC) (B-DNA), native or denatured E. coli or calf thymus DNA, or brominated oligonucleotides. The proteins also bind to negatively supercoiled plasmids carrying Z-DNA sequences but not to <b>relaxed</b> or linearized <b>plasmids</b> in which the Z-DNA conformation is no longer present. Gel analysis reveals a mixture of several large proteins up to approximately 150, 000 daltons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTranscription {{factors that}} are bound {{specifically}} to DNA often {{interact with each other}} over thousands of base pairs [1, 2]. Large DNA loops resulting from such interactions have been observed in Escherichia coli with the transcription factors deoR [3] and NtrC [4], but such interactions are not, as yet, well understood. We propose that unique protein complexes, that are not present in solution, may form specifically on DNA. Their uniqueness would make it possible for them to interact tightly and specifically with each other. We used the repressor and operators of coliphage λ to construct a model system in which to test our proposition. λ repressor is a dimer at physiological concentrations, but forms tetramers and octamers at a hundredfold higher concentration. We predict that two λ repressor dimers form a tetramer in vitro when bound to two λ operators spaced 24 bp apart and that two such tetramers interact to form an octamer. We examined, in vitro, <b>relaxed</b> circular <b>plasmid</b> DNA in which such operator pairs were separated by 2, 850 bp and 2, 470 bp. Of these molecules, 29 % formed loops as seen by electron microscopy (EM). The loop increased the tightness of binding of λ repressor to λ operator. Consequently, repression of the λ PR promoter in vivo was increased fourfold by the presence of a second pair of λ operators, separated by a distance of 3, 600 bp...|$|R
