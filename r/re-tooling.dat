5|$|This {{would involve}} {{replacing}} the eight Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines (total thrust 8 × 17,000lb) with four RB211 engines (total thrust 4 × 37,400lb), which would increase range and reduce fuel consumption, {{at a cost}} of approximately US$2.56billion for the whole fleet (71 aircraft at $36 million each). However, an Air Force analysis in 1997 concluded that Boeing's estimated savings of US$4.7billion would not be realized and that re-engining would instead cost US$1.3billion over keeping the existing engines, citing significant up-front procurement and <b>re-tooling</b> expenditure, as well as the RB211's higher maintenance cost.|$|E
5|$|Helium must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at {{only a fraction of}} that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by <b>re-tooling</b> all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.|$|E
25|$|While the {{introduction}} of the Mark 4 nuclear bomb to replace the Fat Man (the Mark 3) in 1949 caused few problems, that of the Mark 5 nuclear bomb in 1951 required extensive <b>re-tooling.</b> The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and Salt Wells Pilot Plant staffs agreed to adopt direct machining of the explosive components. While this was known to generate additional heat, tests at both sites had been conducted without an explosive accident. Further <b>re-tooling</b> was required for the Mark 12 nuclear bomb explosives, which the Salt Wells Pilot Plant began manufacturing in 1953. It also began tooling up for the Mark 13 nuclear bomb.|$|E
40|$|Requirements {{engineering}} (RE) {{tools are}} software tools which provide automated assistance during the RE process. However, the RE practice relies on office tools rather than <b>RE-tools</b> provided by various companies. Reasons for {{not using the}} <b>RE-tools</b> include financial causes. The {{part of the problem}} also lies in the difficulty to evaluate such tools before acquisition to support the RE process. Hence, to support the completeness and effectiveness of <b>RE-tool</b> evaluation, a sound framework providing methodological guidelines is needed. This work proposes an <b>RE-tool</b> evaluation approach (R-TEA), which provides a systematic way of the <b>RE-tool</b> assessment using two evaluation frameworks. The framework for the functional <b>RE-tool</b> requirements consists of three dimensions: representation, agreement, and specification. The representation dimension deals with the degree of formality, where requirements are described using informal, semiformal and formal languages. The agreement dimension deals with the degree of agreement among project participants through communication means. The specification dimension deals with the degree of requirements understanding and completeness at a given time moment. The second framework categorises the non-functional <b>RE-tool</b> features to process, product, and external requirements. Process requirements characterise constraints placed upon the user’s work practice. Product requirements specify the desired qualitative characteristics of <b>RE-tools.</b> External requirements are derived from the user’s internal and external environment. Both frameworks are applied to a specification exemplar which application initiates preparation of the requirements specification for the <b>RE-tool</b> selection. Assessment of the RE-tools’ compatibility to the specified <b>RE-tool</b> requirements is performed using different evaluation techniques. Decision about <b>RE-tool</b> selection is made after summarising all the assessment results. A prototype tool is developed supporting the frameworks and R-TEA. The R-TEA method is tested in a number of case studies. The findings report on positive trends of the frameworks, prototype and the R-TEA method. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

25|$|Although the C1 Corvette chassis and {{suspension}} design {{were derived}} from Chevrolet's full-size cars, the same basic design was continued through the 1962 model even after the full-size cars were completely redesigned for the 1955 model year. This {{was due to the}} combined factors of the relatively high re-engineering and <b>re-tooling</b> costs for this low-volume production vehicle, the continued potential for cancellation of the car, and the increased size and weight of the all-new suspension design for the full-size cars, which made it unsuitable for use in the lighter weight Corvette.|$|E
25|$|QualPro {{was founded}} in 1982 by Dr. Charles Holland. Holland {{previously}} worked for Union Carbide in the 1960s and 1970s at the Y-12 National Security Complex. They were producing carbon foam used in atomic bombs for the Atomic Energy Commission. 85 percent of the foam was defective and they were considering <b>re-tooling</b> the factory {{at a cost of}} $100 million. Instead, Holland questioned the workers and management team for ideas on how to decrease defects and tested 15 factors like the size and position of mixing blades. Holland’s multivariable experiments were based on the 1935 book The Design of Experiments and the work of two British statisticians that used multivariable testing to make better shells to shoot down German planes in World War II. The success rate of foam production increased from 15 percent to 60 percent, and eventually to 99 percent.|$|E

2500|$|The Attacker {{suffered}} from deficiencies {{which led to}} it quickly being superseded; one being that the aircraft retained the Spiteful's tail-wheel undercarriage (due {{to the extent of}} the <b>re-tooling</b> that would have been required to alter the Spiteful's wing), rather than a nose-wheel undercarriage, thus making the Attacker more difficult to land on aircraft carriers. This same tail-down attitude meant that when operating from grass airfields the jet exhaust would create a long furrow in the ground that [...] "three men could lie down in". Also the new wing was apparently aerodynamically inferior to the original Spitfire elliptic one, with lower critical Mach number, leading to someone quipping that [...] "they rather should have left the Spitfire wing on the thing".|$|E
