5|$|Epilepsy is {{characterized}} by a long-term risk of <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizures.</b> These seizures may present in several ways depending {{on the part of the}} brain involved and the person's age.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (<b>recurrent</b> <b>seizures</b> occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizures.</b> The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
40|$|Cyclothiazide (CTZ) {{has been}} {{reported}} to simultaneously enhance glutamate receptor excitation and inhibit GABAA receptor inhibition, and in turn it evokes epileptiform activities in hippocampal neurons. It has also been shown to acutely induce epileptic seizure behavior in freely moving rats. However, whether CTZ induced seizure rats could develop to have <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> still remains unknown. In the current study, we demonstrated that 46 % of the CTZ induced seizure rats developed to have <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> behavior as well as epileptic EEG with a starting latency between 2 weeks and several months. In those chronic seizure rats 6 months after the seizure induction by the CTZ, our immunohistochemistry results showed that both GAD and GAT- 1 were significantly decreased across CA 1, CA 3, and dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus studied. In addition, both BDNF and its receptor TrkB were also decreased in hippocampus of the chronic CTZ seizure rats. Our results indicate that CTZ induced seizure is capable of developing to have <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure,</b> and the decreased GABA synthesis and transport as well as the impaired BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway may {{contribute to the development of}} the <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure.</b> Thus, CTZ seizure rats may provide a novel animal model for epilepsy study and anticonvulsant drug testing in the future...|$|R

[...] Onset of seizures is from age 1 to 14 years with 76% starting between 3–6 years. Autonomic seizures consist of episodes of disturbed autonomic function with nausea, retching and vomiting as predominant symptoms. [...] Other autonomic manifestations include pallor (or, less often, flushing or cyanosis), mydriasis (or, less often, miosis), cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory alterations, {{incontinence of urine}} and/or feces, hypersalivation, and modifications of intestinal motility. In approximately one fifth of the seizures the child becomes unresponsive and flaccid (syncope-like epileptic seizures or ictal syncope) before or often without convulsions. Syncope-like epileptic seizures (ictal syncope) with the child becoming [...] "completely unresponsive and flaccid like a rag doll" [...] occur in one fifth of the seizures. [...] More-conventional seizure symptoms often appear after the onset of autonomic manifestations. The child, who was initially fully conscious, becomes confused and unresponsive. Eyes turn to one side or gaze widely open. Only half of the seizures end with brief hemiconvulsions or generalized convulsions. Autonomic symptoms {{may be the only}} features of the seizures. None of the above symptoms alone is a prerequisite for diagnosis. [...] <b>Recurrent</b> <b>seizures</b> may not be stereotyped. The same child may have brief or prolonged seizures and autonomic manifestations may be severe or inconspicuous. [...] The full emetic triad (nausea, retching, vomiting) culminates in vomiting in 74% of the seizures; in others only nausea or retching occur, and in a few, none of the emetic symptoms are apparent.|$|E

Objective: To {{identify}} predictors {{for short}} term recurrence {{in young children}} presented with seizure to the accident & emergency department (A & E) in Hong Kong. Methods: It was a retrospective cohort analysis based on A & E data from one district hospital. The study period was from 1 st January 2008 to 31 st December 2012. All children aged below 6 years presented with seizure attended A & E who required admissions to paediatric ward were included. Baseline characteristic factors were recorded. Primary outcome was presence of <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> before admission to paediatric ward. Binominal logistic regression was applied to identify the predictive factors. Results: Total 650 cases were included for analysis. <b>Recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> before admission occurred in 101 cases (15. 5 %). Final diagnoses consisted of febrile seizure (77. 8 %), afebrile seizure (6. 6 %), epilepsy (13. 8 %), status epilepticus (1. 2 %) and others (0. 5 %). Statistically significant predictive factors include pre-hospital seizure duration 5 - 15 minutes (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 960; p < 0. 001), pre-hospital seizure duration more than 15 minutes (OR= 16. 164; p < 0. 001), history of prematurity (OR= 3. 941; p= 0. 006), history of epilepsy (OR= 2. 531; p= 0. 010) and fever in A & E (â¥ 38 oC) (OR= 2. 072; p= 0. 030).

Methods Male adult mice (Kunming stain, n = 10) were divided into pilocarpine-treated group (n = 5) and controls (n = 5). Pilocarpine-treated mice were sacrificed at 12 h after status epilepticus. Brain coronal sections in the thalamus level were subject to FJC staining. Finally, FJC-stained brain sections were examined under fluorescence microscope to identify the shape and overall distribution of the Fluoro-Jade C positive cells in the thalamus. Results The FJC-positive staining cells showed a bright green color in the thalamus tissue and fine processes with neuronal profiles. There was a continuity of thalamic damage and neuronal damage in functionally heterogenous thalamic nuclei. They were not detected in control animals. Conclusion This study successfully applied FJC staining to demonstrate massive neurodegeneration in the thalamus, which will benefit further understanding of long-term brain pathologic changes and <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> mechanism in temporal lobe epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|Background Febrile seizure is a {{condition}} of emotionally trauma- tize for most parents. It is believed that parents whose children experienced febrile seizures before, have a better knowledge, at- titude, and practices (KAP) {{in responding to the}} seizure. Hence the fear and emotional disruption that febrile seizures can cause in the family, prevention should be addresses. Objective To find if there was any differences in KAP of parents of children with <b>recurrent</b> febrile <b>seizures</b> compares to parents with children of first time febrile seizures. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted on parents who have children aged between 6 months to 5 years old with either simple febrile seizures, complex febrile <b>seizures</b> or <b>recurrent</b> febrile <b>seizures</b> admitted to Pediatric Neurology Clinic ofSanglah Hospi- tal. Subjects were selected consecutively and were grouped into group of parents with children of first time seizures and parents with children of <b>recurrent</b> febrile <b>seizures</b> group.

This activation is impaired following <b>recurrent</b> febrile <b>seizures.</b> A seizure-induced modification of a signaling cascade upstream of CREB is suggested by this. Adult rats with infant febrile seizures were treated with Rolipram, a specific phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor (PDE4 inhibitor), which resultes in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and is known to activate CREB by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.

40|$|Purpose Uncertainty about {{recurrence}} after a first unprovoked seizure is {{a significant}} psychological burden for patients, and motivates the need for diagnostic tools with high sensitivity and specificity to assess recurrence risk. As the sensitivity of a routine EEG after a first unprovoked seizure is limited, patients often require further diagnostics. Here, we study if ambulatory EEG (aEEG) has similar diagnostic accuracy as sleep deprived EEG (sdEEG). Methods In this retrospective cohort, we included patients with an unprovoked first seizure and a normal routine EEG who subsequently underwent an sdEEG or aEEG. All EEGs were reviewed {{for the presence of}} interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). We calculated specificity and sensitivity of sdEEG and aEEG, using the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy as golden standard. All patients had a follow-up of one year. Results We included 104 patients. Sensitivities for sdEEG and aEEG were 45 % (specificity 91 %) and 63 % (specificity 95 %), respectively. Independent risk factor for <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> were IEDs on the additional EEG, with a relative risk of 1. 5 of having a <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> within a year. Conclusion Diagnostic accuracies of sdEEG and aEEG are similar and depending on patients’ and clinicians’ preference both can be considered in patients with a first seizure and a normal routine EEG to determine recurrence risk...|$|R

40|$|Endogenous PGE 2 {{dynamically}} regulates membrane excitability, synaptic {{transmission and}} plasticity. Neonatal seizures {{are associated with}} a number of activity-dependent changes in brain development including altered synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity as well as reduction in neurogenesis. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that alteration of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression induced by neonatal seizure may influence brain development. We evaluated the expression of COX- 2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES) by Western blot analysis and immnohistochemistry in flurothyl-induced neonatal seizure and also studied the effect of celecoxib on seizure induction. Seven to 10 days old Sprague–Dawley rats were used for control (n = 18) and experimental group (n = 30). <b>Recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> group showed more increased level of COX- 2 expression than control group. However, the level of mPGES- 2 expression was similar in both groups, and mPGES- 1 was not detected. Hippocampus of control rats showed endogenous COX- 2 expression, which was localized mainly in CA 3 region. This localization pattern was similar in <b>recurrent</b> <b>seizure</b> rats, but intensity of COX- 2 expression was more increased than in control rats. Celecoxib treatment significantly delayed the seizure attack and also reduced COX- 2 expression. In conclusion, this study suggests that COX- 2 expression is related to epileptogenesis in flurothyl-induced neonatal seizure model and shows the possibility that its inhibition lessens functional impairments that occurred in neonatal seizure...|$|R
