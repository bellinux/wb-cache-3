40|$|Background: Unexplained sudden deaths due cardiac {{involvement}} {{are linked to}} autonomic neuropathy in diabetics but mechanisms remain unclear. Heart <b>rate</b> and pulse <b>pressure</b> etc {{have been used to}} predict cardiovascular risk. But the association of <b>Rate</b> <b>Pressure</b> Product remains unascertained. Objective: To predict cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetic patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy using a noninvasive indicator, <b>rate</b> <b>pressure</b> product. Materials and Methods: Case control study done on two groups of 20 each, age matched type 2 diabetics with/without cardiac autonomic neuropathy and matched with 20 controls of either sex (n= 60). <b>Rate</b> <b>Pressure</b> Product was measured in response to cold pressor and hand grip test. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software by paired and unpaired t test. Results: There was a significant increase in <b>rate</b> <b>pressure</b> product in controls and in patients without autonomic neuropathy after the tests (p 0. 001). The change in RPP (âˆ†RPP) was least in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy and significant in controls and non-neuropathy diabetics using unpaired t-test (p< 0. 05). Resting RPP was recorded highest in diabetic autonomic neuropathy patients. Conclusion: Heightened resting RPP and failure of <b>Rate</b> <b>Pressure</b> Product increment during cardiac sympathetic stimulation promotes aggravated ischemic episodes. This renders autonomic neuropathy diabetics vulnerable to adverse cardiovascular events leading to increased morbidity and mortality...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of exchange-rate crises have {{occurred}} {{during the last two}} decades in emerging market economies. The objective of this paper is, based on the literature review on the relationship between exchange-rate and banking crises, to propose and estimate the determinants of exchange rate crises with emphasis {{to the role of the}} central bank and its performance regarding policies to affect private banking liquidity. We suggest, empirically, a mechanism where domestic credit creation and the weakness of the private banking sector affect exchange <b>rate</b> <b>pressure.</b> Our sample is constituted of 13 emerging market economies and data covers the period from January, 1995 to December, 2000. The results corroborate the theoretical propositions. Increases in the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>pressure</b> have been significantly linked to domestic credit expansion, deterioration of short run liabilities of the central bank, higher political risk and increasing exchange <b>rate</b> <b>pressure</b> to the other countries in the sample. At last, the model estimated successfully the periods of high vulnerability owing to increasing exchange rate volatility. ...|$|R

50|$|If the {{pressure}} at the outlet {{is lower than}} {{the pressure}} at the inlet and remains that way in spite of the pumping, then this pressure difference opens both check valves simultaneously and the liquid flows through the pump head uncontrollably from inlet to outlet. This can happen whether the pump is working or not. This situation can be avoided by placing a correctly rated positive pressure differential check valve downstream of the pump. Such a valve will only open if a minimum <b>rated</b> <b>pressure</b> differential across the valve is exceeded, something which most high-pressure metering pumps can easily exceed.|$|E
50|$|Volumetric {{efficiency}} in a hydraulic pump {{refers to the}} percentage of actual fluid flow out of the pump compared to the flow out of the pump without leakage. In other words, if the flow out of a 100cc pump is 92cc (per revolution), then the volumetric efficiency is 92%. The volumetric efficiency will change with the pressure and speed a pump is operated at, therefore when comparing volumetric efficiencies, the pressure and speed information must be available. When a single number is given for volumetric efficiency, it will typically be at the <b>rated</b> <b>pressure</b> and speed.|$|E
