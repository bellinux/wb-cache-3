5|$|The {{contributing}} musicians included Indian sarodya Aashish Khan and tablist Mahapurush Misra, {{the last}} of whom was the regular accompanist to Khan's father, Ali Akbar Khan. Aashish Khan and Misra's contributions were recorded at Abbey Road, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later</b> in India, since the pair were performing in London in December 1967. Barham attended this session and also contributed {{to some of the}} Western recordings for Wonderwall, playing piano, harmonium and flugelhorn, and providing orchestral arrangements for flutes, oboes and trumpet. Another session with some unnamed Indian musicians took place on 5 January 1968.|$|E
5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening sooner <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later</b> {{was made}} possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later</b> clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} proved that climate change will affect Nicaragua sooner <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later</b> due to its {{geographic}} location in the traditional path of strong Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes. Planning efforts in Nicaragua are directed towards adapting to wider climate variability including stronger storms in some years and more severe droughts in others, and higher temperatures that will provoke increased evaporation. This will lead to even drier years than the Nicaraguan agriculture had already suffered in past decades. Moreover, {{there is a high}} deforestation rate in Nicaragua that makes the country even more vulnerable to climate change induced flooding and landslides.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later.</b> With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} home in 1936, recently promoted to full general, to lead Eastern Command, {{one of the}} corps-level regional commands in the United Kingdom, responsible for a single Regular division and three Territorial Army divisions. Here, he realised that a European War would come sooner <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later,</b> and that the Army was in a parlous state to defend the country. However, he found that as with his earlier posts, he could achieve little in Eastern Command – the most important decisions being made in Whitehall. He himself seemed to lose his opportunity for higher office in 1937, when he was rebuked over his mishandling of a mobile force in the annual exercises; until this point, he had been considered a possible candidate as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, but was dropped from consideration in favour of Lord Gort, whom Ironside considered unfit for the job. Lord Hore-Belisha gave him official notice that he was deemed too old for the post, aged 57. Thus, he was appointed an Aide-de-Camp to HM the King in October, a purely ceremonial position, and early in 1938 accepted the offer of Governor of Gibraltar, generally seen as a quiet role where to retire.|$|E

Biographer Sally Green noted that Childe's beliefs were [...] "never dogmatic, always idiosyncratic" [...] and [...] "continually changing throughout his life" [...] but that [...] "Marxist views on a model of the past" [...] were accepted by Childe because they offer [...] "a structural analysis of culture in terms of economy, sociology and ideology, and a principle for cultural change through economy." [...] She noted that [...] "Childe's Marxism" [...] often differed from the orthodox Marxism of his contemporaries because he made reference to the original texts of Hegel, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later</b> interpretations and because he was selective in his use of their writings. Similarly, McNairn considered Childe's Marxism to be [...] "an individual interpretation" [...] that differed from [...] "popular or orthodox" [...] conceptions of Marxism.|$|E

500|$|... « Allemande I & II »: Aue {{describes}} his service {{as an officer}} {{in one of the}} Einsatzgruppen extermination squads operating in Ukraine, as well as later in the Caucasus (a major theme is the racial classification, and thus fate, of the region's Mountain Jews). Aue's group is attached to the 6th Army in Ukraine, where he witnesses the Lviv pogroms and participates in the enormous massacre at Babi Yar. He describes in detail the killing of Soviet Jews, Communists, alleged partisans and other victims of the [...] "special operations". Although he seems to become increasingly indifferent to the atrocities he is witnessing and sometimes taking part in, he begins to experience daily bouts of vomiting and suffers a mental breakdown. After taking sick leave, he is transferred to Otto Ohlendorf's Einsatzgruppe D only to encounter much hostility from his new SS colleagues, who openly spread rumours of his homosexuality. Aue is then charged with the assignment of proving to the Wehrmacht that the Mountain Jews were historically Jewish <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later</b> converts to Judaism. After he fails in this task, due to political pressure from the beleaguered Army, his disappointed commanding officer arranged that he be transferred to the doomed German forces at Stalingrad in late 1942.|$|E

Goebbels {{was one of the most}} enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>later.</b> At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: [...] "ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing." [...] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing [...] "war panic" [...] in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.|$|E
