50|$|The {{purchase}} and subsequent discontinuation prompted criticism from some tech sites, who were uncertain {{about the future}} of the apps. Sean Gallagher of Ars Technica wrote he was concerned for the app's future given Google's previous history of buying out and subsequently abandoning development on other startups such as <b>reMail,</b> Meebo and Quickoffice. Rafe Needleman of CNET wrote that the purchase combined with the ceasing development of Mozilla Thunderbird meant there was a growing lack of quality desktop mail clients. Rob Beschizza of Boing Boing created a satirical video instructing users to prepare for the acquisition by deleting the app from their computer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are {{isolated}} from those communication means that programmers use daily {{to interact with}} each other—as if talk and work were unrelated in software development. We present <b>REmail,</b> an Eclipse plugin, that aims at filling this gap. <b>REmail</b> inte-grates email communication in the IDE, allowing developers to quickly and easily retrieve emails related to the class at hand, perform customized searches, or watch trends in discussions about code. <b>REmail</b> also allows developers to produce infor-mation, e. g., by rating the value of any message or by sending contextual emails. ...|$|E
25|$|Santa Claus {{received}} some attention in 1961 when several advertisements {{appeared in the}} 1961 issue of Popular Mechanics, an American magazine devoted to science and technology. The advertisements offered <b>remailing</b> services where Christmas cards and letters would be <b>remailed</b> from Santa Claus, Arizona, {{at a cost of}} $.25 plus the postage for the <b>remailing.</b> The <b>remailing</b> service would result in a United States Postal Service postmark on the envelope reading Santa Claus, Arizona, something desirable around the annual Christmas holiday.|$|R
50|$|For a mail {{transfer}} agent (MTA), the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) is a scheme for rewriting the envelope sender address of an email message, in view of <b>remailing</b> it. In this context, <b>remailing</b> {{is a kind of}} email forwarding. SRS was devised in order to forward email without breaking the Sender Policy Framework (SPF), in 2003.|$|R
5000|$|By contrast, {{the terms}} <b>remailing</b> or {{redistribution}} can sometimes mean re-sending {{the message and}} also rewriting the [...] "envelope sender" [...] field. Electronic mailing lists furnish a typical example. Authors submit messages to a reflector that performs <b>remailing</b> to each list address. That way, bounce messages (which report a failure delivering a message to any list- subscriber) will not reach {{the author of a}} message. However, annoying misconfigured vacation autoreplies do reach authors.|$|R
40|$|Software {{developers}} spend a {{large part}} of their working time using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). How-ever, IDEs are usually disconnected from the means of com-munication programmers use to interact and discuss with other co-workers. Because of this, many context switches are required and the existing connection between source code artifacts and artifacts generated from recorded communica-tions, such as e-mails, cannot be effectively put to good use. In this paper, we introduce <b>Remail,</b> an Eclipse plugin to integrate e-mail communication in the IDE. It allows devel-opers to seamlessly handle source code entities and e-mails concerning the source code. We present our preliminary work on <b>Remail</b> that allows linking source code classes to the e-mails in which they are discussed, thus providing an updated and effective documentation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{advent of}} {{globalization}} {{has led to}} the adoption of distributed software development as a common practice. One of its drawbacks-the absence of impromptu meetings-is tackled with other communication means, such as emails, instant messaging, or forums. Mailing lists have proven to be ef-fective for enabling developers ’ collaboration and coordination: Being asynchronous, emails can evade timezone barriers; being public, mailing lists maintain developers ’ awareness; being recorded, email archives offer information on system evolution. Emails can provide information about a task, clarify imple-mentation details, or reveal hidden connections among entities, always within the clear context of a discussion. As a result, we argue that emails might help program comprehension. We devised <b>Remail,</b> an Eclipse plugin to integrate email communication in the IDE. It allows developers to seamlessly handle code entities and emails concerning the source code. Discussions relevant to chosen entities can be retrieved easily, thus providing an updated and effective form of complementary documentation. We present design and implementation of <b>Remail,</b> and illustrate, through a number of scenarios, how it can augment program comprehension. I...|$|E
50|$|This kind of {{forwarding}} actually {{constitutes a}} <b>remailing</b> from {{the points of}} view of the envelope-sender and of the recipient(s). The message identity also changes.|$|R
50|$|Typically, plain message-{{forwarding}} does alias-expansion, while proper message-forwarding, {{also named}} forwarding tout-court serves for mailing-lists. When additional {{modifications to the}} message are carried out, so as to rather resemble the action of a Mail User Agent submitting a new message, the term forwarding becomes deceptive and <b>remailing</b> seems more appropriate.|$|R
50|$|Julf's remailer {{worked by}} {{receiving}} {{an e-mail from}} a person, stripping away all the technical information {{that could be used}} to identify the original source of the e-mail, and then <b>remailing</b> the message to its final destination. The result provided Internet users with the ability to send e-mail messages and post to Usenet newsgroups without revealing their identities.|$|R
50|$|Remailer {{systems can}} also be {{attacked}} via traffic analysis. If a message is observed going to a <b>remailing</b> server, and an identical-length (if now anonymized) message is seen exiting the server soon after, a traffic analyst {{may be able to}} (automatically) connect the sender with the ultimate receiver. Variations of remailer operations exist that can make traffic analysis less effective.|$|R
25|$|After {{twelve years}} {{operating}} Santa Claus, Talbot's land resale plans for Santa Claus never materialized, {{in part because}} the only inhabitants in the town were the ones working there. Talbot sold her interest in the town in 1949. Others made plans during the 1950s to improve Santa Claus, which received publicity through the writings of American novelist and famed science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein and U.S. pioneer restaurant rater Duncan Hines and through 1961 <b>remailing</b> service advertisements offering to postmark letters from Santa Claus, for a small fee.|$|R
50|$|In September 1996, an {{anonymous}} user posted the confidential {{writings of the}} Church of Scientology through the Penet remailer. The Church once again demanded that Julf turn over the identity {{of one of its}} users, claiming that the poster had infringed the Church's copyright on the confidential material. The Church was successful in finding the originating e-mail address of the posting before Penet <b>remailed</b> it, {{but it turned out to}} be another anonymous remailer: the alpha.c2.org nymserver, a more advanced and more secure remailer which didn't keep a mapping of e-mail addresses that could be subpoenaed.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, Julf {{claimed that}} he {{explained}} to the Observer the steps he took to prevent child pornography from being posted by forbidding posting to the alt.binaries newsgroups and limiting the size of messages to 16 kilobytes, too small to allow uuencoded binaries such as pictures to be posted. He also informed the Observer of an investigation already performed by the Finnish police which had {{found no evidence that}} child pornography was being <b>remailed</b> through Penet. Julf claims that all this information was ignored, stating that the Observer [...] "wanted to make a story so they made things up." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{anonymous}} remailer is a server that receives messages with embedded instructions {{on where to}} send them next, and that forwards them without revealing where they originally came from. There are Cypherpunk {{anonymous remailer}}s, Mixmaster anonymous remailers, and nym servers, among others, which differ in how they work, in the policies they adopt, and {{in the type of}} attack on anonymity of e-mail they can (or are intended to) resist. <b>Remailing</b> as discussed in this article applies to e-mails intended for particular recipients, not the general public. Anonymity in the latter case is more easily addressed by using any of several methods of anonymous publication.|$|R
5000|$|The example {{above is}} adapted from Shevek. [...] With respect to VERP, the local part (alice) is moved after her domain name (example.org), further adding a prefix (SRS0), a hash (HHH), and a {{timestamp}} (TT). That reflects an operational difference: Eventual bounces back to a VERP address are handled within the rewriting domain, and forged messages can at most unsubscribe some users, a kind of abuse that hasn't seen significant exploits in the last decades. Instead, SRS aims at <b>remailing</b> a possible bounce back to Alice, so that forged bounces can become an alluring technique for injecting spam apparently originating from the rewriting sender.|$|R

5000|$|Some remailers {{establish}} an internal list of actual senders and invented names such that a recipient can send mail to invented name AT some-remailer.example. When receiving traffic addressed to this user, the server software consults that list, and forwards the mail {{to the original}} sender, thus permitting anonymous—though traceable {{with access to the}} list—two way communication. The famous [...] "penet.fi" [...] remailer in Finland did just that for several years. Because of the existence of such lists in this type of <b>remailing</b> server, it is possible to break the anonymity by gaining access to the list(s), by breaking into the computer, asking a court (or merely the police in some places) to order that the anonymity be broken, and/or bribing an attendant. This happened to penet.fi as a result of some traffic passed through it about Scientology. The Church claimed copyright infringement and sued penet.fi's operator. A court ordered the list be made available. Penet's operator shut it down after destroying its records (including the list) to retain identity confidentiality for its users; though not before being forced to supply the court with the real e-mail addresses of two of its users.|$|R

Using a reliable and valid questionnaire, the authors estimated the onset and disappearance of symptoms consistent with functional gastrointestinal disorders. An age- and sex-stratified random sample of 1, 021 eligible residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, aged 30 - 64 years were initially mailed the questionnaire; 82 % responded (n = 835). In a <b>remailing</b> to responders 12 - 20 months later, 83 % responded again (n = 690). The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates per 100 for irritable bowel syndrome, chronic constipation, chronic diarrhea, and frequent dyspepsia were 18. 1 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) 15. 1 - 21. 1), 14. 7 (95 % Cl 11. 9 - 17. 4), 7. 3 (95 % Cl 5. 3 - 9. 3), and 14. 1 (95 % Cl 11. 5 - 16. 8), respectively, on the second mailing.

A repeat letter was sent two months later to non-responders. Those with positive tests were invited for colonoscopy. Compliance was measured according to age, sex, and occupational group {{and the effects of}} reinviting non-compliers investigated. SETTING: Leicester General Hospital, a large university teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 990 employees aged 41 to 65 years. MAIN RESULTS: Total compliance was 46 % with women participating more than men (49 % v 34 %, chi 2 = 12. 2, p 5. 5, p < 0. 02). <b>Remailing</b> raised compliance slightly from 43. 6 % to 46. 3 %. Four employees (1 %) had positive faecal occult blood tests but three were negative on repeat testing with dietary restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The government favours the development of health promotion programmes as stated in its document "Health at work in the NHS". The response in this study, showed methods to increase compliance must be developed if such programmes are to be successful. As uptake was similar to that in several community based programmes in general practice, workplace based programmes could offer a complementary method of delivering screening...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{was to investigate the}} factors affecting the retention behavior of first term and second term Marine Corps enlisted members. Data were extracted from the 1992 DoD Survey of Officer and Enlisted Personnel and their Spouses and were matched with the respondents' 1996 status from the Active Duty Military Master and Loss File by the Defense Manpower Data Center. The sample was restricted to Marines with between two and ten years-of- service who had less than two years <b>remailing</b> on their enlistment contract and was further stratified by term of enlistment and gender. A complete conceptual model was developed which incorporated individual and organizational factors affecting retention. Four categories of determinants of turnover were used: Demographic, Military Experience, Cognitive and External. Logistic regression was used to measure the relative importance of a broad range of these factors for the retention decision. Results indicated that the factors affecting retention differ across term of service and by gender. No single factor was significant for all gender/term of service samples. Some factors were significant only for a particular term of service. Others were significant only by gender and many were significant only for a single sample. The specific findings can provide manpower planners with targeted information to manage retention levels for first term and second term Marines more effectively[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{raise and}} propose {{solutions}} to the problem of guaranteeing that a user of incentive <b>remailing</b> services for anonymization cannot lose money if he does not get full service, i. e., if his message does not reach its destination. Applications such as voting over the Internet or reviewing of articles require anonymous delivery of messages. An anonymizing technique was proposed several decades ago by Chaum and is based on a group of volunteer agents called mixnet. However, mixnets are not yet widely known and used today, and one often mentioned reason is the lack of incentives for volunteers. A recently proposed solution is based on adding digital coins to messages, such that each volunteer can extract only the digital coin designated as a payment for her. However, registered volunteers can sabotage the system by extracting and using their coins without performing their task — which consists of forwarding anonymized messages. The main improvement we propose is to guarantee that no money is lost by the user without getting his message at the destination. This is an essential property for a viable service. Solutions described are based on handshaking mechanisms where each volunteer gets her payment (or key to decrypt the payment) from the agent to which she is expected to forward the message, or from the destination using a public board or a reply message. This ensures that a volunteer gets her financial support only if she fulfills her task. We discuss how techniques for nonrepudiation of receipt of a message, together with reputation systems, can address the remaining problems. ...|$|R

I am enclosing the letter in the hope that it may help clarify what follows herein. On or about last December tenth I received two pound boxes of candied cherries with the greetings of Bryant College. I was at that time stationed at Ft. Benning, Georgia. As I was to have a leave of ten days starting on the sixteenth of December I did not acknowledge the present by mail, but while home in Providence a few days later I visited good old Bryant, had a very pleasant talk with Mr. Ripley during which time I thanked Bryant through Mr. Ripley for their generous gift. I’m mighty sorry if I have caused you any inconvenience Miss Blaney; you may be sure the chocolates were appreciated. I think the idea of a Service Club strictly “Bryant’s Own” is swell, and I’m sure the other fellows in the service appreciate your interest in us as much as I know I do. Would it be possible to have our school paper sent directly to me? My folks always forward it and I sure do enjoy it but as it is it has to be <b>remailed</b> to me each month. I’d be only too glad to pay any expense it might incur. My address now is: Lieut. Earle C.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} perceived expectations which graduates of Southeast Community College held regarding new or continued services for alumni and to recommend strategies by which these expectations might be served. Answers were sought to five questions: (1) What services and activities are perceived as important by a selected sample of graduates of Southeast Community College? (2) Is there a relationship between the time which has elapsed since graduation and perceived expectations of selected graduates? (3) Is there a relationship between distance from campus and perceived expectations of selected graduates? (4) Are there different expectations perceived by graduates based upon their educational goals while enrolled at SCC? (5) Are there perceived differences in expectations of male graduates as compared to female graduates? Alumni were asked to respond to two sets of statements. Set I statements asked the alumni to identify if SCC should or should not develop and offer twenty-one different alumni activities or services. Set II statements asked the alumni to identify if they would or would not participate in the different alumni activities or services. ^ The population from which the sample for this study was drawn consisted of 10, 103 graduates of Southeast Community College from school years 1941 - 1942 through 1978 - 1979. Five hundred and sixteen alumni were randomly selected from the total population. Although the original questionnaire was followed-up by a postcard reminder and then a <b>remailing</b> of the original survey, only two hundred and thirty-one respondents (45 percent) participated in the study. ^ Findings. An analysis of the data collected in this study showed that Job Placement and Referral Services, Continuing Education, and Job Related Workshops were the most important types of services or activities which could be provided for SCC alumni. The relationships between date of graduation, program major, sex or gender, and whether or not SCC alumni were interested in new or continued services were significant. The relationships between distance from campus attended and whether or not SCC alumni were interested in new or continued services were not significant. ^ Conclusions. Based upon the findings of this study, it is concluded: (1) Job Placement and Referral is the most important service or activity which can be provided to alumni of a two-year community college. This study confirms previous research on needs and interests of alumni of two-year institutions in the United States. (2) Continuing Education and Job Related workshops were ranked second and third in terms of importance by alumni of SCC. The findings of this study confirm previous research completed on interests of the adult learner. Adult learners and alumni of institutions of higher education are interested in continuing education and, as a specific example, job related workshops. (3) The relationships between date of graduation, program major, sex or gender, and whether or not SCC alumni were interested in new or continued services were significant. This finding confirms previous research completed on alumni of institutions of higher education. (4) There was no significant relationship between distance from campus attended and how alumni responded to new or continued services or activities. This finding was contrary to previous research in the field of alumni affairs and programming. ^ Based on the results of this study, further research is needed in the following areas: (1) identification of factors which affect alumni identification (allegiance) with a two-year institution, and (2) identification of interests and needs of alumni enrolled in technical programs as compared to alumni enrolled in college transfer programs. ...|$|R
