40|$|An {{electronic}} tongue (ET) comprising 18 potentiometric {{chemical sensors}} {{was applied to}} the quantitative analysis of beer. Fifty Belgian and Dutch beers of different types were measured using the ET. The same samples were analyzed using conventional analytical techniques with respect to the main physicochemical parameters. Only non-correlated physicochemical parameters were retained for further analysis, which were <b>real</b> <b>extract,</b> real fermentation degree, alcohol content, pH, bitterness, color, polyphenol and CO 2 content. Relationship between the ET and physicochemical datasets was studied using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Four significant canonical variates were extracted using CCA. Correlation was observed between 6 physicochemical variables (<b>real</b> <b>extract</b> and fermentation degree, bitterness, pH, alcohol and polyphenols’ content) and 14 sensors of the ET. The feasibility of the ET for the quantification of bitterness in beer was evaluated in the aqueous solutions of isomerised hop extract and in the set of 11 beers with bitterness varying between 14 and 38 EBU (European Bitterness Units). Sensors displayed good sensitivity to isomerised hop extract and good prediction of the bitterness in beer was obtained. Calibration models with respect to the physicochemical parameters using ET measurements in 50 Belgian and Dutch beer samples were calculated by Partial Least Square regression. The ET was capable of predicting such parameters as <b>real</b> <b>extract,</b> alcohol and polyphenol content and bitterness, the latter with Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of 2. 5. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the food chain and water resources for agriculture are essential. A problem is that the water transport systems present low efficiencies in practice. Crop yields must be optimized, and the goal of an operational water manager is to deliver water to irrigation sites accurately and efficiently. In order to fulfill this objective, we propose a centralized overall control diagram to optimize the management of the canal. Our control diagram in real time is mainly composed of two algorithms, CSE and GoRoSoBo. The first one is a powerful tool in canal management, and is able to estimate the <b>real</b> <b>extracted</b> flow in the canal and the hydrodynamic canal state from measured level data at selected points. The second one is an essential tool in the management of the canal, a feedback control algorithm operating in real time. The GoRoSoBo algorithm (Gómez, Rodellar, Soler, Bonet) is able to calculate the optimum gates trajectories for a predictive horizon taking into account the current canal state and the <b>real</b> <b>extracted</b> flow, both obtained by CSE.

40|$|The role {{of silicon}} (Si) in human {{metabolism}} {{is not well}} studied, {{but more and more}} agreement exists that it is an essential element for bone mineral density, potentially reducing the chance to develop osteoporosis and bone fractures. Si also reduces the biological availability of aluminium. Beer is one of the prime sources of Si for humans and is a quintessential part of Belgian heritage. Sripanyakorn et al. (2004) found that Si concentrations in blood serum rise to a peak within 2 h after ingestion of beer, suggesting an efficient uptake of dissolved Si into the bloodstream. A substantial fraction of the beer Si is effectively retained within the body. Although other food products have higher concentrations of Si per weight unit (e. g. cereals and soups), beer has the highest in vitro availability of Si found {{in a wide range of}} consumption products (Robberecht et al., 2009). Si in the beer originates from the husks of the barley malt. During the brewing process most of the deposited amorphous Si remains in the husks, but significant Si is extracted into the wort during mashing and much of this endures into the beer. Belgium represents an excellent case study to investigate variation of Si concentrations among a wide range of beer styles, fermentation processes and ingredients. Several studies have confirmed considerable variability in Si concentrations in beer. Sripanyakorn et al. (2004) found no direct link to beer type, country of origin or alcohol content. Other studies have suggested a link to fermentation (e. g. Robberecht et al., 2009). In our study 120 Belgian beers were analysed for dissolved Si and the results compared with typical beer parameters (alcohol content, <b>real</b> <b>extract,</b> original extract, fermentation degree, colour, pH, bitterness). Process conditions were also taking into account. The study confirmed that all beers contain significant dissolved Si, while some beers contain extraordinary high concentrations. Most Si is available in strong ales like abbey and trappist ales. Concentrations of Si ranged between 214 and 2, 071 μmol L[*]−[*] 1. The alcohol content was related to the Si content. A more significant relation is found between the <b>real</b> <b>extract</b> and the Si content. The <b>real</b> <b>extract,</b> diminished with the eventual sugar added to sweeten the beer, is a possible measure for the amount of grain raw materials used in the production of the beer and as such relates to the Si extracted from the grist...|$|E

Both methods provide a number of analytical results for the comparison of decoction and infusion techniques, and analytical characteristics of both the brewing procedures.

40|$|In the {{presented}} research 3 measurement {{strategies of}} Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry (horizontal- and micro- attenuated total reflection (HATR and μATR, respectively) and a novel high throughput transmission (HTT)) {{in combination with}} extensive chemometric approach have been applied for analysis of beer. Fifty Belgian beer samples were analyzed: lager and white beers, dark and blonde ales, lambic and Trappist beers. Partial Least Square (PLS) regression was used for prediction of different physicochemical parameters of beer based on mid-IR data, modified with different spectral preprocessing and variable selection algorithms for higher prediction performance. It was found that HATR and μATR have the same prediction capability with a slight advantage of μATR and excellent correlations between spectra and reference values were demonstrated for original (R 2 0. 95), apparent (R 2 0. 89) and real (R 2 0. 95) extracts, real and apparent degrees of fermentation (R 2 0. 91 and 0. 89), alcohol content (R 2 0. 94) and energetic value (R 2 0. 95).
