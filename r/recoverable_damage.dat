40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the rights and {{liabilities}} arising under English and Chinese law in respect of the carriage of dangerous cargo. It is noted that the danger in dangerous cargoes was not necessarily something in the goods themselves, but might well lie {{in the way they}} were packaged, looked after or transported. Accordingly, the responsibilities and liabilities of the various parties with regards to the carriage of dangerous cargoes are usually intertwined and complex. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the dangerous cargoes liabilities in English and Chinese law, by providing suggestions for existing problems in each country based on three sources: contract, tort and statute. Moreover, the chain of causation and concept of remoteness has particular importance in order to establish liability and decide which type and what amount of damage is recoverable. This thesis compares both countries’ liability regimes and how to secure compensation for its victims, and the restoration of the environment, with reference to the EU Environmental Liability Directive and relevant international conventions.

50|$|Each {{theory of}} {{liability}} has certain conditions, or elements, {{that must be}} proven by the claimant before liability will be established. For example, the theory of negligence requires the claimant to prove that (1) the defendant had a duty; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the defendant's breach caused the injury; and (4) that injury resulted in <b>recoverable</b> <b>damages.</b> Theories of liability can also be created by legislation. For example, under English law, {{with the passing of}} the Theft Act 1978, it is an offense to evade a liability dishonestly. Payment of damages usually resolves the liability. A given liability may be covered by insurance. In general, however, insurance providers only cover liabilities arising from negligent torts rather than intentional wrongs or breach of contract.|$|R

40|$|According to {{a recent}} {{sequence}} of judgments by the Italian ‘Corte di Cassazione’, “non-material damage” must be interpreted as also encompassing the mental distress caused by injury, inasmuch as this kind of loss {{could be seen as}} a violation of human dignity, which is a legal interest protected by both art. 2 of the Italian Constitution and art. 1 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

In particular, the Author looks at two main issues: 1) the boundaries, if any, fixed by EU legislation – as interpreted by the EU Court of Justice – on the recovery of “nonmaterial damage”; 2) the refusal to countenance – as far as regards negligence – grief, sorrow, anxiety, distress or any other normal emotion as <b>recoverable</b> <b>damages</b> in the two main European Projects regarding tortious liability, namely the Principles of European Tort Law and the Principles of European Law - Non-contractual liability arising out of damage caused to another...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{its search}} for a {{universal}} oil spill liability and compensation regime, the maritime community continues to face the dichotomy between the US approach and that adopted {{by the rest of}} the world.

In the long term, however, it would be desirable to establish a unified international regime which would enable all actors to direct their energies toward handling oil spills rather than grappling with unilateral legislation in individual jurisdictions of the world.

5000|$|Factual {{causation}} {{is established}} {{by means of}} the [...] "but-for" [...] (or conditio sine qua non) test. The test for legal causation asks whether the causal connection between the breach and the loss is sufficiently close to justify the imposition of liability.

5000|$|In {{some cases}} {{corporate}} boards attempted to establish [...] "independent litigation committees" [...] {{to evaluate whether}} a shareholder's demand to bring a suit was justified. This strategy was used to pre-empt criticism that the board was conflicted. The directors would appoint {{the members of the}} [...] "independent committee", which would then typically deliberate and {{come to the conclusion that}} there was no good cause for bringing litigation. In Zapata Corp v Maldonado the Delaware Supreme Court held that if the committee acted in good faith and showed reasonable grounds for its conclusion, and the court could be [...] "satisfied about other reasons relating to the process", the committee's decision to not allow a claim could not be overturned. Applying Connecticut law, the Second Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held in Joy v North that the court could substitute its judgment for the decisions of a supposedly independent committee, and the board, on the ground that there was scope for conflicting interests. Then, the substantive merits for bringing the derivative claim would be assessed. Winter J held overall that shareholders would have the burden [...] "to demonstrate that the action is more likely than not to be against the interests of the corporation". This would entail a cost benefit analysis. On the benefit side would be [...] "the likely <b>recoverable</b> <b>damages</b> discounted by the probability of a finding of liability", and the costs side would include [...] "attorney's fees and other out-of-pocket expenses", [...] "time spent by corporate personnel", [...] "the impact of distraction of key personnel", and potential lost profits which may result from the publicity of a trial." [...] If it is thought that the costs exceed the benefits, then the shareholders acquire the right to sue on the corporation's behalf. A substantive hearing on the merits about the alleged breach of director's duty may be heard. The tendency in Delaware, however, has remained to allow the board to play a role in restricting litigation, and therefore minimize the chances that it could be held accountable for basic breaches of duty.|$|R
40|$|Both U. S. and English courts has {{confronted with}} the {{concurrent}} situations mostly occurring in the cases where 1) the plaintiff asks for the recovery in tort claim despite the existence of contractual relationship or 2) the plaintiff asserts contract claim but the defendant contends that the issue at bar should be sound in tort rather than in contract. After studying all relevant cases and academic writings, this thesis found that both U. S. and English systems generally recognize concurrent tort claim as an elective right. The courts have attempted to provide the justified rationales either to allow the plaintiffs tort claim or to apply tort rules according to the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s defense. All rationales given is definitely aimed at significant aspects including the protection of parties 2 ̆ 7 expectation, the creation of justice, and the reinforcement of public policy. However, there are also the restrictions on the permissive rule of concurrent claim. The critical limitations on the rights to tort claim are as follows: Firstly, because both U. S. and English courts generally recognized that the recovery for economic loss is limited only in contract claim, plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 rights to tort claim for pure economic loss is limited. U. S. law recognized plaintiffs tort claim for economic loss only {{in the cases of}} professional negligence and of bad faith breach of contract. However, some courts are attempting to develop and apply the independent duty doctrine to permit more tort claims of negligence especially for economic loss. Furthermore, tort liability for bad faith breach of contract is mainly limited only in the relationship in insurance contract. To prevent an opportunistic breach of contract, this thesis suggests that the concept of bad faith breach should not be limited only in an insurance contract. Similarly, English law invokes the principle of assumption of responsibility that requires the special relationship between the parties in order to grant the award to the plaintiff who assert concurrent claim of negligence for economic loss. Secondly, it is clear that under English law, the tortious duty of care can be excluded or limited by the exculpatory clause or contractual term of liquidated damages. While English courts refuse to impose the duty of care, which is inconsistent with what the parties have agreed in their contract, it is not apparent that U. S. courts entirely refuse to impose tortious duty of care, which is inconsistent with what the parties have voluntarily agreed in their contract. As to this approach of English system, this thesis suggests that it would be fair, just and reasonable if U. S. courts apparently adopt and apply this kind of limitation to restrict concurrent tort claim in U. S. jurisdictions in order to sustain the freedom of contract doctrine which has the dominant aim to protect the contracting parties 2 ̆ 7 bargain of interest in allocation of their particular risk in the particular way so far as their interest is not outweighed by the mandatory law or public policy. Thirdly, it is suggested by scholars 2 ̆ 7 views that the doctrine of efficient breach recognized in U. S. contract law should be taken into account in limiting the imposition of tort liability on the breaching party particularly in commercial transaction if breaching party can prove that nonperformance is economically efficient. This thesis agrees with this suggestion because this would neither lead to the destruction of well-established concept of efficient breach nor bring about the unreasonable consequences that cause harm to the public economic interest. Lastly, some English courts is inclined to limit the scope of <b>recoverable</b> <b>damages</b> in concurrent tort claim by applying the similar test of remoteness of the breach of contract claim to the tort claim. This restrictive approach aims at the protection of the parties 2 ̆ 7 expectation interest rather than deterrence the wrongful conduct. As for such reason, this thesis suggests that the limitation on the scope of <b>recoverable</b> <b>damages</b> is justifiable only in the case where the tortious duty being imposed by virtue of a contract rather than being imposed by the virtue of provision under a statute or existing independently of contractual terms...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the dispute}} {{resolution}} literature, {{one advantage of}} arbitration over litigation is that arbitration enables the parties to customize their dispute resolution procedures. For example, parties can choose the qualifications of the arbitrator(s), the governing procedural rules, the limitation period, <b>recoverable</b> <b>damages,</b> rules for discovery and the presentation of evidence and witnesses, and the specificity of required arbitrator findings. While other scholars have questioned whether parties to arbitration agreements frequently {{take advantage of this}} customization, there is little solid empirical information about the topic. In this article, we study the arbitration clauses found in a random sample of 910 CEO employment contracts entered into during the time period 1995 to 2005 to determine how much customization actually takes place. We find {{only a small number of}} instances where fine-grained customization has occurred. Parties pay very little attention to customizing arbitral proceedings in these employment contracts, although there is a significant increase in the practice over time. We find this result surprising given that CEO contracts are heavily negotiated documents. Unexpectedly, we find that about half of the arbitration clauses in our contracts carve out a subset of potential claims or types of relief by reserving a right for the parties to seek such relief or file such claims in court. This phenomenon of customizing the circumstances under which parties will use arbitration has received almost no attention in the academic literature to date. In particular, we find that the types of claims carved out for court resolution are those involving firm efforts to protect the value of its information, reputation, and innovation. CEOs and companies in the information technology business are not significantly more likely to carve out such claims, and the use of these carveouts is increasing over time, suggesting that such carveouts are increasingly valuable to all firms. Unfortunately, California court regulation of arbitration clauses in employment contracts has significantly dampened the use of carveouts in contracts between CEO’s and their firms located in California. Our data suggests that court efforts to protect employees by scrutinizing the specific carveouts we observe is both unnecessary and destructive...|$|R
