40|$|Multiple {{quantum well}} lasers {{based on the}} III-V {{compound}} semiconductor indium phosphide were studied in this thesis. Systematic investigations were carried out {{on the effects of}} quantisation and strain on the temperature sensitivity of threshold current, modulation properties, external cavity operation and the 'gain lever' effect. Trends in the temperature sensitivity of threshold current for lasers of various lengths and quantum well numbers can be understood in terms of the nonlinear gain-current density relation. However, compared to bulk active region devices there was no significant improvement. It is unclear at present whether {{this is due to the}} temperature sensitivity of optical gain or Auger <b>recombination.</b> Relative intensity <b>noise</b> measurements were used to compare the modulation properties of lattice-matched and strained MQW lasers. This method gives an estimate of the differential gain and was used to study the properties of devices which were unsuitable for high speed applications. These measurements showed that gain saturation and carrier transport effects may be significant in certain laser structures. Band-filling effects due to the reduced volume and modified density of states were utilised in the demonstration of a grating external cavity laser operating across the 1. 3 mum optical fibre window. This configuration results in single-mode operation across the gain spectrum of the laser. High output power was exhibited across a wide tuning range. The 'gain lever' effect uses the nonlinear gain-current density relation to enhance the amplitude modulation efficiency and the signal-to-noise-ratio. MQW and bulk devices of different length and split ratio were compared. It was seen experimentally and numerically that the nonlinearity causing this effect also increases the distortion. Finally, it is discussed that further modifications to laser properties may be seen in active regions incorporating quantum wires and boxes...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of AlGaAs/GaAs and GaInP/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) of similar geometry is presented. First-order measurements show {{the importance of}} recombination currents in AlGaAs/GaAs transistors. Passivation improves the d. c. performance of GaInP/GaAs devices only. Low-frequency noise measurements are then performed. Spectra show 1 /f noise and g - r components. White noise is never reached. An analysis of each excess noise component is performed versus bias current. The 1 /f noise level and bias dependence is quite similar in all transistors. Generation - <b>recombination</b> <b>noise</b> component levels are more important in AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs. This is attributed to characteristic traps.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research into}} the modelling of residual 1 / f phase noise for Si bipolar amplifiers operating in the linear region and the design construction and measurements of L-Band (1. 2 GHz) and C-Band (4. 2 GHz and 4. 6 GHz) ceramic dielectric resonator based ultra low phase noise oscillators using Si devices. It proposed and demonstrated that for Si bipolar amplifiers the 1 / f phase noise {{is largely due to}} the base emitter <b>recombination</b> flicker <b>noise.</b> The up conversion mechanism is described through linear approximation of the phase variation of the amplifier phase response by the variation of the device parameters (Cbc, Cbe, gm, re) caused by the recombination 1 / f noise. The amplifier phase response describes the device over the whole frequency range of operation where the influence of the poles and zeros is investigated. It is found that for a common emitter amplifier it is sufficient to only incorporate the effect of the device poles to describe the phase noise behaviour over most of its operational frequency range. Simulations predict the measurements of others including the flattening of the PM noise at frequencies beyond f 3 dB, not predicted by previous models. A novel ceramic dielectric resonator based oscillator at 1. 2 GHz is described. The oscillator achieves phase noise of - 171. 8 d. Bc] Hz at 10 kHz offset and ~ 144. 5 d. Bc] H z at 1 kHz which is the lowest noise reported in the literature at this frequency band. To achieve these results extensive optimisation of amplifiers has been taken place. For example the amplifiers used in the oscillator produce a very low phase noise better than - 182 dBc / Hz at 10 kHz and - 175 dBc / Hz at 1 kHz offset from the carrier respectively. Also low residual phase noise narrow band tuning and high power handling phase shifters are reported for the use in oscilIator. Two oscillators at C-Band (4. 2 GHz and 4. 6 GHz) based on ceramic resonators are described. The 4. 2 GHz Oscillator provides a phase noise of - 153 dBc/ Hz at 10 kHz and - 128 dBc/ Hz at 1 kHz offset from the carrier, which is the lowest reported in literature for that type of oscillators. The 4. 6 GHz oscillator phase noise is - 149 d. Bc/Hz at 10 kHz and - 119. 2 d. Bc/Hz at 1 kHz offsets respectively. Both oscillators used the same configuration and the same amplification devices and topology. The improved performance is mainly due to the use of low residual phase noise silicon bipolar amplifiers operated in a push pull configuration, where in literature amplifiers employing SiGe HBTs have been used.

40|$|Thermal noise calculations, {{based on}} the Langevin procedure, are given for a double {{injection}} diode operating in the insulator regime. The frequency range is restricted to frequencies smaller than the reciprocal free carrier transit times. It turns out that at high frequencies the spectral density of the ac short circuit current fluctuations can be described by Nyquist's formula. At low frequencies an additional term, proportional to (1 +ω 2 τ 2) − 1 was found, where τ is the hole life time. The low frequency thermal noise level may be some orders of magnitude larger than the level at high frequencies. It is shown that in general the frequency dependent term will be masked by generation <b>recombination</b> <b>noise.</b> A special case is indicated where those contributions become comparable...|$|E

The basic principle of this measuring method is introduced in this paper. In order to avoid low frequency noise (such as generation <b>recombination</b> <b>noise</b> and 1 /f noise), we choose to modulate the light source {{so that we can}} analyze the useful information in a high frequency domain. By using the data acquisition system (based on DSP and FPGA) to gather multiplex data, we can realize data-transmitting with network in a high speed.

40|$|GaAs layers {{were grown}} by MBE. The layers were then damaged by 3 MeV proton {{irradiation}} and later annealed. We performed Hall effect and low-frequency noise measurements at temperatures between 77 K and 300 K after each step. Several generation - <b>recombination</b> <b>noise</b> components created by proton irradiation disappeared completely after the annealing. The 1 /f noise created by proton irradiation did {{not depend on}} the measurement temperature. It could be reduced systematically by annealing at temperatures in the range of 543 - 563 K. In an isochronal annealing procedure, annealing at different temperature for a constant length of time, we found annealing effects on the free charge carrier concentration but not on the 1 /f noise. 1 /f noise is a fluctuation in mobility originating from clusters of defects. The annealing of damaged GaAs characterizes these noise generating defects by an activation energy of 1 eV...|$|E
40|$|Schottky {{contacts}} on n-type GaAs with embedded InAs {{quantum dots}} (QDs) were studied by current-voltage (I-V) and low-frequency noise measurements. For comparison, diodes not containing QDs were investigated as reference devices. A wide {{distribution of the}} ideality factor was observed, correlated {{with the level of}} the leakage current. Reverse I-V characteristics on the logarithmic scale indicate that the space-charge limited current dominates the carrier transport in these diodes. In all diodes, the reverse current noise spectra show 1 /f behaviour, attributed to traps uniformly distributed in energy within the band-gap of the GaAs capping layer. Depth profiling measurements of the 1 /f noise power spectral density demonstrate the impact of the QDs on these traps.

40|$|We present {{noise current}} {{measurements}} {{on a specific}} elms of quanturn well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs). The design of the detectors implies a carrier mean free path of exactly one period of the superlattices with N = 20 periods. This leads to a deterministic carrier capture process, resulting in the lack of <b>recombination</b> <b>noise.</b> The noise current {{in this type of}} detector is given by I(noise) =(root of 4 e/gn- 1 /(2 N)) I(dark) delta f) with the electron charge e, the noise gain gn, = 1 /(Npc) (where pc is the carrier capture probability), the dark current I(dark) and the measurement bandwidth delta f. For pc = 1 this expression reduces to the shot noise expression for N series-connected photo junctions. From the design of the structures we expect a noise gain of gn = 1 /N = 0. 05 at sufficiently small bias voltages, which is confirmed by the measurements in combination with the appropriate noise model. With this new detector, we achieve detectivities comparable to the detectivities of conventio nal QWIPs at ten times smaller currents...|$|E
40|$|System {{properties}} of {{focal plane array}} (FPA) cameras based on GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) operating in the long-wavelength infrared are analyzed. Due to the limited charge storage capacity of available readout circuits, a small photoconductive gain improves the noise-equivalent temperature difference (NE delta T) of the sensor. We have demonstrated several camera systems based on conventional photoconductive QWIPs with NE delta T < 10 mK and NE delta T < 20 mK for FPAs with 256 x 256 and 640 x 512 pixels, respectively. A small photoconductive gain is obtained by operating the QWIP at very small electric fields (< 3 kV/cm). Finally, we discuss the possibility of reducing the NE delta T even further by using QWIP structures in which the photoexcited carrier mean free path {{is controlled by the}} incorporation of additional epitaxial layers. We thus obtain a high detectivity at very small signal and noise currents, which is useful in particular for large arrays with reduced pixel sizes. In addition, these detectors are shot-noise limited since the <b>recombination</b> <b>noise</b> is suppressed. The performance of FPA sensors based on these detectors will be addressed...|$|E
40|$|The Missile Defense Agency’s Advanced Technology Office is {{developing}} advanced passive electro-optical and infrared sensors for future space-based seekers by exploring new infrared detector materials. A Type II strained layer superlattice, {{one of the}} materials under development, has shown great potential for space applications. Theoretical results indicate that strained layer superlattice has the promise to be superior to current infrared sensor materials, such as HgCdTe, quantum well infrared photodetectors, and Si:As. Strained layer superlattice-based infrared detector materials combine the advantages of HgCdTe and quantum well infrared photodetectors. The bandgap of strained layer superlattice can be tuned for strong broadband absorption throughout the short-, mid-, long-, and very long wavelength infrared bands. The electronic band structure can be engineered to suppress Auger <b>recombination</b> <b>noise</b> and reduce the tunneling current. The device structures can be easily stacked for multicolor focal plane arrays. The III–V semiconductor fabrication offers the potential of producing low-defect-density, large-format focal plane arrays with high uniformity and high operability.

40|$|Many {{applications}} in cosmology and astrophysics at millimeter wavelengths — CMB polarization, studies of galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, studies {{of star formation}} at high redshift and in our local universe and our galaxy— require large-format arrays of millimeter-wave detectors. Feedhorn, lens-coupled twinslot antenna, and phased-array antenna architectures for receiving mm-wave light present numerous advantages for control of systematics and for simultaneous coverage of both polarizations and/or multiple spectral bands. Simultaneously, kinetic inductance detectors using high-resistivity materials like titanium nitride are an attractive sensor option for large-format arrays because they are highly multiplexable and because their high responsivity can render two-level-system noise subdominant to photon and <b>recombination</b> <b>noise.</b> However, coupling the two is a challenge because of the impedance mismatch between the microstrip exiting these architectures and the high resistivity of titanium nitride. Mitigating direct absorption in the KID is also a challenge. We present a detailed titanium nitride KID design that addresses these challenges. The KID inductor is capacitively coupled to the microstrip {{in such a way}} as to form a lossy termination without creating an impedance mismatch. A parallelplate capacitor design mitigates direct absorption, uses hydrogenated amorphous silicon, and yields acceptable two-level-system noise. We show that an optimized design can yield expected sensitivities very close to the fundamental limit from photon and recombination noises for two relevant examples: single spectral band designs appropriate for 90 and 150 GHz for CMB polarization and a multi-spectral-band design that covers 90 GHz to 405 GHz in six bands for SZ effect studies...|$|E
40|$|Having been {{inspired}} by the tremendous progress in material nanoscience and device nanoengineering, hybrid phototransistors combine solution processed colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with graphene or two-dimensional (2 D) semiconductor materials. Novel detectors demonstrate ultrahigh photoconductive gain, high and selective photoresponse, low noise, and very high responsivity in visible- and near-infrared ranges. The outstanding performance of phototransistors is primarily due to the strong, selective, and size tunable absorption of QDs and fast charge transfer in 2 D high mobility conductors. However, the relatively small mobility of QD nanomaterials was a technological barrier, which limited the operating rate of devices. Very recent innovations in detector design and significant progress in QD ligand engineering provide effective tools for further qualitative improvements. This article reviews the recent progress in material science, nanophysics, and device engineering related to hybrid phototransistors. Detectors based on various QD nanomaterials and several 2 D conductors are compared, and {{advantages and disadvantages of}} various nanomaterials for applications in hybrid phototransistors are identified. We also benchmark the experimental characteristics with model results that establish interrelations and tradeoffs between detector characteristics, such as responsivity, dark and noise currents, the photocarrier lifetime, response, and noise bandwidths. We have shown that the most recent phototransistors demonstrate performance limited by the fundamental generation <b>recombination</b> <b>noise</b> in high gain devices. Interrelation between the dynamic range of the detector and the detector sensitivity is discussed.

40|$|Low noise {{devices are}} {{required}} whenever dealing with low signal power detection. The junction {{field effect transistor}} is probably the simplest structure that fulfills the low noise requirement, providing also a high impedance input and good performance in a frequency range that goes from few Hz to some MHz. Notably, JFETs are less affected by low frequency noise than MOSFETs, and, thus, represent an appropriate option for low frequency low noise applications. Apart from theoretical approach to the low noise features of JFETs, there can be process, or design, options which can enhance or reduce the onset of excess noise. An experimental study on general purpose designed JFET has been set up: five different process option, among whose a brand new technique to realize ultra shallow, highly doped top gate layers, have been investigated in search of evidences of links between either layout or process designs and noise performance. The devices have been fully described in their fabrication features, layout, DC performance and low frequency noise behaviour. The geometrical factor turned out to be substantially effective only when modulating the conductive section area of the channel along its length. Shorter anneal have been proved to be not detrimental, since no generation and <b>recombination</b> <b>noise</b> has been found neither in devices with long, nor in those with shorter anneal. Evidences have been found that confirm the theories about a correlation between current flowing and 1 /f noise intensity. Shallow gate devices, in conditions of substantial identity of other features, proved to represent neither an improvement nor a worsening in noise performance, while ultra shallow gate devices, fabricated with the new deposition technique, turned out to be much more noisy. A worse contact between boron layer and metal has been assumed to play a strong role in this phenomenon, having excluded superficial state influence. What the real causes of this noise enhancement are has to be further investigated...|$|E
