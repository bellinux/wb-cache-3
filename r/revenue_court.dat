However, in their 2000 report on the detention conditions in French prisons, Jean-Jacques Hyest and Guy-Pierre Cabanel were concerned to see that these canteens generate strong inequalities between inmates, introducing power relations and promoting the development of racketeering. The rich inmate [...] "will establish dominance over the poorer, which depends on him to get a cigarette, a stamp or a television."Furthermore, in its report of January 2006 the <b>Revenue</b> <b>Court</b> was concerned about the lack of regulations there where in the organization of canteens, and alarmed by the cost of living in prisons.

50|$|Mary's {{dream of}} a new, Catholic Hapsburg line was finished, and her {{popularity}} further declined when she lost the last English area on French soil, Calais, to Francis, Duke of Guise, on 7 January 1558. Mary's reign, however, introduced a new coining system {{that would be used}} until the 18th century, and her marriage to Philip II created new trade routes for England. Mary's government took a number of steps towards reversing the inflation, budgetary deficits, poverty, and trade crisis of her kingdom. She explored the commercial potential of Russian, African, and Baltic markets, revised the customs system, worked to counter the currency debasements of her predecessors, amalgamated several <b>revenue</b> <b>courts,</b> and strengthened the governing authority of the middling and larger towns. Mary also welcomed the first Russian ambassador to England, creating relations between England and Russia for the first time.
