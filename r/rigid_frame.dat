25|$|In some aircraft, {{the control}} {{surfaces}} are not manipulated with a linkage. In ultralight aircraft and motorized hang gliders, for example, {{there is no}} mechanism at all.

40|$|In buildings, {{in which}} <b>rigid</b> <b>frames</b> {{with and without}} walls are provided, both bending and {{shearing}} deformations of the slab between walled <b>rigid</b> <b>frames</b> will be caused on horizontal direction by lateral forces such as seismic forces if the distance between those frames is long. Therefore, <b>rigid</b> <b>frames</b> situated in middle part between two walled <b>rigid</b> <b>frames</b> sill deflect more than those near the ends, and, consequently, the lateral force carried by the former become larger. In the cases mentioned above, therefore, the conventional asssumption that the slab is perfectly rigid and the lateral force is distributed upon every frame {{in proportion to the}} rigidity of those frames can not be accepted in structural design...|$|R

40|$|The {{methods of}} {{analyzing}} <b>rigid</b> <b>frames</b> in present use {{are known to}} have many undesirable characteristics which are either directly or indirectly the result of limiting stress and strain to values below the proportional limit. In this investigation an analysis method is described and used that overcomes the weaknesses of the orthodox methods. The simple plastic theory is stated, explained, and used in the analysis of six <b>rigid</b> <b>frames.</b> The resulting failure loads are compared with the allowable loads of an orthodox method. Although much theoretical and experimental confirmation is required before the simple plastic theory is fully accepted, indications are that it is a very good method of approximating the failure load for <b>rigid</b> <b>frames...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1933 two {{entirely new}} {{locomotives}} were being planned: the R1 and the GG1 class. The R-1 had a <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> for its four driving axles, while the GG-1 had two frames which were articulated.

25|$|Typical school backpacks {{generally}} {{lack the}} <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> of an outdoor-style backpack and include {{only a few}} pockets in the front {{in addition to the}} main storage compartment.

25|$|The {{city street}} facade {{can provide a}} type of {{juxtaposed}} contradiction that is essentially two-dimensional. Frank Furness' Clearing House, now demolished {{like many of his}} best works in Philadelphia, contained an array of violent pressures within a <b>rigid</b> <b>frame.</b> The half-segmental arch, blocked by the submerged tower which, in turn, bisects the facade into a near duality, and the violent adjacencies of rectangles, squares, lunettes, and diagonals of contrasting sizes, compose a building seemingly held up by the buildings next door: it is an almost insane short story of a castle on a city street.|$|E
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of entire systems, this approach {{can be used in}} conjunction with statics, giving rise to the method of sections and method of joints for truss analysis, moment distribution method for small <b>rigid</b> <b>frames,</b> and portal frame and cantilever method for large <b>rigid</b> <b>frames.</b> Except for moment distribution, which came into use in the 1930s, these methods were developed in their current forms {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century.

25|$|With the {{issuance}} of his patent in 1836, Campbell worked with James Brooks to build the first 4-4-0 using his idea. Although it proved to develop 60 percent more tractive effort than the Standard Baldwin 4-2-0, it was not widely adopted. This was {{largely because of the}} <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> which did not allow for maintaining equal weight on the drivers and it was prone to derail. This problem was solved by Joseph Harrison, Jr., partner in the American steam locomotive manufacturing firm of Eastwick and Harrison with the development of the equalising beam. Campbell tried to sue Eastwick for patent infringement With no success.|$|E
25|$|A {{skid loader}} or {{skid steer loader}} is a small <b>rigid</b> <b>frame,</b> {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E

500|$|Following Anaximander, his pupil Anaximenes (c. 585‚Äì528/4) {{held that}} the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets are all made of fire. But whilst the stars are {{fastened}} on a revolving crystal sphere like nails or studs, the Sun, Moon, and planets, and also the Earth, all just ride on air like leaves because of their breadth. [...] And whilst the fixed stars are carried around in a complete circle by the stellar sphere, the Sun, Moon and planets do not revolve under the Earth between setting and rising again like the stars do, but rather on setting they go laterally around the Earth like a cap turning halfway around the head until they rise again. And unlike Anaximander, he relegated the fixed stars to the region most distant from the Earth. The most enduring feature of Anaximenes' cosmos was its conception of the stars being fixed on a crystal sphere as in a <b>rigid</b> <b>frame,</b> which became a fundamental principle of cosmology down to Copernicus and Kepler.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of these}} LNWR Cramptons, Liverpool, was {{particularly}} long, having a rigid wheelbase of [...] Although the locomotive was fast, {{and capable of}} working heavy trains for long distances, its long <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> caused damage to the track.|$|E
2500|$|Instead {{came the}} idea of having {{multiple}} groups of cylinders and driven wheels mounted in one <b>rigid</b> <b>frame.</b> A [...] "duplex" [...] version of a 4-8-4 would be a 4-4-4-4, with the eight driving wheels split into two groups of four, each with its own set of cylinders and valve gear. The reciprocating mass of both sets would be substantially less than the single set on the 4-8-4, since they would be under less stress and gentler piston thrusts. The cylinders could be smaller yet have larger, more efficient valves. The most obvious tradeoff was that in Baldwin's proposed design, the rigid wheelbase was longer since the second set of cylinders had to be between the two sets of drivers. This was sufficiently concerning for many roads, for whom current locomotives were taxing enough, to reject the duplex idea.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{knitting}} has three basic tasks: (1) the active (unsecured) stitches {{must be held}} so they don't drop; (2) these stitches must be released sometime after they are secured; and (3) new bights of yarn must be passed through the fabric, usually through active stitches, thus securing them. In very simple cases, knitting can be done without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, hand-knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles or <b>rigid</b> <b>frames.</b> Depending on their size and shape, the <b>rigid</b> <b>frames</b> are called knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting knobbies, knitting nancies, or corkers).

2500|$|A band mask is a {{heavy duty}} {{full-face}} mask {{with many of the}} characteristics of a lightweight demand helmet. In structure it is the front section of a lightweight helmet from above the faceplate to below the demand valve and exhaust ports, including the bailout block and communications connections on the sides. This <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> is attached to a neoprene hood by a metal clamping band, hence the name. It is provided with a padded sealing surface around the frame edge which is held firmly against the diver's face by a rubber [...] "spider", a multiple strap arrangement with a pad behind the diver's head, and usually five straps which hook onto pins on the band. The straps have several holes so the tension can be adjusted to get a comfortable seal. A band mask is heavier than other full face masks, but lighter than a helmet, and can be donned more quickly than a helmet. They are often used by the standby diver for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|The first really {{popular and}} commercially {{successful}} design was French. An example {{is at the}} Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa. Initially developed around 1863, it sparked a fashionable craze briefly during 1868-70. Its design was simpler than the Macmillan bicycle; it used rotary cranks and pedals mounted to the front wheel hub. Pedaling {{made it easier for}} riders to propel the machine at speed, but the rotational speed limitation of this design created stability and comfort concerns which would lead to the large front wheel of the [...] "penny farthing". It was difficult to pedal the wheel that was used for steering. The use of metal frames reduced the weight and provided sleeker, more elegant designs, and also allowed mass-production. [...] Different braking mechanisms were used depending on the manufacturer. In England, the velocipede earned the name of [...] "bone-shaker" [...] because of its <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> and iron-banded wheels that resulted in a [...] "bone-shaking experience for riders." ...|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{format of}} the hyphen {{originated}} with Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany, [...] {{with the publication of}} his 42-line Bible.

Library of Congress shows that Gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style, 42 equal lines per page. The Gutenberg printing press required words made up of individual letters of type to be held in place by a surrounding non-printing <b>rigid</b> <b>frame.</b> Gutenberg solved the problem of making each line the same length to fit the frame by inserting a hyphen as the last element at the right-side margin. This interrupted the letters in the last word, requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below. His hyphen appears throughout the Bible as a short, double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle.|$|E
