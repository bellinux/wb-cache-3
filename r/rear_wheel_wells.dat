25|$|Fender skirts {{are often}} made as {{extensions}} of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire wheel wells. Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the wheel well and assists in streamlining {{the body of the}} vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. Front fender skirts have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.|$|E
2500|$|The final B-body Caprice was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics and did not hold on to high sales numbers. The car's styling was criticized with car aficionados calling it a [...] "beached whale" [...] and [...] "an upside-down bathtub". For 1993 there were some revisions, the most obvious being {{the removal of the}} skirted <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> in favor of more conventional, open wheel wells. This applied only to the sedan model; station wagons retained the skirted wheel wells. A final appearance tweak appeared on the 1995 Caprice sedan {{in the form of a}} restyled side window between the back door and C pillar (windows on Caprices of the generation through 1994 were triangular, but the 1995 window had 4 sides and lacked the sharp corner pointed toward the rear), and the wagon was given the same mirrors as the sedan. In 1996 the Impala SS was exported to Middle Eastern markets badged as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel & the badge on the dashboard saying Caprice SS.|$|E
2500|$|A 1976 AMC Pacer Hatchback {{was used}} in the 1992 movie Wayne's World, and again in the 1993 movie Wayne's World 2. The Pacer used in both movies was painted bright blue with flame decals, with stock steel wheels and wheel covers in the front, and {{aftermarket}} chrome-plated steel wheels in the rear. It featured a two-tone light blue-and-beige vinyl interior, as well as a licorice dispenser mounted in place of the overhead light in the headliner. The car is used throughout both movies, however, the car is seen the most in the first Wayne's World movie in the introductory scene, where Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) inserts a cassette tape into the stereo of the Pacer, and Wayne, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), and his friends rock out and head bang to [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] by Queen. Modifications to the movie car included interior camera mounts, tow hooks welded to the front subframe, and the removal of the HVAC system. The <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> were modified to accommodate aftermarket speaker boxes, the aforementioned licorice dispenser was added, and an additional cup holder was added to the Pacer's dashboard. The car used an AMC 258 c.i. six-cylinder engine and an automatic transmission.|$|E

A few were also used as radio units.|$|R
50|$|When the 1991 models {{came the}} V6 was dropped & only 2 choices of V8 were offered which would remain until 1993. When the car lost its closed <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> design with all models this also {{affected}} the 9C1 too. The 1991-1992 4th generation Caprice wasn't {{popular due to}} the closed rear well design.|$|R

50|$|Fender skirts are {{implemented}} for both aesthetic and aerodynamic reasons. Rather than air flowing into and being {{trapped in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well,</b> it flows smoothly over the bodywork. They are generally detachable to allow for tire changes and installation of snow chains. Automakers have also experimented with front wheel fender skirts, as on the 1950-1954 Nash Rambler, but with success limited {{by the fact that}} the front wheels must pivot for steering, extending out from the side of the vehicle slightly. In GM parts accessories books, fender skirts are known as fender shields.|$|R

50|$|In {{terms of}} design {{much of the}} {{bodywork}} of the Viper GTS was retained on the race car. Mandatory elements such as a rear wing, rear diffuser, and front splitter were added for aerodynamics, while initial cars had their fog lights covered over before being put back for increased visibility at night. To aid in lighting, optional lights were able {{to be placed in}} square notches above the grill. The exhaust would also be routed out the side of the car, just under the doors, about halfway between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> Side exhausts had been a feature of the first generation American-market RT/10s, but were no longer used on the GTS. Vents were also added to the hood for cooling the engine, while intakes were placed on the roof and rear fenders.|$|E
50|$|The {{nose of the}} {{car would}} also be refined, with the NACA duct from the LMP-1 abandoned. Instead, two small {{porthole}} intakes would be used, allowing for the bodywork {{to be closer to}} the airbox and further lower the height of the bodywork. Brakes cooling was also redesigned, with two large vertical vents cut into the bodywork {{on either side of the}} nose, replacing the large gap below the nose that had been used on the LMP-1. At the sides of the car, the complex concave venting of the LMP-1 was simplified for the LMP07, with a large intake for the rear brake cooling being placed in nearly vertical bodywork, and a large square exit vent in front of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> for the engine.|$|R
50|$|The EXT {{could be}} {{identified}} by its much straighter rear doors (which were not in-line with the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> arches), as <b>well</b> as by the circular, metal cap {{on each of the}} quarter windows where the opening mechanism attaches, on the 2003 models only.|$|R
50|$|The KC-135Q variant was {{modified}} to carry JP-7 fuel {{necessary for the}} Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, segregating the JP-7 from the KC-135s own fuel supply (the body tanks carrying JP-7, and the wing tanks carrying JP-4 or JP-8). The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks. When the KC-135Q model received the CFM-56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body tanks from the wing tanks where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T {{is the presence of}} a clear window {{on the underside of the}} empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted. It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> so ground crews can fuel both the body tanks and wing tanks separately.|$|R
5000|$|For 1950, Cadillac showed all-new styling {{on every}} {{car in the}} lineup, {{including}} the $3,797 Sixty Special. While the opulent interior rivaled no other Cadillac, the exterior styling was nearly identical to the less-expensive Series 62 models. The chrome louver trim that was mounted on the rear roof panel since 1942 was now moved to the lower rear doors, just forward of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> Although Cadillac utilized a wheelbase 4 in longer than the Series 62, the 130 in wheelbase was down 3 in from the previous year. The 1950 Sixty Special's shipping weight was 4136 lb in base form (over 4300 lb curb weight), and was powered by the same engine introduced for 1949 - the 331 cuin L Cadillac OHV V8 producing [...] For {{the first time in}} their history, over 100,000 Cadillacs were sold this year, and 13,755 of them was the Sixty Special - a new record for that model.

The departments also uses several types of boats for lake patrol and motorcycles for traffic enforcement.In 2012, OCPD began transitioning to the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan and Ford Police Interceptor Utility for patrol officers. In appearance, the vehicles are all black. The word [...] "POLICE" [...] is printed in large white letters on the side doors, and [...] "We Serve With Pride" [...] appears above the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> The seal of the City of Oklahoma City appears on the front doors. An abbreviation denoting the division that the vehicle is assigned to appears on the rear trunk (HF-Hefner, SW-Southwest, SF-Santa Fe, SL-Springlake, BT-Bricktown, WRWA-Will Rogers World Airport, US-Uniform Support, BP-Bike Patrol, G-Gang Unit, T-Traffic). Also printed on the rear trunk area is the car number with the word [...] "POLICE" [...] in small white letters.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, the Arnage RL, a long-wheelbase model (250 mm {{longer than}} the Arnage), was launched. The extra length {{is added to the}} car at its rear doors and its C-pillar. With the {{standard}} Arnage model, the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> butt up against the rear door frames, but with the RL they are a few inches further back. The overall effect is a larger rear area inside the car. This style of saloon stretch is sometimes called [...] "double-cut" [...] in the United States, due to the two main points where the car is extended. (Jankel and Andy Hotton Associates, for example, are two aftermarket coachbuilders especially known for this style.) Available only as a bespoke ("Mulliner") model, each RL is customised to the desires of the buyer. The RL, however, was also the first of a new series of Arnages which would finally cure the Bentley Arnage of the reliability and performance deficiencies experienced following its forced deprivation of the modern BMW engines it was designed to use. The RL would also present a credible challenge to BMW's attempts to revive the Rolls-Royce brand with its planned new model, the Phantom.|$|E
5000|$|Sixty Special {{arrived with}} revised trim and more power ( [...] , to be exact) for 1955, {{and while the}} $4,342 price was lower than last year, {{production}} rose slightly to 18,300 units. The eight chrome louvers - mounted on the lower rear doors since 1950, were replaced by 12 louvers mounted {{just ahead of the}} bumper on the rear fenders. Chrome rocker panel moldings - taller than the ones used on Series 62s - stretched {{from the back of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> to the <b>rear</b> bumper. A new grille held a bold eggcrate design, while the rear roof support fashioned a delicate Florentine curve - this design was also shared with the lower-rung Series 62. In back, six vertical chrome louvers were mounted on the panel below the trunk lid - three spaced on each side of the license plate mounting. The tinted band across the windshield header changed from green to gray this year. A new option, the remote control trunk release, debuted this year.|$|R
50|$|The F28/6 in the Calibra was {{designed}} to follow a transverse oriented C20LET engine feeding the front wheels with an outlet to facilitate a driveshaft to feed the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> as <b>well.</b> If the four-wheel drive system is disengaged, the gearbox will feed only the front wheels. Conversion kits are readily available from aftermarket suppliers to convert the 6 speed transmission to suit a front-wheel drive vehicle, {{and this is not}} an uncommon upgrade (from the 5 speed F20 transmission) amongst owners of the C20XE and X20XEV Calibras.|$|R

5000|$|By 1955 a second, larger {{model was}} added to the Eshelman line, a basic six-horsepower open car for two {{passengers}} also named the [...] "Adult Sport Car". These ASCs were 64 in long, 36 in wide and 32 in in height and were powered by an air-cooled rope-started Briggs & Stratton #14 engine (electric starting was optional) that permitted a top speed of 30 mi/h km/h and a 70 mpg fuel consumption rate. Major ASC mechanical differences included 4.50x6 pneumatic tires with four-wheel cable-operated scrub brakes, a foot throttle, and a pedal-operated parking brake. Extra-cost options included a lawn sweeper ($39.95) and a hauling cart ($79.95). The Adult Sport Car was 40inches wide and was equipped with headlamps and taillamps powered by a separate battery that needed occasional charging, as there was no generator. The following year saw a minor restyling on both models including an opening hood, cut-down sides for easier entry and exit, and fully opened <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> A utility version of this car was offered for use on golf courses (and advertised as providing [...] "36 holes per gallon"). Also from 1956 the smaller models were powered by Briggs and Stratton aluminum-block engines; the Model 6B engine of 2.25 horsepower in the standard series and the Model 8B engine of 2.75 horsepower in the deluxe cars.|$|E

According to police reports, Rodriguez admitted to being near the Columbia Mall the night Sjodin disappeared, allegedly viewing the film Once Upon a Time in Mexico at the Columbia Mall Cinema 4. However, that movie was not playing at that theatre or any other theater in the area. The police also found receipts of purchases Rodriguez had made at stores near the mall. Rodriguez apparently had two tool kit knives that could be purchased at only a particular home center store which was about one mile from the mall, {{but they were not}} purchased the day Sjodin disappeared and a purchase date for the knives was never established. Police also found a tool kit knife in Rodriguez's car that was soaking in some type of cleaning solution inside a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> Rodriguez had been released from jail in May 2003 after completing a 23-year prison term for stabbing and trying to kidnap a woman.
