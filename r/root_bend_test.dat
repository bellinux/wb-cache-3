40|$|The three {{boiling water}} {{reactors}} (BWR) in Oskarshamn produce about 10 % of the electrical power in Sweden. The combination of intense radiation fluxes and high temperatures in nuclear reactors creates an extraordinary environment. Therefore, {{a number of}} material challenges arise at {{a nuclear power plant}} that needs to be solved {{in order to maintain the}} nuclear power production, safety and reliability. Dissimilar metal welds can be found at a lot of places in nuclear power plants and due to reparations or replacement some dissimilar metal welds need to be welded on site. The technical regulations for the Swedish nuclear power plants specifies that welding of dissimilar joints shall be made with gap of at least 1. 5 mm and in horizontal position. Welding a dissimilar joint on site makes it difficult to follow the technical regulations, therefore, the aim with this study is to determine if different welding positions of dissimilar metal welds affect the structure and composition of the weld metal in a negative way and to investigate the importance of a gap in the root. In this study six samples were welded in three different welding positions, horizontal, vertical and reversed vertical with or without a gap of 1. 5 mm in the root. The samples were evaluated by non-destructive testing, optical microscopy, chemical analysis, tensile testing, bend testing and hardness measurements. The results shows that two of the samples welded without gap failed the transverse <b>root</b> <b>bend</b> <b>test,</b> the same samples did also have high hardness values in the root bead. The conclusions are that the welding position, horizontal, vertical or reversed vertical does not affect the weld negative in a noticeable way. However, the gap and a good dilution with the filler metal are important...|$|E

Qualification was to be performed using both 1 G (flat) and 3 G (vertical) positions for Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) and Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) processes. Required qualification procedures included two face and two <b>root</b> <b>bend</b> <b>tests</b> coupled with a visual inspection for cracks within the weld region greater than ⅛” long, along with two reduced section tensile tests to ensure the tensile strength exceeded 58 ksi if the sample broke within the weld region or 55. 1 ksi if the sample broke outside of the weld region. Tests were standardized by using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. Cracks greater than 1 / 8 ” {{were found in the}} weld region of <b>bend</b> <b>tested</b> samples in each process except for the 3 G GTAW, disqualifying them. The failed samples were broken open at the crack and examined using optical microscopy in conjunction with polarized light as well as stereo microscopy to determine the inclusion and porosity content of the base and weld metal. The microscopic examination revealed a high degree of porosity and a lack of fusion in a 1 G GTAW root bent sample as indicated by the presence of back gouging marks found in the areas of the weld having lack of fusion. This was the result of improper back gouging procedures. Microscopic examinations of GMAW fracture surfaces showed signs of heavy oxidation and inclusion content within the weld metal as well as a lack of fusion between the weld passes. Both 3 G GTAW samples passed tensile tests with tensile strengths greater than 64 ksi, and the 3 G GTAW process was therefore qualified...|$|R
40|$|National audienceA better {{understanding}} of root-soil mechanical interaction is necessary for investigating the capability of structural roots to provide an efficient anchorage of root or to participate to soil against landslides and soil erosion. This paper aims in analysing the contribution of different root elements and soil types to root anchorage. For this purpose, a 2 D finite element model of root anchorage has been built up and applied to twelve different herringbone-like root patterns. These root patterns have been defined variying the angle between lateral root and main root, and removing different <b>root</b> parts. <b>Bending</b> <b>tests</b> has been performed in both clay and sandy soil.

40|$|The {{research}} of the load distributions and bending stresses with helix deviations in power transmission systems is important for effectively improving gear load capacity. The equations of tooth surface with helix slope and form deviation were established by the given forming rack-cutter tool and the path for processing rack-cutter tool. And various kinds of engaged helical gear models with helix slope and form deviation were developed using finite element method software. Finally, tooth surface load distribution and tooth <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> stress were numerically calculated. The effects of the helix slope deviation, different shape, period, and amplitude of helix form deviation on tooth surface load distribution and tooth <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> stress were investigated {{and the results were}} compared to each other as specified by grades 5 and 7. It is found that the single helix slope deviation on tooth surface load distribution and tooth <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> stress shows “superposition” effect. Especially, the different shapes, periods, and amplitudes of helix form deviation exhibit significant effect on tooth surface load distribution and tooth <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> stress. Helix form deviation mainly affects the tooth surface load distribution and tooth <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> stress along the tooth longitudinal direction, while has little impact between tooth pairs. The study benefits gear load capacity analysis and provides valuable guidelines for improving the performance of power transmission systems...|$|R

Young's modulus, the proportional limit stress, and the bending strength were obtained from the load-loading point displacement and load-strains at the outer surfaces until the occurrence of bending failure. Four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> were also conducted, and the bending properties obtained were compared with the corresponding properties obtained by the compression <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on the experimental results, we believe that when the stress-strain relation is measured by the load-loading point displacement relation using specimens whose length/thickness ratio is large enough, the bending properties can be obtained properly using the compression <b>bending</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R

40|$|Gravitropism is {{required}} for the appropriate alignment of the plant root and shoot. According to the Cholodny-Went hypothesis, gravity induces asymmetric accumulation of auxin in the lower side of the root tissue. More recent studies on root gravitropism have also shown asymmetric accumulation of nitric oxide (NO) in response to gravity, and suggested the involvement of ethylene and NO signalling as well as auxin. Hence, this project aimed to investigate how NO, auxin and ethylene signalling interact in root growth, development and gravitropism. Arabidopsis mutants with defects in these hormonal signals were used in gravistimulation experiments. As expected, Col- 0 (WT) plants displayed <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> 2 h after gravistimulation, but auxin mutants (aux 1, axr 2 and axr 3) did not exhibit any <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> in response to gravistimulation. Roots of ethylene mutants showed reduced <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> compared to WT. Nitrate reductase mutants nia 1 and nia 2 also revealed reduced <b>root</b> <b>bending,</b> and nia 1 showed slower bending than nia 2. Exogenous application of the auxin NAA and the NO donor SNAP increased gravitropic bending. The application of the ethylene precursor ACC reduced <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> in the presence of NO, but increased bending in the absence of NO. The localization of NO in response to gravitropism was investigated using confocal microscopy. Gravitropism induced asymmetric accumulation of NO in WT in the lower side of the <b>bending</b> zone of <b>roots,</b> whereas auxin mutants aux 1 and axr 2 localised NO ubiquitously in the root. NIA 1 (nitrate reductase 1) transcript levels in WT root tips were measured using qPCR. The NIA 1 transcript starts to accumulate after gravistimulation, reaching a two fold higher level after 2 h, before gradually subsiding. The findings suggested that functional auxin signalling is a prerequisite for NO signalling, and that NIA 1 mediated NO induces the <b>root</b> <b>bending.</b> To ascertain the sub-cellular localization of NIA 1 in response to gravity and other hormonal interactions, NIA 1 transcriptional and translational mGFP 4 reporter constructs were made and transformed into the WT and auxin, ethylene and NR mutant plants. Integration of the reporter construct in the plant genome was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Initial confocal experiments showed the successful expression of NIA 1 -driven mGFP 4 fluorescence in roots and stomatal guard cells. Further experiments with these transgenic lines will be needed to examine the role of NO in gravitropism and cross-talk with other phytohormones...|$|R

The rotating <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement. The stress at incipient crack growth gives a point in the fatigue limit (Kitagawa-Takahashi) diagram.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are large}} complex dynamically flexible structures that must operate un-der very turbulent and unpredictable environmental conditions where {{the efficiency and}} reliability are highly dependent upon a well designed control strategy. At maximum energy capture capacity (operating region III) several popular control strategies are being investi-gated to help alleviate loads to prevent damage to the machinery. These include; individual pitch control, collective pitch control, and trailing-edge devices that change the effective camber of the airfoil. In this study the authors investigate the optimal deployment of one type of trailing-edge device, the micro-tabs, in conjunction with collective and individual pitch control to provide effective load alleviation for the NREL Controls Advanced Re-search Turbine (CART) in Colorado. The performance index maintains maximum power output while minimizing <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> moment during “actual simulated ” turbulent wind conditions. The goal {{is to determine the}} micro-tab deployment profiles that keep blade <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> moments {{as close as possible to}} steady-state wind conditions during operation in a turbulent regime.

The results demonstrate up to a potential 70 % theoretical upper-bound reduction in <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> moments, for the cases investi-gated.
