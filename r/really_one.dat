5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was <b>really</b> <b>one</b> of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E

The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

500|$|Stirring Science Stories was {{presented}} by Wollheim {{as if it}} were two separate magazines bound together; {{the first half of the}} magazine was titled [...] "Stirring Science-Fiction", and the second half [...] "Stirring Fantasy-Fiction".

[...] Wollheim described his approach in the first issue, saying [...] "Stirring Science Stories isn't <b>really</b> <b>one</b> magazine but two.

500|$|The book {{explores the}} themes of exile, survival, heroism, leadership, {{political}} responsibility, and the [...] "making of a hero and a community". Joan Bridgman's analysis of Adams's works in The Contemporary Review identifies the community and hero motifs: [...] "he hero's journey into a realm of terrors to bring back some boon to save himself and his people" [...] is a powerful element in Adams's tale. This theme derives from the author's exposure to the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his study of comparative mythology, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), and in particular, Campbell's [...] "monomyth" [...] theory, also based on Carl Jung's view of the unconscious mind, that [...] "all the stories {{in the world are}} <b>really</b> <b>one</b> story." ...|$|E
500|$|Although some reviewers, {{including}} Yahr and TVLine Michael Slezak, were unenthusiastic about Blaine's {{visit to}} Burt {{to get him}} to have [...] "the talk" [...] with Kurt, there was widespread praise for the talk itself, which Jen Harper of BuddyTV described as the [...] "best scene" [...] of the episode. Fallon called it [...] "one of the most uncomfortable father–son sex talks ever committed to television (and thus, <b>really,</b> <b>one</b> of the most realistic)", and his colleague Brown said it became [...] "something lovely, open-hearted, and true". Gonzalez deemed it awkward to watch, yet wrote that the scene served to convince her she had [...] "never loved a father-son pair" [...] more. Poniewozik found it realistic and moving, and gave particular praise to O'Malley for portraying Burt's [...] "determination and awkwardness in helping his son", as did Slezak: [...] "his completely grounded performance helps anchor the show in reality".|$|E
500|$|... "Over There" [...] {{was written}} by Academy Award-winning screenwriter and {{frequent}} Fringe collaborator Akiva Goldsman, together with showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman. Goldsman directed the episodes, his first such credit since the season premiere. He explained the finale in a January 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly: [...] "We're {{trying to do the}} last two episodes as a singular event, a little bit more movie-like. It's <b>really</b> <b>one</b> big story. We're approaching it like a mini-feature. It'll have a singular narrative drive." [...] They originally intended for the two parts to air on the same night, but Fox told them it would be shown on two nights, a week apart. The episodes first aired in the United States on May 13 and May 20, 2010. The writers, finding the script to be easily divisible, ended the first episode with William Bell and Olivia meeting outside Fauxlivia's apartment, and began the second with Bell helping Walter escape from the hospital.|$|E

500|$|The {{crux of the}} issue, Bonds asserts, [...] "was never <b>really</b> <b>one</b> {{of style}} ... but rather of generic conception." [...] Between his Third and Seventh Symphonies, Beethoven had pushed the symphony well beyond the {{boundaries}} of entertainment into those of moral, political and philosophical statement. By adding text and voices in his Ninth Symphony, he not only redefined the genre but also called into question whether instrumental music could truly be superior to vocal music. The Ninth, Bonds says, in fact became the catalyst that fueled debate about the symphony genre. Hector Berlioz was the only composer [...] "able to grapple successfully with Beethoven's legacy." [...] However, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Niels Gade also achieved successes with their symphonies, putting at least a temporary stop to the debate as to whether the genre was dead. Regardless, composers increasingly turned to the [...] "more compact form" [...] of the concert overture [...] "as a vehicle within which to blend musical, narrative and pictoral ideas"; examples included Mendelssohn's overtures A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and The Hebrides (1830).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by noted horror author Stephen King. King {{initially}} approached series co-star David Duchovny and {{informed him that}} he loved the show and desired to write an episode. Eventually, he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead. Carter agreed, but once more, King {{changed his mind and}} it was decided that he would write an episode of The X-Files. King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine; the two individuals never actually met one another. King's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote. Carter explained, [...] "Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work". Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script, hence their dual writing credit on the episode. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, [...] "I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and when it was all said and done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. The nuts and bolts were his, but that was <b>really</b> <b>one</b> of Chris' scripts." [...] Unbeknownst to either Carter or King, the word [...] "Chinga" [...] can be considered a vulgar Spanish colloquialism.|$|E
500|$|Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer {{throughout}} pre-production of {{the action}} thriller Reindeer Games (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having [...] "a very winning, likable quality about him. I've {{been doing this for}} a long time and he's <b>really</b> <b>one</b> of the nicest." [...] He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times enjoying the unexpected casting choice: [...] "Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games." [...] He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck had [...] "traced over" [...] Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross, while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he [...] "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated [...] In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama Bounce. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "understated intensity and exquisite detail" [...] of his performance: [...] "His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive." ...|$|E
