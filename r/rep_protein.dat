In an early stage, the <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> showed a punctate distribution pattern over the nuclei of infected cells, reminiscent of replication foci. At this stage, no capsid proteins were detectable. At later stages, the <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> were distributed more homogeneously over the nuclear interior and finally became redistributed into clusters slightly enriched at the nuclear periphery. During an intermediate stage, they also appeared at an interior part of the nucleolus for a short period, whereas {{most of the time the}} nucleoli were Rep negative. AAV- 2 DNA colocalized with the <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins.</b> All three capsid proteins were strongly enriched in the nucleolus in a transient stage of infection, when the <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> homogeneously filled the nucleoplasm. Thereafter, they became distributed over the whole nucleus and colocalized in nucleoplasmic clusters with the <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> and AAV- 2 DNA. While VP 1 and VP 2 strongly accumulated in the nucleus, VP 3 was almost equally distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Capsids, visualized by a conformation-specific antibody, were first detectable in the nucleoli and then spread over the whole nucleoplasm. This suggests that nucleolar components are involved in initiation of capsid assembly whereas DNA packaging occurs in the nucleoplasm. Expression of a transfected full-length AAV- 2 genome followed by adenovirus infection showed all stages of an AAV- 2 /adenovirus coinfection, whereas after expression of the cap gene alone, capsids were restricted to the nucleoli and did not follow the nuclear redistribution observed in the presence of the whole AAV- 2 genome. Coexpression of <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> released the restriction of capsids to the nucleolus, suggesting that the <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> are involved in nuclear redistribution of AAV capsids during viral infection.

Replication at the cleaved donor site initiates at the free 3' OH where the donor strand serves as a primer for DNA synthesis by host DNA polymerase and replication proceeds to displace one strand of Helitron. If the palindrome and 3' end of the element are recognized correctly, cleavage occurs after the CTRR sequence and the one Helitron strand is transferred to the donor site where DNA replication resolves the heteroduplex.|$|E

50|$|Most {{plasmids}} {{require a}} plasmid-encoded protein, usually called Rep, {{to separate the}} strands of DNA at the origin of replication (oriV) to initiate DNA replication. Rep binds to specific DNA sequences in oriV which are unique to a plasmid type. The synthesis of <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> is controlled in order to limit plasmid replication and therefore regulate copy number.In R1 plasmids RepA can be transcribed from two different promoters. It is made from the first promoter until the plasmid reaches its copy number, upon which the protein CopB represses this primary promoter. RepA expression is also regulated post-transcriptionally from the secondary promoter by an antisense RNA called CopA. CopA interacts with its RNA target in the RepA mRNA and forms a kissing complex and then a RNA-RNA duplex. The resultant double stranded RNA is cleaved by RNase III, preventing synthesis of RepA. The higher the concentration of the plasmid, the more CopA RNA is produced and the less RepA protein can be synthesized, increasing inhibition of plasmid replication.|$|E
50|$|Geminivirus genomes encode {{only a few}} proteins; thus, {{they are}} {{dependent}} on host cell factors for replication: these include factors such as DNA polymerase—and probably repair polymerases—in order to amplify their genomes, as well as transcription factors. Geminiviruses replicate via a rolling circle mechanism like bacteriophages such as M13, and many plasmids. Replication occurs within the nucleus of an infected plant cell. First the single-stranded circular DNA is converted to a double-stranded circular intermediate. This step {{involves the use of}} cellular DNA repair enzymes to produce a complementary negative-sense strand, using the viral genomic or plus-sense DNA strand as a template. The next step is the rolling circle phase, where the viral strand is cleaved at a specific site situated within the origin of replication by the viral <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> in order to initiate replication. This process in a eukaryotic nucleus can give rise to concatemeric double-stranded forms of replicative intermediate genomes, although double-stranded unit circles can be isolated from infected plants and cells. New single-stranded DNA forms of the virus genome (plus-sense) are probably formed by interaction of the coat protein with replicating DNA intermediates, as genomes lacking a CP gene do not form ssDNA. The ssDNA is packaged into germinate particles in the nucleus. It is not clear if these particles can then leave the nucleus and be transmitted to surrounding cells as virions, or whether ssDNA associated with coat protein and a movement protein is the form of the genome that gets trafficked from cell to cell via the plasmodesmata.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAdeno-associated virus (AAV) {{replication}} (<b>Rep)</b> <b>proteins</b> are pleiotropic effectors of viral DNA replication, RNA transcription, and site-specific {{integration into}} chromosome 19. In addition to regulating AAV gene expression, the <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> modulate {{expression of a}} variety of cellular and viral genes. In this report we investigate Rep-mediated effects on expression of the adenovirus (Ad) E 2 a gene and the Ad major late promoter. We have found that all four <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> repress E 2 a expression at the <b>protein</b> level, with <b>Rep</b> 40 showing the weakest repression. Mutations in the purine nucleotide binding (PNB) site weakened each of the protein's abilities to repress expression. Analysis of steady-state E 2 a mRNA showed that <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> decreased mRNA levels, but to a lesser extent than E 2 a protein levels. Analysis of mRNA stability demonstrated that neither Rep 78 nor Rep 52 affected E 2 a mRNA stability, suggesting that the decrease in mRNA is due to Rep-mediated inhibition of Ad E 2 a transcription. To determine if <b>Rep</b> 68 <b>proteins</b> could directly inhibit RNA transcription, we performed in vitro transcription assays using HeLa nuclear extracts supplemented with Rep 68 and Rep 68 PNB. We demonstrate that Rep 68, but not mutant Rep 68 PNB, blocked in vitro transcription of a template containing the Ad major late promoter.

Rep 78 and Rep 52 were more abundant than Rep 68 and Rep 40 owing to a higher synthesis rate throughout the infectious cycle.

Binding assays showed that the interaction between RHSP and rRNA was similar to the RHSP-DNA interaction. Several models are put forth to explain the stimulation of the unwinding reaction catalyzed by <b>Rep</b> <b>protein.</b> In addition, the potential physiological significance of the RHSP-stimulated <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> unwinding reaction is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Plasmid F {{replication}} {{is controlled}} by a plasmid-specified <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> with both autorepressor and initiator functions. The mechanism by which these two functions of a <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> are balanced to achieve stable replication is unknown; however, we speculated in prior work that <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> modification could be involved. We report here that naturally proteolyzed F RepE protein has been detected and characterized. The processed molecule lost the first 17 N-terminal aminoacyl residues and initiator function but acquired increased specific DNA-binding affinity {{in the presence of}} Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA. When supplied in trans, the altered protein acts as an incompatibility substance and eliminates maintenance of F'lac. These findings indicate that protein processing has the potential to contribute to the overall control of DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{expression}} of the adeno-associated virus type 5 (AAV 5) P 41 capsid gene promoter required adenovirus E 1 A and/or E 1 B; however, in contrast to what was observed for {{expression of}} the AAV 2 capsid gene promoter (P 40), neither adenovirus infection nor the large <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> was required. Although both the AAV 2 and the AAV 5 large Rep proteins efficiently bound the (GAGY) 3 Rep-binding element, the AAV 5 large <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> transactivated transcription of the inducible AAV 2 P 40 promoter much less well than AAV 2 large Rep. Differences in their activation potentials were mapped to the amino-terminal region of the proteins, and the poorly transactivating AAV 5 <b>Rep</b> <b>protein</b> could competitively inhibit AAV 2 Rep transactivation...|$|E
50|$|Given the {{similarities}} between the <b>rep</b> <b>proteins</b> of the alphasatellites and the nanoviruses, {{it is likely that the}} alphasatellites evolved from the nanoviruses. Further work in this area is needed to clarify this.|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} of {{adeno-associated virus}} type 2 (AAV 2) P 19 -generated pre-mRNAs generates the small <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> <b>Rep</b> 52 and Rep 40, which {{differ in their}} carboxyl termini. Both proteins are required for optimal packaging of AAV 2 genomes. AAV 5 Rep-encoding P 19 -generated transcripts are primarily polyadenylated within the central intron and not efficiently spliced; however, surprisingly, AAV 5 was found to generate high levels of a <b>Rep</b> 40 -like <b>protein.</b> The AAV 5 <b>Rep</b> 40 -like <b>protein</b> was generated by internal initiation and has the same C terminus as Rep 52. Although precluded from using alternative splicing to generate multiple Rep isoforms, AAV 5 ensures {{the production of a}} <b>Rep</b> 40 -like <b>protein</b> by utilizing a novel internal translation initiation event...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{attempts}} to establish 293 cell-based stable and high-titer adeno-associated virus (AAV) packaging cell lines were unsuccessful, {{primarily due to}} adenovirus E 1 -activated Rep gene expression, which exerts cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on the host cells. Control of the two large AAV <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> (<b>Rep</b> 78 / 68) was insufficient to eliminate the adverse effects, because of the leaky expression of the two small <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> (<b>Rep</b> 52 / 40). However, it was unsuccessful to control Rep 52 / 40 gene expression since its promoter is located within the coding sequence of Rep 78 / 68. To tightly regulate all four <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> by using their own promoters, we have developed a novel gene control paradigm termed “dual splicing switch,” which disrupts all four Rep genes by inserting into their shared coding region an intron that harbors transcription termination sequences flanked the LoxP sites. As a result, the structure and activities of the Rep gene promoters, both p 5 and p 19, are not affected; however, all of the Rep transcripts are prematurely terminated and the genes were inactivated. Removal of the terminator by Cre protein reactivates the transcription of all four <b>Rep</b> <b>proteins</b> derived from their own promoters. This switch system was initially tested in the lacZ gene and a 600 -fold induction of β-galactosidase activity was observed. Using the dual splicing switch strategy, we have subsequently established a number of AAV packaging cell lines from 293 cells, which showed a normal growth rate, high stability, and more importantly, high yields of AAV vectors. Such a gene control paradigm is also useful for other viruses, e. g., autonomous parvoviruses. Finally, the high-titer 293 -based AAV packaging cell lines should greatly {{reduce the risk of}} wild-type adenovirus contamination and provide a scalable AAV vector production method for both preclinical and clinical studies...|$|R
