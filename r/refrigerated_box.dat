40|$|Thermo King as a {{supplier}} of {{mobile refrigeration equipment}} is interested in {{more information about the}} airflow distribution inside a refrigerated trailer in various loading conditions to optimise the performance of the refrigeration units. A more efficient way and/or more uniform way of keeping the internal environment inside the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>box</b> at the required conditions will increase the quality of the cargo as well as causing less damage to the environment. The objective of this project is to develop a testing environment that makes it possible to conduct airflow tests for the purpose of learning more about the internal airflow of a trailer. This test environment will be {{in the form of an}} hydraulic transparent test rig representing a scaled model o f a refrigeration system. The test environment must be able to simulate multiple unit configurations in the form of different airflow volumes, and different configurations of air inlet and outlet positions. Different cargo configurations inside the trailer will be used to simulate different types of loads. Secondly, advice and recommendations on the improvement of airflow as well as ideas for further research will be discussed. It is recommended that the project be continued by future researchers to obtain more extensive results from the simulation environment developed and created during this project. Real flow investigation and improvement in airflow distribution should be developed and tested to enable Thermo King to make a more efficient, competitive and more environmentally friendly refrigeration unit...|$|E

Club critic Steven Hyden {{wrote that}} while Era Extraña sounds [...] "fuller" [...] than Psychic Chasms and [...] "still {{has plenty of}} hooks to offer", Palomo [...] "has to take both feet {{out of the bedroom}} to move his music forward". He also {{compared}} it to another chillwave album that was released a few months before, Washed Out's Within And Without, saying that [...] "Where Within is an immaculately conceived graduation from [...] Greene's early lo-fi work, Extraña is a minor refinement that still feels chintzy in places". Beck and Robertson also discussed Washed Out, as well as Toro y Moi, dubbing the album an unfunny parody of chillwave and also criticized it as [...] "such a strong homage to everything that's cool about retro-chic that you can't help but smell a rat". At PopMatters, Wisnicki wrote that Era Extraña did not have the same quality tunes and aesthetic that Psychic Chasms had, declaring that while each song on Psychic Chasms [...] "felt like getting to open another piece of candy", Era Extraña [...] "feels more like opening one of those <b>refrigerated</b> <b>boxed</b> sandwiches from the grocery store".|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s these mobile blood {{units were}} very efficient, {{with a large}} Red Cross truck Manned only by two men, {{arriving}} at an empty location and setting {{up for the first}} donation which would be taken only two hours later. The Truck would be loaded with at least ten beds, mattresses, dozens of screens and chairs, waste receptacles, tables, stools, huge <b>refrigerated</b> <b>boxes,</b> can-vas bags of ice, coffee urns, gallons of orange juice, buckets, canteen equipment, Hundreds of blood bottles, boxes of sterile supplies, bottles of solution, literature and record forms, oxygen tanks, and sheets only to which the men would have unloaded and set up on site in less than 1 hour. Once set up is complete nurses, volunteers and Doctors Arrive on site to get dressed into uniforms. There were normally 6 nurses and 15 volunteers, the Nurses would do their preliminary task while the volunteers would split off into groups. One group would unpack and set up the reception ready to record details of some 200 donors over 6 hours. Another group would set up the canteen can prepare food for after donations. The third group will set up the blood bottle table where the blood would be tagged numbered and recorded. From there the site has now been set up ready to take donations.|$|R

50|$|The Defense Supply Agency {{was tested}} almost {{immediately}} with the Cuban missile {{crisis and the}} military buildup in Vietnam. Supporting U.S. forces in Vietnam was the most severe, extensive test of the supply system in the young agency’s history. The agency launched an accelerated procurement program to meet the extra demand created by the military buildup in Southeast Asia. The agency’s supply centers responded in record time to orders for everything from boots and lightweight tropical uniforms to food, sandbags, construction materials, and petroleum products. Between 1965 and 1969 over 22 million short tons of dry cargo and over 14 million short tons of bulk petroleum were transported to Vietnam. As a result of support to the operations in Vietnam, DSA’s total procurement soared to $4 billion in fiscal year 1966 and $6.2 billion in fiscal year 1967. Until the mid-1960s, the demand for food was largely for non-perishables, both canned and dehydrated. But in 1966, thousands of portable walk-in, <b>refrigerated</b> storage <b>boxes</b> filled with perishable beef, eggs, {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} began arriving in Vietnam, a logistics miracle.|$|R

It is finished in the same three colours as the standard FN2, and a new addition the range, deep sapphire blue pearl. As often, names and trims vary even within domain markets down to local ones, and a Heritage version replaces GT version in some of them, adding Xenon/HID lights to the mix. The topping Heritage Navi version adds Bluetooth telephone system and voice recognition DVD satellite navigation. A more radical version dubbed Race differs from the Heritage by removing components (incl. HID, AC, fog lights, audio system, sound proofing, some airbags) to reduce weight as much as 40 kg. Finally, together with the 2009 revision to all 8th gen. EDM Civic variants (adding for example a USB iPod-compatible plug to the audio system), a special edition called Championship White comes in the eponyme Honda colour, with the same alloys only with matching white colour, 18" [...] wheels (19" [...] white Rage optional).

40|$|This {{study on}} extended, cooled {{stallion}} spermatozoa aimed {{to compare the}} ability of three extenders to maintain sperm motility during 24 h of preservation, and to describe pregnancy and foaling rates after artificial insemination (AI) of stallion spermatozoa stored and transported in the extender chosen from the in vitro study. After 6 and 24 h of preservation, motility, both subjective and evaluated by the motility analyzer (total, progressive and rapid), was lower in non-fat, dried skim milk glucose than in both other extenders: dried skim milk-glucose added to 2 % centrifuged egg yolk, and ultra high temperature treated skim milk-sugar-saline solution added to 2 % centrifuged egg yolk (INRA 82 -Y). Rapid spermatozoa and sperm velocity parameters, after 24 h, were significantly higher in INRA 82 -Y. In the fertility trial, semen collected from three Maremmano stallions, diluted in INRA 82 -Y, and transported in a <b>refrigerated</b> Styrofoam <b>box,</b> was used to inseminate 56 mares of the same breed. Pregnancy rates after the first cycle and per breeding season were significantly higher for the 31 mares inseminated in three AI centres (54. 8 and 80. 6 %, respectively) than for the 25 mares inseminated at the breeder's facilities (28. 0 and 52. 0 %). Foaling rates {{were not significantly different}} between the AI centres mares (54. 8 %) and the other mares (44. 0 %). In conclusion, INRA 82 -Y yielded satisfactory pregnancy and foaling rates, especially when employed in the more controlled situation of an AI centre, and can therefore be included among those available for cooled stallion semen preservation...|$|R
40|$|Food {{companies}} and analysts often need transportation rate data to explore market opportunities. In some cases, {{it may not}} be practical or necessary to obtain actual rates for all routes under consideration. This study provides analysis of truck rate patterns and alternative rate-estimating equations. The original objective was to provide shipping cost estimates for a national beef-marketing model involving 30 regions of the United States. The data set is 254 rates for <b>refrigerated</b> shipments of <b>boxed</b> fresh meat throughout the United States in 1988. Distance of the routes range from 50 to 2, 923 miles. The average route is 1, 181 miles, at a cost of $ 1, 324 per load of $ 3. 31 per cwt. The average cost per 100 miles was $ 0. 28 per cwt. This simple average underestimates the short hauls and overestimates the long hauls. To improve on this simple procedure, both arithmetic and log equations were fitted to the data. Dummy variables were added to improve the estimates when shipping to different areas in the United States. Highest cost delivery for constant miles was for the areas including the Carolinas north through New England. The lowest cost delivery was the mid-section of the country. The estimating equations explained up to 79 percent of the actual cost. Most of the equations considered performed well in the 500 to 1, 500 -mile distance, but the quadratic and the double log functions, with dummy variables, performed the best over 2, 500 miles. Obviously, these estimating methods are not sufficiently accurate (or necessary) for commercial transactions where only a few routes are under final consideration. Their main value should be to identify rate patterns and for market analysis and planning. Agribusiness,...|$|R
40|$|Sammanfattning Bakgrund ”Mat är mer än bukfylla” löd rubriken på en artikel i Skånska tidningen från januari 2014. Artikeln kom av kritiken som riktats mot de kylda matlådorna som på flera ställen serveras inom äldreomsorgen. Artikelns huvudsakliga syfte var att belysa de brister som finns med maten som serveras till de äldre. Att inte få i sig tillräckligt med näring och energi kan leda till komplikationer som exempelvis nedsatt immunförsvar, svårläkta sår, orkeslöshet samt depressioner.   Syfte Syftet med studien var att ta reda på hur kunder som utnyttjar tjänsten matdistribution inom äldreomsorgen i en utvald kommun i Mellansverige upplever beställning, leverans samt maten som de får distribuerad av kommunen.   Metod En enkät togs fram i samarbete med dietist i utvald kommun. Under våren 2014 delades 170 enkäter ut. Det räknades ut median, genomfördes chi- 2 -test och t-test. Signifikansnivån sattes till P= 0, 05   Resultat Utifrån de 170 enkäter som skickades ut samlades 89 enkäter in. Studien kom att bestå av 39 stycken män och 49 stycken kvinnor. Informanterna tyckte överlag att maten smakade bra och de var nöjda med beställning och leverans. Det fanns dock skillnader mellan könen, män tenderade att vara mer nöjda/mycket nöjda än kvinnorna.   Slutsats Studien visar att kunderna i kommunen sammantaget är nöjda med de kylda matlådorna. Det har inte skett någon större förändring gentemot tidigare studier som gjorts i kommunen, vilket indikerar på att maten håller en god standard. Det vi anser att kommunen bör se över är grönsakerna som medföljer, eftersom de klagomål som framkom av kunderna berörde främst dessa. Vi anser också att vidare studier bör genomföras för att få en djupare bild av upplevelsen kring matsituationen.  Abstract Background"Food is {{more than}} just the amount of food you eat” read the {{headline}} on an article from Skåne magazine from January 2014. The article arose because of the criticism levelled against the <b>refrigerated</b> lunch <b>boxes</b> served in senior care. The lunch boxes that were send to the elderly people were not assessed for nutrient content so there could be a lack of nutrients in the boxes. There were also a lack of procedures and controls, to show how much of the food they ate. Not getting enough nutrients and energy can lead to complications such as impaired immune system and depression.   Objective The {{purpose of the study was}} to find out how customers in senior care in a selected municipality in the middle of Sweden experienced ordering, delivery, and the food that the municipality distributed them.   Method A questionnaire was designed in collaboration with the dietician at the selected municipality. During the spring of 2014 170 questionnaires were distributed. It was calculated median and mean some of the results were compared with previous studies conducted in the municipality.   Results From the 170 questionnaires sent out 89 samples were returned. The study came to consist of 39 male and 49 women. The informants felt overall that the food tasted good and they were satisfied with the order, delivery and food. There was some differences between the genders, men were more satisfied then the women.   Conclusion The study shows that the customers in the municipality overall were satisfied with the lunch boxes. No major changes had occurred since previous studies carried out in the municipality. This indicates that the food was of good standard. What we saw in the comments were that the costumers were complaining about the vegetables that are included in the lunch boxes.   We believe that these complaints need to be resolved by the municipality. We also believe that further studies should be conducted to get at deeper picture of the consumers food experience. ...|$|R
