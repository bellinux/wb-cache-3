5|$|As a whole, {{the ring}} system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter or the broad and complex <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Uranus are similar to the outer G and E <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Uranus may be similar to the <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E

40|$|This article deals {{mostly with}} the {{following}} question: when is the classical <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients <b>of</b> a commutative <b>ring</b> a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> stable range 1 ? We introduce the concepts <b>of</b> a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> (von Neumann) regular range 1, a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> semihereditary range 1, a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> regular range 1, a semihereditary local ring, a regular local ring. We find relationships between the introduced classes <b>of</b> <b>rings</b> and known ones, in particular, it is established that a commutative indecomposable almost clean ring is a regular local ring. A commutative any <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> idempotent regular range 1 is an almost clean ring. It is shown that any commutative indecomposable almost clean Bezout ring is an Hermite ring, any commutative semihereditary ring is a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> idempotent regular range 1.

5|$|The <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Neptune, {{like those}} of Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System.

In this respect the <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Uranus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the Noetherian properties <b>of</b> the <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators of an affine semigroup algebra.

Next we give a condition, based on the data {{of the difference between}} the semigroup and its scored closure, for the <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators being anti-isomorphic to another <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators. Using this, we prove that the <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators is left Noetherian if the condition is satisfied. Moreover we give some other conditions for the <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators being left Noetherian. Finally we conjecture necessary and sufficient conditions for the <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators being left Noetherian...|$|R

5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> the other giant planets.
