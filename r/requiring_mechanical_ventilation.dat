5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles <b>requiring</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E

From late 1999 until the summer of 2000, there was a measles outbreak in North Dublin, Ireland. At the time, the national immunization level had fallen below 80%, and in part of North Dublin the level was around 60%. There were more than 100 hospital admissions from over 300 cases. Three children died and several more were gravely ill, some <b>requiring</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> to recover.|$|E

25|$|Most {{types of}} eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} have similar {{signs and symptoms}}. Prominent and nearly universal signs and symptoms include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, and night sweats. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia typically follows a rapid course.

Symptoms accumulate over several months and include fever, cough, difficulty breathing, wheezing, and weight loss.

2500|$|While commercially {{canned goods}} are {{required}} to undergo a [...] "botulinum cook" [...] in a pressure cooker at [...] for 3 minutes, and thus rarely cause botulism, there have been notable exceptions. Two were the 1978 Alaskan salmon outbreak and the 2007 Castleberry's Food Company outbreak. Foodborne botulism is the rarest form though, accounting for only around 15% of cases (US) and has more frequently been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as carrot juice, asparagus, green beans, beets, and corn. However, outbreaks of botulism have resulted from more unusual sources. In July 2002, fourteen Alaskans ate muktuk (whale meat) from a beached whale, and eight of them developed symptoms of botulism, two of them <b>requiring</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b>|$|E

Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is an important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia with a high mortality rate; streptococcus pneumoniae is the second most important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia for children and primary for adults.

50|$|VAP {{occurring}} early after intubation typically involves fewer resistant {{organisms and}} is thus associated with a more favorable outcome. Because respiratory failure <b>requiring</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> is itself associated with a high mortality, determination of the exact contribution of VAP to mortality has been difficult. As of 2006, estimates range from 33% to 50% death in patients who develop VAP. Mortality is more likely when VAP is associated with certain microorganisms (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter), blood stream infections, and ineffective initial antibiotics. VAP is especially common in people who have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).|$|E

5000|$|When given succinylcholine, a {{commonly}} used neuromuscular-blocking drug administered for general anesthesia during surgery, the heterozygous and mutant homozygous individual will experience a prolonged duration of action of neuromuscular blockade. This results in unexpected and unwanted postoperative respiratory muscle paralysis <b>requiring</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> in such patients. The duration of such paralysis may last from hours to days. To identify susceptible individuals, the dibucaine number {{can be determined}} so as to alert the care team to the risks of use of butyrylcholinesterase substrates. Pestel et al. measured 24,830 Dibucaine numbers {{over a period of}} 4 years in a European trial. Numbers below 30 (atypical homozygous) were found in 0.07% (n=18) giving an incidence of 1:1,400. Dibucaine numbers from 30 to 70 (atypical heterozygous) were found in 1.23% ( [...] n=306). On the basis of identification of the Dibucaine numbers we could avoid the administration of succinylcholine resulting in a cost reduction of 12,280 Euro offset against the total laboratory costs amounting to 10,470 Euro.|$|E
