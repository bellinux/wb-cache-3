The technological capabilities of these devices have expanded very rapidly; for example, their in-built cameras have largely replaced conventional cameras. Their processing power is often sufficient to handle the large data sets of <b>radiology</b> <b>studies</b> and to manipulate images and studies directly on hand-held devices. Thus, they can be used to transmit and view <b>radiology</b> <b>studies,</b> often in locations remote from the source of the imaging data. They are not recommended for primary interpretation of <b>radiology</b> <b>studies,</b> but they facilitate sharing of studies for second opinions, viewing of studies and reports by clinicians at the bedside, etc. Other potential applications include remote participation in educational activity (e.g. webinars) and consultation of online educational content, e-books, journals and reference sources. Social-networking applications can be used for exchanging professional information and teaching.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} which materials afford better simulation of soft tissues in Oral <b>Radiology</b> <b>studies.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample was composed of four materials in eleven different thicknesses to simulate the soft tissues of the face. The mean values of the relative amounts of radiographic contrast of the materials were determined and compared to a gold standard value, which was obtained from 20 patients who were referred to have periapical radiographs taken of the left mandibular molars. Data were subjected to statistical analysis with Dunnett's test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The mean value of the relative amounts of contrast encountered in the patients was 0. 47, with a range between 0. 36 and 0. 64 for all 44 material/thickness combinations. The majority of the tested materials showed values close to those of the patients' tissues, without statistically signifcant differences among them. The values of only three materials/thickness combinations differed statistically from those of the patients' tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of the present study, it may be concluded that except for utility wax (4 mm and 8 mm) and water (4 mm), all materials tested at different thickness could be used as soft tissue substitute materials in Oral <b>Radiology</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|E

30|$|Urosepsis due to obstructive uropathy {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of pregnancy [1], occasionally requiring placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy. Fluoroscopic antegrade pyelography may be indicated to determine the level and cause obstruction. Although typical fetal doses from diagnostic <b>radiology</b> <b>studies</b> are usually low, {{it is important to}} keep fetal radiation doses as low as possible [2, 3]. Antegrade pyelography, however, requires the use of iodinated contrast medium and ionising radiation exposure. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can circumvent the latter challenge [4 – 8] but the potential effects of Gd-based contrast agent on the foetus have not been determined, with one animal study suggesting teratogenicity [9]. The European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) advises caution when using Gd-chelates in pregnant women [10]. This report highlights a potential alternative to the use of ionising radiation and conventional contrast agents in the pregnant woman with obstructive uropathy.|$|E
