5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's <b>radiator</b> <b>grill,</b> and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the systems}} based on photoresistors evolved, growing more compact and {{moving from the}} {{dashboard}} to a less conspicuous location behind the <b>radiator</b> <b>grill,</b> they were still unable to reliably discern headlamps from non-vehicular light sources such as streetlights. They also did not dip to low beam when the driver approached a vehicle from behind, and they would spuriously dip to low beam in response to road sign reflections of the vehicle's own high beam headlamps. American inventor Jacob Rabinow devised and refined a scanning automatic dimmer system impervious to streetlights and reflections, but no automaker purchased the rights, and the problematic photoresistor type remained on the market through the late 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{new models}} were {{exhibited}} at the 1950 Commercial Motor Show, with names instead of model codes for the first time. The Envoy was for traditional front-engined chassis, and featured a full-front cab with a vee-pattern windscreen, and aluminium trim across {{the lower part of}} the <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> extending around squared-off front corners to the wheel arches. The Crusader, which could be built on the traditional front-engined chassis or the new underfloor-engined chassis, had a more upright front profile, with curved glass panels at the windscreen corners, and in most cases an enlarged side window with sloping pillars between this and the entrance. With the front-engined chassis, the Crusader employed the Envoy's front trim. Both the Envoy and Crusader were produced to the new maximum dimensions of [...] by , and many examples were originally fitted with rear wheel spats.|$|E
50|$|Black-and-white {{photos of}} racing car champions, {{together}} {{with a variety of}} motoring memorabilia (including <b>radiator</b> <b>grills,</b> connecting rods, lamps and horns) decorate the walls of the traditional interior which has wood paneling and curtains at the windows.|$|R
5000|$|The hotel's {{insignia}} {{is that of}} the Sutherland {{family and}} consists of a coronet with interlaced [...] "S"s and acanthus leaves. It can be found on <b>radiator</b> <b>grills</b> in parts of the house. The hotel's motto is [...] "Nothing ordinary ever happened here, nor could it." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, Mido {{introduced}} lady’s watches {{with color}} enameled shaped cases and modern straps {{as well as}} timepieces for gentlemen in art deco style. Mido founda market in the flourishing automotive market by producing watches {{in the shape of}} <b>radiator</b> <b>grills</b> {{of a wide range of}} brands such as Buick, Bugatti, Fiat, Ford, Excelsior, Hispano-Suiza, etc.|$|R
50|$|Mk II - had {{all-around}} armour and the <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> {{was moved}} from a vertical position to a horizontal one.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} main models {{produced}} during the production run. The earlier model is easily {{identified with the}} vertical chrome bar <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> and was assembled between November 1967 and March 1970. The later model, with the black pressed metal <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> and slim bumber bars was assembled between April 1970 and December 1971. As {{there had not been}} any earlier Midget models assembled in Australia prior to these, these cars are sometimes referred to as Australian Mark 1 and Mark 2 Midgets.|$|E
50|$|A minor {{facelift}} in {{time for}} the 1938 London motor-show involved a change to the <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> which, while still rearward leaning, now became more curvaceous.|$|E
50|$|While the Bentley R-Type and S-Type were {{significantly}} different to the corresponding Rolls Royce models, the 1965 Bentley T-series/Rolls Royce Silver Shadow differed only in badges and <b>radiator</b> <b>grills.</b> The Bentley models even used a Rolls-Royce badged engine. As a result, fewer Bentleys were sold which, ironically, makes them more valuable today. The Bentley T-series/Rolls Royce Silver Shadow were the first models with monocoque construction and four-wheel disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|A {{variant of}} the model, called the GSR600S or ‘S’-model, was {{released}} middle of 2006. It differs from the standard model with a stock windshield, a <b>radiator</b> protector <b>grill</b> as well as carbon-fibre lamination for selected parts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} livery {{featured the}} Santa Fe's Yellowbonnet {{with a red}} stripe on the locomotive's nose; {{the remainder of the}} locomotive body was painted in Southern Pacific's scarlet red (from their Bloody Nose scheme) with a black roof and black extending down to {{the lower part of the}} locomotive's <b>radiator</b> <b>grills.</b> The numberboards were red with white numbers. In large block letters within the red portion of the sides was either [...] "SP" [...] (for Southern Pacific-owned locomotives) or [...] "SF" [...] (for Santa Fe-owned locomotives). The lettering was positioned on the locomotive sides so that the other half of the lettering could be added after the merger became official. Two ATSF EMD SD45-2s (ATSF #7219 and #7221) were painted with the full SPSF lettering to show what the unified paint scheme would look like after the merger was complete. One Santa Fe caboose was also painted with [...] "SPSF" [...] in a similar situation.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Mercedes-Benz W115 250, W114 technically, saloon: This post-facelift {{version is}} {{distinguished}} by a lower and wider <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> and differing treatment below the single front bumper/fender.|$|E
50|$|In 1958 {{the wide}} chrome {{bars of the}} <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> were {{replaced}} by a less flamboyant grill. But the globe design directly above the grill lasted another year.|$|E

2500|$|This species' {{reputation}} as a public nuisance is due not to any bite or sting (it is incapable of either), but to its slightly acidic body chemistry. Because airborne lovebugs can exist in enormous numbers near highways, they die in large numbers on automobile windshields, hoods, and <b>radiator</b> <b>grills</b> when the vehicles travel at high speeds. If left {{for more than an}} hour or two, the remains become extremely difficult to remove. Their body chemistry has a nearly neutral 6.5 pH but may become acidic at 4.25 pH if left on the car for a day. [...] In the past, the acidity of the dead adult body, especially the female's egg masses, often resulted in pits and etches in automotive paint and chrome if not quickly removed. [...] However, advances in automotive paints and protective coatings have reduced this threat significantly. Now the greatest concern is excessive clogging of vehicle radiator air passages with the bodies of the adults, with the reduction of the cooling effect on engines, and the obstruction of windshields when the remains of the adults and egg masses are smeared on the glass.|$|R
5000|$|The 2005 to 2007 offered {{much more}} {{with a new}} front fascia, with {{features}} such as squared [...] "bug" [...] eye headlights, an extended bumper to accommodate the oversized square <b>radiator</b> <b>grills</b> with three vertical chrome bars and squared fog lamps. Also new was differently finished rear tail-lights and bumpers, integrated radio antenna, digital odometer and trip meter and (depending on the market) an updated multimedia head unit with flip-down ceiling-mounted screen. The engine was a carry-over 2.5-liter DOHC 16-valve common rail direct injection turbo diesel engine that had an output of [...] at 360 Nm of torque and a 2.5-liter SOHC eight-valve turbo diesel with intercooler engine that has an output of [...] at 4,000 rpm and 170 Nm of torque but now with ETC. The interior features upgraded upholstery, a number of cup holders located at the back seats, and an easy to wipe and clean rubberized floor matting. Top of the line (Gold) models features a leather interior an overhead console and immobilizer. Aluminum accents, split, folding seats, all power features, digital climate control, key less entry and DVD player with six speakers are standard.|$|R

5000|$|Externally a Sovereign can be {{distinguished}} by the complete use of highly polished steel/chrome work around windows and rear light clusters; as well as polished <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> and boot garnish. The cars are simply badged as [...] "Sovereign" [...] with no mention [...] "XJ".|$|E
50|$|The south wing's interior, {{originally}} a restaurant, remained in {{use as a}} waiting room. Inside it has some original decor suggesting that purpose. They include brass ticket windows, a long Mission style wooden bench, iron <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> and marble baseboards and sills. Its vaulted ceiling and walls are done in plaster.|$|E
50|$|At {{the front}} the {{radiator}} on the Primus was {{not covered by}} a grill, but it did have its own chrome frame. From 1933, in a move which marked a new model year and increased component harmonisation, the Primus acquired the front <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> which the front-wheel drive Trumpf had used from launch.|$|E
5000|$|An SD40T-2 is a 6-axle {{diesel-electric}} locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division having a 16-cylinder EMD 645E3 diesel engine producing [...] 312 SD40T-2s were built for North American railroads between April 1974 and July 1980. This locomotive and the SD45T-2 are popularly called tunnel motors, but EMD's term is SD40-2s with [...] "cooling system modifications" [...] {{because they were}} designed for better engine cooling in tunnels. The difference between this locomotive and its non-tunnel motor cousin, the SD40-2, are the radiator intakes and <b>radiator</b> fan <b>grills</b> located {{at the rear of}} the locomotive. The radiator air intakes in this model were along the deck to allow more fresh, cooler air to enter and less hot exhaust fumes lingering around the tunnel's ceiling.|$|R
50|$|An {{update to}} the KB {{to make it}} even more {{suitable}} for war time production in times of limited material availability. Emphasis was on reducing the cost of materials. The engine cover was still metal but other body panels were made from plywood. The body design was extremely square, with only simple curves used on the engine cover and a flat <b>radiator</b> with no <b>grill.</b> Only a single headlight and only rear brakes were used.|$|R
50|$|The first Sizaire-Berwick {{came with}} 3014 cm3 engine {{supplied}} by Decolange. This was quickly {{replaced with a}} 4-litre (20 CV) monobloc unit. The <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> on the early cars very closely resembled that of a Rolls-Royce, but, with litigation looming, the flat fronted grill on the Sizaire-Berfwick was replaced with one that featured a shallow V-shaped profile.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Jaguar, the twelve-cylinder Daimler had {{the same}} <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> as its six-cylinder sibling, and {{externally}} only the badges distinguished them. The Double-Six followed the same changes as the Sovereign from Series I to Series III, although the Sovereign name was transferred to Jaguar, the Double-Six name remained with Daimler throughout Series III production, which continued until 1992.|$|E
50|$|Hyundai {{introduced}} an all new front end design {{inspired by the}} Fluidic Sculpture design language. Its centrepiece is a new <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> which features chrome detailing. It also boasts a bracing set of 3D wraparound headlamps with multi reflector chrome surround fog lamps. The bumpers have also been redesigned with a new front grille to lend a more aggressive look.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932 the W08 {{lost the}} “Nürburg” name, being sold {{simply as the}} Mercedes-Benz Typ 500. The 4,918cc [...] side-valve engine with its twin {{downdraft}} carburettor was unchanged, as were the four speed optional overdrive transmission, wheelbase, and list of standard body types. Styling was changed slightly, the most obvious aspect {{of which was a}} slight raking of both <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> and windscreen.|$|E
50|$|Late in the XJ40 run 3.2S and 4.0S, in 1993-1994, Jaguar {{introduced}} the Sport model. It was available {{only with the}} six-cylinder engine, and featured rosewood interior trim (as opposed to the walnut trim of other models.) Both the door mirrors and <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> vanes were color-keyed to the body, which was decorated with twin coachlines. Wider-profile tires were fitted, mounted on five-spoke alloy wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1967 and 1971 a [...] "light" [...] A11 or F11 {{version was}} also available. This has a lighter payload {{and a lower}} {{horsepower}} rating. All Alfa Romeo vans were facelifted in 1977 with a new black plastic <b>radiator</b> <b>grill,</b> and chrome badging was replaced with black adhesive stickers. Production stopped in 1983. The total production of all A11, A12, F11, and F12 was around 17,300 units.|$|E
50|$|Drive Kit Plus for iPhone, Mercedes-Benz phone module with Bluetooth, {{roof box}} 400 with Alustyle Quickfix carrier bars, Mercedes Sport product range (a spoiler lip {{for the front}} apron, a gleaming black <b>radiator</b> <b>grill,</b> gleaming black {{exterior}} mirror casing and waistline trim strip, a roof spoiler and rear apron trims with a diffuser look), light-alloy wheels were developed for the A-Class vehicles. The A-Class in Australia comes standard with 9 airbags.|$|E
5000|$|Behind {{the stylish}} {{rearward}} sloping <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> was a 1131 cc side-valve engine, {{with a relatively}} long 100 mm stroke. [...] This maximised the engine capacity available in the 9 hp tax class which, in the UK at that time, categorised cars and set annual car tax according to the diameter (bore) of the engine’s cylinders. Power was delivered to the rear wheels via a three speed gearbox.|$|E
50|$|The Buick Regal is a rebadged Opel Insignia. The main {{differences}} are the modified <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> and the altered {{color of the}} passenger compartment illumination (blue instead of red). The Regal GS {{is comparable to the}} Insignia OPC. It was first assembled alongside the Insignia at the Opel plant in Rüsselsheim. Since the first quarter of 2011, it is now being built on the flexible assembly line at the GM plant in Oshawa, Canada.|$|E
50|$|The SK {{series is}} {{basically}} a mere evolution of the Neue Generation, which was built up to the year 1989. There were few changes to the cab: <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> and wind leading plates were combined optically, and the lower edges of the side windows were made with a progressive incline towards the front. This design feature had already been realized in 1977 with the T1 and in 1984 with the LN series.|$|E
5000|$|A minor {{facelift}} to the Countryman {{was unveiled}} at the 2014 New York International Auto Show. [...] Changes include a new {{structure of the}} hexagonal <b>radiator</b> <b>grill,</b> underride guard elements for the Cooper S Countryman ALL4 and additional body colour options. It went on sale in July 2014. All variants carried over. US variants include Cooper, Cooper S, Cooper S ALL4, John Cooper Works (with ALL4), with 6-speed manual transmission or optional 6-speed automatic transmission.|$|E
50|$|The Jensen 541S was Jensen Motors luxury GT {{model of}} the Jensen 541 series with wider track. Four inches wider than the 541R the {{increase}} allowed the new car's interior to be roomier and improved the roadholding. It was announced in mid-October 1960. The 541S had a conventional <b>radiator</b> <b>grill</b> (as opposed to the flap of the 541) {{to allow for the}} extra heat given by a proposed new V8 engine, and a Salisbury limited slip differential for the extra torque demanded.|$|E
5000|$|In summer 1991 a {{revision}} {{was carried out}} for Phase 2. The engine range changed because now partially machines from Renault Clio were taken. Added to this was, among other things, a 1.9l diesel engine with 47 kW (64 hp). This engine with the label [...] "F8Q" [...] will be modified to this day in various models of Renault and Nissan use. Discoverable was ours at the modernized <b>radiator</b> <b>grill,</b> which was usually kept in gray plastic and aerodynamically slightly cheaper.|$|E
