5|$|The {{experiment}} was suggested on 1 November 1943 by Robert Serber. The {{idea was to}} measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere. The test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression. The gamma <b>ray</b> <b>source</b> was located {{in the center of}} a metal sphere. The increase of thickness (of hollow shells) and density (of solid spheres) as the compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of gamma rays outside of the sphere; the lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough to interfere with the experiment. The gamma rays had to be intense and of the right energy. Too low energy, and they would be fully absorbed in the surrounding metal; too high energy and the difference of attenuation during the implosion would be too low to be practical. The detectors had to provide high speed and large area; fast ionization chambers, then under development, were the only devices then available satisfying the requirements.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{instruments}} {{also experienced}} degradation {{as a result}} of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin grinding surface of the Rock Abrasion Tool wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets. All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, towards the end of Spirits life, the MIMOS II Mössbauer spectrometer took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its cobalt-57 gamma <b>ray</b> <b>source</b> that has a half life of 271 days.|$|E
500|$|To {{study the}} {{behavior}} of converging shock waves, Robert Serber devised the RaLa Experiment, which used the short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation. The gamma <b>ray</b> <b>source</b> {{was placed in the}} center of a metal sphere surrounded by the explosive lenses, which in turn were inside in an ionization chamber. This allowed the taking of an X-ray movie of the implosion. The lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests. In his history of the Los Alamos project, David Hawkins wrote: [...] "RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design".|$|E
500|$|In her post-war research, Wu {{continued}} to investigate beta decay. Enrico Fermi had published {{his theory of}} Beta decay in 1934, but an experiment by Luis Walter Alvarez had produced results at variance with the theory. Wu set out to repeat the experiment and verify the result. She suspected that {{the problem was that}} a thick and uneven film of copper(II) sulfate (...) was being used as a copper-64 beta <b>ray</b> <b>source,</b> which was causing the emitted electrons to lose energy. To get around this, she adapted an older form of spectrometer, a solenoidal spectrometer. She added detergent to the copper sulphate to produce a thin and even film. She was then able to demonstrate that the discrepancies observed were the result of experimental error; her results were consistent with Fermi's theory.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{investigating}} ultra-high energy cosmic <b>ray</b> <b>sources</b> is suggested. The method {{is based on}} analysis of gamma-ray emission that is generated in extragalactic space when ultra-high energy cosmic particles interact with cosmic background. We have found that intensity of the gamma-ray emission depends on characteristics of cosmic <b>ray</b> <b>sources,</b> specifically on their remoteness and initial particle energy spectra. In the Earth atmosphere cosmic rays initiate air showers, therefore selecting quanta-initiated showers (and excluding those from the galactic plane, gamma-ray sources, etc.) we can obtain above mentioned source characteristics. We derive {{that the number of}} quanta-initiated showers is 0 or ~ 3 x 1000 depending on source parameters, typical statistics of showers registered at 10 ^ 14 eV being of ~ 10 ^ 8. The difference is large enough to use this method for studying ultra-high energy cosmic <b>ray</b> <b>sources.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures.

500|$|In 1878, the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac {{separated}} from the rare earth [...] "erbia" [...] another independent component, which he called [...] "ytterbia", for Ytterby, the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium. He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called [...] "ytterbium" [...] (in total, four elements were named after the village, the others being yttrium, terbium and erbium). In 1907, the new earth [...] "lutecia" [...] was {{separated from}} ytterbia, from which the element [...] "lutecium" [...] (now lutetium) was extracted by Georges Urbain, Carl Auer von Welsbach, and Charles James. After some discussion, Marignac's name [...] "ytterbium" [...] was retained. A relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until 1953. At present, ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media, and less often as a gamma <b>ray</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The first gamma <b>ray</b> <b>source</b> to be {{discovered}} historically was the radioactive decay process called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an excited nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation (it is now understood that a nuclear isomeric transition, however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life). Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as [...] "radioactivity" [...] by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type. Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays, by Ernest Rutherford, who in 1903 named Villard's rays [...] "gamma rays" [...] by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899. The [...] "rays" [...] emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not easily deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and beta rays.|$|E
