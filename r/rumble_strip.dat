5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A <b>rumble</b> <b>strip</b> before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
25|$|Motor vehicle tires {{can become}} {{permanently}} damaged if a flat {{occurs in the}} traffic lane and the driver pulls over onto the shoulder with the flat tire passing over the <b>rumble</b> <b>strip.</b> This may cause the flat tire's sidewalls to be crushed or abraded between the metal wheel rim and <b>rumble</b> <b>strip</b> high-points.|$|E

The results suggested {{that the effect of}} combining centerline and shoulder <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> further reduces run-off-road crashes compared to shoulder <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> alone and both total and fatal+injury crashes compared to centerline <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> alone. However, it appeared that shoulder <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> do not further reduce head-on+sideswipe-opposite-direction crashes than applying centerline <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> in isolation.|$|R

25|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{implies that}} a sleeping driver often does not react {{and begin to}} recover, until all four wheels have struck a rumble strip; if the paved shoulder is narrower than {{the width of the}} vehicle wheel track, a <b>rumble</b> <b>strip</b> may not prevent a sleeping driver from going off the road.|$|E

2500|$|If the snow-cover is substantial, {{then the}} {{shoulder}} (including the <b>rumble</b> <b>strip)</b> is usually partially snow-covered as the snowplow's wing-blade doesn't clear the entire shoulder. [...] Vehicles going {{off the road}} usually collide with the shoulder snow bank or go into a snow-filled ditch which reduces the possibility of serious damage and injury. [...] In these situations, the <b>rumble</b> <b>strip</b> effectiveness can be negated but the crash implications are mitigated by the snow bank.|$|E

2500|$|As before-and-after studies become {{broader and}} more sophisticated, {{it appears the}} {{reduction}} estimates for both CSRS and CRS are less impressive.

2500|$|However, in {{situations}} of parked vehicle on the shoulder, debris on the shoulder, or downhill sections even with the [...] clear path requirement, rumble strips present a significant hazard particularly if the pavement is wet.

2500|$|A 2003 Montana study {{suggested}} that on Interstates, shoulder rumble reduced the roll-over accident rates but {{the severity of}} unprevented roll-over accidents increased.

40|$|This was {{the third}} {{in a series of}} studies {{investigating}} various aspects of <b>rumble</b> <b>strips.</b> In this study, to determine the effect of <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> on the real-world stopping behavior of drivers, we used a radar gun to collect speed data from over 400 vehicles on the approaches to ten intersections selected from a sample of 274 approaches. We found that, after drivers encountered the first set of in-lane <b>rumble</b> <b>strips,</b> they slowed down earlier on real-world approaches With <b>Rumble</b> <b>Strips</b> than on real-world approaches Without Rumble Strips—the difference was, on average, 2. 0 mph to 5. 0 mph (depending on vehicle category and type of approach). In addition, speeding outliers were more likely to slow down earlier on approaches With <b>Rumble</b> <b>Strips.</b> The effect of the presence of in-lane <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> on stopping behavior was greater for approaches where the driver’s view of traffic on the major road is obscured on one or both sides of the road. The study suggests that stop-controlled intersections at which cross-traffic is obscured by manmade structures and/or vegetation on one or both sides of the intersection would be good candidates for implementing in-lane <b>rumble</b> <b>strips.</b> It is worth noting that while in-lane <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> are likely to reduce crashes, they cannot eliminate them.

2500|$|Some {{residents}} living {{close to}} either newly installed lane or transverse <b>rumble</b> <b>strips</b> have complained about noise levels and {{were successful in}} having them removed at considerable expense.
