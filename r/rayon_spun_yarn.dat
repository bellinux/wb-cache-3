DREF yarns occupy an intermediate position between ring-spun and rotor <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> as far as short hairs and total hairiness s concerned. For hairs longer than 3mm, the friction <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> are more hairy than the ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns.</b> Rotor <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> show the least value in both the values. DREF yarns are most irregular in terms of twist and linear density while ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> are most even.|$|R

50|$|Friction <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> DREF yarns have bulky {{appearance}} (100-140% bulkier {{than the}} ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns).</b> The twist is not uniform and found with loopy <b>yarn</b> surface. Friction <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> {{with a high}} %age of core have a high stiffness. Friction <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> are usually weak as compared to other yarns. The yarns possess only 60% of the tenacity of ring-spun yarns and about 90% of rotor spun-yarns. The increased twist and wrapping of the sheath over the core improve the cohesion between the core and sheath and within the sheath.|$|R

This study examined whether the impact of cellulase treatment was different on denim fabrics having torque-free ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in the warp direction. Commercially produced torque-free ring <b>spun</b> cotton <b>yarn</b> was used for manufacturing denim fabric. One specimen of denim fabric had torque-free ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in the warp direction and conventional ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in the weft direction while the other had normal conventional ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in both warp and weft directions. Both warp yarns of the fabrics were dyed with the same indigo dyeing process. The denim fabric samples were treated with neutral cellulase under the same conditions, and weight change and color properties, such as reflectance, K/S value, CIE Lab values, and color fastness ratings, were measured. Experimental {{results showed that the}} weight loss percentages of the denim fabric samples after cellulase treatment were very similar. The specimen with torque-free ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in the warp direction produced a lower reflectance value and higher color yield compared with the specimen with conventional ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in both warp and weft directions.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore whether the {{properties}} of worsted yarns, especially hairiness, can be improved by combining the Solospun and Sirospun processes into a single Solo-Siro spun process. Wool fibres of 19 and 21 μm in average diameter were spun into 40 tex yarns at different twist levels, using the conventional ring, Sirospun and Solo-Siro spun systems, respectively. These yarns were then tested for a range of properties, including hairiness, tenacity, elongation and evenness, for comparison purposes. The statistical analysis results indicate that the hairiness (S 3 value) of Solo-Siro <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> was significantly less than that of both Sirospun and normal ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns.</b> In addition, the tenacity of the Solo-Siro <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> was higher than that of the normal ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns,</b> while changes in yarn breaking elongation were not statistically significant.

As shown in Fig.  3, the twisted shape of Hanji paper yarn showed a stable structure with little fluff on the surface unlike that of cotton <b>yarn.</b> The core <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> had a slightly bulky structure because the cotton yarn enveloped a spandex filament (core yarn). In the existing denim fabrics, the use of core <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> as the weft began {{with the development of}} skinny denim products in recent years, and core <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> were commonly used to improve the surface properties of core yarns and to produce stretch fabrics. Also, the structure of Hanji combination yarns showed that two kinds of yarns, the Hanji single yarn and the core <b>spun</b> <b>yarn,</b> were combined in a stable form.|$|R
