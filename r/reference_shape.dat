40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{generalized}} procrustes analysis. This {{is the problem}} of registering a set of shape data by finding a <b>reference</b> <b>shape</b> and global rigid transformations given point correspondences. The transformed shape data must align with the <b>reference</b> <b>shape</b> as best possible. This is a difficult problem. The classical approach computes alternatively the <b>reference</b> <b>shape,</b> usually as the average of the transformed shapes, and each transformation in turn. We propose a stratified approach inspired by recent results obtained in Structurefrom-Motion. Our stratified approach offers a statistically grounded framework for obtaining both the transformations and the <b>reference</b> <b>shape</b> at once in two steps. First, we compute a <b>reference</b> <b>shape</b> and affine transformations. Second, we upgrade these transformations to the sought after similarity or euclidean transformations. In practice each of these two steps involves solving a non-convex optimization problem. We provide convex approximations and closed-form solutions. As opposed to the classical alternation approach, our stratified approach processes data in batch. It gracefully deals with missing data. We provide results on synthetic and real data sets. Compared to the alternation schema, our algorithm obtains lower error in both affine and euclidean cases, especially for shapes with high deformations. ...|$|E

The method does not require the selection of a <b>reference</b> <b>shape</b> or registration order and hence it is unbiased towards any of the registered shapes. The functional to be minimized is non-linear in the transformation parameters and thus computationally complex. We therefore propose a first order approximation that estimates the transformation parameters in a closed form, with computational complexity (see text for symbol) (N 2). Using a set of wrist bones, we show that the least-squares minimization and the proposed approximation converge to the same solution.

In the case where the diffeo-morphisms from the reference element are all affine, i. e., mesh consists of parallelotopes, it is standard that the rate of convergence in L 2 exceeds by one the degree of the largest full polynomial space contained in the reference space of shape functions. When the diffeomor-phism is multilinear, the rate of convergence for the same space of <b>reference</b> <b>shape</b> function may degrade severely, the more so when the form degree is larger.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a general {{approach}} for performing model-based reconstruction. The task consists in deforming a <b>reference</b> <b>shape</b> in order to extract a geometric model from a 3 D dataset. To achieve this goal, two complementary approaches have been widely used. The deformable model framework locally applies internal and external forces to fit 3 D data. The non-rigid registration framework iteratively computes the best global transformation that minimizes the distance between a model and the data. We first show that applying a global transformation on a surface model, is equivalent to applying some global forces on a deformable model. Second we propose a scheme where we combine the registration framework with the deformable model framework.

40|$|In many {{different}} problems, data analysis requires one to first compensate {{for a global}} transformation between the different datasets of shape data. This is known as procrustes analysis in the statistics and shape analysis literature [1, 3]. More precisely, it is called generalized procrustes analysis when more than two shape data are to be registered. In this problem, one global transformation per observed shape has to be computed, so that the shapes are mapped to a common coordinate frame whereby they look as ‘similar ’ as possible. This process is called also rigid registration. The classical approach to generalized procrustes analysis is to select one of the shapes as a <b>reference</b> <b>shape,</b> and register {{each of the other}} shapes to the reference in turn by solving the absolute orientation problem. It is common to then alternate a re-estimation of the <b>reference</b> <b>shape,</b> as the average of the registered shapes, with shape registration.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a reduced basis hybrid method (RBHM) for the {{approximation}} of partial differential equations in domains represented by complex networks where topological features are recurrent. The RBHM is applied to Stokes equations in domains which are decomposable into smaller similar blocks that are properly coupled. The RBHM is built upon the reduced basis element method (RBEM) and it takes advantage from both the reduced basis methods (RB) and the domain decomposition method. We move from the consideration that the blocks composing the computational domain are topologically similar to a few <b>reference</b> <b>shapes.</b> On the latter, representative solutions, corresponding to the same governing partial differential equations, are computed for different values of some parameters of interest, representing, for example, the deformation of the blocks. A generalized transfinite mapping is used in order to produce a global map from the <b>reference</b> <b>shapes</b> of each block to any deformed configuration. The desired solution on the given original computational domain is recovered as projection of the previously precomputed solutions and then glued across subdomain interfaces by suitable coupling conditions. The geometrical parametrization of the domain, by transfinite mapping, induces non-affine parameter dependence: an empirical interpolation technique is used to recover an approximate affine parameter dependence and a sub– sequent offline/online decomposition of the reduced basis procedure. This computational decomposition yields a considerable reduction of the proble...|$|R
