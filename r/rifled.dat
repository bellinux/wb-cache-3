5|$|The {{armament}} of the Warrior-class ships {{was intended}} to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten <b>rifled</b> 110-pounder breech-loading guns, twenty-six 68-pounders, and four <b>rifled</b> breech-loading 40-pounder guns.|$|E
5|$|A gun {{emplacement}} is {{a position}} or platform specially prepared to support large heavy guns and artillery. The first type of gun put on Fort Pasir Panjang was the 7-inch <b>Rifled</b> Muzzle-Loading (R.M.L.). Two of these guns were first installed in 1878 {{so as to}} provide a temporary defence for the fort. They were, however, removed soon after.|$|E

The Lee–Enfield No. 4 series <b>rifles</b> that were converted to 7.62×51mm NATO were re-designated as the L8 series of <b>rifles</b> with the <b>rifles</b> being refitted with 7.62×51mm NATO barrels, new bolt faces and extractor claws, new rear sights and new 10-round 7.62×51mm NATO magazines that were produced by RSAF Enfield to replace the old 10-round [...]303 British magazines. The appearance of the L8 series <b>rifles</b> were no different from the original No. 4 <b>rifles,</b> except for the new barrel (which still retained the original No.4 <b>rifle</b> bayonet lugs) and magazine.

5|$|Fresh {{worries about}} France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} <b>rifled</b> cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about the security of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy <b>rifled</b> breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for use against fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder {{guns on the}} main deck and 11 <b>rifled</b> breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight of these were also on the main deck {{and the other three}} served as chase guns on the upper deck, two at the bow and one aft.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of ironclads {{tended to}} become concentrated {{in a small}} number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of <b>rifled</b> versus smoothbore guns and breech-loading versus muzzle-loading.|$|E

5|$|The ships mounted four 10-inch <b>rifled</b> muzzle-loading guns in twin-gun turrets {{fore and}} aft of the superstructure. The guns could fire both solid shot and {{explosive}} shells. They were mounted on carriages that used hydraulic jacks to elevate and depress the guns.|$|E
5|$|This gun was {{retrofitted}} into German and Dutch Leopard 2s, and {{chosen as}} the main gun of the Spanish Leopard 2E and the Greek Leopard 2HEL. It was tested on the British Challenger 2 as a potential replacement for its current weapon, the <b>rifled</b> L30 120mm cannon.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{advances}} in military technology made the new defences became obsolete {{before the end}} of the decade. The introduction of <b>rifled</b> breech-loading guns, capable of firing explosive shells, and the construction of armour-plated warships left Hurst's guns and fortifications inadequate. Fears grew in 1859 that France might invade England, potentially in a surprise attack. A 1859 Royal Commission recommended that Hurst, as one of the key forts protecting Portsmouth, should be upgraded as a matter of priority.|$|E

5|$|These {{problems}} {{influenced the}} British to equip ships with muzzle-loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s. After a brief introduction of 100-pounder or 9.5-inch (240mm) smoothbore Somerset Gun, which weighed 6.5tons (6.6 t), the Admiralty introduced 7-inch (178mm) <b>rifled</b> guns, weighing 7tons. These {{were followed by}} a series of increasingly mammoth weapons—guns weighing 12, 25, 25, 38 and finally 81tons, with calibre increasing from 8-inch (203mm) to 16-inch (406mm).|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, {{the advent}} of steam ships meant that enemy vessels could sail up the Thames far more quickly than before, {{reducing}} the time available for forts to intercept them. <b>Rifled</b> guns and turret-mounted weapons and new armour-plating meant that enemy warships could fire on forts such as Tilbury from downstream more easily while being protected from their guns. Fears of an potential invasion by Napoleon III of France led to the establishment Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom in 1859. The Commission reported the following year and recommended that new, more powerful forts be built further downstream, with defences such as Tilbury Fort forming a second-line of defence. Work began on strengthening Tilbury in 1868, {{under the direction of}} the then Captain Charles Gordon, focusing on adding heavier gun positions able to fire upstream to support the new forts. The west, north-east and east bastions and the south-east curtain wall were altered to house thirteen <b>rifled</b> muzzle-loading guns, protected by brick walls, earthworks and iron shields. Initially 7-ton, 7-inch (7,112 kg, 17 cm) guns were deployed but these were upgraded to 9-inch ((22 cm) weapons by 1888, supported by a heavier 25-ton, 11-inch (25,401 kg, 27 cm) gun. The old Tudor block-house was destroyed to make way for the new guns.|$|E

The breech-loading guns {{were of a}} new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an {{armoured}} target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration, and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the guns from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Following the Confederate raid on Washington that {{resulted}} in the Battle of Fort Stevens, new assessments were made of weak spots in Washington's defenses. In the three years between the construction of Fort Stanton and the attack on Fort Stevens, Fort Stanton's perimeter had been greatly increased with the addition of two subsidiary forts and additional rifle pits and trenches, as well as the completion of the military ring road. A report by Maj. Gen. Christopher C. Augur of the U.S. Volunteers recommended Fort Stanton receive one 32-pounder howitzer, two 4½-inch <b>rifled</b> guns, four 12-pounder howitzers, and two 12-pounder Napoleons to bolster its defenses and control its position {{at the center of the}} Eastern Branch defenses.|$|E

5|$|The Caio Duilio {{class was}} a pair of ironclad turret ships built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1870s and 1880s. They were fitted with the largest guns available, 17.72in (450mm) <b>rifled</b> muzzle-loading guns, and were the largest, fastest and most {{powerful}} ships of their day. To save weight on such large vessels, the ship's designer, Benedetto Brin adopted a radical solution for the time: he reserved armor only for the central portion of the ship where it protected the ships' engines and ammunition magazines, {{while the rest of the}} hull were extensively sub-divided with watertight compartments.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of <b>rifled</b> guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E

Two Challenger 2s were modified to undergo firing trials.
