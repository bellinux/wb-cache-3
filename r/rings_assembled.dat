40|$|SummaryThe {{eukaryotic}} chaperonin TRiC/CCT uses ATP cycling to fold many essential {{proteins that}} other chaperones cannot fold. This 1 MDa hetero-oligomer {{consists of two}} identical stacked <b>rings</b> <b>assembled</b> from eight paralogous subunits, each containing a conserved ATP-binding domain. Here, we report a dramatic asymmetry in the ATP utilization cycle of this ring-shaped chaperonin, despite its apparently symmetric architecture. Only four of the eight different subunits bind ATP at physiological concentrations. ATP binding and hydrolysis by the low-affinity subunits is fully dispensable for TRiC function in vivo. The conserved nucleotide-binding hierarchy among TRiC subunits is evolutionarily modulated through differential nucleoside contacts. Strikingly, high- and low-affinity subunits are spatially segregated within two contiguous hemispheres in the ring, generating an asymmetric power stroke that drives the folding cycle. This unusual mode of ATP utilization likely serves to orchestrate a directional mechanism underlying TRiC/CCT's unique ability to fold complex eukaryotic proteins...|$|E

The bacteriophage T 7 gene 4 helicase/primase proteins act in T 7 DNA replication. We have used electron microscopy, three-dimensional reconstruction, and protein crosslinking to demonstrate that both proteins form hexameric rings around single-stranded DNA. Each subunit has two lobes, so the hexamer appears to be two-tiered, with a small ring stacked on a large ring. The single-stranded DNA passes through the central hole of the hexamer, and the data exclude substantial wrapping of the DNA about or within the protein ring. Further, the hexamer binds DNA with a defined polarity as the smaller ring of the hexamer points toward the 5 ' end of the DNA.

40|$|El presente articulo se encuentra aceptado con modificaciones. Background: The caseinolytic {{protease}} (Clp) {{is crucial}} for chloroplast biogenesis and proteostasis. The Arabidopsis Clp consists of two heptameric rings (P and R <b>rings)</b> <b>assembled</b> from nine distinct subunits. Hsp 100 chaperones (ClpC 1 / 2 and ClpD) are believed to dock to the axial pores of Clp and then transfer unfolded polypeptides destined to degradation. The adaptor proteins ClpT 1 and 2 attach to the protease, apparently blocking the chaperone binding sites. This competition was suggested to regulate Clp activity. Also, monomerization of ClpT 1 from dimers in the stroma triggers P and R ring association. So, oligomerization status of ClpT 1 seems to control the assembly of the Clp protease. Results: In this work, ClpT 1 was obtained in a recombinant form and purified. In solution, it mostly consists of monomers while dimers represent {{a small fraction of}} the population. Enrichment of the dimer fraction could only be achieved by stabilization with a crosslinker reagent. We demonstrate that ClpT 1 specifically interacts with the Hsp 100 chaperones ClpC 2 and ClpD. In addition, ClpT 1 stimulates the ATPase activity of ClpD by more than 50 % when both are present in a 1 : 1 ratio. Outside this optimal proportion, the stimulatory effect of ClpT 1 on the ATPase activity of ClpD declines. Conclusions: The accessory protein ClpT 1 behaves as a monomer in solution. It interacts with the chloroplastic Hsp 100 chaperones ClpC 2 and ClpD and tightly modulates the ATPase activity of the latter. Our results provide new experimental evidence that may contribute to revise and expand the existing models that were proposed to explain the roles of this poorly understood regulatory protein.

To cause rice blast disease, the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae develops a pressurized dome-shaped cell called an appressorium, which physically ruptures the leaf cuticle to gain entry to plant tissue. Here, we report that a toroidal F-actin network assembles in the appressorium by means of four septin guanosine triphosphatases, which polymerize into a dynamic, hetero-oligomeric ring. Septins scaffold F-actin, via the ezrin-radixin-moesin protein Tea 1, and phosphatidylinositide interactions at the appressorium plasma membrane.

40|$|SummaryPolar body {{extrusion}} (PBE) is {{the specialized}} asymmetric division by which oocytes accomplish reduction in ploidy {{and retention of}} cytoplasm. During maternal gametogenesis, as in male meiosis and mitosis, cytokinesis is accomplished by a ring rich in active Rho, myosin, and formin-nucleated F-actin [1 – 7]. However, unlike mitosis, wherein the contractile ring encircles the cell equator, the polar body <b>ring</b> <b>assembles</b> as a discoid cortical washer. Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the meiotic contractile ring transforms during closure from a disc above the spindle to a cylinder around the spindle midzone. The meiotic midbody tube comprises stacked cytoskeletal rings. This topological transition suggests a novel mechanism for constriction of an initially discoid cytokinetic ring. Analysis of mouse PBE indicates that midbody tube formation is a conserved process. Depletion of the scaffold protein anillin (ANI- 1) from C. elegans results in large and unstable polar bodies that often fuse with the oocyte. Anillin is dispensable for contractile ring assembly, initiation, and closure but {{is required for the}} meiotic contractile ring to transform from a disc into a tube. We propose that cytoskeletal bundling by anillin promotes formation of the midbody tube, which ensures the fidelity of PBE...|$|R

To study the dynamics and temporal hierarchy of divisome assembly in Bacillus subtilis, we have examined the in vivo localization pattern {{of a set of}} division proteins fused to green fluorescent protein in germinating spores and vegetative cells. Using time series and time-lapse microscopy, we show that the FtsZ <b>ring</b> <b>assembles</b> early and concomitantly with FtsA, ZapA, and EzrA. After a time delay of at least 20 % of the cell cycle, a second set of division proteins, including GpsB, FtsL, DivIB, FtsW, Pbp 2 B, and DivIVA, are recruited to midcell. Together, our data provide in vivo evidence for two-step assembly of the divisome. Interestingly, overproduction of FtsZ advances the temporal assembly of EzrA but not of DivIVA, suggesting that a signal different from that of FtsZ polymerization drives the assembly of late divisome proteins. Microarray analysis shows that FtsZ depletion or overexpression does not significantly alter the transcription of division genes, supporting the hypothesis that cell {{division in}} B. subtilis is mainly regulated at the posttranscriptional level. ...|$|R
