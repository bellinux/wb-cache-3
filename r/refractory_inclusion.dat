40|$|<b>Refractory</b> <b>inclusions</b> in {{carbonaceous}} chondrite meteorites {{are of particular}} interest because both long- and short-lived chronometers have shown {{that they are the}} oldest sampled material to have formed in the Solar System. The objective {{of this study was to}} establish high-precision petrographic, chemical and isotopic analyses of <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions</b> and thus offer insights into the chemical and astrophysical environments present during the formation of the Solar System. The former presence of the short-lived isotope 26 Al (T 1 / 2 = ca. 730 KYr) has been established in a majority of <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Recent studies using both solution-based and in situ methodologies have suggested that the initial 26 Al/ 27 Al 0 value of <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions</b> is ca. 6 x 10 - 5, higher than the established "canonical" value of [5. 00 +/- 0. 05] x 10 - 5. Knowing the initial concentration of 26 Al within the Solar System provides a useful anchor from which ancient materials can be dated. Petrographic and trace element analyses were performed on nine newly-extracted <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions</b> from CV 3 and CK 3 chondrites. These analyses revealed all but three <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions</b> to have experienced multiple episodes of melting and evaporation prior to crystal closure. Mg isotope analyses were performed on eight of the newly extracted <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions</b> in addition to five inter-laboratory samples. All <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions</b> shown to have remained unaltered following crystal-closure, regardless of thermal history prior to closure, yielded a model 26 Al/ 27 Al 0 of [4. 89 x 0. 265] x 10 - 5; within error of the canonical value. This result confirms that 26 Al was homogenous and at canonical concentrations in the solar nebula.

40|$|International audienceHigh-precision stable Sr isotopic {{variations}} (88 Sr/ 86 Sr) {{are reported}} {{in a variety of}} terrestrial samples, martian and lunar meteorites, HED, undifferentiated primitive meteorites, chondrules and refractory inclusions. Almost all the whole-rock samples are isotopically indistinguishable at a 50 parts per million (ppm) level. The exceptions are CV and CO chondrites which are isotopically light and for which we believe that their isotopic composition is controlled by the proportion of refractory material. Five separated chondrules and one <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusion</b> from Allende are isotopically light, with δ 88 / 86 Sr fractionations up to − 1. 73 ‰, whereas the matrix is enriched in the heavy isotopes (δ 88 / 86 Sr = + 0. 66 ‰). The depletion in heavy isotopes observed in chondrules and refractory inclusions could be attributed to the condensation of a material already depleted in Sr, however, in that case more than 60 % of the original material would be unaccounted. We propose instead that isotopic fractionation by electromagnetic sorting of ionized heavy Sr from neutral Sr in the early solar system for the origin of the fractionation observed in refractory inclusions and redistribution of Sr by aqueous alteration for the origin of the fractionation observed in chondrules and matrix. We conclude that CV and CO chondrites are not the primary building blocks for Earth and Mars.

We investigate here analytically {{the dynamics of the}}ir components (chondrules, <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions,</b> metal/sulfide and matrix grains) in protoplanetary disks prior to their incorporation in chondrite parent bodies. We find the dynamics of the solids, subject to gas drag, to be essentially controlled by the "gas-solid decoupling parameter" S≡St/α, the ratio of the dimensionless stopping time to the turbulence parameter. The decoupling of the solid particles relative to the gas is significant when S exceeds unity. S is expected to increase with time and heliocentric distance.

40|$|Abstract-Major {{and trace}} {{elements}} {{were determined by}} INAA in two hibonite-rich refractory inclusions and a dark clast from Vigarano, three refractory inclusions from Leoville, and a hibonite-rich and a melilite-rich fraction from a composite <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusion</b> from Allende. The refractory inclusions from Vigarano and Leoville are all similar to their counterparts in Allende in that they have groups I, II, and III refractory element fractionation patterns, but {{a large proportion of}} these Vigarano and Leoville in-clusions also contain refractory element features that are very infrequently encountered in Allende in-clusions. For example, Vigarano 1623 - 2 is a group I inclusion with a large Ce anomaly (La/Cc = 2. 34 +- 0. 32 relative to Cl); Vigarano 1623 - 3 is a group III in which OS is strongly fractionated relative to other refractory siderophiles (Os/Re = 2. 13 + 0. 08 relative to Cl) : and Leoville 3537 -l is a modified group II in which removal of refractory REEs and condensation of the remaining REEs both occurred at unusually low temperatures. All samples from Vigarano and Leoville, including a fine-and inclusion, have Na, Au, and other volatile element concen~ations at or below {{the low end of the}} concent~tion ranges for these elements in AlIende coarse-grained inclusions. This is consistent with the much lower amounts of Na-rich, secondary alteration products in the Vigarano and Leoville inclusions than in the ones from Allende. Even the Vigarano dark clast has a lower Na content than Allende dark clasts...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} petrographic description {{as well as}} {{results on}} the major- and trace-element chemistry and on Mg, Ca, and Ti isotopic compositions of three <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions,</b> including 3413 - 1 / 31 inclusion from Lance and Murchison 7 - 228 and 7 - 753, the mineralogy of which {{is dominated by the}} oxide minerals spinel, hibonite, and perovskite. The microspherules examined seem to constitute a separate class of <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions,</b> characterized by a distinct morphology and mineralogy; large excesses of Ca- 48 and Ti- 50, and Mg- 26 depletions. It is suggested that this type of inclusions must have formed early, prior to the dilution of isotopic anomalies by mixing processes, and in an area characterized by excesses of Ca- 48 and Ti- 50, depletions of Mg- 26, and a lack of Al- 26...|$|R
50|$|CH chondrites are {{remarkable}} for their very tiny chondrules, typically only about 0.02 mm (20 micrometres) in diameter. They {{have a small}} proportion of equally tiny <b>refractory</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Dusty material occurs as discrete clasts, rather than as a true matrix. CH chondrites are also distinguished by extreme depletions in volatile elements.|$|R
