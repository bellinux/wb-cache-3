40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{consistently}} demonstrated that either occupational or <b>recreational</b> physical <b>activity</b> is pro tective against colon cancer. However, {{it is unclear}} whether <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> is similarly protective among those who engage in high or low occupational activity. We therefore compared 440 male cases of colorectal cancer with 1164 male hospital patients. Occupational activity was defined according to job title, while <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> was assessed by questionnaire for three different periods of life. Occupational activity was protective with respect to colorectal cancer irrespective of whether one engaged in <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> at any different period of life. In contrast, recrea tional activity, performed at 20 - 44 years of age appeared to decrease colon cancer risk by 10 - 25 % irrespective of the in tensity of job activity. The present results suggest that, although we observed a larger effect with occupational <b>activity</b> than with <b>recreational</b> <b>activity,</b> middle-aged men may reduce their risk of colorectal cancer if they exercise when they are not working. These findings need to be confirmed in other population...|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} letter, Gruening also {{promoted}} {{the possibility of}} the dam creating a thriving tourism industry in Interior Alaska, a hypothesis that was raised by other dam supporters as well.

5|$|Snow affects human {{activity}} in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by {{snow on the}} travel surface.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} econometric {{models of}} <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> duration that individuals pursue throughout the week.

The study uses a dataset of 941 individuals from General Social Survey 1998. It reveals that work duration, in-home activity duration, sequence of <b>recreational</b> <b>activity,</b> home ownership, companionship with children, work end time etc. have {{significant impact on the}} duration of daily out-of-home <b>recreational</b> <b>activity.</b> This research would have implications on advancement of activitybased travel modeling and help in making informed decisions. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relative}} importance of both objective and perceived environmental features for physical activity in older English adults. Self-reported physical activity levels of 8, 281 older adults were used to compute volumes of outdoor <b>recreational</b> and commuting <b>activity.</b> Perceptions of neighborhood environment supportiveness were drawn from a questionnaire survey and a geographical information system was used to derive objective measures. Negative binominal regression models were fitted to examine associations. Perceptions of neighborhood environment were more associated with outdoor <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> (over 10 % change per standard deviation) than objective measures (5 – 8 % change). Commuting activity was associated with several objective measures (up to 16 % change). We identified different environmental determinants of <b>recreational</b> and commuting <b>activity</b> in older adults. Perceptions of environmental supportiveness for <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> appear more important than actual neighborhood characteristics. Understanding how older people perceive neighborhoods might be key to encouraging outdoor <b>recreational</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

5|$|Mount Thielsen, or Big Cowhorn (Klamath: hisc’akwaleeʔas), is an extinct {{shield volcano}} in the Oregon High Cascades, near Mount Bailey. Because eruptive {{activity}} ceased 250,000years ago, glaciers have heavily eroded the volcano's structure, creating precipitous slopes and a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning strikes and creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> such as skiing and hiking.|$|E
