5|$|After the expedition, the {{independent}} country of Darfur, and its inhabitants, {{became part of}} Sudan. The £500,000 bill {{for the cost of}} the expedition was sent to the Egyptian Government in Cairo for payment by the Egyptian taxpayers. The British commanders of the operation were also recognised. In 1917, Wingate became the British High Commissioner for Egypt. The commander of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition, Kelly, became the first Governor of the Darfur province with his office located in the Sultan's palace throne <b>room</b> <b>until</b> May 1917. He was then promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was part of the Australian Mounted Division fighting in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The {{other key}} room was the Cabinet <b>Room.</b> <b>Until</b> {{the opening of}} the Battle of France, which began on 10 May 1940, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's war cabinet met at the War Rooms only once, in October 1939. Following Winston Churchill's {{appointment}} as Prime Minister, Churchill visited the Cabinet Room in May 1940 and declared: 'This is the room from which I will direct the war'. In total 115 Cabinet meetings were held at the Cabinet War Rooms, the last on 28 March 1945, when the German V-weapon bombing campaign came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard <b>Room,</b> <b>until</b> the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
50|$|Services were {{initially}} held in school <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> the completion and official {{dedication of the}} Church building on 1967-12-16.|$|R
60|$|The Rovers and Stanley Browne {{were kept}} in the <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> Monday morning. During that time their meals were sent to them, and Professor Sharp came to see them twice.|$|R
60|$|The company {{passed out}} into other <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> {{no one was}} left but Mrs. Blakesly, the professor, and Ware. Miss Powell was talking again, and to Ware mainly. Ware was thoughtful, Miss Powell radiant.|$|R
5|$|Manchester City's first {{transfer}} {{business of}} the season brought goalkeeper Ken Mulhearn to the club from Stockport County on 21 September, a deal that involved City's back-up goalkeeper Alan Ogley moving in the opposite direction. Harry Dowd kept goal in the next match, a 1–0 defeat at Arsenal, but then dislocated a finger, prompting a debut for Mulhearn in the season's first Manchester derby. Mulhearn was reputedly so nervous before the match that Allison locked him in the medical <b>room</b> <b>until</b> he calmed down. Colin Bell scored the opener after five minutes, but two Bobby Charlton goals meant a win for Manchester United. In {{the second half of}} the match, Bowles exchanged punches with Brian Kidd, though neither man was sent off, largely thanks to the intervention of their respective captains. The derby loss was followed by a third consecutive defeat, at Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the <b>room</b> <b>until</b> dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that {{it all comes down to}} how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E
5|$|The main {{family living}} {{quarters}} {{are located in}} the 1752 addition. The staircase hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster ceiling is attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, {{on the north side of}} the house, is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, this room was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting the library to the staircase hall and the drawing room is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal <b>room,</b> <b>until</b> Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri.|$|E
50|$|The {{local board}} met in rented <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> 1881, when {{a town hall}} was opened in King Street. In 1924 Twickenham UDC {{purchased}} the historic York House, and after restoration this became the offices for the borough.|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{she passed}} through several <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> she came upon Tiktok, {{standing}} motionless. It really seemed, then, {{that she had}} found a friend in this mysterious palace, so she hastened to wind up the machine man's action and speech and thoughts.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} library will {{be converted}} to a lecture hall, student lounge and small meeting <b>rooms.</b> <b>Until</b> the new library is open, a Library Concierge will remain open from this site. The county library in Westampton is being enhanced for RCBC students.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the episode, flashbacks {{depict a}} young Sam (Ford) and Dean (Canipe) on Christmas Eve of 1991; {{with their father}} out on a hunt, the {{brothers}} are staying alone in a motel <b>room</b> <b>until</b> he returns. As Sam wraps an object he obtained from Bobby Singer as a present for his father, he begins to question Dean about what their father is doing. Although Dean brushes him off, Sam reveals that he has read their father's hunting journal. Dean acquiesces, and confirms that their father hunts monsters. This revelation terrifies Sam, who is afraid that the monsters will come after them. Later that night, Dean wakes Sam up and claims that their father briefly returned and left presents. When Sam's gifts {{end up being a}} Barbie doll and a sparkly baton, Dean admits that he stole them from a nearby house. Despite this, Sam appreciates what Dean tried to do for him, and gives him the gift meant for their fatherthe amulet necklace that Dean has worn ever since.|$|E
5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the <b>room.</b> <b>Until</b> this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E
25|$|The Sanctuary of the Knife {{lost its}} {{function}} in the third building period and was then used as a storage <b>room,</b> <b>until</b> it was destroyed {{in the first half}} of the 6th Dynasty.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1989, some of {{the older}} rooms were torn down and {{construction}} began on two additional three-story buildings. The rooms in this building contained televisions (which were eventually added to all the rooms.) Telephones were not added to any of the <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> 1990.|$|R
50|$|Originally from Upham, a {{small village}} south of Swindon, Thomas Goddard {{acquired}} the Manor of Swindon in 1563 from the Crown. He also purchased the Crown Inn later, re-named the Goddard Arms, which become Swindon's de facto Town Hall, Courthouse and Council <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> the mid-19th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} began life as {{a one-room}} schoolhouse rolled into the hamlet on logs in 1875. Fifty years later {{it was one of}} the few buildings to survive a fire that destroyed many other buildings in the community. It remained in use as a school, expanded to two <b>rooms,</b> <b>until</b> 1981.|$|R
25|$|The station {{opened on}} 31 May 1898. A station {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1903, {{and served as a}} waiting <b>room</b> <b>until</b> 1916. From then a waiting shed was used. The station is being considered for a lengthening of the platforms, but this is difficult due to it being located in a sharp curve.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 2013, the NIS agents raided Lee Seok-ki's {{office with}} the warrant at 8:10 am, but faced {{resistance}} of Lee's aides and succeeded to enter the office only after 20 minutes of struggle. Inside the office, Lee Seok-ki's fellow lawmakers including Kim Mi-hee blocked the door of another Lee's office <b>room</b> <b>until</b> 3:00 pm.|$|E
25|$|Scott's {{stage fright}} was worsening. During the October 19, 1952 live {{broadcast}} of NBC's Colgate Comedy Hour, Scott reportedly hid in her dressing <b>room</b> <b>until</b> the casting director, Howard Ross, taunted her {{to face the}} audience. By the end of October 1952, of the original 48 big-name actors under contract to Paramount in 1947, only four were left—Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, William Holden, and Lizabeth Scott.|$|E

25|$|The NIS agents, who raided Lee Seok-ki's {{office in}} the National Assembly with the warrant at 8:10 am, faced {{resistance}} of Lee's aides {{and were able to}} enter the office only after 20 minutes of struggle. But inside the office, Lee Seok-ki's fellow lawmakers including Kim Mi-hee blocked the door of another Lee's office <b>room</b> <b>until</b> 3:00 pm. Ahead of the raid, Lee's aides are alleged to have shredded documents of unknown content.|$|E
25|$|From the mid-sixteenth {{century the}} {{surviving}} part of St Paul's – essentially the south {{aisle of the}} Medieval church {{and part of the}} nave consisting of two bays - served as a school <b>room</b> <b>until</b> 1929. A second school room was added {{on the north side of}} the building in 1833. A marble memorial tablet was erected around 1902 on the north wall to two former pupils who fell in the Second Boer War.|$|E
25|$|Duncan, {{aided by}} Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the {{elevator}} evacuation from the Promenade <b>Room</b> <b>until</b> the fire renders the express elevators unsafe. Not heeding Duncan's directions, a group is killed when their elevator {{stops on the}} fire's floor. Bigelow is {{having an affair with}} his secretary Lorrie, and both get killed when the fire traps them on the 65th floor. Parker recommends using the stairs to escape, but the fire exit from the Promenade Room is blocked by a wheelbarrow full of hardened cement.|$|E
50|$|The Grim {{brothers}} {{used the}} eastern half of the first floor for outpatient surgery and treatment <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> they established the Grim Brothers Hospital in 1910. A new hospital building was completed for them just south of the First District Normal School; however, Edward Grim continued to use the original building for his office until his death in 1936.|$|R
50|$|Regina Hall was {{established}} in 1965 as a convent for the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. The building was leased to the College as a residence hall in 1969. The College purchased the building in 1994. It was almost all single <b>rooms</b> <b>until</b> the space was remodeled around 2001 to include single, double, and quad.|$|R
50|$|The seven-story {{building}} is categorized as being 20th-century Baroque Revival architecture, and contains 66 hotel <b>rooms.</b> <b>Until</b> 1920, it was operated by Charles W. Cornelius (1856-1923), who named the hotel {{for his family}} and his brother, Colonel Thomas R. Cornelius. Their father founded the town of Cornelius west of Portland after emigrating to Oregon with Joseph Meek.|$|R
25|$|In 1833, de Montferrand {{was hired}} to {{redesign}} the eastern state rooms and create the Field Marshal's Hall and the Small Throne Room (9 & 10). In 1837, a fire broke out. Its cause is unknown, but its spread is blamed on de Montferrand. The architect was being hurried by the Tsar for an early completion, so he used wooden materials where stone would have been better. Additionally, between the hurriedly built wooden partition walls disused fireplaces were concealed; their chimneys, coupled with the narrow ventilation shafts, acted as flues for the fire, allowing it to spread undetected between the walls from room to <b>room</b> <b>until</b> {{it was too late}} to extinguish.|$|E
25|$|The actors first {{receive the}} script {{in form of}} a table draft and film the episode the next Monday, by which time the story may have changed drastically. The script keeps {{evolving}} during shooting. The actors first perform scenes as written, then act out the alts or improvise, to later allow the producers and editors to choose the gags that ultimately work best. Morris estimated that 20 percent of each episode are improv. Episodes are generally shot over five days, which may increase to several weeks if weather conditions delay filming outdoor scenes. The scenes are put together in the editing <b>room</b> <b>until</b> they achieve the emotional and comedic tone the producers are looking for. The first cut of generally 27 minutes has to be cut down to the air version's 21 minutes and 35 seconds, which may air {{as little as a}} few days later. Only upon completion do the producers know what version ends up in the episode.|$|E
25|$|After {{capsizing}} {{the main}} engines of Finn-Baltic immediately {{went out and}} the emergency diesel generator started automatically. However, it ran only {{for a short time}} and after a while even battery-operated lights dimmed and died out. The chief engineer heard someone yelling in the darkness and found the chief officer from the corridor outside the control room in a shock-like state. After getting a case of soft drinks from the ship's stores and dry clothes for the chief officer they waited several hours in the switchboard <b>room,</b> <b>until</b> the rising water forced them to move to the aftmost part of the engine room next to the propeller shaft. Even before the accident the chief engineer had planned to find his way to this location in case the vessel capsized because there was no double bottom and, once free of its cargo, the combination would stay afloat upside-down. After 20 minutes they heard someone banging the hull outside the ship.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first school}} that {{opened its doors}} in 1890 as Middlesborough Public School was likely located on the lower floor {{of what is now}} the Masonic Lodge {{building}} on 20th Street.
