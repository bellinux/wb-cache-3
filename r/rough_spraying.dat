40|$|The present work {{reports a}} simple and direct {{sputtering}} deposition to form solid state TiO 2 |Ag independent plasmonic solar cells. The independent plasmonic solar cells {{are based on a}} Schottky barrier between two materials, TiO 2 and Ag. The Ag functions as the absorber generating “hot” electrons, as well as the contact for the solar cell. The Ag sputtering is performed for different durations, to form Ag nanoparticles with a wide size distribution on the surface of <b>rough</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis deposited TiO 2. Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements show photovoltaic activity below the TiO 2 bandgap, which is caused by the silver nanoparticles that have a wide plasmonic band, leading to the generation of “hot” electrons. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis supports the “hot” electron injection mechanism by following the Ag plasmon band and detecting local photovoltages. The measurements show that electrons are formed in the Ag upon illumination and are injected into the TiO 2, producing photovoltaic activity. J–V measurements show photocurrents up to 1. 18 mA cm− 2 and photovoltages up to 430 mV are achieved, with overall efficiencies of 0. 2 %. This is, to our knowledge, the highest performance reported for such independent plasmonic solar cells...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to the effect of surface modification on lid warming of busbar trunking system BD 2 which is manufactured by Siemens company in Mohelnice town (CZ). By using experimental methods, it investigates heat transfer by radiation and natural convection. It evaluates which type of surface modification is more effective by transfer heat. This study uses a method of emisivity comparison and a procedure given in standards for heat up test afterwards. It led to recognition, that various colour shades used on busbar system have similar high emissivity. Smooth colour spraying transfers heat a bit more effectively than <b>rough</b> colour <b>spraying.</b> Outputs of supplementary measurements give basis for numerical simulations in SolidWorks software. Numerical analysis assists to interpret results, for example by sensitivity study of heat transfer depending on emissivity...|$|R
40|$|In {{applications}} such as {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) or photovoltaic cells a homogenous voltage distribution in the large anode layer needs to be ensured by including a metal grid with a transparent conductor layer. To ensure sufficient conductivity, relatively thick metal lines are used, which increases the risk of electrical shorts between the anode and the cathode. For this reason an insulating layer is needed on top of the metal lines. The thick metal lines limit the choice of deposition method, since some methods such as spin coating require smooth surfaces and cannot be used for applying the insulator. Here, a spray coating process has been studied as a potential alternative deposition method to create thin resistive layers on <b>rough</b> surfaces. <b>Spray</b> coating and Joule heating has been used for the alignment of insulator films on printed metal lines. It was demonstrated that spray coating can be used to cover the printed metal lines which have high peaks on them. The spray coating forms electrically insulating layers even though the film thickness is less than the height of the peaks. The leakage current through the dielectric was on the order of 10 - 6 A/cm 2...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we report {{on a group of}} {{complementary}} human osteoblast in vitro test methods for the preclinical evaluation of 3 D porous titanium surfaces. The surfaces were prepared by additive manufacturing (electron beam melting, EBM) and plasma spraying, allowing the creation of complex lattice surface geometries. Physical properties of the surfaces were characterised by SEM and profilometry and 3 D in vitro cell culture using human osteoblasts. Primary human osteoblast cells were found to elicit greater differences between titanium sample surfaces than an MG 63 osteoblast-like cell line, particularly in terms of cell survival. Surface morphology was associated with higher osteoblast metabolic activity and mineralisation on <b>rougher</b> titanium plasma <b>spray</b> coated surfaces than smoother surfaces. Differences in osteoblast survival and metabolic activity on titanium lattice structures were also found, despite analogous surface morphology at the cellular level. 3 D confocal microscopy identified osteoblast organisation within complex titanium surface geometries, adhesion, spreading and alignment to the biomaterial strut geometries. Mineralised nodule formation throughout the lattice structures was also observed, and indicative of early markers of bone in-growth on such materials. Testing methods such as those presented are not traditionally considered by medical device manufacturers, but we suggest have value as an increasingly vital tool in efficiently translating pre-clinical studies, especially in balance with current regulatory practice, commercial demands, the 3 Rs and the relative merits of in vitro and in vivo studies.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the survival rate of non-submerged solid-screw ITI dental implants with a <b>rough</b> (titanium plasma <b>sprayed,</b> TPS) {{surface in the}} edentulous maxilla after 1 and 2 years of loading. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Twentyfive patients (mean age 64 years) with edentulous upper jaws received five-seven implants and, after a mean healing time of 6. 9 months, screw-retained implant-supported fixed prostheses. A total of 146 ITI solid screw TPS implants were inserted. The diameter of 56 % of the implants was smaller (3. 3 mm) than the standard (4. 1 mm) and {{the diameter of the}} rest (44 %) was standard. The bone quantity {{of the majority of the}} patients was low and the bone quality poor. Clinical parameters were registered at baseline and at two annual follow-ups. Radiological examinations and assessments were also made at these times. RESULTS: Mean marginal bone level at baseline was measured at a point 4. 52 mm (range 1. 45 - 7. 70, SD 1. 2) apical of the reference point. Mean bone loss from baseline to 1 year of loading was 0. 24 mm (SD 0. 9, P= 0. 002) and from 1 year to 2 years of loading 0. 15 mm (SD 0. 4, P< 0. 001). Five implants failed, four of which were early failures prior to loading. One implant failed shortly after bridge installation. The cumulative survival rate was 96. 6 % after 1 and 2 years. CONCLUSION: ITI TPS solid-screw implants in combination with fixed prostheses had successful survival rates and were found to be a viable treatment alternative in the edentulous maxilla...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{clinical}} study was to test whether peri-implant bone defects can successfully be filled with bone by applying bioresorbable materials for guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedures in conjunction with implants in the transmucosal healing position. Three women and 7 men {{ranging in age from}} 32 to 68 years (median 54. 5) needed tooth replacement with dental implants. Eight to 14 weeks following careful tooth extraction, implants of the ITI Dental Implant System were placed at the extraction sites. At this time, all implants presented dehiscence defects of the alveolar bone partly exposing the <b>rough</b> titanium plasma <b>sprayed</b> (TPS) surfaces. GBR procedures were performed using deproteinized bovine bone mineral (Bio-Oss) as a membrane-supporting material and a bioresorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Gide) as a barrier. The membranes and the flaps were adjusted to fit around the necks of the implants, thus leaving the implants extending transmucosally into the oral cavity. Clinical measurements were taken at 6 sites around each implant (mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal, disto-lingual, lingual, mesio-lingual) using a calibrated periodontal probe. These included: i) defect depth measured from the shoulder of the implant to the first bone-to-implant contact, ii) infrabony defect component measured from the bone crest to the first bone-to-implant contact, iii) defect width measured from the crest to the implant body in a direction perpendicular to the long axis of the implant. The Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Signed Rank Test was applied to detect differences over time. At baseline, the mean defect depth per patient amounted to 3. 6 mm (Standard Deviation 1. 6 mm, range 1. 8 - 6. 8 mm). The deepest extensions of the defects were located at the buccal aspects (mean 7. 8 mm, SD 1. 9 mm). At re-entry, the mean defect had decreased to 2. 5 mm (SD 0. 6 mm). This difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 01). Initially, in 62 % of sites the depth ranged from 0 - 3 mm, in 23 % it ranged from 2 - 4 mm, and in 15 % it amounted to more than 6 mm. Six to 7 months later, at re-entry, 95 % of sites were 3 mm and less in depth and 5 % ranged from 4 - 6 mm. Defect resolution, as assessed by the amount of coverage of the initially exposed rough implant surface, reached a mean value of 86 % (SD 33 %). One hundred percent resolution was accomplished at 8 out of 10 implants, 60 % at one and 0 % at another implant. The tissue at the latter implant showed signs of infection and inflammation during the healing phase. It is concluded that bioresorbable materials in GBR procedures at transmucosal implants can lead to successful bone regeneration into peri-implant defects...|$|R
