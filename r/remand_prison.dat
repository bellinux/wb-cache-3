5|$|In late 1940, an {{engineer}} had created some military inventions which Gjems-Onstad's group {{wanted to bring}} to the Allied forces. It was decided that one of them was to travel to the UK, while Gjems-Onstad was to travel to Stockholm. Gjems-Onstad was joined by three others, and they decided to let themselves be arrested in Östmark in Sweden. They were transported to Stockholm, but the Norwegian legation was not interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was later tipped to contact the British military attaché. He got in contact with Major Malcolm Munthe, who in turn was interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was arrested by Swedish police in Stockholm on 25 March 1941, as parts of Munthe's organisation had been exposed. Gjems-Onstad was imprisoned at the Stockholm police station for 13 days, and then for 59 days in the Stockholm <b>Remand</b> <b>Prison.</b> On 23 May 1941 the government decided that he was to be expelled and banned from entering Sweden (the ban was repealed after the war). He was originally scheduled to be deported to Canada via Moscow and China, but the plans were halted due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was instead sent to the Norwegian refugee camp in Öreryd. He was ordered by the British to escape from Öreryd in October 1941 and travel to Norway. He was captured by the Swedish Home Guard close to the Norwegian border, but was sent by plane to the UK by Swedish authorities in December.|$|E

The van was scheduled to transport the prisoners from North Shore District Court to Auckland Central <b>Remand</b> <b>Prison</b> at Mt Eden. Ashley shared the compartment with two other men, one of whom, George Baker, was classified as a dangerous criminal. Baker attacked Ashley, strangling and stomping on the boy. The victim sustained severe brain injuries. The following day, August 25, at 10:30, his family chose to remove Ashley from life support; Liam Ashley died at 10:45.|$|E

50|$|In the Czech Republic, remand {{takes place}} in <b>remand</b> <b>prisons</b> or in {{separated}} sections of standard <b>prisons.</b> <b>Remand</b> <b>prisons</b> are often in city centres and appertain to court houses. Most <b>remand</b> <b>prisons</b> are over 80 years old, with some, like Pankrác Prison, being more than 125 years old. Men, women and juveniles are held separately. Also persons charged with committing different types of crimes (e.g. unintentional, intentional, violent, etc.) are held separately.Cells have capacity varying between 1—8 beds, with most having between 2—4 beds. Some <b>remand</b> <b>prisons</b> have rooms intended for watching TV, gyms or chapels, but these are exceptional mainly due to overcrowding and lack of space. All have special areas for interviews between the inmates and their attorneys, visiting rooms and courtyards for out-walks.|$|R

The average length of remand custody is around 100 days, with few inmates spending in remand more than 2 years.|$|R
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the <b>remand</b> <b>prison</b> {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the <b>remand</b> <b>prison,</b> meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
500|$|In 1991 a {{group of}} white {{supremacy}} skinheads attacked a couple on a street in Prague after a man called on them to cease nazi salutes. The commotion was witnessed by Pavel Opočenský, a former anti-communist dissident, émigré and famous sculptor, who immediately rushed to help the victims. During the fight, Opočenský used his hunting knife and killed a 17-year-old metal-bar-wielding skinhead. Opočenský was first charged with murder and spent 2 months in a <b>remand</b> <b>prison.</b> He was released from <b>remand</b> <b>prison</b> after the charges were diminished to intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter). He was first convicted by the Municipal Court in Prague and conditionally sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with 4 years probation period. After a lengthy legal proceedings in which higher court repeatedly overturned the Municipal Court's convictions and ordered retrial, Opočenský's actions were finally cleared as legitimate self-defense by the High Court in Prague's decision four and half years later. The trial attracted attention of WP skinheads who conducted various protests. A neo-nazi band Agrese 95 released a song titled [...] "We shall go together and kill Opočenský." ...|$|E
500|$|At 7:00 am on 2 April, an {{estimated}} total of 142 prisoners {{were still in}} control of all the accommodation wings of the prison. Some prisoners on the roof gave clenched fist salutes to the crowd watching below. Some prisoners were wearing prison officers' hats and uniforms, while others were wearing masks improvised from towels and blankets. A banner was unveiled that read [...] "No dead", in response to claims in the press that between eleven and twenty prisoners {{had been killed in}} the rioting. At 10:00 am, C units entered the <b>remand</b> <b>prison</b> and regained control, with six prisoners surrendering peacefully. A Home Office statement was released at 11:45 am stating that no bodies had been found in the <b>remand</b> <b>prison,</b> and 12 prison officers and 37 prisoners had received treatment in hospital to date. Further prisoners surrendered the same day, and by 6:00 pm 114 prisoners remained in the prison. On 3 April newspapers published pictures of the prisoners' [...] "No dead" [...] banner, while still insisting that 20 prisoners had been killed.

50|$|Not all <b>remand</b> <b>prisons</b> grant these privileges, in particular, remand {{prisoners are}} often forced to wear prison uniforms and denied {{additional}} visitation rights, supposedly for safety reasons, although some facilities allow remand prisoners {{to wear a}} uniform that is a different color or otherwise clearly distinguishable from the uniforms of convicted criminals.

500|$|Rioting prisoners gained {{access to}} the <b>remand</b> <b>prison</b> at 12:20 pm through the kitchens in G wing, and began freeing prisoners who were still locked in their cells using stolen keys or improvised tools such as iron bars and fire extinguishers. At this point the rioting prisoners were in control of all {{accommodation}} wings of the prison. A large number of prisoners were on the prison roof, and roof tiles and other missiles were thrown at prison officers on the ground.

50|$|While the Czech {{prison system}} is facing much general {{criticism}} mainly due to overcrowding and under-financing, its shortcomings {{are even more}} felt in the <b>remand</b> <b>prisons,</b> including the Pankrác Prison. Although the principle of not guilty until proven otherwise applies, in reality the inmates held on remand face worse regime than those convicted, as they cannot take part in educational, sport or working activities, mostly because {{they are expected to}} be held only for a limited time (the average is approximately 100 days) before being either released or moved after the verdict.|$|R

2500|$|While {{in prison}} in November 2006, Chee {{reportedly}} became ill, leading to speculation from the SDP {{that he had been}} poisoned.

Four days later, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) asserted that Chee was treated the [...] "same as other prisoners", and that the SDP's claims were [...] "baseless, malicious and seek to undermine the reputation of the Singapore Prison Service". On 3 December 2006, after the doctor at the Queenstown <b>Remand</b> <b>Prison</b> had found traces of blood in Chee's urine, he was admitted under guard to Changi General Hospital. On 10 December, about a dozen of Chee's supporters, including members of his family, held a protest march starting at the Speakers' Corner and ending at Queenstown <b>Remand</b> <b>Prison,</b> where Chee was incarcerated. Several foreign non-government organisations released statements expressing concerns about Chee's health and treatment in prison.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to discuss}} ways of {{opening up the}} design brief when {{designing}} for extreme environments such as intensive care units and <b>remand</b> <b>prisons.</b> Focusing on “designials” (fundamental forms of design being), the methodology intends to illustrate the fact that objects may directly impinge upon certain “existentials” (fundamental forms of human being). Moreover, the method {{is a form of}} critical design that enables designers to shift focus, from analysis of the functionality of a design in use, e. g. by performing a functional analysis, to analysis of the form of being human that a design in use defines. More importantly, this thesis considers what may happen if we do not take into account this aspect of design; in other words, the “dark side” of design thinking.
