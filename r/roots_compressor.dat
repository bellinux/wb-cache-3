5000|$|The {{compression}} ratio in a MVR unit does not usually exceed 1.8. At a {{compression ratio}} of 1.8, if the evaporation is performed at atmospheric pressure (0.101 MPa), the condensation pressure after compression will be 0.101 x 1.8 = 0.1818 MPa. At this pressure, the condensation {{temperature of the}} water vapor at the heat exchanger will be 390 K. Taking into account the boiling point elevation of the salt water we wish to evaporate (8 K for a saturated salt solution), this leaves a temperature difference of less than 8 K at the heat exchanger. A small ∆T leads to slow heat transfer, meaning that we will need a very large heating surface to transfer the required heat. Axial-flow and <b>Roots</b> <b>compressor</b> may reach slightly higher compression ratios.|$|E

The study shows how the theoretical power of the machine can be calculated; it also analyses the influence of the constructive and functioning parameters on the latter. The paper makes a comparison between the N. T. M. and the <b>roots</b> <b>compressor</b> and points out the N. T. M. constructive and operating advantages...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} virtual design process of an {{automotive}} HSDI 2 -Stroke Diesel engine, {{developed at the}} Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering (DIMeC) of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. The new concept of the engine is the tumble supported and spray controlled combustion system, which enables the adoption of loop scavenging without valves, {{and the use of}} a very simple and compact combustion chamber, carved in the engine headThe concept has been applied to a 3 cylinder engine, with a capacity of 1050 cm 3, supercharged by means of a <b>Roots</b> <b>compressor</b> and a variable geometry turbocharger. Some alternative configurations have been defined. Integrated 1 D and multi-dimensional CFD simulations have been performed in order to optimize the main engine parameters, as well as to predict brake performance and emissions, in comparison to a reference four stroke automobile Diesel engine. Simulations results demonstrate the potential of the concept, which may be applied to develop a new generation of ultra-compact and clean automotive Diesel engine...|$|E
5000|$|Lory {{designed}} a high performance 1 482 cc V8 engine incorporating four overhead camshafts and two <b>Roots</b> <b>compressors.</b> [...] This unit initially provided 215 hp at 6,000 rpm. By 1948 the engine had been modified {{to produce a}} maximum of 275 hp at 8,000 rpm. However, it was matched to a transmission system that one commentator described as [...] "delicate".|$|R
50|$|Centrifugal {{supercharger}} {{technology has}} also {{found its way}} into industrial applications. In many industries, pneumatic conveying is now the preferred method for moving product or media within a facility. Traditionally the only source for air flow of this volume was considered to be a <b>Roots</b> style <b>compressor.</b> Due to its efficient design, centrifugal technology is now being embraced because it offers substantial energy savings, lower discharge air temperatures and quieter operation.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>Roots</b> blowers, screw <b>compressors</b> {{are made with}} different profiles on the two rotors: the male rotor has convex lobes which mesh with the concave cavities of the female rotor. Usually the male rotor has fewer lobes than the female rotor, so that it rotates faster. Originally, screw compressors were made with symmetrical rotor cavity profiles, but modern versions use asymmetrical rotors, with the exact rotor designs being the subject of patents.|$|R
40|$|The {{supercharging}} system {{investigated in}} this study is made up of a traditional turbocharger, coupled with a Roots-type positive displacement compressor. An electrically actuated clutch allows the compressor to be disengaged from the engine at high speed and under partial load steady operations (such as the ones occurring in a driving cycle). This concept of supercharging has been applied to the downsizing of a reference engine (a 2. 5 litre, turbocharged, four cylinder, high speed DI Diesel engine), without penalization on the maximum brake power (110 kW) and transient response. For such a purpose, a “paper” engine has been theoretically characterized. The gross engine parameters have been optimised by means of 1 -D numerical simulations, using a computational model previously validated against experiments. Performances of the reference and the downsized engine have been compared, considering both steady and transient operating conditions, full and partial load. The two-stage supercharging system allows the “paper” engine to provide higher values of torque at low engine speed and full load, and to perform slightly better in terms of transient response. Furthermore, when considering operating conditions occurring in the European Driving cycle (<b>Roots</b> <b>compressor</b> disengaged), the downsized engine shows lower fuel consumption (from 6 to 24 %), and lower pollutant emissions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have modeled a {{high-temperature}} <b>Root's</b> type <b>compressor</b> and compared predicted results with measurements. Compression process is modeled using multiple control volumes. Initially, there are two control volumes connected by an “expansion nozzle” naturally formed by the rotor tip and the blower casing. The “nozzle” has time-varying geometry and is modeled to allow transition from choked to non-choked flow. The well-filling process is modeled via expansion of the compressed gas from the high-pressure reservoir into the well through this “nozzle. ” When the pressures in the well and reservoir equalize, the “passive” part of the compression process is taken to be complete. At this point, the gas in the well {{is assumed to be}} fully-mixed and the two control volumes are subsequently considered as one. Then the “active” part of compression takes place. Numerical computations are shown to agree well with the experimental data...|$|R
5000|$|On March 24, 1878 Heinrich Krigar of Germany {{obtained}} patent #4121, patenting {{the first}} ever screw-type compressor. Later that same year on August 16 he obtained patent #7116 after modifying and improving his original designs. His designs show a two-lobe rotor assembly with each rotor having the same shape as the other. Although the design resembled the <b>Roots</b> style <b>compressor,</b> the [...] "screws" [...] were clearly shown with 180 degrees of twist along their length. Unfortunately, the technology of the time was not sufficient to produce such a unit, and Heinrich made no further progress with the screw compressor. Nearly half a century later, in 1935, Alf Lysholm, who was working for Ljungstroms Angturbin AB (later known as Svenska Rotor Maskiner AB or SRM in 1951), patented a design with five female and four male rotors. He also patented the method for machining the compressor rotors.|$|R

The driving temperature for operation of such systems limits the operating window {{and can be}} a barrier for market-introduction. By adding a compressor, the sorption cycle can be run using lower waste heat temperatures. ECN has recently started the development of such a hybrid heat pump. The final goal {{is to develop a}} hybrid heat pump for upgrading lower (< 100 ⁰C) temperature industrial waste heat to above pinch temperatures. The paper presents the first measurements and model calculations of a hybrid heat pump system using a water-silica gel system combined with a <b>Roots</b> type <b>compressor.</b> From the measurements can be seen that the effect of the compressor is dependent on where in the cycle it is placed. When placed between the evaporator and the sorption reactor, it has a considerable larger effect compared to the compressor placed between the sorption reactor and the condenser. The latter hardly improves the performance compared to purely heat-driven operation. This shows the importance of studying the interaction between all components of the system. The model, which shows reasonable correlation with the measurements, could proof to be a valuable tool to determine the optimal hybrid heat pump configuration...|$|R
