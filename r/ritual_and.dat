5|$|The Archaeology of <b>Ritual</b> <b>and</b> Magic is {{an archaeological}} {{study of the}} {{material}} evidence for <b>ritual</b> <b>and</b> magical practices in Europe, containing a particular emphasis on London and South East England. It was written by the English archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, the former {{deputy director of the}} Museum of London, and first published by B.T. Batsford in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Upon publication, The Archaeology of <b>Ritual</b> <b>and</b> Magic {{received}} predominantly positive {{reviews in}} academic peer-reviewed journals such as Folklore and The Antiquaries Journal. In ensuing years, {{the book has}} been widely cited by scholars as an influential and pioneering text {{in the study of}} the archaeology of <b>ritual</b> <b>and</b> magic.|$|E

5|$|In his preface, Merrifield {{noted that}} while archaeologists {{studying}} prehistoric periods have paid increasing {{attention to the}} evidence for <b>ritual</b> <b>and</b> magic in the archaeological record, their counterparts working in later historical periods have failed to follow their lead.

5|$|According to Voigt, the coven {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on practical magic rather than worship, theology, ethics, or <b>ritual,</b> <b>and</b> were eclectic in their practices, mixing Huna with forms of American folk magic. She noted {{that they did not}} worship a goddess but held to a belief in a god who was opposed to the God of Christianity. Moreover she claimed that they met together for both outdoor and indoor meetings, according to the phases of the moon. According to Voigt's account, Anderson also claimed that on occasion, the coven used a naked woman as their altar, and that the group disbanded after World War II broke out.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{national}} collections containing Mellor's work are the National Gallery of Australia, which owns his prize-winning From Rite to <b>Ritual,</b> <b>and</b> the Parliament House Art Collection. Most other major Australian art collections have holdings, including the state gallery {{of his birth}} state, Queensland, and the main public gallery of the city where he completed much of his tertiary study, the Canberra Museum and Gallery. Other state and territory galleries {{in which he is}} represented include the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the National Gallery of Victoria. Public regional galleries that have collected Mellor's creations include Newcastle Regional Art Gallery in New South Wales, and Warrnambool Art Gallery in Victoria. He is also represented in the Australian government's collection, Artbank, as well as in large, private collections such as the Kerry Stokes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, <b>ritual,</b> <b>and</b> righteousness. The amalgamation of these ideas into a theological system involving earlier cosmological theories of yin and yang {{as well as the}} five phases (i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man) was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE). Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three of his original memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E
5|$|Built out {{of earth}} and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow {{consisted}} of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Within {{the eastern end of}} the tumulus was a stone chamber, into which human remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the Early Neolithic. Osteoarchaeological analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals, a mixture of men, women, children and adults. At least one of the bodies had been dismembered before burial, potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of excarnation and secondary burial. As with other barrows, Coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead, perhaps as part of a belief system involving ancestor veneration, although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious, <b>ritual,</b> <b>and</b> cultural connotations and uses.|$|E

5|$|During the {{ceremony}} of initiation, the candidate {{is expected to}} swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the <b>ritual</b> <b>and</b> symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 the Guildhall Museum was amalgamated {{with the}} London Museum, {{creating}} the new Museum of London. Merrifield was appointed senior keeper, {{and soon after}} was promoted to deputy director. He retired in 1978 but remained active within the archaeological community, publishing The Archaeology of <b>Ritual</b> <b>and</b> Magic in 1987 and further studies of Roman London, and giving public lectures across the country. He was a keen supporter of the Standing Conference on London Archaeology, a body designed to monitor the impact that English Heritage was having on the city's archaeology, which he believed to be negative.|$|E
5|$|The Satanic Bible is {{composed}} of four books: The Book of Satan, The Book of Lucifer, The Book of Belial, and The Book of Leviathan. The Book of Satan challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. The Book of Lucifer holds most of the philosophy in The Satanic Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In The Book of Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a <b>ritual,</b> <b>and</b> provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. The Book of Leviathan provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|E

5|$|A. H. A. Hogg {{identified}} {{four types}} of hillfort: contour forts, promontory forts, cliff forts and ridge forts. Contour forts, where banks and ditches are moulded {{to the shape of}} the hill, are the dominant form in Scotland. Less significant are promontory forts, usually employing coastal features, such as the largest one in Scotland at the Mull of Galloway. Different types of defensive style occurred throughout the Iron Age period, some of which may have been a response to Roman siege warfare. There were different combinations in the use of earth, stone or timber. Timber was frequently in-filled with stone or other materials. In continental Europe the timber is often arranged vertically, but in Scotland horizontal timbers were more common. The function of hillforts has been much debated. It was traditionally assumed that they were primarily defensive in nature, but {{in the late twentieth century}} this view began to be questioned and social, <b>ritual</b> <b>and</b> religious functions were emphasised.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to <b>ritual</b> <b>and</b> economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
5|$|Classic Maya social {{organization}} {{was based on}} the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by tradition to such activities as construction, <b>ritual,</b> <b>and</b> warfare. This only served to exacerbate systemic problems. By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities. Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned. Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years. One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at Toniná in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.|$|E
