5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live to <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|He became pope in 1534 {{when he was}} 66 years old, and {{immediately}} appointed {{members of his family}} to key positions. He anointed his eldest grandson Alessandro, the eldest child of his illegitimate son Pier Luigi, cardinal at the age of 14, marking a break with the Farnese tradition of marrying off the first-born to carry on the family name. This move was considered necessary because the next oldest grandson, Ottavio, was then just 10 years old; such a young cardinal would have been politically unacceptable. Paul's advanced years meant that the family could ill afford to wait until the younger brother was of age. Thus Alessandro became a cardinal deacon; this appointment did not necessitate taking major orders, but it compelled him to celibacy and to forgo the rights of primogeniture, which instead went to Ottavio. Alessandro was to bitterly <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> obligations. Paul appointed Ottavio as Duke of Camerino in 1538, and in the same year married him to Charles V's daughter, Margaret, later Margaret of Parma. Both of Paul's grandsons' advancements were widely criticised as evidence of nepotism.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship among general <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> life, <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> process of purchasing and <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning after <b>the</b> purchasing and to determine the characteristic properties which are effective on these three types of regret. This study is applied on the students of Eskisehir Osmangazi University and Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University and it is benefited from the convenience sampling in the study. The data of this study is collected via questionnaire and in a method of drop-and-collect. The results of the study shows that there is a positive meaningful relationship among <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> life, <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> process of purchasing and <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning after <b>the</b> purchasing. Moreover, as a result of this study, it is established that the characteristic properties like extravagant, restrained, easily tempered, careless, enjoy spending and a planner have positive meaningful effects on <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> life, <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> process of purchasing and <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning after <b>the</b> purchasing. </p...|$|R

5|$|Riley's father {{returned}} from the war partially paralyzed. He was unable to continue working in his legal practice and the family soon fell into financial distress. The war had a negative physiological effect on him, and {{his relationship with his}} family quickly deteriorated. He opposed Riley's interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career. The family finances finally disintegrated and they were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm. Riley's mother was able to keep peace in the family, but after her death in August from heart disease, Riley and his father had a final break. He blamed his mother's death on his father's failure to care for her in her final weeks. He continued to <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> loss of his childhood home and wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war, subsequent poverty, and his mother's death. After the events of 1870, he developed an addiction to alcohol which he struggled with for the remainder of his life.|$|E

Historians <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> loss of the work, as it must have thrown much light on a very eventful period, embracing the war against Sertorius (died 72 BC), the campaigns of Lucullus against Mithradates VI of Pontus (75-66 BC), and the victories of Pompey in the East (66-62 BC).|$|E

Vicky would come to <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> day she ever got involved with Grant as he continued to terrorize her for years. Amanda saw her marriage to Sam crash and burn when she had an affair with Janice's son, Evan Frame (Charles Grant). Marley and Jamie's relationship fell apart due to her inability to become pregnant.|$|E

Cooley maneuvers Morton into confessing the truth of Gelman's assertions to Senator Anderson who subsequently re-opens the subcommittee's hearings, thus enraging the President. When the President's attempts to buy Anderson's cooperation fail he places enormous pressure on Majority Leader Robert Munson to entice Anderson into compliance. In a moment of great weakness that Munson will <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> rest of his life, Munson provides the President a photograph, acquired quite innocently by Munson, that betrays Anderson's brief wartime homosexual liaison.|$|E

25|$|Iorga's murder, {{like other}} acts of {{violence}} ordered by the Iron Guard, alarmed Ion Antonescu, who found that it contradicted his resolutions on public order—the first clash in a dispute which, early in 1941, erupted as the Legionary Rebellion and saw the Guard's ouster from power. Reportedly, Iorga's murder instantly repelled some known supporters of the Guard, such as Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade. Responding to condemnation of his actions from his place of exile in Francoist Spain, the Guard leader Horia Sima claimed to have played no part in the killing. Sima stated {{that he did not}} <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> act, noting that Iorga the scholar had had a long enough career, and arguing, counterfactually, that the revenge was saluted by most Romanians.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} adapted from the first four radio episodes.

A hardback edition was published by Harmony Books, a division of Random House in the United States in October 1980, and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give-away of 3,000 free copies in the magazine Rolling Stone to build word of mouth. In 2005, Del Rey Books rereleased the Hitchhiker series with new covers for the release of the 2005 movie. To date, it has sold over 14million copies.|$|E
25|$|In {{a charity}} match at Lord's, Brian Lara came to <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> {{decision}} to bowl first, although the match was hardly {{to be taken}} seriously. Andy Flower, the old Zimbabwe stalwart, made a quickfire 55 {{near the end of}} the innings, Stephen Fleming smashed some lovely cover drives on his way to a 46-ball fifty before edging Makhaya Ntini to third man for 62, and Jacques Kallis also made 62 as he paired up well with VVS Laxman. The deep batting order, aided by Lara's willingness to utilise his bowlers – the pick of the International XI, Chaminda Vaas, who utilised the English conditions as he took two for 19, only got to bowl seven overs, while Lara himself bowled two and the International XI used all their available bowlers – and the MCC made 327 for 7.|$|E

25|$|In 1991 X-Ray Spex {{reformed}} for {{a surprise}} sell-out gig at the Brixton Academy where Poly appeared in a blue foam dress with an army helmet (to her <b>regret).</b> <b>The</b> group reformed again in 1995 with a line-up of Styrene, Dean and Logic to release a new album Conscious Consumer. Although heralded as {{the first in a}} trilogy, the album was not a commercial success. Styrene later explained that touring and promotional work suffered an abrupt end when she was run over by a fire engine in central London, suffering a fractured pelvis. The following year X-Ray Spex played at the 20th Anniversary of Punk Festival in Blackpool minus Poly Styrene, overcoming her last-minute decision to withdraw by recruiting a replacement female singer named 'Poly Filla'. The band subsequently disbanded, but later releases include a compilation of the group's early records, a live album, and an anthology of all the aforementioned.|$|E
25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E
25|$|The extravagant {{administration}} of Ismail, for which perhaps Nubar {{can hardly be}} held wholly responsible, had brought Egypt to the verge of bankruptcy, and Ismail's disregard of the judgments of the Court at last compelled Great Britain and France to interfere. Under pressure, Ismail, who began to <b>regret</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the International Courts, assented to a mixed ministry under Nubar, with Charles Rivers Wilson as minister of finance and the Marquis de Blignières as minister of public works. Nubar, finding himself supported by both Great Britain and France, tried to reduce Ismail {{to the position of}} a constitutional monarch, and Ismail, with an astuteness worthy of a better cause, took advantage of a somewhat injudicious disbandment of certain regiments to incite a military rising against the ministry. The governments of Great Britain and France, instead of supporting the ministry against the khedive, weakly consented to Nubar's dismissal; but when this was shortly followed by that of Rivers Wilson and de Blignières they realized that the situation was a critical one, and they succeeded in obtaining from the sultan the deposition of Ismail and the substitution of his son Tawfiq as khedive (1879). Nubar remained out of office until 1884.|$|E
