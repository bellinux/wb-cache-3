50|$|Forage {{harvesters}} can be implements {{attached to}} a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they have either a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel {{with a number of}} knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using <b>reciprocating</b> <b>knives,</b> disc <b>mowers</b> or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the cutterhead and accelerator. In most forage harvesters, the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for chopping non-cereal crops.|$|R

40|$|Semi-natural grasslands are species-rich {{and one of}} {{the most}} {{threatened}} habitats in Europe, since land-use changes have led to reduced area of grassland. Appropriate management practices like grazing or mowing is needed to maintain the conservation values and species-richness of semi-natural grasslands. However, few studies have investigated which of grazing or mowing is most appropriate. Furthermore, almost no studies have investigated which mowing technique is best for the conservation value of grassland flora. The aim of this study was to determine which management practice of grazing and mowing, and which mowing technique, has the most positive effect on grassland flora. Data from two long-term trials were evaluated: one compared the effect of grazing and mowing in eleven sites in southern Sweden during at least twelve years; the other compared the effect of the <b>knife</b> <b>mower</b> and grass trimmer at different cutting heights in one site during twelve years. Meta-analysis was used, based on the odds for a plant record being an indicator species, using eight different indicator systems of classification of grassland plants. Over time, results show increasing odds of finding indicators of good management and no change in odds of finding indicators of lack of management in mowed compared to grazed plots. There were no differences in the odds of finding any indicator species for any of the mowing techniques. Hence, to maintain the conservation values of semi-natural grasslands, mowing is the better management practice compared to grazing. Mowing using a <b>knife</b> <b>mower</b> or grass trimmer has similar effects, and can both be recommended...|$|R

A variation of the platform, a [...] "flex" [...] platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains.|$|R
50|$|Stone pickers {{are used}} in farming and landscaping, where stones need {{to be removed from}} the soil and ground surface to prevent damage to other farm {{machinery}} (such as hay balers, combines, and mowers), improve the soil for crop production, or improve the appearance of the ground surface in preparation for a lawn or a golf course. Surface stones and large rocks often left from plowing can damage a hay bailer, the header or <b>reciprocating</b> <b>knives</b> on a combine, and blades on a rotary mower. Land with rock instead of fine soil are often less useful for crops. Thus, removing stones from the soil also ensures a more consistent yield. Additionally, using stone pickers is particularly useful for crops forming tubers (such as potatoes) in the ground.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of mowers: sickle bar mowers, disc mowers, and drum mowers. Sickle bar mowers use a {{reciprocating}} blade to cut the grass and typically use a reel to fold the grass over the <b>knife.</b> Disc <b>mowers</b> {{have a number of}} hubs across the cutting width, each hub having a small (18") rotating disc with <b>knives.</b> Drum <b>mowers</b> use two or three large plates (called the drums, about 36" [...] across) which ride over the ground as they are spinning. A sickle bar mower's main advantage over disc mowers and drum mowers is the reduced horsepower requirements. Its disadvantage is the extra maintenance required due to the high number of moving parts and wear items. Disc mowers were historically considered an [...] "all the eggs in one basket" [...] kind of mower because all the mower hubs were in one large gearbox. If one blade hit something and a gear tooth broke, the whole gearbox would suffer a catastrophic failure, and there would be nothing worth fixing. If anything broke, everything broke. Drum mowers prevented this by having typically two belt-driven drums compared to six or more gear-driven hubs. Modern disc mowers use isolated gearboxes, and if one fails it can be swapped out without rebuilding the entire machine.|$|R

40|$|Young {{women who}} suffer from cancer have a high change of {{becoming}} infertile {{as a consequence of}} the treatment. They would benefit from an effective fertility preservation method that allows natural conception. A new method, called autotransplantation of ovarian tissue, has much potential but improvements can be made. The method entails that ovarian tissue is harvested before treatment and frozen until future use. When the patient is in remission the tissue is transplanted back into the patient, which will allow the patient to become pregnant in a natural way. In order to improve the success rate and facilitate further research, a new technique for harvesting ovarian fragments was researched. The goal of this study was to develop a technique to harvest ovarian tissue fragments with controlled dimensions in a minimally invasive way. The technique had to satisfy two functions, namely holding the ovary and removing a tissue fragment. A concept technique was developed where suction was used to hold the ovary and a knife was used to cut a tissue fragment with an impulse. An experimental set-up was developed to test this concept technique. The use of the set-up with chicken filet showed a proof of principle. The efficacy of the concept technique was proven, as well as the accuracy and precision of the length of the obtained fragments. However, the set-up was not effective in producing fragments origination from ovarian tissue.

40|$|Laser cutting {{technology}} is a non-conventional machining which being used widely in many industries. However, the application of this technology in textile industry is still new and yet to be explored. Indeed, nowadays many textile industries are preferred to cut the textile by using conventional way such as discs, band blade and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>knives.</b> As compared to traditional cutting methods the laser cutting offers several advantages such as fast cutting speed, reduced the time consumption, a non-contact cutting and no tool wear. Thus, using this technology would be more efficient and productive if the right method of laser cutting process is used to replace the conventional cutting methods. This research conducted, in conjunction to recognize the best machining condition {{and the effectiveness of}} CO 2 laser interaction with various types of textiles in cutting process. Through this study, two main experiments have been conducted using CO 2 laser to perform cutting process on a single and multiple layers of textiles. The textiles used in this study are plain cotton, chiffon, habutae silk, plain jessy and plain dull satin. Two main variable machining parameters have been chosen, the laser power (100 W – 500 W) and the cutting speed (60 mm/s – 600 mm/s). Variation of laser power and cutting speed in laser cutting process are very important parameters for best quality and efficiency of laser cutting method. The effect of varying the variable parameters have been investigated through the findings of the kerf width, side line length (SLL), circular diameter, percentage of overcut, depth of cut and the material removal rate (MRR). From the findings it is shown that, the usage of laser power and cutting speed influence the accuracy of the cutting process. For single layer the use of low power (100 W) and high cutting speed (600 mm/s) is the best choice. Moreover, cutting multiple layers of textile would require higher laser power and moderate cutting speed to avoid non full-through cutting. As a conclusion, the textile industries may manipulate this new technology in order to improve the productivity and increase quality of their products. Thus this CO 2 laser fabric cutting technique can produce high quality of production with a minimum of waste and total ease of use. Subject to a correct parameter selection and suitable intermediate material used in multiple layer of textile cutting process, may increase the productivity. In conclusion in order to achieve the overall improvements, the best machining condition of laser cutting need to be well determined to prevent any burn textile while conducting the cutting process...|$|R
40|$|To {{promote the}} birdlife in grazelands and {{increase}} the multiplicity {{of plants and animals}} in flooded meadows (used for harvesting fodder) there is call for a continued cultivation of these areas. For many years these areas were harvested manually, or grazed by cattle from farms located nearby. Due to the rationalization in farming has the cultivation of flooded meadows diminished in extent. These meadows are unique with their plants and animal life and characterized by the annual flooding with nutritious water from local lakes and water-courses. To maintain the cultivation by the use of grazing animals would the livestock of the local region have to be increased a lot. Since this option isn't feasible today, there's an enhanced need for mechanization of cultivation practices at flooded meadows. As the cultivation of flooded meadows has been discontinued will the shores be choked with tall-growing species which means that the amount of biomass increases. This results in a soil with a reduced oxygen content which leads to a slower decomposition of plant remnants. The process elevates the ground and causes overgrowing into much the same as mainland vegetation. Birds of flooded meadows needs low vegetation and distances of at least 100 meters to the nearest bushes or trees. Plant remnants needs to be taken away otherwise it will become a disturbing element for these birds. These meadows will thereby turn into a beneficial environment for nesting and feedseeking birds. The experiences from cultivation of flooded meadows in our country are of various kinds. From conventional ley harvest methods practised in the south to the management of wetland cultivation up north. New methods have been tried out here and there, using for example special constructed machinery or applied military training with crawler type vehicles. These measures can be used for the actual work of putting flooded meadows in order. An essential problem is the carrying capacity for this kind of soil. Therefore considerable requirements are made upon the bearing parts of the used vehicles. To reduce the pressure from beneath the wheels needs the load either be decreased or the carrying surface be increased. The bearing wheels sinks until the surface of support becomes as large, as the pressure on its surface becomes equal with the carrying capacity. Resistance to taxiing comes of tracking and calls for extra energy. To avoid this effect it is better to increase the diameter of the wheels than of the width of the tyres. When the carrying capacity is crucial it is no more than the connected surface layer that gives it any support. At passage across the field becomes the surface of the soil exposed to shearing. The shearing can be decreased through an additional number of wheels or having the machines equipped with crawlers. On soils like these it is the axial weight that influences the carrying capacity. Alternative methods to put fields like these in order is to mill off soil, burn off vegetation or to use a pasture trimmer. Special purpose machines are nowadays under testing. These machines are manufactured by the companies LVR AB and NOVASS AB. Another of these machines is being developed and tested privately by Jossi Kyllenen. There are different kinds of mowers and one of these is the <b>knife</b> <b>mower</b> which is low in weight, power efficient and shears the grass but sensitive towards strange objects lying in the way of its course. Another is the rotary mower that is more dependable in service and works through a combination of shearing and striking. The latter one has a higher capacity but requires an increased engine effect and weight of the tractor. There is also the flail forage harvester that strikes off the grass with flails and transports the material directly to a carriage. The machine can on the other hand pick up pieces of soil and gravel together with the harvested material. Dry soils can be cultivated with conventional ley machines while wet soils sometimes just allow one or two passages across at maximum. The later condition requires direct loading into a collector trailer, alternatively with the mower aggregate mounted {{in the front of the}} tractor. When harvesting hey it's often necessary to turnover the material at least once. For the purpose of harvest are various balers and self-loading trailers obtainable. Balers are usually heavy while self-loading trailers can be found in many sizes and often equipped with bogie. They are also flexible as they can carry small loads on quite wet soils. Transport of the harvested material can be done through two different systems. Either directly to final disposal or through transhipment at the roadside of fields. When distances of transport are less than 30 to 40 kilometers transport by tractor can be considered as less expensive than transport by truck. Round bales and rectangular big bales are easy to load and transport on open-sided trailers. The trailers can take a full load with a relatively good utilization of the loading capacity of the carriage. Because of their weight these bales must be loaded on carriages by machine. Using small bales is another beneficial alternative, but these bales need to be heaped up during long-distance transport which requires extra labour to a certain extent. Harvested material that is not baled can either be transported with a self-loading trailer or a truck carrying containers. The self-loading trailer is good at shorter distances of transport but less suitable for transhipment. The removed material can be deposited in the following ways: • Forage to livestock. The forage can be of special value if classified as KRAV-approved feed. It can also become horse-feed to a certain extent. • Green manuring of arable land. The material needs in this case to be chopped. Material with nitrogen deficiency can tie itself to the nitrogen of the soil in connection with the decomposition. The nitrogen dissolves itself when the process of decomposition is concluded. • Soil at vegetable production. The material should be chopped and the method can result in positive effects upon noxious insects, weed, soil moisture and soil structure. • Composting. Fresh material should be mixed with other substances. Two alternatives are: 1. Windrow composting has many disadvantages and is not recommended. 2. Compost blended with parkwastes has more advantages than drawbacks. • Retting. In the process of retting biogas is produced. Research is in progress and several interesting byproducts can be extracted, as for example forage. The condition is an existing and suitable plant for biogas production located nearby. • Incineration. It requires particular furnaces with certain properties of combustion. • Landfill. The material is not suitable for established municipal set-ups and the initial cost for new set-ups can be extensive. Not recommended. Other important issues to take into consideration: • How is the nutrient and energy content of the green forage utilized? • Is there any economic value in the green forage? • How can transportation work be minimized? • Which resources and possibilities are available? Finally, from a general point of view it is nearly impossible to decide which machinery that is most suitable for a particular type of soil or the cost of cultivation of flooded meadows. The conditions varies a lot between the regions, which means that many aspects needs to be taken into account for in each case...|$|R
40|$|Although, {{mulberry}} {{plants are}} grown in Australia as ornamentals or fruit, {{there are no}} data available or work done to assist in establishing a sericulture industry. This research conducted in Lockyer Valley in South East Queensland covered four areas of mulberry leaf production in identifying mulberry varieties and practices suitable for Australian conditions. The first trial involved identifying local mulberry varieties with desirable characters of high leaf yield, high protein content, high carbohydrate content and high moisture content; these are the characters desirable for sericulture production. Nine mulberry varieties consisting of Morus nigra, Morus alba and Morus macroura cv. Shahtoot, were identified as planting material in South East Queensland. Cuttings were raised in polybags in a glasshouse for 18 weeks. The plants of nine varieties (LV 1 to LV 9) were transplanted into the field on raised plastic mulch beds at a row by tree spacing of 4 m × 2 m. A randomised block design and three replications was used. Irrigation and fertiliser were applied through a drip system. Three sets of data were recorded over the trial period. Harvest 1 was taken at 20 weeks after transplanting, Harvest 2 at 13 weeks after first pruning and Harvest 3 at 30 weeks after second pruning. The characters evaluated were leaf and shoot yield (fresh and dry weight), crude protein and carbohydrate (TNC) content, moisture content, growth rate, number of shoots, number of branches, stem diameter, longest shoot height, internode length, leaf size and shape, number of leaf lobe and 20 leaf weight. The number of branches, stem diameter, longest shoot height, internode length were measured on the longest shoot at harvest. Using Harvest 2 data, when leaves are normally harvested and fed to silkworms, varieties, LV 5 and LV 7, recorded higher fresh leaf yields (2. 13 t/ha and 2. 21 t/ha respectively), leaf moisture content (60 % and 59 %), and intermediate carbohydrate content (17. 5 % and 14. 9 %). Although both varieties, LV 5 and LV 7, recorded low protein contents (13. 6 % and 15. 7 % respectively), they were recommended for sericulture production based on overall performance. LV 9, at Harvest 3 recorded high fresh leaf yield (5. 6 t/ha), protein content (18. 6 %), carbohydrate content (12. 5 %) and moisture content (65 %), therefore it was also recommended for sericulture production. The second trial involved five varieties Morus alba sp. (MA), Morus nigra sp. cathayana, Morus nigra sp. kanva (MK), Morus nigra sp. multicaulis (MM) and Morus nigra sp. (MN) imported from Indonesia. The trial set up, {{data collection and analysis}} were the same as in the first trial. Two sets of data, Harvests 1 and 2, were recorded over the research period. Varieties, MM, MK and MC were recommended for silkworm feeding based on leaf yield, protein content, carbohydrate content and moisture content. MM recorded the highest leaf yield (6. 57 and 8. 13 t/ha), followed by MK (3. 66 and 4. 79 t/ha) and then MC (3. 43 and 4. 54 t/ha) for Harvests 1 and 2. Moisture content for MM (68 % and 75. 1 %), MK (71 % and 77. 5 %) and MC (71 % and 76. 2 %) were high at both harvests except for MM (68 %) which recorded the lowest at Harvest 1. MM (17. 5 % and 15. 5 %) recorded the lowest at both harvests for protein content, whereas MK (17. 8 % and 18. 9 %) and MC (17. 6 % and 18. 9 %) maintained intermediate protein contents at both harvests. MK (18. 1 % and 15. 5 %) recorded the highest carbohydrate at both harvests while MM, in general, recorded intermediate carbohydrate contents. MC recorded intermediate and lowest carbohydrate content (13. 8 % and 12. 7 %) at Harvests 1 and 2 respectively. In general, MM, MK and MC showed characters which were higher than MA and MN, although MM recorded low protein content. The third trial looked at the effect of plant density on the main economic characters of mulberry plants. A local variety, LV 1, was planted using six density treatments of row x plant spacing 0. 6 m x 0. 5 m, 0. 6 m x 1. 0 m, 0. 6 m x 1. 5 m, 4. 0 m x 0. 5 m, 4. 0 m x 1. 0 m, 4. 0 m x 1. 5 m using a strip plot design. Two sets of readings were measured over the research period. Harvest 1 occurred at 26 weeks after first pruning and Harvest 2 at 37 weeks after the second pruning. The 4. 0 m x 0. 5 m spacing treatment (5, 000 plants/ha) was recommended for sericulture practice because leaf yield was high (2541 kg/ha and 4274 kg/ha) at Harvests 1 and 2, protein content was highest (19. 7 % and 19. 1 %) at both harvests, carbohydrate content was lowest (14. 1 %) but second highest (20. 2 %) at Harvest 1 and 2 respectively. Moisture content was highest (59. 9 %) and low (61. 4 %) at Harvests 1 and 2. The fourth area of study involved designing, developing and testing a mechanical mulberry leaf harvester. The harvester consisted of a reel, <b>reciprocating</b> cutting <b>knife,</b> conveyor, hydraulic system, lift mast, collection bin and support frames. The harvester was supported at the tractors three point linkage and operated by the tractors hydraulics. The harvester was field tested on 14 and 20 week mulberry plants, planted at 1 m apart and at row spacing of 4 m. Harvesting operations were performed at three tractor forward speeds (1. 5, 2. 0 and 3. 0 km/h) in combination with reel, cutting knife and conveyor speeds. It was observed that all mulberry plants within the effective cutting area (100 % cutting efficiency) were harvested at the three forward speeds. The collected yield ranged from 0. 63 t/ha to 2. 25 t/ha, collection efficiency ranged from 65 % to 93 % and damaged shoots ranged from 9 % to 34 %. New shoots budded and grew from all the harvested shoots (damaged and undamaged). The four trials showed that local varieties LV 5, LV 7, and LV 9 together with imported varieties MC, MK and MM produced high leaf yield, protein, carbohydrate and moisture content. A 4 m x 0. 5 m spacing (5000 trees/ha) treatment showed high values for the desirable characters, therefore the six high production varieties as well as the 4 m x 0. 5 m spacing arrangement are recommended for sericulture production in Australia. Also the mechanical leaf harvester which showed satisfactory performance can be utilised to minimise labour costs...|$|R
