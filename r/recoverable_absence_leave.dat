5000|$|Fudd was {{originally}} voiced by radio actor Arthur Q.

[...] was dubbed by Mel Blanc, although Bryan had voiced the rest of the part. Later, during the musician's union strike of 1958, another artist did the voice for Elmer's co-starring appearance in Pre-Hysterical Hare. There is no documented reason for Bryan's <b>absence,</b> <b>leaving</b> some fans to speculate that he refused to cross the picket lines.|$|R

25|$|After {{the death}} of Phillip of Macedon, many of his newly conquered territories desired to take {{advantage}} of the perceived weakness of the new young king. These nations included the Illyrians, Thracians, and some southern Greek city-states.

After extensive planning in Macedonia, Alexander started to prepare for his next major conquest: the invasion of Asia. Before leaving Macedon, Alexander appointed his father’s experienced general Antipater as regent in his <b>absence,</b> <b>leaving</b> him with 9,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to maintain control over Macedonia's holdings in Europe. In the spring of 334 BC, Alexander took 2,600 cavalry and went on a 20-day march from Macedon to Hellespont, to join Parmenion in Asia.|$|R
