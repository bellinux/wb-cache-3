40|$|The Web puts a {{huge number}} of {{learning}} resources within reach of anyone with Internet access. In many cases, these valuable resources are difficult for most users to find in an efficient and effective manner. This is why e-learning <b>resources</b> <b>repositories</b> or e-learning brokerage systems have emerged. In a very generic terms an online "brokerage system " is an on-line entity that acts as an electronic marketplace. Brokerage service has two types of users: those who offer their products for sale (providers) and those who buy the products offered (consumers). An e-learning <b>resources</b> <b>repository</b> facilitates the exchange of learning objects or resources among organizations and individuals. One can mention a lot of e-learning <b>resources</b> <b>repositories.</b> Unfortunately, the various repositories are either closed systems or systems that allow user access only through proprietary interfaces and data formats. In brief, there is lack of interoperability. Interoperability can be defined as “the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged”. The aim of this chapter is to present the requirements of an ideal e-learning <b>resources</b> <b>repository</b> that will provide services for covering the aforementioned critical issues. We will also describe how this system could be non-centralized, which is the main difference from all the system that exists today in the WWW. Peer to Peer (P 2 P) based approaches are more flexible than centralized approaches with several advantages. 1...|$|R

Because it requires much labor to create metadata contents of academic resources, development of tools or services enabling to easily create metadata contents is expected. This paper proposes a system which converts BIBTEXmetadata of academic resources { widely used by researchers in science and engineering { into NII metadata format in order to support constructions of academic <b>resource</b> <b>repositories.</b> The proposed system enables to reduce almost four-¯fth of workloads of creating metadata contents.

What makes an e-learning <b>resources</b> <b>repository</b> much more than a portal is the ability to discover a learning object and put it to a new use. The purpose of an e-learning <b>resources</b> <b>repository</b> is not simply safe storage and delivery but the ability of their administration, in terms of updating, identifying, utilizing, sharing and re-using them, which remains a great challenge.

50|$|D. rerio is {{a common}} and useful {{scientific}} model organism for studies of vertebrate development and gene function. Its use as a laboratory animal was pioneered by the American molecular biologist George Streisinger {{and his colleagues at}} the University of Oregon in the 1970s and 1980s; Streisinger's zebrafish clones were among the earliest successful vertebrate clones created. Its importance has been consolidated by successful large-scale forward genetic screens (commonly referred to as the Tübingen/Boston screens). The fish has a dedicated online database of genetic, genomic, and developmental information, the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN). The Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) is a genetic <b>resource</b> <b>repository</b> with 29,250 alleles available for distribution to the research community.

His doctorate {{examined the}} relationship between advertising and commercial architecture and was awarded by the Superior Technical School of Architecture of Madrid. It was later developed into a book, Deciphering Art, Architecture and Advertising: Selling to the Sophisticated Consumer. In 1995 he founded and ran the UK based performance arts company Hybrid Artworks specializing in spatial installation and multi media performance. He lived in Spain between 2000-2005 and published his first book in Spanish: El Arquitecto Detrás de la Cámara: Una Visión Espacial del Cine.In 2011 he founded the research organisation Architecture Media Politics Society and its associated journal. In this role he has organised academic conferences internationally with events in the UK, the US, Spain, Cyprus and Australia. Examples include 2014 events in both London and Los Angeles. He has also developed a new genre of academic publication - the ‘interview-article’. Interview-articles have been published by authors such as Noam Chomsky, Kenneth Frampton, Daniel Libeskind and Michael Sorkin. He has also established a <b>resource</b> <b>repository</b> as part of a collaboration between librarians and academics.He is the author and editor seven published books on architecture, design, film and advertising.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that current Learning Object Repositories adopt {{strategies}} for quality assessment of their resources that rely on the impressions of quality given {{by the members of}} the repository community. Although this strategy can be considered effective at some extent, the number of <b>resources</b> inside <b>repositories</b> tends to increase more rapidly than the number of evaluations given by this community, thus leaving several <b>resources</b> of the <b>repository</b> without any quality assessment. The present work describes the results of an experiment for automatically generate quality information about learning <b>resources</b> inside <b>repositories</b> through the use of Artificial Neural Networks models. We were able to generate models for classifying resources between good and not-good with accuracies that vary from 50 % to 80 % depending on the given subset. The preliminary results found here point out the feasibility of such approach and {{can be used as a}} starting point for the pursuit of automatically generation of internal quality information about <b>resources</b> inside <b>repositories...</b>|$|R

This paper expounds the design of HIT-TENA <b>resource</b> <b>repository</b> in detail.

After the abstract analysis {{of different types of}} resources, we built the distributed database and developed the repository manager based on B/S (browser/server) for the users to manage the resources.
