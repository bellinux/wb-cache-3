50|$|Prior to 2001, {{there were}} {{a total of four}} {{scientific}} journal articles specifically addressing symptoms of SCT.

The <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>and</b> its accompanying commentary urging the undertaking of more research on SCT spurred the publication of over 30 scientific journal articles to date which specifically address symptoms of SCT.|$|E
5000|$|Voucher {{specimens}} are select herbarium specimens.

[...] These specimens are usually associated with a professional <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>and</b> {{are considered to be}} more official references than a typical herbarium specimen. Voucher specimens can be useful in many ways such as use for comparison when scientists think they have found a new species or when dichotomous keys have narrowed the possible species down to a few that have minute differences.|$|E

50|$|Most {{authorities}} classify leloii as {{a junior}} synonym of the Yangtze giant softshell turtle, based a study by Farkas et al. However, some Vietnamese biologists, such as Hà Đình Đức, who first described leloii, and Le Tran Binh, insist that the two turtles {{are not the same}} species. Le points out genetic differences as well as differences in morphology, re-describing the Hoan Kiem turtle as Rafetus vietnamensis. However, Farkas et al. repeated their 2003 conclusion in 2011, stating that differences between specimens may be due to age. They also pointed out that Le et al. did not adequately describe their methods for DNA sequencing, and that the genetic sequences used were never sent to GenBank. They also criticized the fact that Le et al. violated ICZN Code by renaming the species from leloii to vietnamensis on the grounds of “appropriateness”. Another genetic analysis was purportedly when the turtle was rescued and cleaned, which allegedly showed it to be female and distinct from the R. swinhoei of China and Đồng Mô, Vietnam. However, the results were not formally announced or ever published in a peer-reviewed <b>research</b> <b>article,</b> <b>and</b> some skepticism has been cast on the results.|$|E

Drawing on the principles of systemic functional grammar approach to language, it focuses on the distribution of lexicogrammatical features as factors indicating interpersonal and social relationships in the text. It is argued that the distribution of some of these features has a higher loading in one genre compared to other genres due to the communicative purpose of that specific genre...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} from {{a program of}} language assistance for a PhD medical student. The program {{took the form of}} a comparative study of the student's draft of a <b>research</b> <b>article,</b> <b>and</b> her supervisor's rewrite of it. The linguistic framework for the analysis was based on the "functional grammar" of Halliday (1985) and the move analysis of Swales (1981). Observed differences in the transitivity and thematic structure in the two texts suggested a greater level of self-consciousness {{on the part of the}} student in the research process. The value of this comparative approach, both as a tool for genre analysis and as a pedagogical method, is considered at the end of the paper...|$|E
40|$|Newspapers are {{important}} {{sources of information}} about medical advances for many lay people and can influence those working in the health service. Medical journalists on newspapers routinely use general medical journals to obtain information on research.
