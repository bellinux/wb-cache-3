40|$|The slight {{improvement}} in productivity {{performance of the}} Japanese economy cannot yet {{be interpreted as a}} major turn-around compared with its dismal performance during the 1990 s. Despite recent improvements, most labor productivity growth since 1995 is driven by capital deepening, both in information and communication technology (ICT) and non-ICT.

A <b>sector</b> <b>breakdown</b> of productivity growth shows some strength in ICT-production, but the contribution of other goods-producing industries and market services halved.

Here we discuss the potential and limitations of SCIAMACHY limb measurements for estimating stratospheric CDs of NO 2 in comparison to a simple <b>reference</b> <b>sector</b> method, and the consequences for the resulting tropospheric CDs. A direct, absolute limb correction scheme is presented that improves spatial patterns of tropospheric NO 2 column densities at high latitudes, but results in artificial zonal stripes at low latitudes. Subsequently, a relative limb correction scheme is introduced that successfully reduces stratospheric artefacts in the tropospheric data product without introducing new ones. This relative limb correction scheme is rather simple, robust, and, in essence, based on measurements alone. The effects of the different stratospheric estimation schemes on tropospheric CDs are discussed with respect to zonal and temporal dependencies. In addition, we define error quantities from the nadir/limb measurements that indicate remaining systematic errors as a function of latitude and day. Our new suggested stratospheric estimation scheme, the relative limb correction, improves mean tropospheric slant CDs significantly, e. g. from − 1 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (using a <b>reference</b> <b>sector</b> method) to ≈ 0 in the Atlantic ocean, and from + 1 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 to ≈ 0 over Siberia, at 50 ° N in January 2003 – 2008...|$|R

Then, we study some well-known cosmological spacetimes such as the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Bianchi type I, and Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metrics for the five-dimensional massive bigravity.

30|$|In {{addition}} to examining the overall {{composition of the}} established earnings gaps, it would seem instructive to perform detailed decompositions as well, whereby {{it would be possible}} to see which explanatory variables contribute the most to the three- and/or two-fold overall decompositions. An issue here is that while the overall decompositions are always identified, the results for categorical variables in detailed decompositions depend on the choice of the reference category (Oaxaca and Ransom 1999). A possible solution to this problem is to apply the deviation contrast transformation to the estimates before conducting the decomposition (Yun 2005); this is also the approach pursued here. Similar to the OLS regressions, the decomposition estimations also all allow for arbitrary heteroskedasticity (Huber 1967; White 1980). So as to condense the wealth of results obtained here—thereby easing the interpretation of the many results—the detailed decompositions are done groupwise rather than for each individual variable (for example, for education as a whole, rather than separately for primary or less, secondary, and tertiary education).

The project chose also the software industry as a <b>reference</b> <b>sector,</b> even though it does not intend to exclude from the study any other sector of activity or the so-called “hybrid” forms of work. However, the latter must have some of the characteristics of telework. The project thus takes into account the so-called “traditional” sectors of activity, namely textile and machinery and metal engineering (machinery and equipment), not usually associated to this type of work. However, telework could include, in the so-called “traditional” sectors, other variations that are not found in technologically based sectors. One of the evaluation methods for the dynamics associated to telework consisted in carrying out surveys by means of questionnaires, aimed at employers in the sectors analysed. This paper presents some of the results of those surveys. It is important to mention that, being a preliminary analysis, it means that it does not pretend to have exhausted all the issues in the survey, but has meant that it shows the bigger tendencies, in terms of teleworking practices, of the Portuguese industry. ...|$|R
