25|$|The {{folded dipole}} is {{therefore}} well matched to 300nbsp&ohm balanced transmission lines, such as twin-feed <b>ribbon</b> <b>cable.</b> The folded dipole has a wider bandwidth {{than a single}} dipole. They {{can be used for}} transforming the value of input impedance of the dipole over a broad range of step-up ratios by changing the thicknesses of the wire conductors for the fed- and folded-sides. Instead of altering thickness or spacing, one can add a third parallel wire to increase the antenna impedance 9nbsp&times over a single-wire dipole, raising the impedance to 450nbsp&ohms, making a good match for window line feed cable, and further broadening the resonant frequency band of the antenna.|$|E

50|$|The early flat <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables</b> {{were used}} in the mainframe-computer industry, on card readers, card-punching machines, and tape machines. Subsequently, <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables</b> were {{manufactured}} by a number of different companies, including 3M. Methods and materials were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables,</b> by standardizing the design and spacing of the wires, and the thickness of the insulation, so that they could be easily terminated through the use of insulation-displacement connectors (IDC). Due to the simplicity of <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables,</b> their low profile, and low cost due to standardization, <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables</b> are used today in most computers, printers, and many electronic devices.|$|R
50|$|Round {{parallel}} ATA cables (as {{opposed to}} <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables)</b> were eventually {{made available for}} 'case modders' for cosmetic reasons, as well as claims of improved computer cooling and were easier to handle; however, only <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables</b> are supported by the ATA specifications.|$|R

50|$|The v3.x {{hardware}} uses a 5x2 header. The v4.0 hardware uses a 6x2 header, {{which is}} an uncommon <b>ribbon</b> <b>cable</b> size, where as 7x2 and 8x2 are common <b>ribbon</b> <b>cable</b> headers.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>ribbon</b> <b>cable</b> {{was invented}} in 1956 by Cicoil Corporation, a company based in Chatsworth, California. The company's {{engineers}} {{figured out how to}} use a new material, silicone rubber, to [...] "mold" [...] a flat cable containing multiple conductors of the same size. Since the cable looked like a flat ribbon or tape, it was named a <b>ribbon</b> <b>cable.</b> The <b>ribbon</b> <b>cable</b> allowed companies like IBM and Sperry/Univac to replace bulky, stiff round cables with sleek, flexible ribbon cables.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ribbon</b> <b>cables</b> {{are usually}} seen for {{internal}} peripherals in computers, such as hard drives, CD drives and floppy drives. On some older computer systems (such as the BBC Micro and Apple II series) {{they were used}} for external connections as well. The ribbon-like shape interferes with computer cooling by disrupting airflow within the case and also makes the cables awkward to handle, especially when {{there are a lot}} of them; as a result, round cables have almost entirely replaced <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables</b> for external connections and are increasingly being used internally as well.|$|R
5000|$|When {{electronics}} hobbyists {{are working}} on their computers or digital musical keyboards to [...] "mod" [...] (modify) or [...] "hack" [...] them, they sometimes have to solder <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables.</b> Soldering <b>ribbon</b> <b>cables</b> can present a challenge to a hobbyist {{who has not been}} trained as an electronics technician. In some cases, hobbyists strip off the wire with a fine razor, and then separate the wires before soldering them. Some hobbyists use fine sandpaper to wear away the plastic insulation from the wires. The sanding also primes the copper tracks. Then when the [...] "tinned" [...] soldering iron is touched onto the bare wire, the solder is guided into the track.|$|R
