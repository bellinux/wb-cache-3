5000|$|The name [...] "Best Western" [...] was {{a result}} of most of their {{properties}} originally being in the United States west of the Mississippi River. By 1962, Best Western had the only hospitality <b>reservations</b> <b>service</b> covering the entire United States, and in 1963, was the largest motel chain in the industry with 699 member properties and 35,201 rooms. From 1946 to 1964, Best Western had a marketing partnership with Quality Courts, the forerunner of the chain known today as Quality Inns, whose properties were located mostly east of the Mississippi River, not in direct competition with Best Western. This partnership made sense geographically, but was not successful in the long run, and was eventually abandoned. In 1964, Best Western launched an expansion effort of its own operations east of the Mississippi using the moniker [...] "Best Eastern" [...] for those properties with the same typestyle and Gold Crown logo as [...] "Best Western." [...] By 1967, the [...] "Best Eastern" [...] name was dropped and all motels from coast-to-coast got the [...] "Best Western" [...] name and Gold Crown, a move that would further enhance an already successful marketing brand into the [...] "World's Largest Hotel Chain" [...] by the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} premise that the use of Internet airline reservation systems is perceived to be riskier than traditional airline reservation systems. Unlike previous studies on perceived risk that typically focused on the relationship of perceived risk and information search, this study examines the dynamics of perceived risk throughout the various stages of the consumer buying process. A survey of 159 respondents reveals that perceived risk for both traditional and Internet airline <b>reservation</b> <b>services</b> follows a systematic pattern throughout the consumer buying process. Perceived risk for both traditional and Internet airline reservation systems falls during information search but recovers and rapidly increases as consumers approach the moment of purchase. When viewed as a dynamic process, perceived risk for Internet airline <b>reservation</b> <b>services</b> shows more radical changes in risk levels than the traditional service. Another major finding of this study is the discovery of a risk premium for Internet airline <b>reservation</b> <b>services</b> that permeates all stages of the consumer buying process...|$|R

40|$|To {{address the}} {{anticipated}} sporadic terabyte demands generated by high-end time-constrained applications, dynamically reconfigurable optical networks services are envisioned. However, {{the time and}} rate granularities of a bandwidth <b>reservation</b> <b>service</b> and those of transfer tasks using the reserved capacity is not necessarly {{in the same order}} of magnitude.

This paper explores the interactions between a bandwidth <b>reservation</b> <b>service</b> and a data mover service guaranteeing bulk data transfers. We formulate the underlying optimisation problem and propose an optimal strategy for bandwidth provisionning when time-constrained bulk data transfer requests are known in advance.
