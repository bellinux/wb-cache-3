5|$|Emeric, Stephen's {{only son}} to survive infancy, {{died in an}} {{accident}} in 1031. Stephen's cousin Vazul had the strongest claim to the throne, but the King overlooked him and named Peter as his heir. On Stephen's order, Vazul was blinded shortly thereafter and his three sonsLevente, Andrew and Béla exiled, which strengthened Peter's right of succession. The King asked Peter {{to take an oath}} <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> property of his wife, Queen Giselle, suggesting that Peter's relationship with his aunt was tense.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{logistical}} problems, the new Polish Commander-in-Chief Jan Krukowiecki, who {{had replaced}} Dembiński in mid-August, ordered a sortie {{on the right}} bank. Like his predecessor, Krukowiecki was a conservative and believed the main aim of the November Uprising was {{the return of the}} status quo ante with the tsars of Russia as kings of Poland, but <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> constitution and Polish laws. Unlike Skrzynecki, he believed foreign intervention to be unrealistic, and wanted to force the Russians to return to peace talks by defeating the Russian forces, breaking the siege or defeating the assault attempts.|$|E
5|$|From 1885 to 1893, the {{architect}} Helgo Zettervall (1831-1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking {{to give the}} cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he {{has been criticized for}} not <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it as high as it was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E

According to the briefing that followed his reunion with bishop González Nieves, it was established that the religious leader tried to convince him to move away from armed conflict and to abandon clandestine activities. However, Ojeda Ríos responded by replying that, despite <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> motives behind these suggestions, he declined. He extended an offer of his own to the bishop to join the efforts of the EPB, which was turned down as well.|$|E
5|$|In the {{township}} of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona), {{the widow of}} Jaume Figueras commissioned Gaudí to renovate the Torre Bellesguard (1900–1909), former summer palace of King Martin I the Humane. Gaudí designed it in a neo-Gothic style, <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> former building as much as possible, and tried as always to integrate the architecture into the natural surroundings. This influenced his choice of local slate for the construction. The building's ground-plan measures 15 x 15 meters, with the corners oriented to the four cardinal points. Constructed in stone and brick, it is taller than it is wide, with a spire topped with the four-armed cross, the Catalan flag and the royal crown. The house has a basement, ground floor, first floor and an attic, with a gable roof.|$|E
5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also evolve in a unitary fashion, <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground floor}} of Manjakamiadana was divided into two vast rooms with {{furniture}} and decor that reflected European influence but with placement of objects <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> norms of Malagasy cosmology. Following the reign of RadamaII, the building was no longer inhabited but instead was reserved for state occasions. The northernmost of these two rooms {{was the site of}} the signing of important trade treaties with British and American dignitaries. It was also opened annually for the celebration of the Fandroana (Royal Bath) ceremony. Following the imposition of French colonial rule, Manjakamiadana was transformed in 1897 into L'Ecole Le Myre de Vilers (Le Myre de Vilers School), a training centre for Malagasy civil servants employed by the French colonial regime. When the purpose of the building changed, the elevation of the main hall's floor was raised by building a platform on top of the original wooden floor.|$|E
5|$|When Ladislaus IV {{was murdered}} in 1290, the Holy See {{declared}} the kingdom a vacant fief. Although Rome granted the kingdom to his sister's son, Charles Martel, crown prince of the Kingdom of Naples, {{the majority of the}} Hungarian lords chose Andrew, the grandson of AndrewII and son of a prince of dubious legitimacy. Andrew became the first monarch to take an oath <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> liberties of the Church and the nobility before his coronation. He regularly convoked the prelates, the lords and the noblemen's representatives to assemblies known as Diets, which started to develop into a legislative body. By 1300, when the kingdom had disintegrated into autonomous provinces ruled by powerful noblemen (including Matthew Csák, Ladislaus Kán, and Amadeus Aba), the Croatian lord, Paul I Šubić of Bribir, dared to invite the late Charles Martel's son, the twelve-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary. The young pretender was marching from Croatia towards Buda when AndrewIII unexpectedly died on January 14, 1301.|$|E

Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E

5|$|The {{positive}} {{economic outlook}} for Greece—based {{on the return}} of seasonally adjusted real GDP growth across {{the first three quarters}} of 2014—was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in Q4-2014. This new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to the premature snap parliamentary election called by the Greek parliament in December 2014 and the following formation of a Syriza-led government refusing to accept <b>respecting</b> <b>the</b> terms of its current bailout agreement. The rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to Greece under its current programme, until such time as the Greek government either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors. This rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis (both for the Greek government and Greek financial system), resulting in plummeting stock prices at the Athens Stock Exchange while interest rates for the Greek government at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source.|$|E
