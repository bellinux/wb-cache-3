5|$|The {{constant}} {{change of}} colonial administrators, {{and the corresponding}} reissue of encomienda licenses to <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> of the incoming official, prolonged the instability {{in the province of}} Chiapa. In 1531, Pedro de Alvarado finally took up the post of governor of Chiapa. He immediately reinstated the old name of San Cristóbal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the encomiendas of Chiapa were transferred to new owners. The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan; it was not successful in terms of conquest, but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses. The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still-independent regions, leading to a cycle of slave raids, trade for supplies, followed by further conquests and slave raids.|$|E

5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers and their <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> Soliciting employment {{from those in}} positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the orphanage}} staff {{who thought that}} Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her legal {{guardian}} in 1936, although she {{was not able to}} take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months, as Doc molested her. After staying with various of her and Grace's <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> in Los Angeles and Compton, Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the Sawtelle district. She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and was taken to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. While otherwise a mediocre student, Monroe excelled in writing and contributed to the school's newspaper. Due to the elderly Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in either late 1940 or early 1941. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School.|$|E

He gave a few interviews in which he disagreed with the administration's policy of annexing Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Later that year, his wife, Margaret, had a stroke; she died two years later on June 5, 1900. Sherman continued to alternate between houses in Mansfield and Washington. He mostly remained out of politics, except for a letter he wrote endorsing George K. Nash for Governor of Ohio in 1899. Sherman died at his Washington home on October 22, 1900, {{in the company of}} his daughter, <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> After a funeral at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, he was interred in Mansfield City Cemetery with his wife.|$|E

Lennon, hitherto inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> By December he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he was refusing to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono {{who claimed to have}} found a cure for smoking. But after the meeting he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent that}} Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E
5|$|When {{both men}} were arrested on 18 January, Carty said he was {{innocent}} of the allegations and claimed {{he had been in}} a pub in Kilburn with <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends,</b> and stayed the night at a relative's house. When police searched his home, they found a pair of trainers that forensic tests showed had a drop of ap Rhys Pryce's blood on one toe. DNA from several people, including Brown, were found on the trainers. Officers also found a top with traces of Brown's DNA, and fibres found on Pryce's overcoat were microscopically indistinguishable from the material of that top. Brown also said he had been in Kilburn {{the night of the murder}} and initially claimed that he had nothing to do with either the robbery of the other man or the robbery and murder of Pryce. When the mobile phone of the other victim (Ali) was discovered at his home, he claimed he had bought it from two men. Detectives also found that Brown had hoarded press cuttings of Pryce.|$|E
5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study several dimensions of family strengths in family systems and to determine to what degree these strengths are passed {{from one generation to the}} next. The sample consisted of 23 couples, constituting the married child generation, and each husband 2 ̆ 7 s father and each wife 2 ̆ 7 s mother, constituting the parent generation, for a total of 23 family systems and a total of 92. Each person involved in the study had to be in their first marriage and have at least one child. A significant (alpha. 05) difference was found between the father and son generations on the <b>relative</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> support <b>and</b> the professional support. The alpha levels for differences between mothers and daughters on these two dimensions were. 146 (<b>relative</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> support) <b>and.</b> 190 (professional support). A factorial analysis of variance suggests these differences are between generations rather than between genders of family groups. Significant correlations were found between the fathers 2 ̆ 7 family togetherness score and the sons 2 ̆ 7 family flexibility score and between the fathers 2 ̆ 7 quality of life and the sons 2 ̆ 7 family confidence and family coping and coherence scores, at (r=. 4876, p=. 018), and (r=. 4582, p=. 028), respectively, and between the fathers 2 ̆ 7 family discord and the sons 2 ̆ 7 family discord scores at (r=. 4381, p= 037). Corresponding correlation values for the mothers and daughters were (r=. 0367, p=. 868); (r=-. 2049, p=. 348); (r=-. 0234, p= 916); and (r=. 0011, p =. 996). A significant correlation was found between mothers and daughters on the mothers 2 ̆ 7 <b>relative</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> support score <b>and</b> the daughters 2 ̆ 7 family confidence score at (r=. 4215, p=. 045), while the corresponding coefficient for fathers and sons was (r=-. 3911, p=. 065). Significant correlations were found more often than were significant differences. The results also indicate that the males are more volatile than the females in terms of significant findings on the family strength measures...|$|R
