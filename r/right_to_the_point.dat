Field explained his thought process on the film trailer: [...] "A trailer, is like a one-minute or whatever, mini movie that's got {{to have its own}} feeling and form to it— trailer music is very intense and gets <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> It sounds simple, but it's taken me some years to really figure out. I call it 'rock and roll orchestra' because it's got orchestral elements and, sometimes, a choir, but it also has a lot of rock elements like the drive, the drums and the way it just builds and builds." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{appears to}} be saying that LGE simply {{licensed}} Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products. LGE expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products; and LGE made Intel tell its customers about the absence of a license. But LGE did not say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel’s manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.” [...] LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed to go <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.” ...|$|E

60|$|Our heroic friend sums up for us, {{in other}} words, {{and has always}} summed up, {{the life of the}} mind and the life of the senses alike, taken together, in the most irrepressible freedom of either--and, after that fashion, {{positively}} lives for us, carries on experience for us; does it under our tacit and our at present utterly ungrudging view of her being formed and endowed and constantly prompted, toward such doing, on all sorts of sides that are simply so many reasons for our standing off, standing off in a sort of awed intellectual hush or social suspense, and watching and admiring and thanking her. She is sole and single in this, that she takes charge of those of the interests of man which most dispose him to fraternise with himself, to pervade all his possibilities and to taste all his faculties, and in consequence to find and to make the earth a friendlier, an easier, and especially a more various sojourn; and the great thing is the amiability and the authority, intimately combined, with which she has induced us all to trust her on this ground. There are matters as to which every set of people has of course most to trust itself, most to feel its own genius and its own stoutness--as we are here and all round about us knowing and abiding by that now as we have never done. But I verily think there has never been anything in the world--since the most golden aspect of antiquity at least--like the way in which France has been trusted to gather the rarest and fairest and sweetest fruits of our so tremendously and so mercilessly turned-up garden of life. She has gardened where the soil of humanity has been most grateful and the aspect, so to call it, most toward the sun, and there, at the high and yet mild and fortunate centre, she has grown the precious, intimate, the nourishing, finishing things that she has inexhaustibly scattered abroad. And if we have all so taken them from her, so expected them from her as our <b>right,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that she would have seemed positively to fail of a passed pledge to help us to happiness if she had disappointed us, this has been because of her treating us to the impression of genius as no nation since the Greeks has treated the watching world, and because of our feeling that genius at that intensity is infallible.|$|E

50|$|In {{order for}} the agents to not be {{affected}} by the flash, they wear Ray-Ban super dark sunglasses that reflect the rays. After being neuralyzed, the agents have about 30 seconds to supply new memories to replace the ones they've just erased. If there are more witnesses to neuralyze, or if they are pressed for time, a special team is sent in to supply memories. The obvious flaw of the neuralyzer is that it can't delete a specific desired memory but only can erase all memories of a certain time period starting from the point when it's used, so, if a memory from an earlier time period has to be erased, so do all memories following that specific memory <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of the usage.|$|E
