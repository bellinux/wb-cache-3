40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the {{theoretical and empirical}} predictions {{of the effects of}} <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>hours</b> of work on wages and employment, the economic efficiency arguments for such reductions and the related issue of the determination of <b>hours</b> of work <b>in</b> a bargaining framework. The conventional approach, assumes that workers will want to maintain their incomes in the face of <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>hours</b> of work per period. This is difficult to justify theoretically, when hours and union/worker utility are taken properly into account. Rather, unions and workers that desire <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>hours</b> of work are likely to opt for the same or even a reduced hourly wage, leading to a significant employment effect of any such measure. We show that this result is true in labour markets and economies where unions determine or bargain over the wage and in models where firms set the wage because it affects their workers' productivity. It is also true when firms demand positive overtime, when such models account properly for the long-run movement of hours of work. The thesis examines also the determination of hours, employment and wages in a bargaining framework and shows that the employment effects of unionism are likely to be overestimated when no account is taken of the hours determination procedure. This allows us also to provide an economic rationale for union behaviour regarding <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>hours</b> of work and maximum hours legislation and determine the conditions under which <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> standard <b>hours</b> of work can increase union utility and firm profits. Finally, empirical evidence is provided with a test {{of the relationship between the}} hourly wage and weekly hours of work, using aggregate data. We use a large number of variables and different estimation techniques to avoid simultaneity. Our results suggest, in line with the theoretical predictions, that changes <b>in</b> <b>hours</b> of work have no effect on the hourly wage...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the start}} of the high unemployment, there has been {{discussion}} <b>in</b> Germany of <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours,</b> also for employment policy reasons, as a means of avoiding the threat of redundancies or - for lack of additional jobs - to spread the work available over more people to reduce unemployment. In addition to traditional concepts such as cuts in the statutory working week and increased part-time work, new forms of working time arrangements move into focus here which lead, for example via annual working time accounts, to operating hours and working hours being made more flexible and less closely bound, as well as to an increase in the time sovereignty of the employees. The economic effects of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours,</b> <b>in</b> particular the effects on employment are, however, judged very differently, and not only by the two sides of industry. This article demonstrates economic connections of a general <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours.</b> As a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> influences the economy in several ways, some of which compensate for others, {{it is very difficult to}} deduce definite statements from economic theory, so macroeconomic simulation studies have to be used. For this reason a series of simulations were carried out on the effect of general <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> annual working time, using the lAB/Westphal model, which was developed from the SYSIFO model. The following results can be deduced from the simulation experiments: - A <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> has a positive effect on employment, both with and without compensatory increases in wage rates, whereby, however, the employment effect is clearly less significant in the case of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> with full compensatory increases in wage rates. - The upswing in employment induced by the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> is paid for with price increases and a loss of affluence and growth. - The effects of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> which increase employment, wages and prices, result in reduced state transfer payments and in the medium term also in additional tax revenue for the state. If this is then put back into the economic circulation, the positive employment impulse of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> increases and the losses in affluence and growth can begin to be compensated. - The most advantageous strategy from a employment policy point of view is a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> under the following conditions: - without a compensatory increase in wage rates - use of the state's savings in expenditure and additional revenue to reduce taxes and non-wage labour costs To qualify this it must be stressed that the employment promoting impulses can only be deduced with the model for the national economic average. Disaggregation by trades or industries, regions, occupations or qualifications could result in differing effects. Also, the positive statements are valid only for <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> which do not differ greatly in type and scope from the previous development of annual working time observed in the past. More extensive drops in the average annual working. time could lead to reactions which cancel the connections deduced from the past and are therefore not taken into account in the model. Limitations for the extent of <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> also arise from the international competition connections. It can also be expected that in the case of a completely different pattern of <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours,</b> such as a definite increase in voluntary transitions into part-time employment as well as more extensive flexibility and independence of operating and working hours, other effects will occur. There is something to be said for the fact that in the latter case the negative attendant circumstances could presumably be avoided to a large extent. As a result of its defensive character, an isolated <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> working <b>hours</b> occurring purely for employment policy reasons due to a lack of sufficient jobs available elsewhere, and not embedded in a more extensive strategy of job creation, could hardly be suitable to solve the problems on the labour market permanently.
