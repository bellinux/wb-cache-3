5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|It {{is true that}} I have held, {{and still}} hold, a strong opinion {{with regard to the}} {{judgment}} of Marshall CJ in McCulloch v Maryland - the judgment on which Deakin v Webb was based - although I utter the opinion with a feeling that it will be regarded by some as almost blasphemy. I <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> the utterance rather of the statesman than of the lawyer.|$|E
2500|$|The stories locate {{it somewhere}} in Great Britain and {{sometimes}} {{associate it with}} real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> entirely fictional, its geography being perfect for chivalric romance writers. Nevertheless, arguments about {{the location of the}} [...] "real Camelot" [...] have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes.|$|E
50|$|The APG system, of 1998, also {{recognized}} this family, but left <b>it</b> unplaced <b>as</b> to order, and <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> {{among the most}} basal lineages in the clade angiosperms.|$|R
5000|$|Venison only scored {{one goal}} for the Magpies but he <b>regards</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> the best goal he's ever scored; it was, in his words, [...] "a 20-yard screamer" [...] against Aston Villa at a packed St James' Park.|$|R
50|$|Many of his contemporaries, {{in their}} own written responsa, {{including}} Rabbi Yosef Karo's Beit Yosef, have cited his interpretation, <b>regarding</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> authoritative. After {{the death of the}} chief rabbi of Jerusalem, Rabbi Levi ibn Habib (ha-Ralbach), Rabbi Sirilio became the leading sage of the Jerusalem community, until his own death a few years later.|$|R
2500|$|On February 3, 1840, a {{complaint}} was {{brought by the}} owners of typographical workshops to the Câmara dos Deputados (Chamber of Deputies - the parliament), alleging that [...] "without condemnation or sentence", they had been {{the victims of the}} whims of the authorities (police) which had been coming into the workshops and destroying their presses. On the night of August 11 of that same year, there was rioting in the streets of Lisbon, which lead Queen Mary II to begin a cycle of constant and successive [...] "temporary" [...] elimination of liberties, like the freedom of press, resulting in further rioting. The law of October 19, drafted by Costa Cabral, forced publishers to pay hefty bonds, deposits and mortgages, and to submit to an exam qualifying them as honorable persons. Press freedom would only be formally reestablished through the law of August 3, 1850 (known as the [...] "Lei das Rolhas" [...] ), even though public opinion did not <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> {{in the spirit of the}} Constitution, because it still contained heavy sanctions which in practice completely restricted the activity of writers and journalists. Among the intellectuals that rebelled against this law were Alexandre Herculano, Almeida Garrett, António Pedro Lopes de Mendonça, José Estêvão de Magalhães and Latino Coelho. Also sharing this opinion was the Duque of Saldanha, who shortly after rising to power, revoked it, opening a period known as the [...] "Regeneração" [...] (regeneration/renewal) which would be especially welcomed by journalists after the law of May 17, 1866 specifically abolished any [...] "bonds or restrictions to the periodical press".|$|E
60|$|This was {{the only}} retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy {{creature}} was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by {{it as if it}} had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> like the honorable Finch's impudence to come down to that Grove,--we always talked about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by that? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this time}} Jo has been {{standing}} on {{the spot where he}} woke up, ever picking his cap and putting bits of fur in his mouth. He spits them out with a remorseful air, for he feels that it is in his nature to be an unimprovable reprobate and that it's no good HIS trying to keep awake, for HE won't never know nothink. Though it may be, Jo, that there is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near the brutes as thine, recording deeds done on this earth for common men, that if the Chadbands, removing their own persons from the light, would but show it thee in simple reverence, would but leave it unimproved, would but <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> eloquent enough without their modest aid--it might hold thee awake, and thou might learn from it yet! ...|$|E
50|$|True-believer {{syndrome}} is an informal or rhetorical term used by M. Lamar Keene in his 1976 book The Psychic Mafia. Keene {{used the term}} to refer to people who continued to believe in a paranormal event or phenomenon even after it had been proven to have been staged. Keene considered {{it to be a}} cognitive disorder, and <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> a key factor in the success of many psychic mediums.|$|R
2500|$|In any case, {{the debate}} is purely modern: {{it is clear that}} most Byzantine viewers did not {{consider}} their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic. As Cyril Mango has observed, [...] "our own appreciation of Byzantine art stems largely from the fact that this art is not naturalistic; yet the Byzantines themselves, judging by their extant statements, <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> highly naturalistic and <b>as</b> <b>being</b> directly in the tradition of Phidias, Apelles, and Zeuxis." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{consequence}} of these traditions, Classical Rabbinical Literature theorised {{that the name}} was a (linguistically corrupted) reference to the Temple, suggesting translations like the teaching-place (referring to the Sanhedrin that met there), the place of fear (referring to the supposed fear that non-Israelites would have at the Temple), the place of myrrh (referring to the spices burnt as incense). Targum Pseudo-Jonathan interprets the name as land of worship, while the Samaritan Targum <b>regards</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> land of vision.|$|R

50|$|A 2015 DNA {{analysis}} {{indicates the}} species is {{more closely related to}} the pipits than the white-eyes, and some taxonomic authorities now tend to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> {{a member of the family}} Motacillidae within the clade containing pipits in the genus Anthus.|$|E
5000|$|Sahih al-Bukhari {{is one of}} the six {{canonical}} Hadith {{collections of}} Sunni Islam. Sunni Muslims <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> the most authentic of the six, and is considered to be the most authentic book after Qur-an. Sahih al-Bukhari contains a chapter [...] "Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihad)".|$|E
5000|$|Darwin's rhea is {{categorized}} as least concern by the IUCN. The former southern nominate subspecies remains relatively widespread and locally fairly common. Its range {{is estimated at}} 859000 km2. The situation for the two former northern subspecies is more worrying, with their combined population estimated <b>as</b> <b>being</b> possibly <b>as</b> low as in the hundreds. However, they are classified as Rhea tarapacensis by the IUCN, which <b>regards</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> near threatened, with the primary threats being hunting, egg-collecting, and fragmentation of its habitat due to conversion to farmland or pastures for cattle-grazing.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in Tokyo {{the secret}} Navy {{proposal}} was {{opposed by the}} Imperial Japanese Army and Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, who <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> unfeasible given Australia's geography {{and the strength of}} the Allied defences. Instead, the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by advancing through the South Pacific. This offensive was abandoned following the Battle of the Coral Sea and Battle of Midway in May and June 1942, and all subsequent Japanese operations in the vicinity of Australia were undertaken to slow the advance of Allied forces.|$|R
5000|$|St John the Evangelist's Church is in {{the small}} village of Byley, Cheshire, England. It is {{recorded}} in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. [...] It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Middlewich. Its benefice is combined with that of St Michael and All Angels, Middlewich. [...] The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> [...] "really very ugly" [...] with a [...] "minimum of motifs, but a maximum of materials".|$|R
50|$|Allegorical {{interpretations of}} Genesis are {{readings}} of the biblical Book of Genesis that treat elements of the narrative as symbols or types, rather than viewing them literally as historical events. Either way, Genesis is canonical scripture for Judaism and most sects of Christianity, and believers generally <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> of spiritual significance.|$|E
50|$|Although it is {{regarded}} as a heterostracan, its exact placement within Heterostraci {{is regarded}} as incertae sedis, as {{the fact that it is}} currently impossible to discern where its dorsal and ventral plates (which are made up of a mosaic of the aforementioned tiny scales) end or begin. Some experts <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> descended from the basal heterostracans of the Silurian.|$|E
50|$|The name Artemia parthenogenetica {{is widely}} used in the {{relevant}} literature, although some taxonomists <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> used incorrectly to refer to parthenogenetic populations of Artemia that do not form a true species. A 2015 study based on microsatellite markers showed that parthenogenetic populations of different ploidy levels group together in a principal component analysis, and are distinct from related species such as Artemia sinica, Artemia tibetiana and Artemia urmiana.|$|E
5000|$|In the German tradition, Naturphilosophie (philosophy of nature) persisted {{into the}} 18th and 19th century {{as an attempt}} to achieve a {{speculative}} unity of nature and spirit. Some of the greatest names in German philosophy are associated with this movement, including Goethe, Hegel and Schelling. Naturphilosophie was associated with Romanticism and a view that regarded the natural world as a kind of giant organism, as opposed to the philosophical approach of figures such as John Locke and Isaac Newton who espoused a more mechanical view of the world, <b>regarding</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> like a machine.|$|R
50|$|Ian Watt's The Rise of the Novel (1957) still dominates {{attempts}} at writing {{a history of}} the novel. Watt's view is that the critical feature of the 18th-century novel is the creation of psychological realism. This feature, he argued, would continue on and influence the novel <b>as</b> <b>it</b> has been known in the 20th century, and therefore those novels that created it are, in fact, the true progenitors of the novel. Although Watt thought Tristram Shandy was the finest novel of the century, he also <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> a stylistic cul-de-sac. Since Watt's work, numerous theorists and historians have attempted to answer the limitations of his assumptions.|$|R
50|$|The Dibb Report {{received}} a mixed response. Some experts <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> {{an important contribution}} to developing an independent Australian defence posture. Other experts criticised the report for calling for an essentially defensive military strategy, implying that existing Australian military capabilities be abandoned and making optimistic assumptions about the period of time available to detect and respond to new threats to Australia. Many of the Dibb Report's assumptions were used in developing the 1987 Defence white paper, The Defence of Australia, but the Government did not adopt some of Dibb's key recommendations, such as those concerning Australia's relationship with the United States and the Australian military's role in the Pacific.|$|R
50|$|In summary, the {{external}} evidence stands against Matthew using Mark, inasmuch as Matthew was written first, and against Mark directly using Matthew, unless perhaps {{either of these}} canonical Gospels is a translation into Greek influenced by the other. The patristic consensus, rather, was literary independence. But {{the value of this}} external evidence is uncertain; most synoptic scholars <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> of little help and focus almost entirely on the internal evidence instead.|$|E
5000|$|The poem is 36 lines long, with breaks after lines 9, 15, 18, 23 and 26, {{which would}} seem to divide it into six stanzas. However critics {{typically}} <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> in four sections, each of which begins with the image [...] "" [...] which can be translated as [...] "Black milk of dawn." [...] The speaking voice in the poem is mostly a collective [...] "We". The structure of the poem has been said to reflect that of a musical fugue in that phrases are repeated and recombined, comparably to the musical genre.|$|E
5000|$|Mundesley Volunteer Inshore Lifeboat is a {{voluntary}} run lifeboat station {{located in the}} village of Mundesley in the English county of Norfolk. The station operates one lifeboat which is used for inshore work. The lifeboat service is a [...] "Declared Facility", this means that H.M.

The lifeboat provides it service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to windsurfers, fishing boats, swimmers and divers or anybody in distress within the Mundesley area. The service has also provided assistance to boats of various sizes which have required towing etc.|$|E
5000|$|As in many fields, as {{time went}} by, people used the word perhaps without {{understanding}} its detailed meaning, so that it became applied less precisely and other configurations were given the name. By 1911, as the motor-propelled lorry (a kind of truck) developed, a pedant would have <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> more the heir of the heavy trolley than of the horse-drawn lorry. However, the railway vehicles, first noted by the Oxford English Dictionary from 1838, were more like the horse-drawn road lorry. In these earlier years, it was also called a lurry. In Britain, [...] "lorry" [...] nowadays means any large powered truck.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{reference}} to the name sampi in the western literature occurs in a 17th-century work, Scaliger's discussion of the Aristophanes scholion regarding the word samphoras (see above). Some modern authors, taking Scaliger's reference as the first known use and unaware of earlier attestations, have claimed that the name itself only originated in the 17th century and/or that Scaliger himself invented it. A related term was used shortly after Scaliger by the French author Montfaucon, who called the sign [...] "" [...] (antisigma-pi), [...] "because the Greeks <b>regarded</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> composed of an inverted sigma, which is called , and from [...] " [...] ("Graeci putarunt ex inverso sigma, quod [...] vocatur, et ex [...] compositum esse").|$|R
5000|$|Adrian Searle of The Guardian {{commented that}} [...] "the scale and {{modelling}} {{and degree of}} detail feel right", with a [...] "lifelike and other-worldly" [...] feel to the sculpture. He felt that it avoided [...] "straining to look meaningful or relevant" [...] and that despite its irreverence, it [...] "lightens the mood and lifts the spirit." [...] The Daily Telegraph's Serena Davis did not <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> as impressive {{as some of the}} previous works to have stood on the fourth plinth, but nonetheless called it [...] "one of the jolliest things to have sat upon the square's spare plinth since the public art commissions for it began in 2005." ...|$|E
5000|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 85% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 40 reviews the website collected. [...] Some critics <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> {{one of the}} best and most effective horror films; admirers say the film balances a stellar script, gruesome effects, and outstanding performances. However, the movie has its detractors as well, including Kim Newman who has criticized it for messy plot construction, conventionality and overblown pretentiousness, among other perceived defects. Writer James Baldwin provides an extended negative critique in his book length essay The Devil Finds Work.|$|E
5000|$|Camelot is {{a castle}} and court {{associated}} with the legendary King Arthur. Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, after the Lancelot-Grail cycle, eventually came to {{be described as the}} fantastic capital of Arthur's realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world. The stories locate it somewhere in Great Britain and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> entirely fictional, its geography being perfect for romance writers; Arthurian scholar Norris J.

Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the [...] "real Camelot" [...] have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{symptomatology}} of congenital saccular and arteriovenous aneurysms {{as well as}} {{of other}} vascular abnormalities of the brain have been carefully des-cribed by a number of authors, {{and there seems to be}} little to add to this interesting chapter of surgical neurology. However, there is a type of vascular lesion characterized by fusiform enlargement, generally bilateral, of the subclinoid portion of the carotid artery which is less well known (Fig. 1). This lesion was first described, so far as we know, by Adson, who published two of these cases in 1942. He does not consider it a true aneurysm and <b>regards</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> due to hardening of the wall and abnormal internal rotation of the intracranial carotid.

Examining a key they found in the Pope's Chambers, they match the DNA of the victim with DNA of the Tornado acquired when he was shot, and thus believe themselves to have solved the case. However, Clouseau is unconvinced and believes the Tornado was not the thief.|$|R
5000|$|The Holiness Code is a {{collection}} of many laws concerning several subjects. Critical scholarship therefore <b>regards</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> generally a work constructed by the collecting together of a series of earlier collections of laws. One of the most noticeable elements of the work is a large section concerning various sexual activities, which are prohibited [...] "lest the land vomit you out". These prohibitions include sexual relations with one's mother, step-mother, sister, step-sister, sister-in-law, aunt, granddaughter, daughter-in-law, with a woman as well as her daughter, with a ritually unclean woman, with the wife of a neighbor, with another man, or with an animal.
