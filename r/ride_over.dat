5|$|News of Philip's death roused {{many states}} into revolt, {{including}} Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When {{news of the}} revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, and ordered his men to <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around {{the sides of the}} ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E

The slant-eyed man summons a shantak-bird, which both <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> the Plateau of Leng, a vast tableland populated by Pan-like beings. Arriving at a monastery wherein dwells the dreaded High Priest Not to Be Described, Carter now suspects that the slant-eyed man is yet another conspirator of the forces that seek to thwart his quest.|$|E
25|$|Wave-piercing {{catamarans}} {{employ a}} low-buoyancy bow on each hull that is {{pointed at the}} water line and rises aft, up to a level, to allow each hull to pierce waves, rather than <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> them. This allows higher speeds through waves than for a conventional catamaran. They are distinguished from SWATH catamarans, in that the buoyant part of the hull is not tubular. The spanning bridge deck may be configured {{with some of the}} characteristics of a normal V-hull, which allows it to penetrate the crests of waves.|$|E

25|$|It {{would seem}} {{that it was a}} {{pleasant}} day out for a couple of the canons or friars of Wells to hire horses and <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> to talk business with Denys, perhaps an excuse to enjoy some all-expenses paid entertainment. It appears that Denys held the farm until his death in 1422, although records are not available to confirm this. A cadet branch of the Denys family became lords of the manor of Pucklechurch, probably in the 16th century, and continuing until the death of William Dennis in 1701, last of the male line.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{spectrum}} of stirrup lengths, which the rider may chose depending on the purpose. For example, in dressage, the longest possible stirrup length is used {{in order for the}} rider to have complete control over every nuance of the horse's movement. Likewise, a very long stirrup is used in the western sport of cutting, where, though the rider relinquishes control to the horse, requires maximum security to stay in the saddle during the rapid stops, turns and bursts of speed the horse uses when maneuvering cattle. For a comfortable <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> long hours at slow speeds, the long stirrup is also preferred by trail riders.|$|E
25|$|To {{celebrate}} the official launch of The Book of Air Collector's Edition, PlayFirst invited four local Dream Chronicles fans in San Francisco, United States. The invitation included {{one and a}} half hour to preview the game, a trip to the California Academy of Sciences, a tour around their office, and time to speak with a panel of the local Dream Chronicles team about the inspiration, story, and future of the Dream Chronicles series. Here, the fans got a chance to speak with Kenny Dinkin, PlayFirst's Chief Creative Officer then about the inspiration for Dream Chronicles, and how they work with the developer KatGames. PlayFirst also hosted seven members of the media, three of their local Dream Chronicles fans, their CEO Mari Baker, and senior product marketing manager Becky Ann Hughes on a real airship <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> San Francisco Bay Area, mimicking Lyra’s own travels in the game.|$|E

25|$|Since the US {{returned}} {{control of}} the Ryukyu Islands to Japan in 1972, development on Iriomote continued with finances from the Okinawan mainland. In 1977, a prefectural road was built that circles half of the island, {{which has led to}} a few Iriomote cat deaths every year due to traffic accidents. The Ministry of the Environment as well as the governments of Okinawa and Taketomi Town began installing road signs to warn people of Iriomote cats, tunnels beneath the road for animals' safe crossing, zebra zones which create loud noises when cars <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> them, wide ditches on the sides of roads, and ditches {{on the side of the}} road that are inclined on one side in order to improve the preservation of the cats. However, many residents have objected to restrictions on land cultivation and improvement brought about by the measures in place to protect the Iriomote cat and other species on the island.|$|E
25|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies - with an all-new, {{sturdier}} perimeter frame, new chassis/body mounts, larger 8½inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm bushings, increased {{front and rear}} suspension travel, new shock absorber location, and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E
25|$|Downriver {{transport}} {{could be}} quite fast for the day. A traveler bound from Walla Walla would take the stage to Wallula, board the Colonel Wright or another steamer, then head downriver to Celilo. After a bumpy <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> the portage, the traveler would arrive at The Dalles where an overnight stay would be necessary {{at one of the}} hotels. The next morning the traveler would board a steamboat on the middle river, perhaps the Oneonta, for a morning run down to the Upper Cascades. There again the traveler disembarked, usually on the favored north side, and rode on the portage railway to the landing at the Lower Cascades. There, a steamer, possibly the Wilson G. Hunt, then ran downriver to Portland, which the traveler reached some thirty hours after leaving Walla Walla, a feat which was considered remarkable at that time. The genius of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company was to control all the boats on all the steps of the staircase, and the portages too, thus achieving a monopoly on transport in the days before there were roads or railways capable of mounting any competition. The Wright was simply superb at making money, earning as much as $2,500 a trip in passenger fares alone.|$|E

25|$|Lexus {{unveiled}} the fifth-generation ES in February 2006 at the Chicago Auto Show for the 2007 model year. The line initially {{consisted of the}} ES 350 sedan, which as per previous models, featured front-wheel drive and a V6 engine—now displacing 3.5 liters. The line was refreshed in 2009, during which more features were added, and a four-cylinder variant, the ES 240, was introduced for Asian markets. The fifth-generation ES remained Lexus' top-selling sedan model in the North American and Asian markets, anchoring the marque's entry-level model lineup. Like previous generations, the fifth-generation Lexus ES was geared towards the comfort luxury segment, favoring a soft <b>ride</b> <b>over</b> sporty performance. It continued the previous generation's direction of moving the ES more upscale in its design and features; Lexus touted the ES 350 as faster, more powerful, more aerodynamic, and more quiet than the original LS 400 flagship. Like its predecessors, the fifth-generation ES continued {{to be made in}} Japan, at the Kyushu plant in Fukuoka, Japan. Despite being built in the country, the XV40 is left-hand drive only and was not sold in the Japanese market, {{as well as the other}} regions with right-hand drive, although the country allows both RHD and LHD vehicles on their roads.|$|E
25|$|Belisarius's fleet {{during the}} Vandalic War, as {{described}} by Procopius of Caesarea, was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that {{by that time the}} lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation. These 6th-century dromons were single-banked ("monoreme") ships of probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger, these extended directly from the hull. In the later two-banked ("bireme") dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the ship's marines in boarding operations. The Greek scholar Christos Makrypoulias suggests an arrangement of 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to maneuver effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os).
