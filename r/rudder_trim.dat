25|$|On 24 August 2010, an Airbus A321-231 (registration G-MEDJ) {{en route}} from Khartoum to Beirut as flight BD996 {{suffered}} a serious electrical malfunction which caused the intermittent failure of the captain and co-pilot's electronic displays together with the uncommanded application of left <b>rudder</b> <b>trim.</b> The latter caused the aircraft to stray 20 nautical miles off course. The aircraft was cruising at 36,000ft at the time, with both autopilot and autothrust engaged. The captain ultimately disengaged both and flew the aircraft manually, landing in Beirut without further mishap. Airbus indicated that an electrical power interruption had occurred which had caused a reset of the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC). Such an event may cause a small incremental offset of the <b>rudder</b> <b>trim,</b> according to the aircraft manufacturer. The Air Accidents Investigations Board (AAIB) subsequently issued Safety Recommendation 2010-092, recommending that Airbus alert all operators of A320 series aircraft {{of the possibility that}} an electrical malfunction may not be clearly annunciated on the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring system (ECAM) and that such an event may lead to an uncommanded input of <b>rudder</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{design team}} also {{attempted}} to minimize {{changes in the}} aircraft's trim at varying speeds, thus reducing the pilot's workload. They were so successful in this regard that they found in-flight-adjustable aileron and <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> tabs were not necessary. Small, fixed tabs were fitted to control surfaces and adjusted for proper balance during initial test flights. Only the elevator trim needed to be adjusted in flight (a feature common to all aircraft). This was accomplished by tilting the entire horizontal tailplane with an electric motor, with an angle of incidence ranging from −3° to +5°.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} blocks, called {{chips for}} their square shape, are chip, frame, <b>rudder,</b> rudderf, <b>trim,</b> trimf, wheel, reaction less wheel (RLW), jet, arm, and cowl. All chips have an angle, a color, and an option.|$|R
5000|$|A {{falling leaf}} is a {{controlled}} stall {{performed in a}} fixed-wing aircraft. The maneuver is performed by purposely stalling the airplane and then carefully using the rudder to try to hold the aircraft on a steady course. The falling leaf consists of a constant rotation about the yaw axis while continually changing the direction. This is opposed to a flat spin, where the aircraft constantly rotates around its yaw axis in only one direction, similar to a Frisbee. The falling leaf is sometimes described as carefully [...] "walking" [...] the aircraft while stalled. The maneuver is typically performed mostly with the <b>rudder,</b> <b>trimming</b> with the elevator but keeping the ailerons neutral.|$|R
25|$|To {{make the}} R.E.8 less tiring to fly, the pilot's {{controls}} included a wheel {{to adjust the}} tailplane incidence in flight and a form of primitive <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> (applied to the rudder bar) was provided to alleviate the constant pressure necessary to counteract the torque of the propeller. Basic flight controls were installed in the observer's cockpit and folded {{out of the way}} when not in use. They were connected to the elevators, rudder and throttle but not to the ailerons, and were intended to give observers a chance to make a forced landing if the pilot was killed or incapacitated rather than to offer true dual control.|$|E
500|$|The second {{prototype}} had a redesigned single vertical stabiliser and a 610PS (...) Junkers Jumo 210 A engine installed, {{and later}} the Jumo 210 Da. The first A series variant, the A-0, was of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit under a [...] "greenhouse" [...] well-framed canopy; bearing twin radio masts on its aft sections, diagonally mounted {{to either side of}} the airframe's planform centreline and unique to the -A version. To ease the difficulty of mass production, {{the leading edge of the}} wing was straightened out and the ailerons' two aerofoil sections had smooth leading and trailing edges. The pilot could adjust the elevator and <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> tabs in flight, and the tail was connected to the landing flaps, which were positioned in two parts between the ailerons and fuselage. The A-0 also had a flatter engine cowling, which gave the pilot a much better field of vision. In order for the engine cowling to be flattened, the engine was set down nearly [...] The fuselage was also lowered along with the gunner's position, allowing the gunner a better field of fire.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dorsal fin}} kits became {{available}} in August 1944, and available as retrofits for P-51Bs and P-51Cs (but rarely {{used on the}} [...] "razorback" [...] -B and -C Mustangs), and to early P-51Ds and P-51Ks that had not already been built with them. Also incorporated was a change to the <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> tabs, which would help prevent the pilot over-controlling the aircraft and creating heavy loads on the tail unit.|$|E
5000|$|Some multihulls use three foils; {{two main}} forward foils provide lift {{so that the}} boat [...] "flies" [...] while a {{horizontal}} foil on the <b>rudder</b> is <b>trimmed</b> to drive and control altitude. On catamarans, a single main foil can be attached between the hulls {{just in front of}} the center of gravity and at 2 degrees of incidence, spanning the tunnel with supporting struts. Hydrofoil catamarans are also called foilcats.|$|R
50|$|The MB.160 had {{conventional}} empennage, {{with the}} tailplane and elevators mounted {{near the top}} of the fuselage. Together, they were tapered and round tipped; the elevators, like the <b>rudder,</b> had <b>trim</b> tabs. The latter was straight-edged and balanced. Though it extended to the keel, it was hinged non-vertically so was far enough back to clear the elevators. The fin was essentially triangular. All the rear surfaces had steel internal structures rather like those of the wing.|$|R
50|$|The NC.1070 was {{powered by}} a pair of SNECMA 14R fourteen-cylinder, two-row, {{air-cooled}} radial engines mounted well ahead of the wing. The fairings behind them extended around the wings and beyond as booms; at their rear, rectangular fixed tailplanes linked the booms to the fuselage. A straight tapered fin and <b>rudder</b> with <b>trim</b> tabs was mounted {{at the end of each}} boom with a constant chord, round tipped main tailplane mounted on top of them, carrying a one-piece elevator.|$|R
2500|$|On 6 September 2011, Flight 140, an All Nippon 737-700 {{traveling}} from Naha to Tokyo with 117 passengers and crew, banked over 90 degrees in mid-air and rapidly descended as the First Officer accidentally hit the <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> switch {{instead of the}} door unlock button as the captain returned from the lavatory. [...] The First Officer eventually regained control and levelled the plane. [...] There were minor injuries to two flight attendants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next-generation}} Meteor F.4 prototype first flew on 17 May 1945, {{and went}} into production in 1946 when 16 RAF squadrons were already operating Meteors. Equipped with Rolls-Royce Derwent 5 engines, the smaller version of the Nene, the F.4 was [...] faster than the F.1 at sea level (585 against 415), but the reduced wings impaired its rate of climb.The F.4 wingspan was 86.4cm shorter than the F.3 and with blunter wing tips, derived from the world speed record prototypes. [...] Improvements included a strengthened airframe, fully pressurized cockpit, lighter ailerons to improve manoeuvrability, and <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> adjustments to reduce snaking. The F.4 could be fitted with a drop tank under each wing, and experiments were carried out with carriage of underwing stores and also in lengthened fuselage models.|$|E
2500|$|The CR.100 is a {{conventional}} single engine, low-wing monoplane, {{with the large}} control surface areas and absence of dihedral expected in an aerobatic aircraft. [...] The structure is mostly wood and fabric, though the main wing spar is a plywood and carbon laminate composite and carbon covered ply is an option for the wing surfaces. All the flying surfaces are straight edged and tapered. [...] The ailerons take up about 60% of the wing's trailing edge. The ailerons have spades to reduce control loads. The remainder of the wing trailing edge is three-position flaps. The rudder and elevators are horn balanced {{and there is a}} fixed <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> tab. The width of the flat sided fuselage is determined by the side by side seating arrangement. Full dual controls, including a pair of left hand throttles, are fitted. [...] A sliding bubble canopy covers the cockpit and is faired behind into a raised and rounded fuselage top decking. [...] The wide track main conventional undercarriage has cantilever legs in fairings, with wheels usually in spats. The tailwheel is freely castoring. The CR.100T variant offers the alternative of a tricycle undercarriage.|$|E

2500|$|The ARV is {{constructed}} mainly of aluminium alloy, with fibreglass wingtips, cowlings and canopy frame. The cockpit is a stiff monocoque of [...] "Supral" [...] alloy for lightness and improved crash protection. Aft {{of the cockpit}} bulkhead, the ARV is conventionally built, with frames, longerons and a stressed skin forming a semi-monocoque. [...] Skin sections are both glued and riveted. The aircraft has twin control sticks. [...] Ailerons, elevators and flaps are pushrod-controlled, but the <b>rudder</b> and <b>trim</b> are cable-linked. [...] The rudder pedals also control a steerable nosewheel, but the hand-operated disc brakes are not differential and do not contribute to steering.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of flight tests to determine the lateral and directional stability and control characteristics of the Grumman F 8 F- 1 airplane with three vertical-tail configurations. The data presented herein have no bearing on the performance characteristics of the airplane, which were not measured but which were considered to be exceptionally good. The conclusions reached regarding the lateral and directional stability and control characteristics may be summarized as follows: 1. It was found that the directional stability was poor with the production vertical tail. Addition of a 12 -inch extension to the vertical fin and rudder produced a desirable improvement in directional stability and control characteristics. However, further enlargement of the vertical tail would be required to make the directional stability satisfactory in all respects. 2. There was a tendency for the rudder control force to overbalance at large angles of right sideslip with the modified vertical tails. There was no such tendency with the production tail configuration which included a dorsal fin. It was concluded that the dorsal fin should have been retained on the modified vertical tails. 3. The aileron control characteristics were better than those of many comparable airplanes which have been tested. However, the ailerons did not satisfy the Navy requirements for satisfactory flying qualities with regard to either control forces or rolling effectiveness. 4. The power of the <b>rudder</b> <b>trimming</b> tab proved to be inadequate and the tab should be enlarged and/or be provided with an increased deflection range...|$|R

50|$|The Antilope {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{turboprop}} powered light aircraft. Apart from its engine, it was a conventional all-metal low-wing machine. The cantilever wing was built around two spars and was a semi-monocoque structure, carrying unslotted ailerons and electrically powered, single slot Fowler flaps. The fuselage was also of semi-monocoque construction. The tail unit included a variable incidence tailplane and a <b>rudder</b> with a <b>trim</b> tab.|$|R
5000|$|One such {{incident}} was an in-flight malfunction in a Canberra B(1) Mk. 12, which disabled the aircraft's control column.

50|$|Many {{airplanes}} {{also have}} rudder and/or aileron trim systems. On some of these, the <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> tab is rigid but adjustable {{on the ground}} by bending: it is angled slightly to the left (when viewed from behind) to lessen {{the need for the}} pilot to push the rudder pedal constantly to overcome the left-turning tendencies of many prop-driven aircraft. Some aircraft have hinged <b>rudder</b> <b>trim</b> tabs that the pilot can adjust in flight.|$|E
2500|$|The Kittiwake II differs chiefly {{in having}} two {{side-by-side}} seating {{and a more}} powerful 130hp (97kW) Continental O-240. It is longer, heavier and has an increased span which increases the wing area by about 8%. [...] The fuselage is wider and the small dorsal fillet of the Kittiwake I gone; the <b>rudder</b> gained a <b>trim</b> tab and the elevators full width tabs. It first flew on 19 March 1972.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{and tail}} unit are constructed of chrome-molybdenum steel and are fabric covered. The tailplane, mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage, is wire braced to the small triangular fin. Both the fin and the tailplane are adjustable when on ground. The deep, wide chord rudder reaches {{to the bottom of the}} fuselage between the divided elevators. The <b>rudder</b> carries a <b>trim</b> tab and the elevators a Flettner flap.|$|R
2500|$|The M.15 was {{powered by}} a 200hp (149kW) Gipsy Six 6-cylinder engine, much more {{powerful}} than the Magister's 130hp (97kW) Gipsy Major. Partly as a result, the M.15 was about 4ft 10 in (1.4 m) longer than the Magister. The vertical stabiliser had straight leading and trailing edges, giving it a triangular look compared with the rather pointed Magister surface. Both elevators and the horn-balanced <b>rudder</b> carried <b>trim</b> tabs. [...] The wingspan of the M.15 was slightly less than that of the Magister, but the planform was more curved along the trailing edge and the total wing area greater. Both types carried mild dihedral outboard of the centre section. A small fairing behind the rear cockpit was another new feature of the M.15.|$|R

50|$|The {{hull of the}} Aleks-251 has {{a single}} step and is divided into six {{watertight}} compartments. The cabin, 3.10 m (10 ft 2 in) long, 1.40 m (4 ft 7 in) wide and 1.30 m (4 ft 3 in) high seats the pilot and six passengers in three rows, the central one with three seat, the front pair {{just ahead of the}} wing leading edge but behind the propeller disks. Other seating configurations, e.g. for medical evacuation with a stretcher and two attendants, are possible. Access is by hinged transparencies. A straight edged, swept back fin carries both the horn-balanced rudder and, at about ⅓ height, the parallel chord, strongly dihedralled tailplane. The port elevator and, in production aircraft the <b>rudder,</b> have <b>trim</b> tabs.|$|R
