50|$|Rolling mills {{are often}} divided into roughing, {{intermediate}} and finishing rolling cages. During shape rolling, an initial billet (round or square) with edge of diameter typically ranging between 100-140 mm is continuously deformed {{to produce a}} certain finished product with smaller cross section dimension and geometry. Different sequences can be adopted to produce a certain final product starting from a given billet. However,since each rolling mill is significantly expensive (up to 2 million euros), a typical requirement is to contract the number or rolling passes. Different approaches have been achieved including empirical knowledge, employment of numerical models, and Artificial Intelligence techniques. Lambiase et al. validated a finite element model (FE) for predicting the final shape of a rolled bar in round-flat pass. {{one of the major}} concern when designing rolling mills is {{to reduce the number of}} passes; a possible solution to such requirement is represented by the slit pass also called split pass which divided an incoming bar in two or more subpart thus virtually increasing the cross section reduction ratio per pass as reported by Lambiase.Another solution for reducing the number of passes in the rolling mills is the employment of automated systems for <b>Roll</b> <b>Pass</b> Design as that proposed by Lambiase and Langella. subsequently, Lambiase further developed an Automated System based on Artificial Intelligence and particularly an integrated system including an inferential engine based on Genetic Algorithms a knowledge database based on an Artificial Neural Network trained by a parametric Finite element model and to optimize and automatically design rolling mills.|$|E

40|$|Hot steel rolling {{techniques}} {{continue to}} develop because rolling is amongst {{the most widely used}} industrial methods and steel is a most recycled material.

40|$|An AZ 31 B sheets were {{processed}} by on-line heating rolling (ON-LHR) in five <b>passes.</b> <b>Roll</b> and sheets temperatures were 473 K and 533 K, respectively. The grain size was reduced {{in the first}} three <b>roll</b> <b>passes,</b> to a minimum of 4. 1 μm, due to dynamic recrystallization, and coarsened in the last two passes due to a combination of dynamic recrystallization and grain growth. The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation to fracture reached 232 MPa, 347 MPa and 21 % in the rolling direction. The maximum yield strength occurred after the fourth pass. The maximum is attributed to the small grain size and the formation of networks of sub-grains and deformed grains.

40|$|During {{hot rolling}} a texture {{gradient}} is developed through {{the thickness of}} the slab. This {{is directly related to the}} different strain paths experienced by the material between the surface and the centre plane. The difference in strain path not only affects the texture, but can also give differences in stored energy though the thickness, which in turn affects the recrystallisation kinetics and ultimately the recrystallisation texture. The strain path is further complicated when a number of roll passes are involved, since the material is subjected to more complex strain paths. In the current investigation the effects of <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> schedule (rolling direction, i. e. reverse rolling or continuous rolling) on the texture development during deformation and subsequent annealing have been characterised for an Al- 1 %Mn alloy. The study has shown that the texture of the surface region of the slabs is dependent on the <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> schedule.

The presented case analysis shows how regression analysis and the probability density function (PDF) are used to define principal dimensions—height and width—for the leading oval groove.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{sintering}} {{conditions on the}} phase transformation and critical current density of multifilament Bi- 2223 PIT tapes with AgMg sheaths has been investigated. A two stage sintering process was used comprising a first (HT 1) and second (HT 2) heat treatment with an intermediate <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> between each stage. The sintering atmosphere during each stage {{was a mixture of}} nitrogen and oxygen with a N/O percentage ratio of either 80 / 20 % (in N 80 / 020 %) or 92. 5 / 7. 5 % (in N 92. 5 / 07. 5 %). It was found that the conversion of 2212 precursor phase to 2223 was significantly influenced by the sintering atmosphere of HT 1. Sintering in N 80 / 020 % tended to produce larger 2223 grains and a higher degree of texturing compared to sintering in N 97. 5 / 07. 5 %. The lower partial pressure of 0 promoted faster and more complete conversion of 2212 and smaller 2223 grain size, however, retained much more 2201 phase. It was observed that conditions of HT 2 had less of an impact on the conversion of 2212 phase but influenced the proportion and size of secondary phases, specially influenced that of the lead-rich secondary phase. A possible explanation for the differences in phase transformation and the effect on the critical current was discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B. V.
