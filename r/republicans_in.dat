5|$|In 1970, the Young Republican National Federation was {{permanently}} {{spun off}} from the College <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> 1970 to prevent counter-productive infighting among the two groups.

5|$|In his {{decade in}} Congress, McEwen {{compiled}} a conservative voting record, usually scoring {{in the single}} digits in the annual Americans for Democratic Action ratings and 85% or higher in the American Conservative Union's similar polls, though McEwen was never {{one of the most}} conservative <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the House nor the most conservative Republican in the Ohio delegation.|$|E
5|$|In the campaign, Hunter {{emphasized}} {{his conservative}} credentials, {{focusing on the}} issues of border security, the War on Terrorism, and trade. Throughout 2007, he was in the second tier of Republican candidates, consistently receiving three percent or less support among <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> national polls. However, the campaign reached a high point after Hunter won the Texas Straw Poll.|$|E

5|$|Missoula's state {{legislative}} delegation {{is the second}} largest in the Montana Legislature and is represented by districts 91–100 in the Montana House of Representatives and districts 46–50 in the Montana Senate.

5|$|A {{number of}} monuments and {{memorials}} were constructed across the country, and abroad, to honour his memory and achievements. Dublin's monument to Nelson, Nelson's Pillar, completed in 1809, {{was destroyed by}} Irish <b>republicans</b> <b>in</b> 1966. In Montreal, a statue was started in 1808 and completed in 1809. Others followed around the world, with London's Trafalgar Square being created in his memory in 1835 and the centrepiece, Nelson's Column, finished in 1843. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque was unveiled in 1876 to commemorate Nelson at 147 New Bond Street.|$|E
5|$|As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House {{of welfare}} reform and {{a capital gains tax}} cut in 1997. The poor showing by <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the 1998 Congressional elections, a {{reprimand}} from the House for Gingrich's ethics violation, and pressure from Republican colleagues, resulted in Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 6, 1998. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E

5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Chances {{the bill}} would be passed ended in November 2004 when House <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the Pennsylvania General Assembly decided not to bring the bill to a vote. Later that year, Governor Rendell {{released}} US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget to Liberty Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state.|$|E
5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} {{part of his}} career, Tzara {{combined}} his humanist and anti-fascist perspective with a communist vision, joining the <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II, and serving a term in the National Assembly. Having spoken in favor of liberalization in the People's Republic of Hungary just before the Revolution of 1956, he distanced himself from the French Communist Party, {{of which he was}} by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the Algerian War.|$|E
5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, {{with the}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the majority, McKinley sought {{election}} as Speaker of the House. He failed {{to gain the}} post, which went to Thomas B. Reed of Maine; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a {{landslide}} victory for his party, securing another term {{as president and}} taking 36 seats from <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford {{to see if he}} would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as Minority Leader.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Long {{began his}} {{involvement}} in politics {{at the local level}} in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E
