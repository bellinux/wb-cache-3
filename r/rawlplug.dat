50|$|The {{original}} {{wall plug}} {{was invented by}} John Joseph Rawlings in 1911, and marketed under the name <b>Rawlplug.</b> These plugs became popular after the First World War, when a demand for retro-fitting existing buildings with new electric lighting coincided with a shortage of labour, encouraging many new labour-saving innovations in the building trade. <b>Rawlplug</b> gained their prominence from their adoption in the British Museum.|$|E

50|$|During the interwar period, the <b>Rawlplug</b> company {{tried and}} {{patented}} {{a number of}} new fixing solutions and tools. Several types of wall plugs were among them including the Rawlbolt, the first solution for heavier loads and the world’s first mechanical anchor.

After the war, the company came up with the first metal drywall anchor in 1947 and in the 1960’s they began to offer plastic wall plugs, which became the industry standard at that point.|$|E
5000|$|The company history {{begins with}} the Rawlings Brothers, a small {{plumbing}} and electrical engineering company founded in 1887 in London. The company was awarded a contract for the British Museum in 1910, which required them to fix electrical fittings to the museum walls in as unobtrusive manner as possible. The contract led directly to the invention and patenting of the world’s first wall plug, which {{went on to become}} a standard solution for attaching things to walls.John Joseph Rawlings, who is credited with invention of the wall plug, sold his product under the name <b>rawlplug,</b> using the first part of his last name to make it unique.

50|$|One of {{the first}} of these {{mixtures}} was produced by <b>Rawlplug</b> and was composed of dry white asbestos fibres, sold loose in a tin. The user wetted some into a ball (usually by spitting on them) and pushed this plug of putty into the hole. A small tamper and spike was supplied with the kit. This putty worked very well, but the hazard of the asbestos fibres means that the product is no longer available. However, another way to fix wall plugs is accomplished by the application of a cotton woven pad which has been impregnated with a special formulated gypsum to bond into the wall. The pad is wetted and wrapped around the wall plug, and the two are inserted into the hole; after a short time it hardens and a strong bond is achieved and the wall fitting can be applied. It is used in combination with wall plugs in masonry, ceramic, wood and plasterboard walls.|$|E
