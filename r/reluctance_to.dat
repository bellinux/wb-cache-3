This includes his <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> resolve a dispute between Leonidas Polk, a personal friend, and Braxton Bragg, who was defeated in important battles and distrusted by his subordinates. He was similarly reluctant to relieve the capable but overcautious Joseph E. Johnston until, after numerous frustrations which he detailed in a March 1, 1865 letter to Col. James Phelan of Mississippi, he replaced him with John Bell Hood.|$|E

40|$|Presently, a {{necessary}} modification to mainstream anal-ysis tools prevents the direct application of reluctance k. In this paper, we propose a reluctance realization algo-rithm (RRA) by directly converting <b>reluctances</b> <b>to</b> circuit el-ements compatible with general simulation engines, such as SPICE. Reluctance realization is applicable to arbitrary circuit topology and no accuracy penalty {{is involved in}} the realization process. Since the stability of the converted cir-cuit largely depends on the stability of the reluctance ma-trix, we present an efficient Improved Recursive Bisection Cutting Algorithm (IRBCA) <b>to</b> obtain stability-guaranteed <b>reluctance</b> matrices, and integrate IRBCA and RRA into a SPICE compatible reluctance extraction tool, SCORE. ...|$|R

5|$|In September 1847 Busch began {{studying}} {{mechanical engineering at}} Hanover Polytechnic. Busch's biographers are not in agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most believe {{that his father had}} little appreciation of his son's artistic inclination. Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> believe every word of the Bible and catechism.|$|E

We explore this significance through <b>reluctances</b> <b>to</b> dispose of USB portable hard drives, partly for environmental reasons, but also because of concerns over the data stored on them. In direct tension to these concerns is an ephemeral sense of ownership, where USB portable hard drives are always disposable from the moment of acquisition. We also explore views on, and negotiations of, these paradoxical issues in regards to the disposability of USB portable hard drives...|$|R

John Marshall, a Representative from Virginia (who later became Chief Justice of the United States) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol. However, a lack of funds, disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country's first president, and the Washington family's <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> move his body prevented progress on any project.|$|E
5|$|The Persian strategy, on {{the other}} hand, was {{probably}} principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of Thermopylae and Plataea.) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> attack the Athenians head-on.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, the {{regulation}} of executive action was met with judicial <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> intervene. Certain types of governmental discretion, exercised using prerogative powers, were regarded as {{beyond the scope of}} judicial scrutiny because they involved issues of substantive policy. However, developments focused on the substance of the issues at hand, rather than merely accepting that the prerogative power is non-justiciable per se. Simply put, the focus shifted from the source of the power to the subject matter.|$|E

5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
