5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

The images were from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center. The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.|$|E

40|$|Acceleration-based {{displacement}} measurement approach {{is often used}} to measure the polish rod displacement in the oilfield pumping well. <b>Random</b> <b>noises</b> and trend terms of the accelerometer signals are the main factors that affect the measuring accuracy. In this paper, an efficient online learning algorithm is proposed to improve the measurement precision of polish rod displacement in the oilfield pumping well. To remove the <b>random</b> <b>noises</b> and eliminate the trend term of accelerometer signals, the ARIMA model and its parameters are firstly derived by using the obtained data of time series of acceleration sensor signals. Secondly, the period of the accelerometer signals is estimated through the Rife-Jane frequency estimation approach based on Fast Fourier Transform. With the obtained model and parameters, the <b>random</b> <b>noises</b> are removed by employing the Kalman filtering algorithm. The quadratic integration of the period is calculated to obtain the polish rod displacement. Moreover, the windowed recursive least squares algorithm is implemented to eliminate the trend terms. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online learning algorithm is able to remove the <b>random</b> <b>noises</b> and trend terms effectively and greatly improves the measurement accuracy of the displacement...|$|R

25|$|The {{algorithm}} {{works in}} a two-step process. In the prediction step, the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables, along with their uncertainties. Once {{the outcome of the}} next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some amount of error, including <b>random</b> <b>noise)</b> is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight being given to estimates with higher certainty. The algorithm is recursive. It can run in real time, using only the present input measurements and the previously calculated state and its uncertainty matrix; no additional past information is required.|$|E
25|$|Although A-weighting {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a quasi-peak detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> as opposed to pure tones. Psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow-band circuits are common.|$|E
25|$|CW {{spectroscopy}} is inefficient {{in comparison}} with Fourier analysis techniques (see below) since it probes the NMR response at individual frequencies in succession. Since the NMR signal is intrinsically weak, the observed spectrum suffers from a poor signal-to-noise ratio. This can be mitigated by signal averaging i.e. adding the spectra from repeated measurements. While the NMR signal is constant between scans and so adds linearly, the <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> adds more slowly – proportional to the square root {{of the number of}} spectra (see random walk). Hence the overall signal-to-noise ratio increases as the square-root of the number of spectra measured.|$|E

40|$|The {{differences}} in the satellite orbit and signal quality of global navigation satellite positioning system, resulting in the complexity of <b>random</b> walk <b>noise</b> in GNSS time series, has become a bottleneck problem in applying GNSS technology to the high precision deformation monitoring industry. For the complex characteristics of <b>random</b> walk <b>noise,</b> small magnitude, low frequency and low sensitivity, an improved semisoft threshold algorithm is presented. Then it forms a unified system of semisoft threshold function, so as to improve the adaptability of conventional semisoft threshold for <b>random</b> walk <b>noise.</b> In order to verify and evaluate the effect of improved semisoft threshold algorithm, MATLAB platform is used to generate a linear trend, periodic and <b>random</b> walk <b>noise</b> of the GNSS time series, a total of 1700 epochs.
