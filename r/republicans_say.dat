40|$|Democrats in the US {{say that}} taxes {{can be used}} to “grease the wheels ” of the econ-omy and create wealth enough to recover taxes and thereby {{increase}} employment; the <b>Republicans</b> <b>say</b> that taxation discourages investment and so increases unemployment. These arguments cannot both be correct, but both arguments seem meritorious. Faced with this paradox, one might hope that a rigorous mathematical approach might help determine which is the truth. We attempt to do this, and we reach a firm conclusion with a reasonable model which, as it turns out, favors the democratic or socialistic side by showing that if money is lent to a profitable company, there is always a way to provide enough additional profit to pay the cost of the loan and still provide the profits obtainable {{in the absence of the}} loan, at least on average. More precisely, we show that for every profitable company the additional funds {{can be used to}} increase the mean discounted profits and these additional profits can be used to pay for the expected discounted cost of the loans to the company. This would appear to settle the issue, at least for a mathematician, that truth lies on the socialist side. However, there is a subtlety: if the company is free to take its profits in its own way so as to maximize its time discounted total dividends, then the statement becomes false in the sense that there are some profitable companies where, if the company can set its own rule for taking dividends, the additional profit may not be enough to pay the expected discounted loan cost and provide the old profits too. Thus interference in the companies internal decision making is required to obtain the advantage promised by the democratic claim. This weakens the conclusion of the democrats if the greater society is not in favor of taking the freedom away from companies to use their own plan for profit taking. Perhaps the only conclusion is that mathematics is unable to give insight unless the rules for interference in the internal affairs of the companies is made clearer. On the other hand, this in itself is insightful. Moreover, society might feel that it is correct for a company’s profit taking to be subjected to government interference if it takes a government loan. 1 a...|$|E
