Koniecpolski's influence also protected the outlaw Samuel Łaszcz, whom {{he saw as}} another able commander.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{developed}} large {{intelligence services}} during the war. Prior {{the outbreak of}} war the Australian military possessed almost no intelligence gathering facilities and was <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> information passed on by the British intelligence services. Several small signals intelligence units were established in 1939 and 1940, which had some success intercepting and deciphering Japanese transmissions before {{the outbreak of the}} Pacific War.|$|E

5|$|Because of America's {{entry into}} World War I in April 1917 {{and the ongoing}} war effort, several SIAA schools did not field {{football}} teams in 1918. Coming off the South's first national championship in 1917, Tech lost several players {{to the war effort}} and was heavily <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> freshmen.|$|E
5|$|From March 1781, the Congress of the Confederation and the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were {{situated}} at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia. Under {{the authority of the}} Articles of Confederation, Congress did not have direct control over the military, except in times of war, and was largely <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> the use of state militias to enforce laws and keep order.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{large number}} of ski resorts in the area. The town is served by the Echigo-Yuzawa and Gala-Yuzawa {{stations}} on the Jōetsu Shinkansen line, {{making it one of the}} most easily accessible winter sports areas from Tokyo, and the town's economy is <b>reliant</b> principally <b>on</b> skiing and snowboarding.|$|R
5|$|Media in the Eastern Bloc was {{an organ}} of the state, {{completely}} <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> and subservient to the communist party, with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party. Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.|$|E
5|$|On the {{way back}} from Gascony, Henry met with Louis {{for the first time in}} an {{arrangement}} brokered by their wives, and the two kings became close friends. The Gascon campaign cost more than £200,000 and used up all the money intended for Henry's crusade, leaving him heavily in debt and <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> loans from his brother Richard and the Lusignans.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{invasion}} of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8thcentury introduced a style of building developed in North Africa <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> tapial, pebbles in cement, where timber was in short supply. Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11thcentury onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, {{while at the same}} time timber was still the dominant building material in north-west Europe.|$|E

50|$|The local economy, once <b>reliant</b> {{exclusively}} <b>on</b> agriculture, is {{now almost}} completely centered on tourism (both {{during the summer}} and the winter, as opposed to some of the surrounding towns), mainly due to the town's position within the Dolomites.As a result of tourism, Andalo is among the wealthiest towns in the province and in the country.|$|R
5|$|The West Kootenay, however, is {{transitioning}} from a coal-mining to a tourism-based economy, and {{the rest}} of the Kootenay region is also starting to do so. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is becoming increasingly <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> tourism, and several Canadian national and state parks have already been established, and several national forests in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{environmental}} factors affecting {{the distribution of}} living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil type and light intensity, and {{the presence or absence}} of all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it. Generally speaking, animal communities are <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> specific types of plant communities.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues {{charged by the}} Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E
50|$|Tainter {{concludes that}} {{considerable}} hardship {{will be required}} to adjust to an economy that is (a) smaller (b) <b>reliant</b> more <b>on</b> individuals to carry out their own primary production, say in gardens and farms (c) not investing in problem solving {{to a greater extent than}} is warranted by the actual savings in energy that result out the other end.|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums {{of his own money}} in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Emissions {{of bonds}} are backed by {{guarantees}} {{given by the}} euro area member states in proportion to their share in the paid-up capital of the European Central Bank. The €440 billion lending capacity of the facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the eurozone countries' governments and may be combined with loans up to €60 billion from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (<b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> funds raised by the European Commission using the EU budget as collateral) and up to €250 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to obtain a financial safety net up to €750 billion.|$|E
5|$|England {{came out}} for their second innings, and with Bradman {{predominantly}} <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> his seamers, Johnson bowled only seven overs on the third afternoon as the hosts closed at 3/174 from 69 overs. Late in the day, Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80. Washbrook reached stumps unbeaten on 85, and Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.|$|E

50|$|However, PDO {{was also}} <b>reliant</b> entirely <b>on</b> Objective-C to function. This was a price most {{were unwilling to}} pay, as at the time C++ was more widely used and the effort to shift codebases to an entirely new {{language}} and paradigm was considered too onerous. PDO never saw much use, and NeXT's emphasis shifted to its new WebObjects framework in 1995.|$|R
50|$|BNP is {{cleared by}} binding to natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Less than 5% of BNP is cleared renally. NT-proBNP is the {{inactive}} molecule resulting from cleavage of the prohormone Pro-BNP and is <b>reliant</b> solely <b>on</b> the kidney for excretion. The achilles {{heel of the}} NT-proBNP molecule is the overlap in kidney disease in the heart failure patient population.|$|R
5|$|Homer {{returns to}} {{apologize}} but is turned {{away by a}} fearful Burns. With no one around, Burns learns to do things himself and soon becomes completely self-reliant. After thanking Homer for making him learn that he can fend for himself, Burns fires Smithers when he returns from his vacation. Smithers and Homer engage in a fight within Burns' office which ends when Burns accidentally falls out the window. Burns is seriously injured and becomes <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> Smithers once again. In gratitude, Smithers sends Homer a fruit basket.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, {{amendments}} to the Indian Act made school attendance compulsory for Indigenous children between 7 and 16 years of age. The changes included a series of exemptions regarding school location, {{the health of the}} children and their prior completion of school examinations. It was changed to children between 6 and 15 years of age in 1908. The introduction of mandatory attendance was the result of pressure from missionary representatives. <b>Reliant</b> <b>on</b> student enrollment quotas to secure funding, they were struggling to attract new students due to increasingly poor school conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the NEP was {{replaced}} by the National Development Policy (NDP), which continued most of the NEP-era policies. The Malay share of the economy, though substantially larger, was not near the 30% target according to government figures. In its review of the NEP, the government found that although income inequality had been reduced, some important targets related to overall Malay corporate ownership had not been met. Both Mahathir and the Tunku had expressed concern that the Malays remained too <b>reliant</b> <b>on</b> the Chinese economically.|$|E

50|$|As was {{the norm}} with European crowns, Napoleon's crown {{is made up}} of eight half-arches set with shell cameos and carved carnelians which meet at a golden globe, on top of which is placed a cross.
