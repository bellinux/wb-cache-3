Contamination sources include leaking underground storage tanks, superfund sites, landfills, water and air pollution, power lines, pipeline ruptures, nuclear power plants, animal feedlots and several other urban nuisance uses. The study summarizes a literature review of 75 peer-reviewed journal articles and selected case studies, and generates a data set of about 290 observations that contain information about each study’s loss (the dependent variable), with the independent variables being distance from the source, type of contamination, urban or rural environment, geographic region, market conditions and several other variables.

30|$|The {{imposition}} {{of the real estate}} tax on 1 January 2013 was envisaged by Article 265 of the New Tax Code of Ukraine, but in mid- 2013 it was postponed until 1 January 2014. According to the recent amendments to the Tax Code effective since 1 April 2014, the tax base is the total area of a <b>residential</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>property.</b> For individuals, the tax base may be reduced by 120 square meters for apartments and by 250 square meters for a house. The tax is heavily criticized by experts because of low tax rates 8 and because its base is linked to an apartment size (in square meters) rather than to a market value of the property, which is at odds with standard practice in the world. Furthermore, as usual in Ukrainian legislation, there are many tax exemptions 9. Hence, it is not a full-fledged property tax that would deliver substantial revenues to local governments and contribute to the efficient reallocation of people between dwellings, municipalities and regions, as in developed countries. This calls for further improvement of the real estate tax in Ukraine, following good practices in the world.|$|E
40|$|Municipalities {{sometimes}} reform {{property tax}} schedules {{in an effort}} to increase suboptimal residential densities. One such approach is to reduce the tax rate applied to building values and increase the tax rate applied to land, known as a two-rate property tax (TPT). This paper evaluates the impact of a TPT on residential density in Nashville-Davidson County,Tennessee where a conventional property tax schedule prevails during 2006 – 2007. When land taxes are proportionally higher than taxes on structures, 1. 07 to 1 and 1. 25 to 1 for general and urban service districts, respectively, ex ante simulations suggest that housing density increases by 18 % in general services districts and 83 % in urban services districts. Key words: residential density, spatial lag probit, two-rate property tax. JEL codes: Q 24, R 14. Most municipalities in the United States collect <b>residential</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>property</b> taxes based on a percentage of total assessed property value. These policies place equal value on land and structures, but the taxation of build-ings or structures inflates the perceived cost of improvements, thereby discouraging site improvement and potentially reducing eco-nomic returns (Mathis and Zech 1982). Thus, the landowner can reduce their tax burden by developing projects that use relatively more land than structures. This behavior leads to lower than optimal residential densities (Skaburskis and Tomalty 1997). In response to suboptimal residential densities, researchers have investigated reducing tax rates applied to structures and increasing tax rates on land using a “two-rate property tax ” (TPT) as an alternative to plac-ing equal weight on land and structure taxes. ...|$|E

First, the company moved its headquarters to Irwindale, California {{to take advantage of}} more space for less money. Secondly, more than 700 employees were eliminated at staff and administrative levels and, as a result, the company lowered its ratio of general expenses to 1.5% of its average assets, nearly one-half point below the industry ratio for the larger savings and loan institutions. Deihl also insisted on adhering to strict criteria for home loans. The average borrower at Home Savings carried a personal debt of 33% of his total income, almost 3% below the standard set by the Government National Mortgage Association.

40|$|The {{question}} about objective valuation is linked {{on the one}} hand to the identification {{of a large number of}} reliable sale data, on the other hand to the ability to control the critical evaluation protocol. Automating the valuation process, ensured by computerization of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> data properly detected, provides a concrete answer to the problem of objectivity, allowing a significant control of the subjective component which characterizes the more traditional appraisals. Automatic methods traditionally proposed at international level are often set on multiple regression models, designed to build prediction functions that are valid throughout the study area, calibrating the coefficients on the basis of the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> data contained on the supporting database. In accordance with the International Valuation Standards, this paper proposes a different approach to automated appraising that, far from the idea of defining appraisal equations generally valid on the basis of regression models, proposes the implementation of an automatic procedure based on the Market Comparison Approach, with the aim to define equations related to the peculiarities of a marketplace in a very circumscribed area.

This is unsurprising given that in the short run the supply of residential property is relatively fixed so any increase in demand, whether domestic or foreign, should result in higher prices. Indeed, there have been many other significant domestic drivers of property prices over the period examined. The majority of foreign investment approvals are for new as opposed to established dwellings.

Illegal property flipping usually often involves collusion between a <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> appraiser, a mortgage originator and a closing agent.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether or}} not {{non-traditional}} marketing {{has an effect on}} the prices paid for <b>residential</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> Non-traditionally broker-marketed <b>properties</b> are defined as those properties that are sold {{with the aid of a}} <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> broker, but not marketed through a Multiple Listing Service (MLS). An analysis of properties that sold in this fashion offers further insight into the intermediation role of the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> broker, as well as an opportunity to further investigate the efficiency of <b>residential</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> markets. Specifically, we can assess whether MLS participation generates higher prices by determining whether like-kind properties price equivalently despite differences in their mode of marketing. The results show a significant and positive impact by non-traditionally broker-marketed properties on property price suggesting, for this sample, a premium of over 6 % compared to like-kind properties marketed through the MLS. This premium may be a result of brokers intermediating a better matching of buyers and sellers. The observed premium also suggests a degree of market inefficiency.
