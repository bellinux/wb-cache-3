5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} system active between 3.5 and 2mya that includes Ojos del Salado and Nevado Tres Cruces. It was the last volcanic centre formed in the region; subsequently, the shallowing of the subducting slab prevented volcanism east and south of it. Another volcanic trend considers Incapillo as part of a northeastsouthwest trend with Cerro Galan and Cerro Blanco. This trend may be related to delamination of the lower crust. Also, these centres are located between two domains of different <b>rigidity,</b> an Ordovician sedimentary domain of low <b>rigidity</b> and a higher <b>rigidity</b> basement.|$|E

50|$|In macroeconomics, <b>rigidities</b> {{are real}} prices and wages {{that fail to}} adjust to the level {{indicated}} by equilibrium or if something holds one price or wage fixed to a relative value of another. Real <b>rigidities</b> can be distinguished from nominal <b>rigidities,</b> <b>rigidities</b> that do not adjust because prices can be sticky and fail to change value even as the underlying factors that determine prices fluctuate. Real <b>rigidities,</b> along with nominal, are a key part of new Keynesian economics. Economic models with real <b>rigidities</b> lead to nominal shocks (like changes in monetary policy) having a large impact on the economy.|$|R

The comparison between this model and Blanchard and Gali (2006) highlights the non trivial differences which exist in the way nominal wage and real wage <b>rigidities</b> drive the economy’s dynamics.

We analyze the question in a standard dynamic general equilibrium "new open macro-economy" model, which is solved analytically.

5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real <b>rigidities</b> could interact with nominal <b>rigidities</b> to create significant disequilibrium. Real <b>rigidities</b> occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real <b>rigidities</b> if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real <b>rigidities</b> in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real <b>rigidities</b> combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|R

The consensus is that real wage <b>rigidities</b> can be a useful mechanism to induce the inflation persistence that is absent in the standard Calvo model. Real wage <b>rigidities</b> thus generate a slump in output after a credible disinflationary policy. This consensus is flawed, since it depends on analyzing the model in a linearized framework. Once nonlinearities are taken into account, the results change dramatically, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Under very general assumptions, we show that the presence of non-price competition among firms dampens the overall degree of real <b>rigidities</b> in the economy, thereby increasing the sensitivity of inflation to movements in real marginal costs. Because of this property, our analysis provides additional insights to the existing theories on real <b>rigidities,</b> showing that the strong linkage between real <b>rigidities</b> and the sensitivity of inflation to real marginal costs that has been found in previous works is not robust across alternative assumptions about inter-firms competition. ...|$|R

Therefore, nominal <b>rigidities</b> in both goods prices and wage rates are needed to address the empirical composition of gross equity positions under incomplete markets. ...|$|R
