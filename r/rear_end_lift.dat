5000|$|The {{cars were}} {{equipped}} with chrome exterior rearview mirrors and protective black vinyl bodyside moldings, and the interiors were black with vinyl bench seats. On {{top of the}} factory paint the distinctive white [...] "vector" [...] stripe with bordering black pinstripe was applied. The Torinos had their <b>rear</b> <b>ends</b> <b>lifted</b> by air shocks and were equipped with [...] "U.S." [...] brand 5-slot aluminum wheels with larger rear tires plus a chrome tip on the exhaust pipe.|$|R
50|$|Other {{appliances}} like pocket watches, waffle irons, sandwich toasters, krumkake irons, and the George Foreman Grill {{have long}} utilised a clamshell design; {{a very similar}} concept is used in racing and road legal cars, like the Ford GT40 and Ferrari Enzo, where the whole <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> can be <b>lifted</b> to access the engine compartment and suspension system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cars were}} also custom painted (on {{top of the}} factory red paint colour) with the {{distinctive}} white [...] "vector" [...] stripe designed by Spelling-Goldberg's transportation coordinator George Grenier. The <b>rear</b> <b>ends</b> were <b>lifted</b> by air shocks, and had [...] "U.S." [...] brand 5-slot mag wheels added with larger rear tires. While the tires were mounted so that only the black wall side would show, thus hiding any unauthorized brand-name display, in one first-season episode ("Kill Huggy Bear"), a close-up shot of the villain cutting the rear brake lines shows the letters on the inside-facing side of the tires to say Firestone.|$|R
25|$|The ADE won {{the project}} for {{developing}} an LGB in 2006. The project aimed to develop an advanced laser guidance kit for 450kg (1000 pound) class dumb bombs to improve their accuracy. The Sudarshan kit incorporates laser guidance developed by ADE for 450kg (1000 pound) bombs to improve the accuracy of a conventional bomb. The guidance consists of a computer control group (CCG), canards attached {{to the front of}} the warhead for steering and a wing assembly attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> to provide <b>lift.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{variant of}} the Plaxton Paramount III 3500 built to National Express {{specification}} on Volvo B10M chassis was named Expressliner. It was fitted with a windowless, moulded plastic <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> featuring an embossed National Express double-N logo. The <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> could {{be replaced by a}} standard Paramount <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> when the coach was no longer used for National Express services.|$|R
5000|$|From fairly {{early in}} their history, Boss Hoss has sold trikes with <b>rear</b> <b>ends</b> {{designed}} to look like smaller facsimiles of Chevrolet Corvettes, 57 Chevys, 32 Low-boy hot rods, or other distinctive cars. At some point, the Corvette <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> was discontinued and replaced with a narrowed 7 1/2" [...] Ford truck <b>rear</b> <b>end.</b> As of 2005, the trikes have a new three-speed transmission that {{takes advantage of the}} extra stability and rear axle of a trike configuration.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{operating}} noise performance of a seat adjuster mechanism, benchmarking measurements were conducted in different cars for six and eight types of seat adjustment operation. The six types of operation include: seat moving up, seat moving down, seat front end up, seat front <b>end</b> down, seat <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> up and seat <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> down. The eight types of operation include: seat moving forward, seat moving backward, seat moving up, seat moving down, seat front end up, seat front <b>end</b> down, seat <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> up and seat <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and root causes of the noise problem have been analysed and discussed in this paper. The noise characteristics have been identified, and the psychoacoustic parameters {{have been used to}} quantify sound quality of the seat adjuster. The objective assessment results have been found to match well with subjective evaluation results...|$|R
