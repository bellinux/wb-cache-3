The treatments were repeated six times utilizing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 couples with a couple/volume ratio of 1 / 450, 1 / 225, 1 / 150, 1 / 112, 1 / 90, 1 / 75 and 1 / 64 cm 3, respectively. It was observed that the average pre-oviposition period for one couple was 5. 8 ± 0. 3 days while for the other treatments it was 7 – 8 days. For the oviposition period {{no significant differences were}} found, 100 days being ob-tained on the average, but for the daily and total oviposition the results showed differences among the treatments with one couple per <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> showing the greatest fecundity (520 ± 26. 0 eggs/female). By increasing the couple numbers, the total oviposition capacity de-creased, becoming more marked from four couples per <b>rearing</b> <b>unit,</b> with only 270. 0 ± 103. 0 eggs/female when seven couples were utilized (density 1 / 64 cm 3). Longevity was equally af-fected by density and for a single couple, it was 138. 3 ± 11. 2 days for the males and 117. 8 ± 12. 8 days for the females.

50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit ring gear from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that ring gear. From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same ring gear in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that ring gear were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse <b>unit.</b> The <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear.

40|$|Dairy farmers often keep {{almost all}} their newborn heifer calves despite {{the high cost}} of rearing. By rearing all heifer calves, farmers have more {{security}} and retain flexibility to cope with the uncertainty in the availability of replacement heifers in time. This uncertainty is due to mortality or infertility during the rearing period and the variation in culling rate of lactating cows. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide insight in the economically optimal number of heifer calves to be reared as replacements. A herd-level stochastic simulation model was developed specific for this purpose with a herd of 100 dairy cows; the biological part of the model consisted of a dairy herd unit and <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> for replacement heifers. The dairy herd unit included variation in the number of culled dairy cows. The <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> incorporated variation in the number of heifers present in the herd by including uncertainty in mortality and variation in fertility. The dairy herd unit and <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> were linked by the number of replacement heifers and culled dairy cows. When not enough replacement heifers were available to replace culled dairy cows, the herd size was temporarily reduced, resulting in an additional cost for the empty slots. When the herd size reached 100 dairy cows, the available replacement heifers that were not needed were sold. It was assumed that no purchase of cows and calves occurred. The optimal percentage of 2 -wk-old heifer calves to be retained was defined as the percentage of heifer calves that minimized the average net costs of rearing replacement heifers. In the default scenario, the optimal retention was 73 % and the total net cost of rearing was estimated at € 40, 939 per herd per year. This total net cost was 6. 5 % lower than when all heifer calves were kept. An earlier first-calving age resulted in an optimal retention of 75 %, and the net costs of rearing were € 581 per herd per year lower than in the default scenario. For herds with a lower or higher culling rate of dairy cows (10 or 40 % instead of 25 % in the default scenario), it was optimal to retain 35 or 100 % of the heifer calves per year. Herds that had a lower or higher cost of empty slots (€ 50 or € 120 per month instead of € 82 in the default scenario) had an optimal retention of 49 or 83 % per year; the optimal retention percentage was dependent on farm and herd characteristics. For Dutch dairy farming conditions, it was not optimal to keep all heifer calves...|$|E
40|$|Little {{information}} is available on steroid concentrations in the rearing water of aquaculture systems and whether they accumulate in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Therefore this study aimed at determining (1) the concentrations and variation of cortisol and sex steroids in RAS, (2) the contribution of fish rearing conditions to steroid concentrations in seven commercial RAS. Each RAS was sampled twice at three different points: (1) make-up water; (2) influent and (3) effluent of the <b>rearing</b> <b>unit.</b> The results showed significant higher steroid concentrations in the influent and effluent {{when compared with the}} make-up water. On average cortisol concentration was 15. 7 % higher in the effluent when compared with the influent. Mean steroid concentrations in the <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> effluent varied between: 3. 8 – 217. 0 ng/L for cortisol, 3 – 12. 5 ng/L for testosterone, 0. 9 – 7. 1 ng/L for 11 -ketoteststerone and 1. 8 – 12. 8 ng/L for 17, 20 ß-dihydroxypregn- 4 -en- 3 -one. Stocking density, Total Ammonia-Nitrogen concentration and orthophosphate-P concentration (a measure of make-up water usage) showed a positive correlation with sex steroids in the water. The steroid concentrations from the present study were orders of magnitude lower than initial estimations indicating a water treatment efficiency of > 99 %. The results suggest that an intensification of fish production through decrease of make-up water use and increase of stocking density will lead to a build-up of steroids in the water. Although intensification is critical for the economical success of RAS, this ultimately could affect fish performance as steroids accumulates in the water of RAS at levels that can potentially be detected by some fish species...|$|E
50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit ring gear was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit ring gear were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a fish <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> modification that establishes mixed flow reactor (MFR) {{behavior in a}} rectangular vessel so as to eliminate metabolite concentration gradients, increase current velocities and improve solids scour at low water exchange rates. A standard raceway section 14. 5 m long was modified to create six counter-rotating mixed cells, each 2. 4 m wide by 2. 4 m long. Cells receive water from vertical pipe sections extending to the tank floor and positioned {{in the corners of}} the cells. Vertical pipe sections were fabricated with jet ports that direct water into the cells tangentially to establish rotary circulation. Water exits each cell through a centrally located floor drain. Hydraulic characteristics of the tank are described based on an analysis of residence time distribution, current velocities and cell-to-cell water exchange rates. The latter was calculated based on a proposed hydraulics model and tracer concentrations established at a steady state. Vessel dispersion numbers measured with water exchange rates of 1. 0 and 1. 3 per hour, indicate tank performance approximates that of a MFR with the active tank volume representing 77. 9 – 100 % of total tank volume. Water velocities measured at 216 stations averaged 0. 14, 0. 12 and 0. 12 m/s for the tank surface, mid-depth and near bottom regions. The benthic shear stress calculated given surface velocity was 0. 04 N/m 2. This was sufficient to scour and purge fecal solids produced by 2010 kg of lake trout that averaged 44. 3 cm in total length. Cell interaction was significant with cell-to-cell exchange rates averaging 3. 9 times the tank inflow rate.

The use of the mass rearing trays and rack did not adversely affect larval development, pupation and survival rates and allowed the management of large larval rearing colonies with reduced space requirements in comparison with classical individual trays. The effects of larval density, water temperature and diet composition on pupal production and size differentiation for sex separation efficacy were analyzed for individual mass rearing trays as well as multiple trays stacked within the dedicated rack unit. Best results were obtained using eighteen thousand larvae per tray at a density of 3 larvae per ml of deionized water at a temperature of 28 °C on a diet consisting of 50 % tuna meal, 36 % bovine liver powder, 14 % brewer's yeast and, as an additive, 0. 2 gr of Vitamin Mix per 100 ml of diet solution. Pupae were harvested on the sixth day from larval introduction at L 1 stage and males were separated out by the use of a 1400 µm sieve with 99. 0 % accuracy with a recovery rate of ca. 25 % of the total available males. With the use of this larval <b>rearing</b> <b>unit,</b> an average production of 100, 000 male pupae per week can be achieved in just 2 square meter of laboratory space.

40|$|To {{address the}} {{preference}} of mud crab farmers for larger size Scylla serrata juveniles (5. 0 â€“ 10 g body weight or BW; 3. 0 â€“ 5. 0 cm internal carapace width or ICW), a {{study was conducted}} to compare the growth and survival of crab juveniles (2. 0 â€“ 5. 0 g BW; 1. 0 â€“ 3. 0 cm ICW) produced a month after stocking of megalopae in net cages when reared further in net cages installed in earthen ponds or when stocked directly in earthen ponds. In a 3 Ã— 2 factorial experiment, three stocking densities (1, 3 and 5 ind m âˆ’ 2), two types of rearing units (net cages or earthen pond) were used. Megalopae were grown to juvenile stage for 30 days in net cages set inside a 4000 m 2 brackishwater pond and fed brown mussel (Modiolus metcalfei). Crab juveniles were then transferred to either net cages (mesh size of 1. 0 mm) or earthen ponds at three stocking densities. After 1 month, no interaction between stocking density and <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> was detected so data were pooled for each stocking density and <b>rearing</b> <b>unit.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} the growth or survival rate of crab juveniles across stocking density treatments. Regardless of stocking density, survival in net cages was higher (77. 11 Â± 6. 62 %) than in ponds (40. 41 Â± 3. 59 %). Growth, however, was significantly higher for crab juveniles reared in earthen ponds.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{apparatus}} for germ-free rearing of animals, the author studied on the methods of germ-free rearing historically and experimentally {{under the direction of}} Professor K. Tanikawa and Associate Professor J. Tanami. In our laboratory, a new compact type of <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> HMC- 1 was constructed after Reyniers 2 ̆ 7 system and Gustafsson 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus in 1954. Continuously the <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> HMC- 2 was constructed with the useful advice given by Professor M. Miyakawa. A thermo-sterilizing plant and glass-wool filter are used for air sterilization. In order to eliminate humidity in the air a fin-coil type refrigerating desicator is used. The ventilation power of pump on the average is 60 1 per minute, and this quantity of air is sufficient for 2 rearing tanks and 1 operating tank. The rearing tank is constructed of steel 6 mm in thickness, the diameter of the tank is 60 cm and the length is 120 cm. Entire surface of the tank is covered with asbestos in 3 cm thickness. This tank has 4 glove ports and 2 viewing ports, gloves are made of artificial rubber and are fixed on the glove ports of the tank with a special ring. The operating tank is almost equal to the rearing tank in its size and shape. This tank has a chamber for the operating trap provided under it. This trap is used for moving an animal into the tank. The sterilizing food clave is a small steel tank, 25 cm in diameter and 65 cm in length. This is used for removing food, water and the other heat steriliable articles into the rearing tank. The germicidal trap is an apparatus through which all objects placed into the rearing tank, which must not be sterilized with heat, must pass. The double Seitz-filter is an apparatus through which certain kinds of solution can be filtered and sterilized. The entire system can be sterilized at the same time, but in accordance with the demands of the experiment procedures, one part of the system, either the rearing tank or the operating tank, must be separately sterilized. Because of this reason a sterilizing pipe system is constructed for that purpose. The air temperature of the rearing tank is controlled by the air temperature regulator and the hot water tank provided under part of the tank, so there must be two electric regulating system for the rearing tank. All sorts of furnishings in the rearing tanks must be provided so as not to injure the,rubber gloves during manipulation. The HMC- 2 system is arranged to form a compact unit, so the system as a whole can be set in a chamber 3. 6 m× 7. 2 m and can be used coveniently. It will be important to devise a compact system or simplified unit for germ-free rearing of animals so as to make rearing easy to perform in every laboratory wanting to do some experiments with germ-free animal. In the near future, a central system for germ-free animal production will be established in our country.

Production of antibacterial compounds may be quorum regulated, and we identified the acylated homoserine lactone (3 -hydroxy-decanoyl homoserine lactone) from cultures of Roseobacter 27 - 4 using LC-HR-MS. The signal molecule was primarily detected in stagnant cultures. Roseobacter 27 - 4 grew between 10 and 30 °C but died rapidly at 37 °C. Also, th...|$|E
