5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the <b>rumen,</b> the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a <b>rumen).</b> After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the <b>rumen</b> and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the <b>rumen</b> and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E
5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy <b>rumen.</b>|$|E

5|$|The bohor reedbuck is host {{to several}} parasites. The most notable helminths {{found in the}} bohor reedbuck are Carmyerius papillatus (in the <b>rumen),</b> Stilesia globipunctata (in the small intestine), Trichuris globulosa (in the caecum), Setaria species (in the {{abdominal}} cavity), Dictyocaulus species (in the lungs) and Taenia cysts (in the muscles). Other parasites include Schistosoma bovis, Cooperia rotundispiculum, Haemonchus contortus, species of Oesophagostomum, Amphistoma and Stilesia. The common ticks found on the bohor reedbuck are Amblyomma species and Rhipicephalus evertsi.|$|E
5|$|The data {{generated}} by metagenomics experiments are both enormous and inherently noisy, containing fragmented data representing {{as many as}} 10,000 species. The sequencing of the cow <b>rumen</b> metagenome generated 279 gigabases, or 279 billion base pairs of nucleotide sequence data, while the human gut microbiome gene catalog identified 3.3 million genes assembled from 567.7 gigabases of sequence data. Collecting, curating, and extracting useful biological information from datasets of this size represent significant computational challenges for researchers.|$|E
5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the <b>rumen,</b> with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E

5|$|A {{new round}} of snap {{elections}} in October 2014 resulted in a third GERB victory with around {{a third of the}} vote. A record of eight parties won seats, {{the first time since the}} beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by President Rosen Plevneliev to form a government, Borisov's GERB formed a coalition and members of the parties in the Reformist Bloc (Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG), Alternative for Bulgarian Revival and Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS)) were chosen for Minister positions. However, Boyko Borisov made a vow in 2016 – should GERB President nominee Tsetska Tsacheva does not win the Bulgarian presidential election, 2016, he would resign as a Prime Minister. GERB lost at this election from the independent candidate <b>Rumen</b> Radev who was, nevertheless, supported by the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Subsequently, Boyko Borisov resigned for the second time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the <b>rumen</b> and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
25|$|Cattle are {{classified}} as ruminants because of the amazing construction of their digestive tract. Their symbiotic relationship with the microbes that occupy the fermentation chamber in their stomach, the <b>rumen,</b> allows them to survive on incredibly low quality feed. The <b>rumen</b> is a micro-ecosystem within each dairy cow. For optimal digestion, {{the environment of the}} <b>rumen</b> must be ideal for the microbes. In this way, the job of a ruminant nutritionist is to feed the microbes not the cow.|$|E

40|$|High level, {{long term}} release of {{oxytetracycline}} HCl into artificial <b>rumens</b> {{was accomplished by}} a controlled release device. Three controlled release devices delivered 16. 33, 8. 15, and 9. 31 mg/day for 52, 63, and 63 days, respectively. Theory for the controlled release devices predicted release rates of 13. 30, 13. 48, and 13. 63 mg/day for 59. 19, 58. 34, and 58. 63 days, respectively. The release rates were nearly zero-order. The discrepancies between the experimentally determined release kinetics and those predicted by theory were largely attributed to environmental factors;The artificial <b>rumens</b> {{were found to be}} viable representations of in vivo <b>rumens</b> up to 92 days based upon pH measurements and volatile fatty acid production. No significant shifts in volatile fatty acid production were noted for the artificial <b>rumens</b> influenced by oxytetracycline HCl release from the delivery devices;Utilization of this controlled release system to administer oxytetracycline HCl and possibly other beneficial agents to ruminants appears to be feasible...|$|R

25|$|Cattle are ruminants, meaning their {{digestive}} system is highly specialized {{to allow the}} use of poorly digestible plants as food. Cattle have one stomach with four compartments, the <b>rumen,</b> reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, with the <b>rumen</b> being the largest compartment.|$|E
