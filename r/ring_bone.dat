40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the bone strength in different genetic types of pigs. Nowadays, in swine production it is rather common to obtain pigs with weak bones, especially on the hind legs. This weakness causes fractures, which are correlated with losses in carcass weight, hence economical aspects are involved as well, and regard to significant animal welfare issues, too. Because of this, it was interesting to investigate what are the causes of weakness in pig bones of the most important genetic types used in the North European pig breeding, such as Duroc, Hampshire, Finnish Landrace and Norwegian Landrace. Bone and joint defects have been linked to high growth rate (different content in collagen), mainly of pigs. The responses of the mechanical properties are also strongly related to feeding. Genetic factors are another probable cause of weakness and the fracture of bones, both linked to osteochondrosis, which is rather common in pigs. In this study the bone strength and other geometrical and mechanical parameters, such as the bone mineral content (BMC), the bone mineral density (BMD), the thickness of the <b>ring</b> <b>bone,</b> the cross sectional area and the compression force of the <b>ring</b> <b>bone</b> as well were evaluated. These mechanical parameters were evaluated in bone‟ rings, which were obtained from the middle shaft of each femur bone of pigs...|$|E
40|$|To {{illustrate}} the clinical and radiographic findings of some distal limbs affections in Ninety two animals (24 horses and 68 donkeys) which were admitted to Animal Care Hospital in Luxor. Each animal {{was subjected to}} thorough clinical and radiographic examination; the grade of lameness was recorded and the best radiographic views were taken.   Fifteen types of distal limb affections were evident. The most prevalent affections in donkeys were high and low <b>ring</b> <b>bone</b> (29. 35 %) and hoof abscess (9. 78 %) followed by traumatic arthritis of the fetlock (6. 52 %), suspensory ligament desmitis (5. 43 %), fracture of first phalanx (5. 43 %), fracture of PII (4. 35 %), side bone (3. 26 %)  whereas, fracture of metacarpal bone (1. 09 %), sesamoditis (1. 09 %) and flexural deformities (1. 09 %)  represented the lowest prevalent affections. On the other hand, side bone (4. 35 %), fracture of the metacarpal bone (4. 35 %) represented the most prevalent affections in horses followed by high and low <b>ring</b> <b>bone</b> (3. 26 %), fractures of PI (2. 17 %), PII (2. 17 %), subluxation of coronopedal joint (2. 17 %) and punctured wounds in of the hoof (2. 17 %), traumatic arthritis of the fetlock joint (2. 17 %). Whereas, navicular disease (1. 09 %), suspensory ligament desmitis (1. 09 %) and hoof abscess (1. 09 %) were the lowest prevalent affections in horses. Treatment was not recommended in certain cases. In conclusion, although the wide stride progress have made in diagnostic imaging in recent decades, the x ray still offers a satisfactory tool for diagnostic imaging in equine limb practice that is useful for equine practitioners...|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of 364 show jumper horses was examined {{for signs of}} lameness in three province of Iran, i. e., Tehran, Isfahan and Fars. The basis of the survey was {{the inability of the}} horse to take part in jumping exercise.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the osseointegration of implants placed in a single-staged compared to two-staged procedure using <b>bone</b> <b>ring</b> technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study were used standardized, vertical alveolar bone defects in dogs. In the test group, dental implants (Straumann BL®, Basel, Switzerland) were inserted simultaneously with <b>bone</b> <b>ring</b> technique. As control group served implants inserted 6 months following grafting. Implants of both groups were left for an osseointegration period of 3 and 6 months. The peri-implant bone loss and bone-to-implant contact within the <b>bone</b> <b>ring</b> and native <b>bone</b> were analyzed morphometrically. An explorative statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: The peri-implant bone level remained relatively stable within groups and between groups per given time period. Most of bone apposite on the implant surface in two groups was composed of newly formed bone. A nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant advantage for two-staged implant placement for new and total bone, except for residual bone (P =. 0084). Furthermore, two groups of implants performed similarly in <b>bone</b> <b>ring</b> and in native bone throughout the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of osseointegration, both techniques are likely equally efficient in the present defect model. The single-staged implant placement with cortical bone grafts warrants further documentation in clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|A {{surgical}} drainage simple {{surgical procedure}} that enables elimination of pathological effluent from operative wounds or other anatomical spaces, {{as well as}} removal of possible pathological exudates (blood, pus, enteric content, pancreatic juice, etc.). Nowadays, silicone drains are used for draining of the peritoneal cavity. In this study we presented a case of 42 -year old female patient who underwent surgery after traumatic injury of intraabdominal organs and fracture of pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>bone</b> structure. Postoperative drain placed into the rectovesical space could not be removed on day 17 post surgery. Additional diagnostics could not identify the actual reason of failing to remove the drain, thus relaparotomy was required. Intraoperative diagnosis revealed incarceration of the antimesenteric part of the appendix into two circumjacent side perforations in the drain, without signs of acute inflammation. This paper presents an unusual and rare case of peritoneal drainage complication. The drainage of peritoneal cavity should be performed only in appropriate clinical situations, i. e. when the procedure is surgically indicated...|$|E
40|$|Lymphomas {{are solid}} {{malignant}} tumors having {{a wide spectrum}} of clinical and pathological features. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is a subtype of lymphoma with two-thirds of the cases presenting as lymph node enlargement. The remaining one third of NHL cases has been reported in the extranodal sites, including the gastro intestinal tract, Waldeyer’s <b>ring,</b> <b>bone,</b> skin, and brain. Intraoral non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is uncommon and may affect either the jaw bones or occur within the soft tissues of the oral cavity. Here we report a case of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in a 65 -year-old male patient who presented with a growth from the extraction socket. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma presenting as a growth from the extraction socket is unusual. An orthopantamograph (OPG) was taken which revealed a diffuse radiolucent defect in relation to the extraction socket of the left lower molar region. Routine hemogram, urine analysis, and chest radiograph were normal. Incisional biopsy was performed and the tissue was subjected to histopathological examination. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma.

40|$|Mice {{homozygous}} for {{a targeted}} deletion of the homeobox gene Goosecoid (Gsc) have multiple craniofacial defects. To understand the mechanisms {{responsible for these}} defects, the behavior of Gsc-null cells was examined in morula aggregation chimeras. In these chimeras, Gsc-null cells were marked with beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity using the ROSA 26 lacZ allele. In addition, mice with a lacZ gene that had been introduced into the Gsc locus were used {{as a guide to}} visualize the location of Gsc-expressing cells. In Gsc-null 3 ̆c- 3 ̆ewild-type chimeras, tissues that would normally not express Gsc were composed of both Gsc-null and wild-type cells that were well mixed, reflecting the overall genotypic composition of the chimeras. However, craniofacial tissues that would normally express Gsc were essentially devoid of Gsc-null cells. Furthermore, the nasal capsules and mandibles of the chimeras had defects similar to Gsc-null mice that varied in severity depending upon the proportion of Gsc-null cells. These results combined with the analysis of Gsc-null mice suggest that Gsc functions cell autonomously in mesenchyme-derived tissues of the head. A developmental analysis of the tympanic <b>ring</b> <b>bone,</b> a bone that is always absent in Gsc-null mice because of defects at the cell condensation stage, showed that Gsc-null cells had the capacity to form the tympanic ring condensation in the presence of wild-type cells. However, analysis of the tympanic ring bones of 18. 5 d. p. c. chimeras suggests that Gsc-null cells were not maintained. The participation of Gsc-null cells in the tympanic ring condensation of chimeras may be an epigenetic phenomenon that results in a local environment in which more precursor cells are present. Thus, the skeletal defects observed in Gsc-null mice may reflect a regional reduction of precursor cells during embryonic development...|$|E

5000|$|Facing {{the outer}} ear, the lateral wall (or {{membranous}} wall), is formed mainly by the tympanic membrane, partly by the <b>ring</b> of <b>bone</b> into which this membrane is inserted. This <b>ring</b> of <b>bone</b> is incomplete at its upper part, forming a notch (notch of Rivinus), close to which are three small apertures: the [...] "iter chordæ posterius", the petrotympanic fissure, and the [...] "iter chordæ anterius". The iter chordæ posterius (apertura tympanica canaliculi chordæ) {{is situated in}} the angle of junction between the mastoid and membranous wall of tympanic cavity immediately behind the tympanic membrane and on a level with {{the upper end of}} the manubrium of the malleus; it leads into a minute canal, which descends in front of the canal for the facial nerve, and ends in that canal near the stylo-mastoid foramen. Through it the chorda tympani nerve enters the tympanic cavity. The petrotympanic fissure opens just above and in front of the <b>ring</b> of <b>bone</b> into which the tympanic membrane is inserted; in this situation it is a mere slit about 2 mm. in length.

Após aplicação de montagem constituída de um semi-anel proximal, um anel médio e outro distal, ligados entre si por meio de hastes rosqueadas, foi excisado um segmento da diáfise média distal da tíbia e fíbula direitas de 30 % do comprimento ósseo. A reconstrução do defeito foi realizada por transporte de um segmento ósseo obtido por osteotomia {{subperiosteal}} da parte proximal da tíbia, entre o semi-anel proximal e o anel médio. O período de latência foi de seis dias e o ritmo do transporte foi de 0, 5 mm a cada 12 horas. Na área de acoplamento foi aplicada compressão. O fixador permaneceu em fase neutra por 14 semanas e, após a remoção do aparelho, os animais foram observados por mais quatro semanas. O resultado funcional foi considerado excelente em um animal, bom em um, satisfatório em três e deficiente nos outros dois. O transporte ósseo permitiu a reparação de falhas ósseas segmentares extensas, porém pode apresentar dificuldades no direcionamento do segmento ósseo transportado e de sua consolidação na área de acoplagem. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the bone transport technique using the Ilizarov external fixator for the treatment of the extensive segmental bone defect induced in the tibia of seven dogs. An Ilizarov frame assembled with one proximal half-ring, one middle ring and one distal ring, all connected to each other, was used. Thirty percent of the tibia and fibula were removed in the medium and distal parts of the diaphyses, between the medium and distal rings. The bone defect was reconstructed by bone transport using a bone segment developed by proximal subperiosteal osteotomy of the tibia between the half-ring and the middle <b>ring.</b> <b>Bone</b> transport started seven days after surgery (0. 5 mm every 12 hours). Compression was applied in the docking area. The neutral fixation frame period was 14 weeks. The frame was removed at the end of this period, and the dogs were observed for four more weeks. Complications such as intercalary segment deviation (2 dogs) during the trajectory, and nonunion (2 dogs) in the docking area were observed. The functional results were considered poor in the two, fair in three, good in one and excellent in the other dog. The bone transport allowed reconstruction of large segmental bone defect, however, it may have problems during the trajectory of the transport bone segment and in its healing in the docking area...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Simultaneous implant {{placement}} with {{bone grafting}} shortens the overall treatment period, but {{might lead to}} the peri-implant bone loss or even implant failure. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the single-staged to two-staged implant placement using the <b>bone</b> <b>ring</b> technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four standardized alveolar bone defects were made in the mandibles of nine dogs. Dental implants (Straumann BL®, Basel, Switzerland) were inserted simultaneously with <b>bone</b> <b>ring</b> technique in test group and after 6 months of healing period in control group. Animals of both groups were euthanized at 3 and 6 months of osseointegration period. The harvested samples were analyzed by means of histology and micro-CT. RESULTS: The amount of residual bone decreased while the amount of new bone increased up to 9 months of healing period. All morphometric parameters remained stable between 3 and 6 months of osseointegration period within groups. Per a given time point, median area of residual bone graft was higher in test group and area of new bone in control group. The volume of <b>bone</b> <b>ring</b> was greater in test than in control group, reaching the significance at 6 months of osseointegration period (P = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: In the present type of bone defect, single-staged implant placement may be potentially useful to shorten an overall treatment period...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Vacuum Infusion Packaging (VIP) rapidly rehydrates and {{improves}} the mechanical properties of freeze-dried allograft bone. A dye penetration test into porous bone grafts resulted in {{deeper and more}} uniform distribution of fluid compared to conventional soaking methods. Mechanical testing resulted in improved yield displacement and mechanical toughness properties for femoral <b>ring</b> allograft <b>bone</b> grafts in comparison to traditionally soaked grafts. In addition, VIP decreased the stiffness of the freeze-dried graft which may result in fewer fractures during impaction. VIP {{proved to be an}} effective and rapid means to uniformly deliver liquids into porous grafts and reducing the brittleness of freeze-dried bone grafts...|$|R
50|$|It {{was covered}} by a {{protective}} shell composed of more than 1,000 2.5 cm-thick bony plates, called osteoderms or scutes. Each species of glyptodont had its own unique osteoderm pattern and shell type. With this protection, they were armored like turtles. Unlike most turtles, glyptodonts could not withdraw their heads, but instead had a bony cap {{on the top of}} their skull. Even the tail of Glyptodon had a <b>ring</b> of <b>bones</b> for protection. Such a massive shell needed considerable support, evidenced by features such as fused vertebrae, short but massive limbs, and a broad shoulder girdle.|$|R
