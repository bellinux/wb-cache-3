5|$|Abdül Kadir was to {{have been}} the Ottoman Navy's first pre-dreadnought battleship. She {{followed}} a series of ironclad warships built in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1876, Sultan Murad V was deposed; the Ottoman Navy had {{played a role in the}} coup, which installed Abdul Hamid II on the throne. The new sultan was as a result suspicious of the navy, and attempted to <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> power by withholding funding and ordering no new capital ships over the course of the following decade. By the late 1880s, however, the ships built by his predecessors were rapidly becoming obsolescent, especially compared to foreign designs like the British s.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> value.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E

5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|By then, SAS {{had taken}} sixteen {{aircraft}} out of service, reduced production with 12% and fired 1,000 employees. The airline {{stated that they}} wished to renegotiate the agreement with the Braathens family and KLM to reduce the price. Because there had arrisen a situation with high over-capacity of aircraft, the value of planes had fallen. In addition, SAS demanded that Braathens <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> fleet from 33 to 23 aircraft if the deal was to go through, threatening to terminate the purchase if the airline did not abide.|$|E
5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT {{for violating}} the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its {{hazardous}} waste storage and disposal procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E

In July 2013, Kikugawa and Mori were both sentenced to 3 years in prison, 5 years suspended. The auditor who had been party to the fraud was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison, 4 years suspended. Olympus was fined 700 million yen ($7 million USD). In April 2014, six banks filed a civil suit against Olympus over the fraud, seeking an additional 28 billion yen in damages.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, a bounty was levied on J.lagostoma in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> numbers. Hunters were paid 6 pence (alternatively paid in rum) for every hundred claws collected. In 1879, the total bag for the island {{comprised}} 66 cats, 4,013 mice, 7,683 rats and 80,414 land crabs; in the eight years to 1887, bounties were collected on more than 330,000 crabs.

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to <b>reduce</b> <b>its</b> volume and increase its density.|$|E
