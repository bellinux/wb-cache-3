In this paper we present two original distributed algorithms implemented on clusters of PCs used to solve the {{frequency assignment}} problem in the field of radio broadcasting.

40|$|The {{antidiuretic}} hormone arginine-vasopressin regulates water homeostasis {{in the human}} body by binding to its vasopressin type 2 receptor (V 2 R). Mutations in AVPR 2, the gene encoding V 2 <b>R,</b> <b>lead</b> to the X-linked congenital form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a disease characterized by the inability to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin; often this involves missense mutations or deletion of one or a few amino acids. In vitro V 2 R expression studies revealed that the function of most of these receptors is not disturbed, but due to their misfolding, the quality control mechanism of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retains these receptors inside the cell, thereby preventing their functioning at the plasma membrane. This review summarizes our current knowledge on ER retention of V 2 R mutants, and describes the different approaches that have been undertaken to restore the plasma membrane expression and function of V 2 R mutants in NDI in vitro and in vivo. The use of cell permeable receptor ligands (called 'pharmacological chaperones') appears promising for the treatment of NDI in a subset of patients...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} {{a new model}} to evaluate the yield stress of suspensions, slurries or pastes, based on {{the release of a}} finite volume of material onto a horizontal surface. Considering the height (h) and the radius (R) of the sample at the flow stoppage, two asymptotic regimes, where h higher than R or h lower than <b>R,</b> <b>lead</b> to different analytical models that allow the determination of yield stress. Experimental observations show typical sample shape at stoppage between slump and spread. Based on these observations, we have developed a new analytical model to evaluate accurately the yield stress of materials in this intermediate regime. The validity of this model was evaluated from data obtained using various Carbopol® dispersions. The yield stress measured with the proposed model was compared with the yield stress evaluated from shear flow curves obtained with roughened plate/plate geometry fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley model. Results show the relevance of the proposed model which that can be applied in the range between models used for the two asymptotic regimes...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for discovering sets of web queries having similar latent needs, called search tasks, from user queries stored in a search engine log. The framework is made of two main modules: Query Similarity Learning (QSL) and Graph-based Query Clustering (GQC). The former is devoted to learning a query similarity function from a ground truth of manually-labeled search tasks. The latter represents each user search log as a graph whose nodes are queries, and uses the learned similarity function to weight edges between query pairs. Finally, search tasks are detected by clustering those queries in the graph which are connected by the strongest links, in fact by detecting the strongest connected components of the graph. To discriminate between "strong" and "weak" links also the GQC module entails a learning phase whose goal is to estimate the best threshold for pruning {{the edges of the}} graph. We discuss how the QSL module can be effectively implemented using Learning to Rank (L 2 R) techniques. Experiments on a real-world search engine log show that query similarity functions learned using L 2 <b>R</b> <b>lead</b> to better performing GQC implementations when compared to similarity functions induced by other state-of the-art machine learning solutions, such as logistic regression and decision trees...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{the crucial}} role of genetic {{susceptibility}} {{in the development of}} early-onset obesity, {{it has been shown that}} feeding behavior could contribute to increased body weight. A significant association between obesity/overweight and ADHD has been reported, suggesting that these two conditions, despite their heterogeneity, might share common molecular pathways. Although the co-occurrence of obesity and ADHD is increasingly supported by empirical evidence, the complex pathogenetic link between these two conditions is still unclear. Here, we focus on the relationship between MC 4 R gene mutations and ADHD in children with early-onset obesity. Mutations in the gene MC 4 <b>R</b> <b>lead</b> to the most common form of monogenic obesity. We hypothesize that dysregulated eating behavior in a subset of patients with MC 4 R mutation might be due to comorbid ADHD symptoms, underpinned by abnormal reward mechanisms. Therefore, we speculate that it is possible to prevent obesity in a subset of patients with MC 4 R mutation, even if these patients are genetically programmed to “be fat”, via an appropriate treatment of ADHD symptoms. We hope that our paper will stimulate further studies testing if the early screening for ADHD symptoms and their appropriate treatment may be an effective way to prevent obesity in a subset of children with MC 4 R mutation...|$|E
40|$|The new mineral reynoldsite, Pb_ 2 Mn^(4 +) _ 2 O_ 5 (CrO_ 4), {{occurs at}} the Blue Bell claims, near Baker, San Bernardino County, California, U. S. A., and at the <b>Red</b> <b>Lead</b> mine, Dundas, Tasmania, Australia. At the Blue Bell claims, reynoldsite occurs in subparallel growths and {{divergent}} sprays of thin prisms with a square cross section. At the <b>Red</b> <b>Lead</b> mine, it occurs as thin rectangular blades. At both occurrences, crystals are small (≤ 0. 2 mm), and ubiquitously and multiply twinned. At both deposits, reynoldsite formed as a secondary mineral derived from the weathering of primary minerals including oxides and sulfides {{in the presence of}} acidic groundwater. Reynoldsite is dark orange-brown to black in color and has a dark orange-brown streak. Its luster is subadamantine and its Mohs hardness is about 4 ½. The mineral is brittle with irregular to splintery fracture and a poorly developed { 001 } cleavage. The calculated density is 6. 574 g/cm^ 3 (<b>Red</b> <b>Lead</b> mine). The very high indices of refraction and dark color permitted only partial determination of the transmitted light optical properties. Electron microprobe analyses of Blue Bell and <b>Red</b> <b>Lead</b> reynoldsite provided the empirical formulas (based on nine O atoms) : Pb_(1. 97) Mn_(2. 01) O_ 5 (Cr_(1. 01) O_ 4) and (Pb_(2. 07) Sr_(0. 04)) _(∑ 2. 11) Mn_(2. 15) O_ 5 (Cr_(0. 87) O_ 4), respectively.

Reynoldsite is triclinic with space group P 1 and unit-cell parameters: α = 5. 0278 (7), b = 7. 5865 (11), c = 10. 2808 (15) Å, α = 91. 968 (12), β = 99. 405 (12), γ = 109. 159 (10) °, V = 363. 81 (9) Å_ 3, and Z = 2 (for a <b>Red</b> <b>Lead</b> mine crystal).

These layers are composed of edge-sharing double chains of octahedra extending along [100], which in turn are linked to one another by sharing edges in the [010] direction. The thick interlayer region contains Pb^(2 +) cations and CrO_ 4 tetrahedra. The 6 s^ 2 lone-electron pair of the Pb^(2 +) is stereochemically active, resulting in a one-sided Pb-O coordination arrangement.

40|$|Background: Inherited {{deficiencies}} of IL- 10 or IL- 10 receptor (IL- 10 <b>R)</b> <b>lead</b> to immune dysregulation with life-threatening early-onset enterocolitis. Objectives: We sought to gather clinical data of IL- 10 /IL- 10 R-deficient patients and devise guidelines for diagnosis and management, including {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT). Methods: We enrolled 40 patients with early-onset enterocolitis and screene d for mutations in IL 10 /IL 10 R using genetic studies, functional studies, {{or both of the}} IL- 10 signaling pathway. Medical records of IL- 10 /IL- 10 R-deficient patients were reviewed and compiled. Results: Of 40 patients, we identified 7 with novel mutations, predominantly in consanguineous families with more than 1 affected member. IL- 10 /IL- 10 R-deficient patients had intractable enterocolitis, perianal disease, and fistula formation. HSCT was carried out in 2 patients with IL- 10 deficiency and 1 patient with IL- 10 R α chain deficiency and proved to be an effective therapy, leading to rapid improvement of clinical symptoms and quality of life. Conclusion: Because the defect in patients with IL- 10 /IL- 10 R deficiency resides in hematopoietic lineage cells and their colitis is resistant to standard immunosuppressive therapy, HSCT should be considered early as a potentially curative therapeutic option. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology...|$|E
40|$|Simulations of {{irreversible}} {{growth of}} extended (fractal and square) islands with critical island sizes i= 1 and 2 are performed in broad ranges of coverage θ and diffusion-to-deposition ratios R {{in order to}} investigate scaling of island size and capture zone area distributions (ISD, CZD). Large θ and small <b>R</b> <b>lead</b> to a crossover from the CZD predicted by the theory of Pimpinelli and Einstein (PE), with Gaussian right tail, to CZD with simple exponential decays. The corresponding ISD also cross over from Gaussian or faster decays to simple exponential ones. For fractal islands, these features are explained by changes in the island growth kinetics, from a competition for capture of diffusing adatoms (PE scaling) to aggregation of adatoms with effectively irrelevant diffusion, which is characteristic of random sequential adsorption (RSA) without surface diffusion. This interpretation is confirmed by studying the crossover with similar CZ areas (of order 100 sites) in a model with freezing of diffusing adatoms that corresponds to i= 0. For square islands, deviations from PE predictions appear for coverages near θ= 0. 2 and are mainly related to island coalescence. Our {{results show that the}} range of applicability of the PE theory is narrow, thus observing the predicted Gaussian tail of CZD may be difficult in real systems. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

To date, only five genetically confirmed patients with a complete ß-ureidopropionase deficiency have been reported. Here, {{we report on the}} clinical, biochemical and molecular findings of 11 newly identified ß-ureidopropionase deficient patients as well as the analysis of the mutations in a three-dimensional framework. Patients presented mainly with neurological abnormalities (intellectual disabilities, seizures, abnormal tonus regulation, microcephaly, and malformations on neuro-imaging) and markedly elevated levels of N-carbamyl-ß-alanine and N-carbamyl-ß-aminoisobutyric acid in urine and plasma. Analysis of UPB 1, encoding ß-ureidopropionase, showed 6 novel missense mutations and one novel splice-site mutation. Heterologous expression of the 6 mutant enzymes in Escherichia coli showed that all mutations yielded mutant ß-ureidopropionase proteins with significantly decreased activity. Analysis of a homology model of human ß-ureidopropionase generated using the crystal structure of the enzyme from Drosophila melanogaster indicated that the point mutations p. G 235 R, p.
