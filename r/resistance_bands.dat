40|$|Background: Competitive {{swimming}} is a {{sport that}} require high muscle strength to overcome the forces in the water. A phenomenon called post activation potentiation (PAP) is known to acutely increase power output. PAP {{can be defined as}} an increase in muscle performance after muscle contraction. Previous research on PAP has shown positive effects on different sports, including swimming. However, a limited amount of studies exists on PAP associated with swimming and distances longer than 100 meters. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if PAP for triceps brachii and latissimus dorsi with elastic bands can improve the aerobic performance, V 4 -speed, of elite freestyle swimmers. Methods: 13 elite swimmers participated in this study (mean ±SD: age 18 ± 1. 15). The participants performed three test sessions on two different days. The first occasion evaluated aerobic performance, V 4 -speed, where the participants performed a 400 -m freestyle swim race and lactate and time were collected. At the second occasion, a 10 -repetition maximum (RM) elastic <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> test was done to get the right <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> for each individual participant for the PAP exercise. At the third occasion, a PAP exercise, that mimics freestyle swim, with elastic <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> was performed with 10 repetitions in two sets. After, a rest of six minutes was performed and then the same 400 -m freestyle swim test as the first occasion. A paired samples t-test was used to evaluate significant differences between the swim test performed with and without a PAP exercise. Results: The study showed no statistical difference between the V 4 -speed with or without PAP exercise (p= 0. 93). An increase in lactate was seen after the PAP exercise (p= 0. 02). Conclusion: This study could not ensure an improvement of the aerobic performance, V 4 -speed, of elite swimmers when a PAP exercise, similar to a freestyle stroke, was performed before a 400 -m submaximal freestyle swim race with elastic <b>resistance</b> <b>band.</b> Further research must be done in this area before coaches and athletes can apply this in training programs...|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} motion of a handstand pushup can be {{increased}} by placing the hands on objects elevated from the floor, such as boxes or chairs, parallettes, or for the greatest difficulty, gymnastic rings. This allows the head to be lowered {{below the level of}} the palms, greatly increasing the difficulty of the movement. Difficulty can also be increased by adding further resistance, either in the form of weights attached to the torso; such as a weighted vest, attached to the legs, or <b>resistance</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|E
50|$|Usually dips {{are done}} on a dip bar, with the exerciser's hands {{supporting}} his or her entire body weight. For added resistance, weights can be added by use of a dip belt, weighted vest, or by wearing a backpack with weights in it. A dumbbell may also be held between the knees or ankles. For less resistance, an assisted dip/pull-up machine can be used which reduces the force necessary for the exerciser to elevate his body by use of a counterweight. One may also use <b>resistance</b> <b>bands</b> hooked under his feet to help if he lacks the strength to properly perform a dip.|$|E
50|$|A barbell, {{dumbbells}} or a smith machine may be {{used for}} resistance, and overhand, inside, outside, underhand or mixed grip can be used.

40|$|Biceps brachii muscle {{illness is}} one of the common {{physical}} disabilities that requires rehabilitation exercises in order to build up the strength of the muscle after surgery. It is also important to monitor the condition of the muscle during the rehabilitation exercise through electromyography (EMG) signals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyse and investigate the selection of the best mother wavelet (MWT) function and depth of the decomposition level in the wavelet denoising EMG signals through the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method at each decomposition level. In this experimental work, six healthy subjects comprised of males and females (26 [*]±[*] 3. 0 years and BMI of 22 [*]±[*] 2. 0) were selected as a reference for persons with the illness. The experiment was conducted for three sets of <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> loads, namely, 5 [*]kg, 9 [*]kg, and 16 [*]kg, as a force during the biceps brachii muscle contraction. Each subject was required to perform three levels of the arm angle positions (30 °, 90 °, and 150 °) for each set of <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> load.

50|$|Barre {{is a form}} of {{physical}} exercise, usually conducted in group classes in gyms or specialty studios. It is distinguished from other group fitness activities by its use of the ballet barre and its incorporation of movements derived from ballet. These classical dance movements and positions are combined with those drawn from yoga and pilates, and other equipment is sometimes used in addition to the barre, such as <b>resistance</b> <b>bands,</b> yoga straps, exercise balls and hand weights. Barre classes typically focus on small, pulsing movements with emphasis on form, alignment and core engagement. Participants hold their bodies still while contracting specific, targeted sets of muscles in isometric exercises. Repetitions tend to be high, range-of-motion small, and weights, when used, light (1-1.5kg or 2-3 pounds). Holding muscles in contraction for extended periods frequently leads to them shaking as they fatigue. This is particularly true of thighs, as the quadriceps tire.|$|E

50|$|After {{experiencing}} a rotator cuff tear, {{minimally invasive surgery}} is {{needed in order to}} repair the torn tendon. After surgery, the rehabilitation of the rotator cuff is necessary in order to regain maximum strength and range of motion within the shoulder joint. Physical therapy progresses through four stages, increasing movement throughout each phase. The tempo and intensity of the stages are solely reliant on the extent of the injury and the patient’s activity necessities. The first stage requires immobilization of the shoulder joint. The shoulder that is injured is placed in a sling and shoulder flexion or abduction of the arm is avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery (Brewster, 1993). Avoiding movement of the shoulder joint allows the torn tendon to fully heal. Once the tendon is entirely recovered, passive exercises can be implemented. Passive exercises of the shoulder are movements in which a physical therapist maintains the arm in a particular position, manipulating the rotator cuff without any effort by the patient. These exercises are used to increase stability, strength and range of motion of the Subscapularis, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, and Teres minor muscles within the rotator cuff. Passive exercises include internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, as well as flexion and extension of the shoulder.As progression increases after 4-6 weeks, active exercises are now implemented into the rehabilitation process. Active exercises allow an increase in strength and further range of motion by permitting the movement of the shoulder joint without the support of a physical therapist. Active exercises include the Pendulum exercise (as shown in Image 2), which is used to strengthen the Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, and Subscapularis. External rotation of the shoulder with the arm at a 90-degree angle is an additional exercise done to increase control and range of motion of the Infraspinatus and Teres minor muscles. Various active exercises are done for an additional 3-6 weeks as progress is based on an individual case by case basis. At 8-12 weeks, strength training intensity will increase as free-weights and <b>resistance</b> <b>bands</b> will be implemented within the exercise prescription.|$|E
40|$|Question: Is the exercise-integrated Bandcizer™ system {{feasible}} for recording exercise dosage (time under tension (TUT) and repetitions) and pain scores among adolescents with patellofemoral pain? Do adolescents practise the exercises as prescribed (TUT and repetitions) ? Do adolescents accurately report the exercises {{they do in}} an exercise diary? Design: Observational feasibility study. Participants: Twenty adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age with patellofemoral pain. Intervention: Participants were prescribed three exercise sessions per week (one with and two without supervision) for 6 weeks. The exercises included three hip and one knee exercise with an elastic <b>resistance</b> <b>band.</b> Participants were instructed to perform three sets with a predefined TUT (3  seconds concentric; 2  seconds isometric; 3  seconds eccentric; 2  seconds pause), equating to 80  seconds for 10 repetitions (one set). Outcome measures: The exercise-integrated system consisted of a sensor attached to the elastic <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> that {{was connected to the}} Bandtrainer app on an electronic tablet device. Pain intensity was reported on a visual analogue scale on the app. Participants also completed a self-report exercise diary. Results: No major problems were reported with the system. Participants performed 2541 exercise sets during the 6 weeks; 5 % were performed with the predefined TUT (ie, within 10  seconds of the 80 -second target) and 90 % were performed below the target TUT. On average, the participants received 15 % of the instructed exercise dosage based on TUT. The exercise dosage reported in the exercise diaries was 2. 3 times higher than the TUT data from the electronic system. Pain intensity was successfully collected in 100 % of the exercise sets. Conclusion: The system was {{feasible for}} adolescents with patellofemoral pain.

40|$|Study {{was carried}} out to {{examine the effect of}} {{application}} of <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> in the female boxers on the levels of the anaerobic power and Maximal Bench Press force (MBP). The study {{was carried out}} on 12 female subjects, in ages between 19 and 23 yo, who are actively engaged in the boxing branch. The subjects were divided into two groups, each consisting of 6 people, as Constant Resistance (CR) and Wavy Resistance (WR). The average age of CR group was 21. 33 ± 0. 81 years, the average height 169. 67 ± 2. 06 cm, and the average body weight 65. 28 ± 8. 95 kg. The average age of WR group was 21. 16 ± 0. 75 years, the average height 173. 50 ± 3. 27 cm, and the average body weight 65. 56 ± 3. 19 kg. In the study, the exercise of <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> was made by all subjects four days a week for 6 weeks between the hours 9. 00 - 10. 00, boxing training for competition period between the hours 18 : 00 – 20 : 00 in evenings. In CR group, the bands in the same color and resistance were used by the method of the black <b>band</b> constant, <b>resistance,</b> in WR group, the bands in different color (red, blue, black) and resistance by the wavy method. Before training, the body weights, and the levels of anaerobic power and MBP levels of both groups were determined. The same measurements were repeated six weeks later. In the statistical analyses of the data obtained, in determining the differences between in-group test and the final test, Paired-sample t-test was used. In determining the difference between two groups, pre-test and final test, independent samples t-test was used. The significance between differences was determined at the level of P< 0, 05. As a result; as a matter of fact, {{it can be said that}} the constant resistance method of CR group is more effective than the wavy resistance method of WR group. Hence, conducting the studies of <b>resistance</b> <b>band</b> that will be conducted specific to branch, using the method of constant resistance, can be more effective...|$|R

30|$|The {{exercise}} program {{used for the}} study {{was found to be}} safe and possibly feasible for lung cancer patients that initiated the program. Although several adverse events were reported {{during the course of the}} intervention none were believed to be related to the {{exercise program}}. This finding is in line with past research that has found exercise to be generally safe for cancer survivors, even during treatment and recovery (Schmitz et al. 2010). Moreover, EX condition participants were able to complete a relatively high proportion of planned exercise sessions (79 %), suggesting a three times weekly exercise program with <b>resistance</b> <b>bands</b> may be feasible for this population of lung cancer patients. Given lung cancer patients frequently indicate low aerobic capacity and limited mobility, training with <b>resistance</b> <b>bands</b> may be a more viable mode of exercise compared to aerobic training (e.g., walking or other cardio programs). <b>Resistance</b> <b>bands</b> may also be appropriate for lung cancer populations as all exercises can be completed from a seated position, tension can be adjusted to accommodate a wide range of abilities, and the entire program is portable enough to be used as an economical home based exercise program. Future research examining the utility of <b>resistance</b> <b>bands</b> as a part of exercise programming in lung cancer and other deconditioned patient populations is warranted to fully determine its potential use in supportive care.|$|E
