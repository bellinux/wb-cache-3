25|$|Historically, a {{ceremonial}} Golden Spike driven by Leland Stanford connected the rails of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the United States. The valuable <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> spike represented the merge of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads on May 10, 1869, at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. The rail spike has entered American popular consciousness in this manner; the driving of the Golden Spike {{was a key}} point {{in the development of}} the western seaboard in North America and was recognized as a national achievement and demonstration of progress. Since, railroad workers have been celebrated in popular culture, including in song and verse.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> {{system is}} a means of fixing rails to {{railroad}} ties (North America) or sleepers (British Isles, Australasia, and Africa). [...] The terms rail anchors, tie plates, chairs and track fasteners are used to refer to parts or all of a <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> system. [...] Various types of fastening have been used over the years.|$|E
2500|$|A {{rail spike}} (also {{known as a}} cut spike or crampon) is a large nail with an offset head {{that is used to}} secure rails and base plates to {{railroad}} ties (sleepers) in the track. Robert Livingston Stevens is credited with the invention of the rail spike, the first recorded use of which was in 1832. The railroad spike was an invention which resulted from the state of industrialisation in the United States in the early 19th century: English mainline railways of that period used heavy and expensive cast iron chairs to secure T-shaped rails; instead, Stevens added a supporting base to the T rail which could be fixed with a simple spike. In 1982, the spike was still the most common <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> in North America. Common sizes are from [...] square and [...] long.|$|E

2500|$|This {{gave rise}} to the ballastless railway track, {{especially}} in tunnels, on high-speed railway lines, and on lines where high train frequency imposes greater stress on the track. Paved concrete track has the <b>rail</b> <b>fastened</b> directly to a concrete slab about half a meter thick, without ties.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a methodology of FE modelling and simulation {{of the bridge}} – track – moving train (BTT) system using LS-DYNA computer code. The KNI 140070 viaduct of span length 14. 40 m with ballasted track was selected as a representative for the study. Two variants of the viaduct were taken into consideration – a version operated before the modernization in 2008 and the modernized version including additional flats welded to the bottom flanges of the main beams. The German high-speed train ICE- 3 moving at 150 – 300 km/h was selected. The FE model of the BTT system was developed using Altair HyperMesh and LS-PrePost software. The platform of the viaduct was modelled using 8 -node 48 DOF solid elements. The structure was symmetrised, homogenized and reflected by linear viscoelastic orthotropic materials. Discrete model of the track included the main and side <b>rails,</b> <b>fastening</b> systems, sleepers, crushed stone ballast and approach RC slabs. Components of the train FE model were considered as rigid bodies. Cylindrical and revolute constrained joints were applied for kinematic connections and relations between respective components. Discrete springs and dampers were applied for FE modelling of the primary and the secondary suspension systems. Numerical simulations were focused on determining the resonant velocities for both considered variants. Selected time histories for displacements and stresses, were shown as {{the results of the}} analyses...|$|R
