25|$|An {{important}} {{concept for}} insulating fluids is the static <b>relaxation</b> <b>time.</b> This {{is similar to}} the time constant τ (tau) within an RC circuit. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static dielectric constant divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/m has an estimated <b>relaxation</b> <b>time</b> of about 18 seconds. The excess charge in a fluid dissipates almost completely after four to five times the <b>relaxation</b> <b>time,</b> or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> {{provide a}} {{continuous}} measure {{of changes in}} intervertebral disk biochemistry. The {{purpose of this study}} was to correlate T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> in lumbar disks with patient age and stage of degeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sagittal T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images and axial images were acquired in 20 patients referred for MR imaging for back pain or radiculopathy. Two readers inspected these images and assigned a Pfirrmann grade to each disk. An additional sagittal multiecho FSE image sequence was obtained, and T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> were calculated for a each lumbar disk. T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> were correlated with Pfirrmann grade. T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> in nondegenerated disks were correlated with patient age. Statistical significance was tested by ANOVA, ad hoc tests, and Pearson coefficients. RESULTS: T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> were calculated for 95 lumbar disks in 19 patients and discarded for 5 disks in 1 patient due to motion artifacts. Forty-four disks were classified as Pfirrmann grade II; 34, as grade III; 14, as grade IV; and 3, as grade V. Mean T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> of the central region decreased from 108 ms for grade II to 53 ms for grade IV disks. T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> correlated significantly with Pfirrmann grade. For grade II disks, T 2 <b>relaxation</b> <b>times</b> of the central region decreased significantly from an average of 132 ms for patients in their 20 s to 86 ms for those in their 60 s...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{excitation}} of {{the sample}} with a radio frequency (60–1000MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. A spectrum from a single FID has a low signal-to-noise ratio, but fortunately it improves readily with averaging of repeated acquisitions. Good 1H NMR spectra can be acquired with 16 repeats, which takes only minutes. However, for elements heavier than hydrogen, the <b>relaxation</b> <b>time</b> is rather long, e.g. around 8 seconds for 13C.

25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{is likely to}} be high pulmonary vascular pressures with concurrent negative airway pressures, causing extreme stress across the pulmonary capillary membrane (the fragile membrane separating blood in the pulmonary capillaries from the air-filled alveoli) and consequent hemorrhage into the air spaces of the lung.

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse <b>relaxation</b> <b>time</b> T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.

25|$|Decay {{times of}} the excitation, {{typically}} measured in seconds, depend {{on the effectiveness of}} relaxation, which is faster for lighter nuclei and in solids, and slower for heavier nuclei and in solutions, and they can be very long in gases. If the second excitation pulse is sent prematurely before the relaxation is complete, the average magnetization vector has not decayed to ground state, which affects the strenght of the signal in an unpredictable manner. In practice, the peak areas are then not proportional to the stoichiometry; only the presence, but not the amount of functional groups is possible to discern. An inversion recovery experiment can be done to determine the <b>relaxation</b> <b>time</b> and thus the required delay between pulses. A 180° pulse, an adjustable delay, and a 90° pulse is transmitted. When the 90° pulse exactly cancels out the signal, the delay corresponds to the time needed for 90° of relaxation. Inversion recovery is worthwhile for quantitive 13C, 2D and other time-consuming experiments.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Franck–Condon principle, after the electronic transition, the molecules which {{end up in}} higher vibrational states immediately begin to relax to the lowest vibrational state. In the case of solvation, the solvent molecules will immediately try to rearrange themselves {{in order to minimize}} the interaction energy. The rate of solvent relaxation depends on the viscosity of the solvent. Assuming the solvent <b>relaxation</b> <b>time</b> is short compared with the lifetime of the electronic excited state, emission will be from the lowest solvent energy state of the excited electronic state. For small-molecule solvents such as water or methanol at ambient temperature, solvent <b>relaxation</b> <b>time</b> is on the order of some tens of picoseconds whereas chromophore excited state lifetimes range from a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Immediately after the transition to the ground electronic state, the solvent molecules must also rearrange themselves to accommodate the new electronic configuration of the chromophore. Figure 7 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle applied to solvation. When the solution is illuminated by with light corresponding to the electronic transition energy, some of the chromophores will move to the excited state. Within this group of chromophores there will be a statistical distribution of solvent-chromophore interaction energies, represented in the figure by a Gaussian distribution function. The solvent-chromophore interaction is drawn as a parabolic potential in both electronic states. Since the electronic transition is essentially instantaneous on the time scale of solvent motion (vertical arrow), the collection of excited state chromophores is immediately far from equilibrium. The rearrangement of the solvent molecules according to the new potential energy curve is represented by the curved arrows in Figure 7. Note that while the electronic transitions are quantized, the chromophore-solvent interaction energy is treated as a classical continuum due to the large number of molecules involved. Although emission is depicted as taking place from the minimum of the excited state chromophore-solvent interaction potential, significant emission can take place before equilibrium is reached when the viscosity of the solvent is high or the lifetime of the excited state is short. The energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons depicted in Figure 7 is the solvation contribution to the Stokes shift.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{relaxation of}} a viscoelastic gel {{has been identified}} as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the <b>relaxation</b> <b>time</b> of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the autocorrelation function near the point of gelation.|$|E
