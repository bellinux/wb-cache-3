40|$|Risk is {{inherent}} {{in every aspect of}} the construction industry. This risk is allocated by the contract documents which establish the relationships between the parties in a construction contract. Often, when risk is not appropriately proportioned in a contractual agreement, contractors and subcontractors add significant premiums, or <b>risk</b> <b>allowances,</b> to their bids to reduce the potential negative consequences if the risk event occurs. This paper investigates the risks in construction contract agreements which general contractors and subcontractors indicated most affects their bids as suggested by the frequency with which a contingency for risk is included. It also investigates the contractor's success in gaining a time extension or claim for additional cost for the same conditions. Survey results indicate that both general contractors and subcontractors generally feel that contract provisions are fair; however, they often include an allowance for risk in their bids depending on their level of perceived risk[URL]...|$|E
40|$|In May 2004 the CFO Forum {{harmonized}} {{the various}} efforts of reporting the embedded valueof life insurance companies by issuing the European Embedded Value (EEV) Principles. In this working paper a methodology is proposed to derive a maximum lending amountfrom EEV figures without much additional data requirements from the originating insurer. The approach chosen {{is similar to}} that of other financing areas, e. g. real estate finance, where first a prudent best estimate valuation is done and later risk deductions are performed in the form of applying loan to value ratios, e. g. 60 - 80 % of the prudent amount. Here, this prudent value is called bankable embedded value and the loan to value analysis presented leads to the maximum lending amount. The deductions proposed to arrive at a maximum lending amount are based on parameter adjustments and <b>risk</b> <b>allowances</b> for unexpected risks. There is an analogy with insurers for determining their own capital needs. The methodology proposed is based on the stress test approach which increasingly gains popularity with insurance supervisors in Europe.

40|$|Formal and {{analytical}} risk models prescribe how risk should be incorporated in construction bids. However, the actual process of how contractors {{and their clients}} negotiate and agree on price is complex, and not clearly articulated in the literature. Using participant observation, the entire tender process was shadowed in two leading UK construction firms. This was compared to propositions in analytical models and significant differences were found. 670 hours of work observed in both firms revealed three stages of the bidding process. Bidding activities were categorized and their extent estimated as deskwork (32 %), calculations (19 %), meetings (14 %), documents (13 %), off-days (11 %), conversations (7 %), correspondence (3 %) and travel (1 %). <b>Risk</b> <b>allowances</b> of 1 - 2 % were priced in some bids and three tiers of risk apportionment in bids were identified. However, priced risks may sometimes be excluded from the final bidding price to enhance competitiveness. Thus, although risk apportionment affects a contractor’s pricing strategy, other complex, microeconomic factors also affect price. Instead of pricing in contingencies, risk was priced mostly through contractual rather than price mechanisms, to reflect commercial imperatives. The findings explain why some assumptions underpinning analytical models may not be sustainable in practice and why what actually happens in practice is important for {{those who seek to}} model the pricing of construction bids...|$|E

The general objective {{was to investigate the}} recruitment procedures and job satisfaction in the Police Force. Specific objectives included: Analysis of the recruitment procedures for Police Force applicants, assessment of job satisfaction; and examination of recruitment policy in the Police Force. Case Study research design and qualitative research approach were employed during the study. Research methods such as interview, observations and documentary analysis were used to collect data and were affected through the use of interview questions, observation and documentary review schedules. Content analysis was used during data analysis where by large amount of data was reduced into small portions for easy analysis. Findings indicated that respondents were not satisfied with recruitment in the Police Force. Recruitments were dominated with favors, corruption, nepotism, forgery of certificates and biasness. These negatively affected the performance of the Police Force because most of those recruited were not committed to serve the Police Force. Findings indicated that there was job dissatisfaction which were caused by low remuneration/low salary, mistreatment of Police Officers in terms of administrative practices, poor houses poor interpersonal relations, bad retirement and pension plans, <b>risk</b> <b>allowances</b> with no proper insurance as well as improper staff training. Recommendations for immediate action include; (i) Recruitment to be done direct from secondary schools, universities and other training colleges (ii) Employees in the Police Force should be provided with good housing, fringe benefits, good salaries and interpersonal relationship which are major components of job satisfaction at workplace; (iii) The minimum qualifications for recruitment to be Form IV certificate (without imposing a condition of division three) and Form VI.

40|$|Competitive bidding is {{the main}} {{mechanism}} of allocating projects in the construction market. In the traditional single criterion bidding method, the markup decision has {{a significant impact on}} a contractor's business success. Contractors usually take into consideration several factors in the process of determining their markup. This study has reviewed the literature and identified a range of contractors' behaviors when making their markup decision within a competitive bidding environment. An additive markup function consisting of three components, namely competition, risk, and need for work, was developed in order to replicate markup behaviors of contractors. Then, agent-based modeling has been employed for simulating the bidding process within a market formed of a set of heterogeneous contractors with different risk attitudes and defined markup behaviors. This model was used to study the impact of considering need for work and <b>risk</b> <b>allowance</b> in markup determination on financial performance of contractors in various market scenarios.

40|$|Builds {{on earlier}} work which {{reported}} {{on the experience of}} the Hong Kong Government in using risk analysis techniques in capital cost estimating. In 1993 the Hong Kong Government implemented a methodology for capital cost estimating using risk analysis (ERA) in its public works planning. This calculated amount replaces the pre- 1993 contingency allowance, which was merely a percentage addition on top of the base estimate of a project. Adopts a team approach to identify, classify and cost the uncertainties associated with a project. The sum of the average <b>risk</b> <b>allowance</b> for the identified risk events thus becomes the contingency. A study of the effect of ERA was carried out to compare the variability and consistency of the contingency estimates between non-ERA and ERA projects. The preliminary results of a survey showed a highly significant difference in variation and consistency between these groups. This analysis indicates the successful use of the ERA method for public works projects to reduce unnecessary and  exaggerated <b>allowance</b> for <b>risk.</b> However, the contingency allowance for ERA projects was also considered high.

40|$|Investment {{diversification}} is a {{risk management}} technique that allows to create balanced portfolios that achieve a certain {{rate of return on}} one's investment, within a certain <b>risk</b> <b>allowance.</b> Despite the advantages it offers to investors, diversification has been strongly debated {{in the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis of 2007 - 2009, because it is believed to have potential adverse effects on systemic risk. In this thesis, we specifically investigate the adverse effects that limited information availability of investors, and the diversification choices they make due to that information, may have on the systemic risk of the financial system as a whole. Information availability here is seen as the level of awareness for each agent of the available options he can employ in order to diversify his portfolio in the given market, examined in terms of two so-called "information barriers": a) assets accessibility, representing private and public information offered to each investor about the available assets in the market, b) agents diversifiability, representing the agent's experience in processing this information in order to make better diversification decisions. Building on an existing stylized financial system model, we enrich it by partitioning the assets and the investors according to their accessibility and diversifiability respectively. Our contribution is threefold; we demonstrate a tradeoff between individual diversification activity and systemic risk induced by the two information barriers, we provide analytical characterization and numerical representation of the conditions under which diversification activity under limited information may amplify systemic risk and finally we observe and highlight a discrepancy that is created between actual and perceived risk for increasing level of information availability in the system. by Georgia-Evangelia Katsargyri.

After a mean follow-up of 4. 2 years, there have been 202 cases of major ischaemic heart disease. Univariate estimates {{of the risk of}} ischaemic heart disease show that serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cigarette smoking, and body mass index are all associated with increased risk of ischaemic heart disease. Evidence of ischaemic heart disease at initial examination is also strongly associated with increased risk of subsequent ischaemic heart disease. All these factors were then considered simultaneously using multiple logistic models. Definite myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram and recall of a doctor diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease remained predictive of subsequent major ischaemic heart disease, after allowance for all other risk factors. Serum total cholesterol, blood pressure, and cigarette smoking each remained as highly significant independent risk factors whereas overweight, above average levels of HDL-cholesterol and serum triglyceride were not predictive of <b>risk</b> after <b>allowance</b> for the above factors.

40|$|The {{links between}} {{emission}} and energy markets are {{of great interest}} to practitioners, academics and policy makers. In this paper, it is conjectured that a positive relationship exists between emission allowance spot returns and electricity risk premia within the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We discuss how this can be justified {{on the basis of the}} substantial uncertainties in the carbon markets. We also argue that this link could be due to trading strategies followed by electricity producers who attempt to exploit their initial allocation of free allowances. Analysis of data from three major markets, the EEX, Nord Pool and Powernext, offers empirical support to our conjecture. These findings have significant policy implications since they imply that efforts should be made in order to reduce the uncertainty in the carbon markets by clearly defining the EU ETS regulative framework and design over the next years. Moreover, our results suggest that the allocation of free allowances and their unrestricted trading enable electricity producers to accomplish windfall profits in the derivatives market at the expense of other market participants.

The reversion is discounted at the market-derived All Risks Yield (ARY), which correctly implies growth in the reversionary income stream. The reversionary income is the current Estimated Rental Value (ERV) inflated by an appropriate annual growth factor (or CAGR - Compound Annual Growth Rate). The crux of the Crosby-Wood model, and that which sets it apart from the customary DCF, is that the growth factor is derived by means of formula, as a function of the rate of return and the All Risks Yield. For example, if the rate of return is 10% per annum, the ARY is 8% per annum and rent is reviewed annually, then the growth factor will be 2%. (This simple subtraction only works when rent is reviewed annually - in all other situations the growth factor is derived by use of the Crosby formula.) Thus the Short-cut DCF produces a mathematically consistent valuation.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} motivation, job satisfaction and attitudes of nurses in the public health services of Botswana. The objective was to discover how nurses felt about a wide range of variables in their work environment and ultimately to distil them into what they conceived as the mainstay motivators, job satisfiers and positive attitudes. The non pariel (unrivalled, unique) role of the government in creating both the hardware and the software of national health services was acknowledged and recognised with a particular reference to the primacy it placed on developing the human resources in the form of nurses, in order to realize the goals of administering the public health services efficiently and effectively. It was noted that nurses were the change agents and the axis in promoting quality standards of healthcare but in partnership with the government, which must be seen to be responsive and proactive in discharging its fiduciary responsibilities, in respect of both the content and the context of nurses’ occupational ambience. For the purposes of constructing a database from which both the government and the nurses can draw, the most salient thematic details of the theories of motivation, job satisfaction and attitudes were studied and examined and were used as a scaffolding for the empirical survey of nurses. Nine hundred questionnaires were distributed to both registered and enrolled nurses with a minimum of two years work experience in the public health sector and 702 of these were returned constituting a return rate of 78 %. The findings indicated that a majority of nurses enjoyed job satisfaction in certain areas of their work namely autonomy, participating in decision-making, choice of type of nursing, change of wards or departments or work units, interpersonal relationships amongst nurses themselves and between nurses and their supervisors. Nurses also perceived the hospital as an environment in which they could continually learn and they were moreover satisfied with the nursing job or the work itself. The other end of the spectrum revealed an overwhelming majority of 92. 2 % of nurses who were dissatisfied with the level of pay and 88. 5 % who were not happy with the fringe benefits including the provision of accommodation. Working conditions were viewed as generally disliked by 67. 3 % of the nurses. Low pay, workload, lack of viii recognition for outstanding performance and or delayed promotional chances were singled out as being particularly disliked by 67. 2 %, 64. 9 %, 42. 6 % and 44. 4 % of the nurses respectively. Interviews held with 31 nurses yielded similar results. The research further showed that the most important motivators to nurses were dominated by competitive salary which was mentioned by 80. 9 % of the respondents, attractive or sufficient working conditions which were stated by 71. 2 % of the nurses, opportunity for continuous education which was rated by 63. 8 % of the nursing candidates, reduced workload which was claimed by 59. 3 % of the nursing cadres, opportunity for the recognition of outstanding performance and opportunity for promotion which were scored by 54. 1 % and 53. 4 % of the nurse respectively. Job satisfiers were also represented by competitive salary which received 76. 1 % of the nurses’ votes. <b>Risk</b> <b>allowance</b> occupied the second position with 69. 1 % and competitive working conditions were awarded a third ranking by 68. 2 % of the nurses. Those nurses who derived job satisfaction from the fact of each nursing shift being manned by an adequate number of nurses accounted for 63. 1 % of the sample. Competitive fringe benefits attracted 60. 1 % of the nurses. Opportunity to attend workshops and the need for high morale in nursing team-work were chosen as job satisfiers by 53. 7 % and 49. 6 % of the nurses respectively. In the section on recommendations the government was exhorted to invoke corrective or remedial measures in view of the detailed exegesis of the satisfactions and dissatisfactions in the nurses’ work environment and the ensuing problematique (doubtful, questionable) of raising the standards of health care in the public health services. Living up to these sanguine expectations should be the cherished longterm vision of the government if it is to meet and quench the soaring aspirations of its modernizing society for quality health care delivery and the escalating needs of the nurses.

Using a self-rated assessment of total physical activity, there was a systematic tendency for the cases to report more frequently 'low' or 'very low' physical activity. The relative risks were similar for 'very high' or 'moderately high' physical activity, but increased in the two lowest levels, with point estimates, in various decades of age, between 1. 3 and 2. 3 for 'moderately low' and over 2. 5 for 'very low' physical activity. Although the association was apparently stronger at older ages, all the trends in <b>risk</b> were significant. <b>Allowance</b> for major identified potential distorting factors, including body mass index and a measure of total energy intake, could explain only in part the association, and the inverse trends in risk remained statistically significant. When selected types of physical activity were analysed, no association was observed with climbing stairs or walking, but the risk estimates for {{the lowest level of}} activity was over 4 for housework, and between 1. 5 and 1. 9 for sport and leisure and occupational activity. Thus, the present findings suggest that a moderate or high physical activity is an indicator of reduced endometrial cancer risk, although this observation still requires epidemiologic confirmation and clearer definition from a pathogenic point of view...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the nutritional etiology of squamous cell esophageal cancer, we conducted a case-control study in 3 areas of northern Italy. A total of 304 incident, histologically confirmed cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (275 men, 29 women) and 743 hospital controls (593 men, 150 women) with acute, non-neoplastic conditions, not related to smoking, alcohol consumption or long-term diet modification, were interviewed during 1992 to 1997. The validated food-frequency questionnaire included 78 questions on food items or recipes, which were then categorized into 19 main food groups, and 10 questions on fat intake pattern. After allowance for age, sex, education, area of residence, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and non-alcohol energy, a significant increased risk emerged for high consumption of soups (OR= 2. 1 for the highest vs. lowest quintile), whereas inverse associations with esophageal cancer risk were observed for pasta and rice (OR= 0. 7), poultry (OR= 0. 4), raw vegetables (OR= 0. 3), citrus fruit (OR= 0. 4) and other fruit (OR= 0. 5). The associations with dietary habits were consistent in different strata of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking. Among added lipids, olive oil intake showed a significant reduction of esophageal cancer <b>risk,</b> even after <b>allowance</b> for total vegetable consumption (OR= 0. 4), while butter consumption was directly associated with this risk (OR= 2. 2). Our results thus provide further support to the evidence that raw vegetables and citrus fruit are inversely related {{to the risk of}} squamous cell esophageal cancer and suggest that olive oil may also reduce this risk...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three distinct studies (chapters 1 - 3) that all focus on tax planning and how it impacts firm outcomes. Chapter 1 : We investigate whether firm’s performance {{is influenced by the}} employment of top executives who exert a significant effect on their firm’s effective tax rate. Research by Dyreng et al. (2010) provides evidence of the magnitude of top executives’ effect on their firm’s ETR, and calls for research on the consequences of this behavior. Although tax avoidance might contribute to after-tax firm performance, it is possible that costs associated with executive-induced tax planning outweigh the benefits of the reduction in explicit taxes. After classifying executives in terms of their influence on their firm’s GAAP ETR and CASH ETR, we investigate in which firm environment these executives operate and study their influences on firm performance. We observe that the presence of a CASH ETR-decreasing executive has a negative impact on pre-tax performance, indicating that there are significant trade-off costs related to reducing cash taxes. However, we find no overall effect on after-tax performance. After-tax performance is only impacted negatively by CASH ETR-decreasing CEOs or executives with longer tenure. A GAAP ETR-increasing executive has a positive impact on pre-tax performance, which partially persists in after-tax performance. We find weak evidence of a positive impact on return on equity. This effect is especially pronounced for CEOs and executives that are employed for a longer time period. We conclude that the employment of an ETR-decreasing executive is not necessarily beneficial for after-tax firm performance. Chapter 2 : This study contributes to the literature by examining small and medium-sized enterprises’ intentions to plan taxes, {{the extent to which they}} undertake tax planning efforts, the tax planning process and the influence of the executives involved. Our empirical analyses are based on data collected through an online survey with SME managers in Belgium. We estimate a logistic model that captures the likelihood of engaging in tax planning for 101 SMEs and find that both regulation-specific knowledge and executive tenure positively influence the likelihood of engaging in tax planning activities. We also find limited evidence that the probability of planning taxes increases if the firm had a prior engagement with an external tax advisor. While investigating the impact of tax planning efforts on firm outcomes (by measuring changes in Delta), we find that tax planning does not appear to have a consistent effect. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the upper echelons theory in identifying determinants of tax planning. In addition, the results show that tax planning efforts are not necessarily captured by tax measures reported in financial statements. Chapter 3 : This study examines how firms shift profits from one period to another in response to the introduction of an allowance for corporate equity (ACE). We focus on the introduction of the <b>risk</b> capital <b>allowance</b> (RCA) in Belgium by the law of June 22 nd, 2005. We predict and find that firms with relatively low (but positive) earnings in 2006 have incentives to defer profits in 2005 and that this effect is stronger for firms with higher equity ratios. Conversely, we predict that firms that are highly profitable in 2006 and have net operating loss carryforwards in 2005 have incentives to accelerate profits. We find that only subsets of firms react to this incentive: these are firms with a longer time lag between the book year end and the filing date, firms with higher equity ratios and firms that do not issue equity. In sum, our results show that tax-related benefits motivate firms to engage in conforming tax avoidance and provide evidence of cross-sectional variations in the reaction to these incentives. In addition, our results contribute to the literature that outlines the costs and benefits of changes in tax regimes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The three {{chapters}} all address solvency regulation issues, with a {{focus on}} market risks under the Solvency II framework. Chapter 1 deals with “high-level” aspects of Solvency II as main principles and the general structure. Chapters 2 and 3 will be devoted to quantitative issues. Chapter 1 describes the main evolutions that {{led to the development of}} Solvency II. The insurance sector has dramatically evolved during the last two decades. Among others developments, we stress the new risks faced by the sector as natural catastrophes, changing demographics or market risks. Insurers become international companies, investing almost 10 trillion € of assets in Europe at the end of 2014 and being increasingly intertwined with banks and other financial sectors. Financial innovation and the refinement of risk management techniques and models developed by companies have gained momentum among the major European insurance companies. Have these evolutions changed the needs for the supervisory of insurance companies? The economic foundation for regulation is based on the presence of market failures, including severe asymmetric information problems and principal-agent conflicts. Insurance consumers, particularly individuals and households, face significant challenges in judging the financial risk of insurers. But the importance of the insurance sector for financial stability has been increasing. A sound regulatory and supervisory system is necessary to maintain efficient, safe, fair and stable financial markets and promote growth and competition in the insurance sector. The difficult conditions experienced by the industry and the shortcomings of the previous regulatory and supervisory framework have forced regulators to take action to change the way in which they regulate insurance companies’ solvency. Recognizing the shortcomings of Solvency I, EU policy-makers undertook the Solvency II project. Solvency I was not consistently applied throughout EU as the directive allowed countries to implement insurance regulation in different ways. Moreover Solvency I did not consider risks fully or in detail. In life business, the major criticism was the lack of consideration of asset <b>risks.</b> <b>Allowances</b> for latest developments in risk management were also inadequate and companies could not use an internal model to calculate the solvency capital. Finally, the increasing presence of conglomerates and groups forced the insurance regulator to align some requirements with the banking regulation, Basel II/III. Due to the differences in their core business activities, banks and insurers regulators’ goal does not imply comparability of the overall capital charges. However, considering the asset side of the balance sheets, the investment portfolios of banks and insurers contain the same asset classes. In order to avoid regulatory arbitrage, the capital charges for the same amount and type of asset risk should be similar. Chapter 2 compares the main regulatory frameworks in Europe: Solvency II and the Swiss Solvency Test, SST, in Switzerland, {{with a focus}} on potential market implications. Both systems are quite advanced but some key differences need to be highlighted, including the treatment of assets, in particular sovereign bonds, the consideration of diversification or the risk measure applied. Solvency II uses a Value at Risk at 99. 5 % whereas the SST is based on a Tail Value at Risk at 99 %. Our approach is both qualitative and quantitative. In particular, based on a numerical example, we aim at quantifying the level of regulatory capital prescribed by the standard models. The numerical analysis reveals large differences between capital charges assigned to the same asset class under Solvency II and the SST. Solvency II penalizes investment in stocks, mainly due to a lower diversification benefit under the standard formula. On the other hand the SST model requires a higher capital for bonds, primary due to a stringent risk measure and confidence level. The treatment of EU sovereign bonds under Solvency II is another area of concern as it does not require any capital for spread risk. The question arises to what extent an internal model leads to different capital requirements as compared to the SST and Solvency II models. Therefore we apply an internal approach based on Monte Carlo simulation to derive the necessary capital based on the Value at Risk at 99. 5 % (in line with the Solvency II standard model) and on the Tail Value at Risk at 99 % (in line with the SST standard model). Internal models calculate capital requirements that more closely matches risks of insurers and promote a culture of risk management. To develop internal models, companies need incentives to properly manage their risks, i. e. decreasing capital requirements. One potential benefit of the standard model is that insurers who use it can be compared to one another, whereas internal models are by definition specific to individual insurers. One argument against the standard model is the possibility of some systemic risk. An unusual event in the capital or insurance market could encourage all insurers to take the exact same response, thereby causing a run in the market. The analysis shows that standard and internal models still display large discrepancies in their results, suggesting a long way ahead to achieve a harmonized view between the regulators and the insurance sector. The choice of a statistical model or the refinement of parameters are key concepts when setting up an internal model and appear to be critical in the Solvency Capital Requirement calculation. By calculating and comparing the market risk capital charges for a representative insurer under the Solvency II and the SST standard approach as well as an internal model, we are able to provide evidence that the regulatory framework might have an impact on asset portfolios. The main impacts would be a shift from long-term to shorter-term debt, an increase in the attractiveness of higher-rated corporate debt and government bonds, in particular EU sovereign bonds as the consequence of the special treatment under Solvency II, as well as low level of equity holdings. But it is unlikely that large-scale reallocations will happen in the short term, as transitional arrangements are likely to phase in the implementation of Solvency II over several years. The likely impact on assets portfolios could have also already been anticipating by insurers. Chapter 3 studies the effectiveness of the Solvency II reform to prevent the default probability faced by a life insurance company. The default risk leads to a consequence that policyholders might not get back their initial investment upon default of the insurance company. Therefore, policyholders are concerned with the issues like what probability the insurance company will become bankrupt and which amount they can expect to obtain after taking account of the default risk of the insurer. Starting from a theoretical life insurance company which sells a participation insurance policy containing only a savings component and a single premium inflow, we simulate a life insurance company on an eight-year time horizon. We focus only on market risks as there is no mortality risk attached to the insurance contract. Finally several policies and investment strategies will be analysed. The purpose of the chapter is to evaluate how Solvency II can prevent the company to collapse. The papers discussing Solvency II effectiveness are qualitative in nature. In particular there is little research on the accuracy of the standard formula with regard to the proclaimed ruin probability of 0. 5 % per year. To do so we compare the probability of default at maturity of the life insurance policy, i. e. if the company has to enough assets to pay what was promised to the policyholders, with the early probability of default forced by Solvency II based on standard and internal models. We have first to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement as laid down in the directive. One crucial point is the evaluation of liabilities. To do so we use an approach recently applied by the insurance sector called Least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC). The aim of Solvency II is to monitor insurers on an annual basis. The SCR level can then be interpreted as a regulatory barrier, consistent with a model developed by Grosen and Jørgensen (2002). Key drivers of the ruin probability at maturity include interest rate parameters, portfolio riskiness and investment strategies in bonds. The continuously decrease of interest rates creates a challenge for insurers, especially life insurers that suffer a double impact on their balance sheet: a valuation effect and a decreasing reinvestment returns of premiums and maturing bonds. The latter explain also the riskiness of rolling-bond strategies compared to duration matching strategies. By setting the confidence level to 99. 5 % per year, the regulator wants to ensure that the annual ruin probability equals to 0. 5 %. Since the SCR from our internal model equals the 0. 5 % quantile of the distribution, it exactly matches the targeted ruin probability. Our analysis reveals that the set-up and calibration of the Solvency II standard model are inadequate as the solvency capital derived by the standard formula overestimates the results of the internal model. This is mainly the consequence of an overestimated equity capital and a lower diversification benefit. The 0. 5 % proclaimed goal under Solvency II is not reached, being too conservative. One declared goal of the directive is to decrease the duration gap between assets and liabilities. Solvency II penalizes then rolling-bond strategies. The long-term feature of our policy should impact the level of regulatory capital. As Solvency II is based on a quantile measurement, we define the solvency capital using the default probability objective for different horizons. SCR is not systematically a decreasing function of the time horizon even if a decreasing form appears on long-term. This shows undoubtedly that a horizon effect exists in terms of measurement of solvency. As the standard model overestimated the internal model capital we expect a forced default probability higher than 0. 5 % under the Solvency II framework. The SCR barrier stops the company more often than it should be. This can be interpreted as one cost of regulation, i. e. closing down financially sound at maturity companies. The analysis of the evolution of default probabilities as a function of time horizon reveals that ruin probabilities at maturity lie always below the Solvency II objective. Furthermore the gap between the observed default at maturity and the Solvency II objective is increasing over time; the situation is even worse for longer-term insurance products. Finally stakeholders are more interested in their expected return than in the default probability. A cost of regulation defined as the difference between stakeholder’s returns with and without regulatory framework exists, particularly for shareholders.

40|$|Risk {{management}} (RM) {{should be}} seen {{as one of the most}} important functions in the South African built environment. Without the effective management of the risks associated with the industry, the noble vision of a sector that is efficient, profitable, and sustainable cannot be achieved. By embracing tried and tested policies that successfully mitigate risk, industry stakeholders will achieve many project successes, and will outlast any competitors that choose to ignore, or are ignorant of the fact, that the negative impact risk has on projects is inversely proportional to the level of RM employed. Construction Project Management (CPM) practices, realising that there are excellent business opportunities across South Africa’s borders, and faced with a competitive South African market, are engaging with developers and government entities involved in cross border projects in the hope of securing these potentially lucrative African projects. With this move into Africa comes increased uncertainty and risk for these CPM practices, and other project stakeholders. Similarly, CPM practices that have made the strategic decision to remain operational only within South Africa’s borders, are faced with a competitive and complex built environment and industry, made increasingly challenging by a weakening economy, exacerbated by industrial strikes, infrastructure deficiencies and a decrease in industry skill levels. This study reports on Project Managers’ (PMs’) perceptions of project failures and inefficiencies resulting from inadequate RM on projects, including the RM methodologies currently being employed. The study focused on perceptions of PMs who operate within South Africa’s borders, PMs that operate across border into other African countries, as well as PMs who operate exclusively within South Africa’s built environment framework. A study was undertaken incorporating qualitative methodologies via a normative survey. The survey was split into three main phases. Phase one employed the use of a pilot survey executed with the objective of further investigating the main sub-problems to gain more insight into the related issues and challenges. For the pilot survey, PMs were selected based on their engagement in CPM activities within South Africa as well as across South Africa’s borders into other African countries. Phase two of the main survey, with the sample stratum being the Association of Construction Project Managers (ACPM), was aimed at PMs within the ACPM who have engaged, or are engaging, in CPM activities both within South Africa’s borders as well as across South Africa’s borders into other African countries. Phase 3 of the main survey, with the sample stratum being the ACPM, was aimed at PMs within the ACPM who have engaged, or are engaging, in CPM activities within South Africa’s borders only and have not engaged in cross border activities. Survey findings identified the commercial sector and value of the projects undertaken by the practices, the level of risk associated with different client typologies, the link between inadequate RM and project inefficiency and failure, and the importance of RM on projects. Findings also identified that RM methodologies are employed by CPM practices, and that CPM practices generally endeavour to create a culture of risk awareness amongst employees. Further findings indicated that CPM practices may not always understand the risks associated with new industry sectors, regions or countries that they are considering operating within, and that that there is room for improvement regarding the effectiveness of current RM systems. Survey findings also indicated that risk is not always transferred to the correct project stakeholder most suited to managing the risk, and CPM practices are not always able to accurately quantify the costs associated with project risk. Furthermore, it was identified that CPM practices do not always undertaken risk assessments (RAs) at the correct project stage resulting in inadequate <b>risk</b> contingencies <b>allowances,</b> regular <b>risk</b> reviews are not always undertaken for projects, project pre-mortems are seen as valuable tools by CPM practices as a method to reduce future risk, and project post-mortems relative to ‘lessons learnt’ are not always undertaken. Conclusions outline the link between effective RM, project inefficiencies and project failure, as well as the increase or decrease in risk relative to ineffective or effective use of risk identification and management methodologies for time, cost, and quality factors respectively. Conclusions also outline the fact that although CPM practices generally understand the link between RM and project success, they are not always able to fully comprehend the risks associated with new industry sectors, regions or cross border countries. This indicates that without the adequate identification of risk, the RM process or steps that follow the qualitative risk identification process will have little or no value. This is indicative of the requirement for professional associations to consolidate risk data for industry activities with the aim of improving the level of RM industry wide. Recommendations highlight the importance of the compiling of sector specific risk registers, compiled by the South African Council for the Project and Construction Management Professions (SACPCMP) with registered member input, made available to all PMs via the SACPCMPs online database. Further recommendations include: the engendering, by senior management of CPM practices; a healthy ‘risk aware’ culture, by promoting RM practices aligned with best practice methodologies; the implementation of well balanced and formal RM systems throughout the CPM practice, with the aim of achieving effective RM without overburdening PMs with unnecessary documentation or ‘paperwork’; the attendance of risk conferences and workshops by all CPM practices, aimed at specifically identifying challenges that exist with RM and methods that can be employed to improve the status quo; the attendance of formal risk training courses, by all CPM practices, aimed at improving the knowledge base of PMs relative to effective RM, and the appointment of risk professionals, driven by the monetary value and risk levels of the project, to undertake the RM process and unburden PMs from the task, allowing PMs to concentrate on the other project knowledge areas...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{taxes are}} {{associated}} with depreciation deductions in the future. The tax deduction, which is a future cash flow if we rule out Brown taxation (pure cash flow tax), has to {{be accounted for by}} the firm when it comes to project valuation. But in order to include this factor in the valuation of a project the cash flow has to be properly valuated, i. e. all factors that affect the value of the future cash flow have to be included. One factor is the risk associated with the cash flow. There are three types of risk that can be said influence the valuation of depreciation allowances. The first is related to the risk of the company being in tax position. Will the firm be able to pay taxes such that it will be eligible to collect the tax deduction in the future? A second type of risk associated with the tax deduction is a possible change in the tax system by the tax authorities. For example the tax rate might be changed after the project has been initiated. A third type of risk is the risk of inflation uncertainty. Economists always assume that economic agents only care about real rates of return and not nominal. Correspondingly the firm will only care about the real value of future cash flows. But since the inflation rate is uncertain, even though the nominal value of the cash flow might be known, the real value will be uncertain. This uncertainty might have a big impact on the valuation of the future cash flow in question. Using a survey-method Summers (1986) finds that firms generally use a too high discount rate when it comes to valuating depreciation allowances. His main argument is that the risk associated with inflation is non-existing or negligible, such that the discount rate applied should be given by the after-tax coupon payments on a safe bond. In the paper “Taxation, Uncertainty, and the Cost of Equity” by Lund (2002) professor Lund looks at how the valuation of the net cash flow of a company is affected by the presence of tax shields. With basis in the CAPM one of the main findings is that beta value of equity is lower when there are depreciation schedules, and that the value is decreasing in the tax rate. Lund (2002) also touches indirectly upon the question about whether Summers (1986) was right to assume that the <b>risk</b> of depreciation <b>allowances</b> could be ignored when it comes to valuation of these cash flows. He concentrates mostly on the risk associated with the firm’s tax position. The aim of this thesis is to see if the risk of inflation uncertainty has an effect on the valuation of a nominally risk free cash flow. Basically I assumed as case 1 in Lund (2002) that the firm VIII is in tax position with certainty and thus that there is a nominally risk free claim one period ahead. As a first case I look at a representative Norwegian company with a possible investment project in Norway. I set up a real CAPM, additionally assuming that there exists a risk free rate. Further on I deduce the expression for the beta value of a nominally risk free claim of 1 NOK. In order to estimate the beta value I use a sample of Norwegian data in the period 1988 - 2006 and estimate each part in the expression by using empirical moments. The statistical program used is STATA 9. 2, although other packages like Microsoft Excel could have been utilized just as well. As a second case I look at multinational company (American) with an investment project in Norway. The assumptions are the same as in the first case but the major difference is that now the exchange rate plays a part. A similar expression for the beta value is presented, but to be precise it is not the beta value of a nominally risk free claim in terms of USD since the exchange rate is uncertain one period ahead. But the claim is nominally risk free in terms of NOK. The method used for estimation is analogous to the one in case 1 but the period is different. Because I had difficulties finding data for TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) prior to January 2003 I used data from the period January 2003 -January 2009. In the first case I found a beta value of the nominally risk free cash flow close to zero. This means that in the period in question, 1988 - 2006, the risk of inflation uncertainty did not affect the valuation of equity of the firm. Based on this one can argue that Summers (1986) was right to assume that depreciation <b>allowances</b> are “nearly” <b>risk</b> free. But of course, this is just one period. The result might not have been the same if we looked at another time period with different economic conditions. In the second case, with an American multinational investing in Norway, I found a negative beta value of the nominally NOK-risk-free claim. In CAPM-terms this means that the return on the market portfolio and the return on the claim are negatively correlated. I argued that the origin of uncertainty came from the close relationship of the oil price and the value of the Norwegian currency. It is reasonable to assume, since Norway is a major oil-exporting country, that the value of NOK will be high when the oil price is high. Further on, the oil price will of course depend on the supply- and demand forces in the market. It is argued that in periods where the oil price variations are dominated by changes on the supply side the beta value of the oil price will be negative in the U. S., i. e. the return on the S&P 500 is low when the oil price is high and vice versa. The reason is that changes in the oil price that are supply IX side- dominated {{are associated with}} factors that have a negative influence on the world economy, like political unrest, wars and strained relationships among OPEC-countries. Naturally, new technologies in the energy sector and newly discovered oilfields will also affect the supply side. These factors can be related to the period 2003 - 2009, and therefore explain the negative beta value found...|$|R
