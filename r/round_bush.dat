He was picked by Muhammad Ali in 1984 to box on his Champion Sports Pro Boxing Team in the Cayman Islands. Ali had watched Bush in a kickboxing match on ESPN in which he had knocked out George Morrisey with head kick in the sixth <b>round.</b> <b>Bush</b> won his boxing fight by a fourth-round knockout, which gave him a record of 3-0 with 3 KOs as a professional boxer. Bush signed a six-fight contract with Ali's lawyer, Richard Hirschfeld, to box in the Caribbean with a final bout in London, England, for a minor title. However, the company folded soon after Bush's Cayman Islands fight because of stock fraud. In 2005, captured fugitive Richard Hirschfeld committed suicide.|$|E

5000|$|The Julia Child {{cultivar}} features golden flowers {{produced in}} clusters that repeat all season long. Flowers are medium size, full, (26-40 petals), cup shaped, and globular. The small <b>round</b> <b>bush,</b> has foliage that is bright green, and glossy. The bush grows in height of 26" [...] to 31" [...] (65 to 80 cm), with a spread of 20" [...] to 26" [...] (50 to 65 cm). It could grow larger in warmer climates. Usually climates with warmer temperatures offer the roses a longer season, thus {{allowing them to}} get much larger than they would in a shorter season. The bright green foliage makes a nice backdrop for the buttery yellow flowers. It is used in borders, garden beds, containers, and as a cut flower. It is a popular landscaping plant, because of its bright yellow color, disease resistance, and constant bloom.The Julia Child rose is heat tolerant, with excellent resistance to blackspot and mildew.

40|$|Abstract—We {{develop a}} {{vegetation}} mapping method using long-wave hyperspectral imagery {{and apply it}} to landmine de-tection. The novel aspect of the method is that it makes use of emissivity skewness. The main purpose of vegetation detection for mine detection is to minimize false alarms. Vegetation, such as <b>round</b> <b>bushes,</b> may be mistaken as mines by mine detection algorithms, particularly in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. We employ an unsupervised vegetation detection algo-rithm that exploits statistics of emissivity spectra of vegetation in the long-wave infrared spectrum for identification. This informa-tion is incorporated into a Choquet integral-based fusion struc-ture, which fuses detector outputs from hyperspectral imagery and SAR imagery. Vegetation mapping is shown to improve mine detection results over a variety of images and fusion models. Index Terms—Blackbody, clustering, decision-level fusion, emissivity normalization, expectation maximization (EM), mine detection, multisensor systems, vegetation mapping. I...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s Premac was {{manufacturing}} many contract {{parts for}} the heavy industries {{located in the}} Midwest United States. One of the parts being manufactured was a skid plate with Premac's [...] "Prelon" [...] material bonded to it. This eventually morphed into a <b>round</b> <b>bushing</b> (as a bronze bearing replacement) and sadle bearings for hydraulic pumps. In the very early 1980s, a salesman for PBC visited companies in the Detroit, MI area to explain PBC's products and capabilities. At this time, the primary use for PBC bearings was as a saddle bearing in hydraulic pumps (typical Inner Diameter ranged from 6.000 inches to 14.000 inches) for large trucks and equipment. A manufacturing engineer was in the meeting and asked if the technology could be adapted into a much smaller package as he had linear ball bearings which were constantly failing. A quick conference call with the factory and the concept for the Simplicity Bearing was born.|$|R
