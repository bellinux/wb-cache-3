50|$|The {{auditorium}} cornerstone {{was laid}} October 20, 1920, and the completed building was dedicated April 15, 1922. Smith & Oby was one local company {{involved in the}} project, {{at the time the}} largest convention hall in the United States. The main arena floor is 300 x 215 ft and 80 ft high. No columns were used in its construction. With all its <b>removeable</b> seats in place on the arena floor and in the balcony, the hall could seat 13,000. The main stage is 140 x 60 ft with a 72 x 42 ft proscenium arch. A key attraction was a spectacular pipe organ, Opus 328, the largest ever built at one time by E.M. Skinner with 10,010 pipes and 150 direct speaking stops. Belowground, a basement Exhibition Hall provided more than 28500 ft2 m2 of exhibition space. This space was reached by an elegant stone staircased with bronze lights which led down from Public Auditorium's lobby. But the exhibition space itself was uninviting. It had an asphalt floor, was undecorated, and was interrupted by more than 40 columns.|$|E
5000|$|Sunkissed Glow by JLo is {{the fourth}} flanker {{endorsed}} by Lopez. It is inspired by a tropical scent of breeze and the steamy sun; it has notes of flowery and fruity orange blossom, water lilies and passion flowers. It was created by Caroline Sabas. Robin from Now Smell This said [...] "Sunkissed Glow is nicely done, and gets a plus in my book for not smelling like candy ... {{despite the fact that}} I’m not usually a huge fan of coconut in perfume, I prefer the original Miami Glow. It was just more fun. I understand it can still be found at some of the discount chains, so you might want to try both scents before you make up your mind." [...] It is available in 30, 50, and 100ml Eau de Toilette. Blue Glow by JLo is the fifth flanker of Glow endorsed by Jennifer Lopez. Released in Spring 2010, it is a [...] "refreshing watery fragrance" [...] and has notes of water lilly, vanilla orchid, sea wood, cedar and mangosteen; the bottle comes with a complimentary silver anklet. L.A. Glow by JLo was released in early 2011, as the sixth flanker of Glow. It is also Lopez's sixteenth fragrance. It contains notes of cherry, purple plum, blackberry, jasmine, peony, magnolia blossum, musk and amber. According to Lopez's parfum website, the fragrance is inspired by the hip, high energy Los Angeles nightlife. The fragrance appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show during a hidden camera prank DeGeneres and Lopez did. Rio Glow by JLo is the seventh flanker of Glow, endorsed by Jennifer Lopez. The fragrance is limited edition. Released in Summer 2013, it is inspired by the city of Rio De Janeiro, therefore continuing the line's reoccurring theme of interesting cities (L.A Glow & Miami Glow). The perfume has notes of peach, apple, pear, vanilla and orange blossom. The fragrance does not come with any <b>removeable</b> charms, unlike the other fragrances in the line, which all have a charm of some sort attached to their bottles. Wild Glow by JLo is the eighth flanker of Glow, endorsed by Jennifer Lopez. The fragrance is a limited edition that was released in December 2014. The perfume's inspiration was the [...] "upbeat rhythm of music that pulses through the club and bright lights that represent the joys of life." [...] The perfume has notes of blackcurrent, tropical fruits, heliotrope and jasmine. Like Rio Glow before it, the fragrance has no charms attached its bottle.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{contamination}} {{evaluation is}} a tough problem since {{it is difficult to}} isolate the radiations emitted by the surface, especially in a highly irradiating atmosphere. In that case the only possibility is to evaluate smearable (<b>removeable)</b> contamination since ex-situ countings are possible. Unfortunately, according to our experience at CEA, these values are not consistent and thus non relevant. In this study, we show, using in-situ Fourier Transform Infra Red spectrometry on contaminated metal samples, that fixed contamination seems to be chemisorbed and <b>removeable</b> contamination seems to be physisorbed. The distribution between fixed and <b>removeable</b> contamination appears to be variable. Chemical equilibria and reversible ion exchange mechanisms are involved and are closely linked to environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature. Measurements of smearable contamination only give an indication of the state of these equilibria between fixed and <b>removeable</b> contamination at the time and in the environmental conditions the measurements were made...|$|E

40|$|Constant-density {{electrically}} conducting fluid is conned to {{a rapidly}} rotating spher-ical shell and is permeated by an axisymmetric magnetic eld. Slow steady non-axisymmetric motion {{is driven by}} a prescribed non-axisymmetric body force; both rigid and stress-free boundary conditions are considered. Linear solutions of the gov-erning magnetohydrodynamic equations are derived in the small Ekman number E limit analytically for values of the Elsasser number less than order unity and they are compared with new numerical results. The analytic study focuses {{on the nature of}} the various shear layers on the equatorial tangent cylinder attached to the inner sphere. Though the ageostrophic layers correspond to those previously isolated by Kleeorin et al. (1997) for axisymmetric flows, the quasi-geostrophic layers have a new structure resulting from the asymmetry of the motion. In the absence of magnetic eld, the inviscid limit exhibits a strong shear singularity on the tangent cylinder only <b>removeable</b> by the addition of viscous forces. With the inclusion of magnetic eld, large viscous forces remain whose strength Z was measured indirectly by Hollerbach (1994 b). For magnetic elds with dipole parity...|$|E
40|$|The joined wing is a {{new type}} of {{aircraft}} configuration which employs tandem wings arranged to form diamond shapes in plan view and front view. Wind-tunnel tests and finite-element structural analyses have shown that the joined wing provides the following advantages over a comparable wing-plus-tail system; lighter weight and higher stiffness, higher span-efficiency factor, higher trimmed maximum lift coefficient, lower wave drag, plus built-in direct lift and direct sideforce control capability. To verify these advantages at full scale a manned research airplane is required. A study has therefore been performed of the feasibility of constructing such an airplane, using the fuselage and engines of the existing NAA AD- 1 oblique-wing airplane. Cost and schedule constraints favored converting the AD- 1 rather than constructing a totally new airframe. By removing the outboard wing panels the configuration can simulate wings joined at 60, 80, or 100 percent of span. For maximum versatility the aircraft has alternative control surfaces (such as ailerons and elevators on the front and/or rear wings), and a <b>removeable</b> canard to explore canard/joined-wing interactions at high-lift conditions. Design, performance, and flying qualities are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As an {{important}} branch of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has received extensive attention of various fields {{as it is}} portable and <b>removeable.</b> However, energy consumption is highlighting increasingly as nodes are hard to be recharged or replaced. Up to now, many energy efficient routing algorithms or protocols have been proposed with techniques like clustering, data aggregation and location tracking etc. However, many of them aim to minimize parameters like total energy consumption, latency etc. In order to optimize network routing and prolong the life of network, this paper proposes an energy-efficient routing algorithm in WBAN {{which is based on}} Genetic Ant Colony Algorithm (GACA). GACA makes full use of Genetic Agorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA). Choosing the optimal routing is to take advantages of both GA and ACA. At the early stage of algorithm, it uses GA to generate the initial pheromone distribution quickly and comprehensively, and then converts the evolved pheromones distribution into pheromones that can be used by ACA and finally uses the positive feedback and parallelism of ACA to find out the optimal solution. It is the fusion of the two algorithms, gaining an improvement of both time and quality. Then it reduces and balances energy consumption for all sensor nodes through a Distance-based Energy Aware Routing (DEAR) algorithm in order to prolong the lifetime of network...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{the yield}} {{behaviour}} of a cohesive bulk solid in the Jenike shear tester are normally done in two steps. First, pre-shearing {{to a steady}} state yielding, and secondly, shearing under a lower normal stress to establish the shear stress at incipient failure. Due to the limited strain of the sample in this apparatus, the material must be consolidated in an earlier stage. This {{is done by the}} twisting action of a loaded cover, at which the vertical load and the amount of twists are chosen such that a suitable stress—strain curve will be obtained in the pre-shearing stage. The ratio n between the vertical load during consolidation and pre-shearing, respectively, can have a strong impact on the results. In this article, results of measurements with various n-values are given, leading to a variation in shear stress levels for both steady state and incipient failure. This can be explained by variations in the real normal stresses on the shear plane, which can substantially deviate from the externally applied normal stresses, due to contact between ring and base. To establish the real normal stress on the plane of shear, a somewhat modified shear tester was used. Furthermore, measurements were performed where the contact between ring and base was avoided by a <b>removeable</b> pair of half-rings. The results of those measurements and the implications for the derived quantities are amply discussed, resulting in some recommendations for a more reliable testing procedure...|$|E
40|$|One {{rationale}} for the Space Shuttle program which was dramatically realized during the repair of the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) is the efficiency of in-orbit satellite servicing. An unexpected benefit of this repair mission was the return of parts of the Solar Max satellite which had been exposed for four years to the space environment. Studies conducted on these parts have yielded valuable data on the micrometeorite flux and composition at shuttle altitudes during this time period. The scientific results from studies of the cosmic dust component of the observed particle impacts are not yet complete {{but it is clear}} from the preliminary data available that such studies will be a valuable adjunct to the studies of cosmic dust particles collected in the atmosphere. The success of the initial studies of particles collected during repairs of the SMM spacecraft on a surface not specifically designed as a particle collector nor retrieved in a manner intended to minimize or eliminate local contamination raises the possibility that even more interesting results might be obtained if serviceable satellites were initially designed with these objectives in mind. All designs for modern satellites utilize some form of thermal blanket material in order to minimize thermal stresses inside the spacecraft. It is proposed that all future satellites be designed with standardized <b>removeable</b> sections of thermal blanket material which could be replaced during on-orbit servicing and returned to earth for detailed study...|$|E
40|$|Background: This work aims {{to confirm}} if implant-supported overdentures {{are a good}} {{treatment}} option for edentulous patients and offer an improvement in quality of life compared with traditional complete prostheses (dentures). Material and Methods: This retrospective clinical descriptive study included three evaluation groups: validation group (n= 57); control group of patients with complete <b>removeable</b> prostheses (n= 56); study group of patients with implant-supported overdentures retained with the Locator® system (n= 80). The study also validated the Oral Health Impact Profile- 20 questionnaire. Individual protocols were created that included socio-demographic data, the Oral Health Impact Profile- 20 (OHIP- 20) questionnaire and Oral Satisfaction Scale (OSS). Descriptive and bivariate statistical analysis was carried out applying χ², Pearson, Kruskal-Wallis, and Student t tests, transferring data into SPSS-Windows® software from a Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet. Results: The OHIP- 20 {{proved to be a}} valid instrument and provided reliable assessment of health-related quality of life among both the Spanish general population and edentulous patients. The control and study groups proved comparable, showing socio-demographic homogeneity. For patients with overdentures retained by means of the Locator® system, these restorations had significantly lower impact on quality of life (19 vs 33), both generally and for each individual questionnaire item, and much higher satisfaction with the state of their oral cavities (8. 3 vs 5. 3) than patients wearing dentures; both sets of data showed a direct linear relationship, so that as the level of impact on quality of life increased, perceived oral satisfaction worsened. Conclusions: Patients rehabilitated with implant supported overdentures retained by the Locator® system, presented significantly lower levels of impact on their quality of life and significantly higher oral satisfaction than patients with conventional complete prostheses...|$|E

40|$|Background: A Class II {{division}} 2 malocclusion is characterised by {{upper front}} teeth that are retroclined (tilted toward {{the roof of}} the mouth) and an increased overbite (deep overbite), which can cause oral problems and may affect appearance. This problem can be corrected by the use of special dental braces (functional appliances) that move the upper front teeth forward and change the growth of the upper or lower jaws, or both. Most types of functional appliances braces are <b>removeable</b> and this treatment approach does not usually require extraction of any permanent teeth. Additional treatment with fixed braces may be necessary to ensure the best result. An alternative approach is to provide space for the correction of the front teeth by moving the molar teeth backwards. This is done by applying a force to the teeth {{from the back of the}} head using a head brace (headgear) and transmitting this force to part of a fixed or removable dental brace that is attached to the back teeth. The treatment may be carried out with or without extraction of permanent teeth. If headgear use is not feasible, the back teeth may be held in place by bands connected to a fixed bar placed across {{the roof of the}} mouth or in contact with the front of the roof of the mouth. This treatment usually requires two permanent teeth to be taken out (one on each side). Objectives: To establish whether orthodontic treatment that does not involve extraction of permanent teeth produces a result that is any different from no orthodontic treatment or orthodontic treatment involving extraction of permanent teeth, in children with a Class II division 2 malocclusion. Search methods: Cochrane Oral Health 2 ̆ 7 s Information Specialist searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health 2 ̆ 7 s Trials Register (to 10 January 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 10 January 2017), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 10 January 2017). To identify any unpublished or ongoing trials, the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials. gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps. who. int/trialsearch) were searched. We also contacted international researchers who were likely to be involved in any Class II division 2 clinical trials. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of orthodontic treatments to correct deep bite and retroclined upper front teeth in children. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened the search results to find eligible studies, and would have extracted data and assessed the risk of bias from any included trials. We had planned to use random-effects meta-analysis; to express effect estimates as mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes, with 95...|$|E
