In Autumn 1863 Ostrovsky finished Difficult Days (Тяжёлые дни), a sequel to the Hangover, telling the story of backward Russian provinces where ignorance <b>rules.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>followed</b> by Jokers (Шутники, 1864) and The Deep (Пучина, 1865), the latter concluding the Zamoskvorechye cycle.

40|$|A {{positive}} relationship of phonological awareness and reading alphabetic writings is well documented. Chinese {{does not have}} the transparent speech-script correspondence as the alphabets do. We review several studies carried out in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China on the effect of phonological awareness on reading Chinese. Data reveal that almost all subjects were aware of speech sound at the syl-labic level. Smaller than syllabic unit speech sound awareness may require some form of instruction in phonetic aids. Yet it is not a must in order to learn to read Chinese. The finding is discussed in relation to the structure of Chinese characters that provide phonetic cues and help phonological coding when reading characters. 1. Phonological awareness and reading In western literature concerning the acquisition of reading, the main focus is di-rected to decoding single words and more specifically, phonological awareness (Adams 1991). A positive relation between phonological awareness and reading ability has been established (I. Liberman, Shankweiler, & A. Liberman 1989). Phonological awareness refers to an explicit mental representation of phonological information in processing oral and written language. In English, phonological awareness has been operationalized as the ability to discriminate phonemes. For example, segmenting /cat / into /k/-/ae/-/t/. Most of the alphabetic script and speech correspondence is transparent, each sound is represented by a letter, as in cat. To segment speech sounds, there are Grapheme-Phoneme conver-sion (G-P-C) <b>rules</b> to <b>follow.</b> <b>It</b> would <b>be</b> very natural and easy then, for the al-phabetic readers to perform the phoneme segmentation tasks. However, this is not the case. In alphabetic research, of particular interest is the data regarding the explicit analysis capacities of non-readers — whether the preschool children, disadvan-taged readers, or adult illiterates often perform less well to readers.

40|$|Introduction: In the European {{internal}} market consumers {{have a wide}} choice of products that become increasingly available through cross-border shopping. Sometimes sellers frustrate consumers‟ contractual expectations by delivering goods that are not of satisfactory quality. To guarantee a minimum level of consumer protection, EC Directive 1999 / 44 requires that goods must be in conformity with the contract of sale. 1 This rule applies {{regardless of whether the}} seller behaved negligently. In cases of non conformity consumers have a choice of different remedies for breach of contract by the seller, such as repair or replacement or price reduction. The Directive has been presented as a significant step towards creating an internal consumer market, which would be impeded by fragmented and heterogeneous consumer protection <b>rules.</b> <b>It</b> may <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> in the future by further harmonization initiatives in the field of consumer sales law. From an economic perspective, two sets of questions arise. First, it may be asked whether legal intervention is necessary to guarantee quality in markets for consumer goods. The standard economic answer to this question is that legal rules may cure market failures, in particular problems of asymmetric information. However, any legal intervention must be justified by a benefit-cost analysis to enhance economic efficiency and avoid counterproductive effects. Consumer protection should be increased only up to the point where its marginal cost equals its marginal benefit. Moreover, market failures should not be replaced by government failures, which lead to outcomes that are worse than those of imperfect markets. Second, Law and Economics scholars have critically analyzed the question relating to the best level of government for designing regulatory responses to market failures. Should rules of consumer protection be enacted at the European level or should regulatory action be taken by the Member States? The economic analysis of federalism and regulatory competition provides several useful insights that are also relevant for discussing the desirability of harmonization of consumer sales law to further market integration...|$|R

50|$|Following the mandating {{of actual}} revenue {{reductions}} {{within the first}} couple of years, the effects and results of Proposition 2 ½ were limited. The lack of significant changes was {{due in part to the}} state government increasing general purpose aid to municipalities, which helped them to stay away from budget shortfalls. Effective property tax rates declining and an increase in community taxes were a result of various factors including a 64% increase in real estate aid to municipalities between 1981 and 1988, declining school expenses, and a region wide real estate boom. Reduced revenues in the 1980s caused the state to reduce local aid, which fell 12% in 1990, along with over 30% between 1989-1992. Over time, Proposition 2 ½ would have become more binding due to the fact that it is operated in nominal terms, meaning that the <b>rules</b> <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> do not change in response to prices, costs, or spending.|$|R
