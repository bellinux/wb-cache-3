50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>burnishing,</b> or surface rolling, {{is used on}} cylindrical, conical, or {{disk shaped}} workpieces. The tool resembles a roller bearing, but the rollers are {{generally}} very slightly tapered so that their envelope diameter can be accurately adjusted. The rollers typically rotate within a cage, as in a roller bearing. Typical applications for <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> include hydraulic system components, shaft fillets, and sealing surfaces.Very close control of size can be exercised.|$|E
50|$|Another metal skiving {{application}} is for hydraulic cylinders, where a round and smooth cylinder inside {{is required for}} proper actuation. Several skiving knives on a round tool pass through a bore to create a perfectly round hole. Often, a second operation of <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> follows to cold-work the surface for mirror-finish. This process is common among manufacturers of hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> is {{a method}} of cold working metal {{surfaces}} to induce compressive residual stresses and enhance surface roughness qualities. The tooling typically consists of a hardened sphere or cylindrical roller. These tools are pressed onto/across the part being processed. The part (or the tool in some applications) must be moving at a constant rate of speed, for example {{in the case of}} <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> a part on a lathe, the part is spinning and the burnishing tool is moved across the surface as a constant rate; therefore, producing a very consistent finish across the part. Another application is thrust bearing surfaces of some production crankshafts. A dual roller (cylindrical) tool is moved into the thrust bearing journal of a crankshaft, while the crankshaft is spinning the tool is indexed (so each roller is perpendicular to the thrust surface while backing each other up) deforming the surfaces. So the diameters of each roller added together (compensated for elastic deformation) equals the finish dimension of the thrust bearing.|$|E

50|$|In {{deep hole}} machining, a <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> tool is often {{combined}} with skiving knives {{on the same}} tool. The skiving knives pass first, scraping the inside layer of metal, followed by the burnishing rollers, which cold work the tube to create a mirror surface finish. Skive-burnishing is often used in hydraulic cylinder applications. This process can happen on a deep hole drilling machine or a dedicated skiving machine.|$|E
50|$|Hyco uses a {{large number}} of {{manufacturing}} processes in order to produce their final products. The processes include rod and tube machining and grinding, custom metal machining, component machining, skive and <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing,</b> friction and inertia welding, plating, painting, and hydraulic component assembly. Robotic and CNC machines are used in many of these processes. Several plants specialize in large capacity machining and handling the very heavy, oversized components used to produce very large bore, very long stroke hydraulic rod and telescoping cylinders.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} forms of {{burnishing}} processes, {{the most common}} are <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> and ball burnishing (a subset of which is {{also referred to as}} ballizing). In both cases, a burnishing tool runs against the workpiece and plastically deforms its surface. In some instances of the latter case (and always in ballizing), it rubs, in the former it generally rotates and rolls. The workpiece may be at ambient temperature, or heated to reduce the forces and wear on the tool. The tool is usually hardened and coated with special materials to increase its life.|$|E
50|$|Unlike LPB, {{traditional}} burnishing tools {{consist of}} a hard wheel or fixed lubricated ball pressed into the surface of an asymmetrical work piece with sufficient force to deform the surface layers, usually in a lathe. The process does multiple passes over the work pieces, usually under increasing load, to improve surface finish and deliberately cold work the surface. <b>Roller</b> and ball <b>burnishing</b> have been studied in Russia and Japan, and were applied most extensively in the USSR in the 1970s. Various burnishing methods are used, particularly in Eastern Europe, to improve fatigue life. Improvements in HCF, corrosion fatigue and SCC are documented, with fatigue strength enhancement attributed to improved finish, {{the development of a}} compressive surface layer, and the increased yield strength of the cold worked surface.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear of piston rings in a {{hydraulic}} radial piston motor. The piston ring has to satisfy increasing demands for reliability and longer service life. It has two contacting surfaces, the face and the flank, and operates under a boundary lubrication state. This {{first part of the}} project aimed to detect and characterise piston ring wear. Measurement by weighing gives an overall value for wear defined as loss of mass. Two-dimensional form and surface roughness measurements show the distribution of wear on the piston ring face in contact with the cylinder bore and the piston ring flank in contact with the piston groove. Three-dimensional analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, allow the wear mechanisms to be identified. The wear of piston rings from an actual hydraulic motor was characterised. As well, rig testing was performed in two different test rig set-ups, one simulating the sliding movement of the piston ring and the other the tilting movement {{at the end of the}} strokes. Wear during the running-in period was investigated, and the findings indicate that the period when this takes place is of short duration. In the long term, mild wear makes the surfaces smoother than they were when new, resulting in a very low wear coefficient. Significant levels of wear were measured on both contacting surfaces of the piston ring. In cases in which the flank exhibits more wear than the face, the wear on the flank can be reduced by proper design of the piston groove. The second part of the project aimed to evaluate use of a textured surface for the cylinder bore counter surface and a coated surface for the piston ring. Three modelling experiments were performed to characterise the friction and wear properties under lean boundary lubrication conditions. Under such conditions, textured surfaces have the advantage of retaining more lubricant and supplying it over a longer time. Stable friction was also a distinctive feature of the textured surface. Use of a coating could also possibly reduce the amount of wear. Though a smooth surface, like a polished one, is hard to beat for a working texture, a coated surface is far ahead of a smooth uncoated one. Different manufactured and commonly used cylinder bore surfaces, including textured ones, were evaluated in the sliding movement test rig. That allowed favourable wear properties, such as lowest wear coefficient, to be determined with the use of a <b>roller</b> <b>burnished</b> surface. A final part of the research involved simulating wear on the piston ring face throughout the entire service life of a hydraulic motor. This allowed us to determine the roles of surface roughness and coating in prolonging service life and achieving acceptable and secure piston ring operation. The model is simple and realistic, but still needs to be refined so as to correspond even better to reality. QC 2010100...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the major}} {{interests}} in powertrain development are {{the reduction of}} frictional losses and service life extension from improved wear resistance. Surface finishing and deterministic microstructuring {{have been shown to}} be effective methods in improving the tribological properties of sliding contacts such as bearings and cylinder liners. This is due to their acting as micro pressure-chambers and as wear debris traps. In this work, tribometric ring-on-disc tests were performed in order to evaluate the influence of surface structure - namely, the microstructure geometry and layout - on the frictional behavior of lubricated surfaces. The material combination bronze against steel as typically used in powertrain applications was investigated. The surface structures where machined using electrochemical machining by closed electrolytic free jet (Jet-ECM). It was determined that microstructuring reduced the friction coefficient by up to 45 % in the hydrodynamic regime under loads and speeds found in automotive components. The friction measurements showed that microstructures with low aspect ratios result in the least friction. In addition to the tribological investigations, the process capabilities and implementability in serial production of two surface microstructure fabrication processes: Jet-ECM and a newly developed, hybrid <b>roller</b> micro-embossing and <b>burnishing</b> process were evaluated and contrasted. It was shown that both fabrication methods can attain high structure quality...|$|R
50|$|The {{processes}} that affect surface integrity can be conveniently broken up into three classes: traditional processes, non-traditional processes, and finishing treatments. Traditional processes {{are defined as}} processes where the tool contacts the workpiece surface; for example: grinding, turning, and machining. These processes will only damage the surface integrity if the improper parameters are used, such as dull tools, too high feed speeds, improper coolant or lubrication, or incorrect grinding wheel hardness. Nontraditional processes are defined as processes where the tool does not contact the workpiece; examples {{of this type of}} process include EDM, electrochemical machining, and chemical milling. These processes will produce different surface integrity depending on how the processes are controlled; for instance, they can leave a stress-free surface, a remelted surface, or excessive surface roughness. Finishing treatments are defined as {{processes that}} negate surface finishes imparted by traditional and non-traditional processes or improve the surface integrity. For example, compressive residual stress can be enhanced via peening or <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> or the recast layer left by EDMing can be removed via chemical milling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} shot peening and <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> on the fatigue {{performance}} of the γ(TiAl) alloy Ti- 45 Al- 9 Nb- 0. 2 C was investigated {{over a wide range}} of processing intensities. At optimized conditions shot peening and <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> can markedly improve the fatigue strength at ambient temperatures. For temperatures above 650 °C, the residual compressive stresses induced by shot peening and <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> quickly relax. This indicates that, at elevated temperatures, surface roughness and dislocation strengthening become more important for the fatigue performance of mechanically surface-treated components. <b>Roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> leads to much lower surface roughness than shot peening, resulting in more effective improvement of high temperature fatigue performance. However, surface strengthening by shot peening can also be beneficial for the fatigue performance at elevated temperatures, when the surface roughness is reduced by subsequent polishing...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of fine machining efficiency of 34 CrMo 4 steel with <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> tools. Application of <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> process as a clean and environmentally friendly machining process which can replace other pollution processes is of great interests. It is important to evaluate the influence of material properties (primary hardness) for smoothing efficiency and achieving of lower roughness and higher work piece hardness. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental tests of cutting outputs have been done on specimens prepared for final machining process to estimate the rate of roughness decrease, and diameter increase. Roughness measured data before and after <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> process have been compared. Findings: It was found that surface roughness is significantly lower after <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing.</b> Roughness ratio (before/after process) and decrease factor was 4 what doesn’t satisfy expected results.

Practical implications: Smoothing process can be performed on standard machine tools without additional reconfiguration tasks. Process is very rapid. Process is very versatile for any workshop and can be conducted without coolant what is additional advantages for the environment and pollution free machining.

A lot of {{innovations}} in molding and casting technology and also simulation techniques have made ductile iron {{more and more}} competitive and it even competes meanwhile against steel forgings.
