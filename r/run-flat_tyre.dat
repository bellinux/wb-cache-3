50|$|The ASLAV has an eight-wheeled {{configuration}} (capable {{of either}} four or eight wheel drive), is amphibious {{and has a}} range of 600 km with a top road speed of 120 km/h. The vehicle has excellent battlefield mobility, as all wheels are equipped with a solid-core secondary <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyre</b> next to the hub, allowing the vehicle to function even with eight flat tyres.|$|E
50|$|Straussler {{worked on}} a variety of {{automotive}} projects after the war. Although many were connected in some way with amphibious vehicles, they included the Lypsoid Tyre — a very low-pressure, off-road, <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyre</b> that saw some use with military and construction vehicles, including the Fabrique Nationale AS 24 lightweight transport vehicle. In October 1957, Straussler was charged with violating British export controls. A 'semi-military' truck fitted with his off-road wheels was sent, with permission, to the Netherlands for demonstration purposes. But it was then sent from there to Hungary - this was illegal as that country was behind the Iron Curtain. Straussler was given an absolute discharge (i.e. found guilty, but no punishment was imposed); his company was fined £500 and he and his company shared the costs of the prosecution.|$|E

25|$|Cascavel Mk IV: First {{production}} model to {{be equipped with}} <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres</b> and the tyre pressure regulator. Also carried a more integrated fire control system.|$|R
25|$|The SIBMAS {{was built}} with {{power-assisted}} steering, automatic transmission, and <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres.</b> It {{could also be}} fitted with night vision sights, a {{nuclear biological and chemical}} (NBC) protection suite, an electrical air conditioning system, heater, and a winch.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of a supercharger to the Mk I Cooper S required that the battery be relocated into {{the rear of the}} car — leaving no room for a spare tyre, so the S models came with <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the 335i {{became the}} first 3 Series model to be sold with a {{turbocharged}} petrol engine. The E9X family also saw the introduction of <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres</b> to the 3 Series range. Consequently, cars with run-flats are not equipped with a spare tyre.|$|R
50|$|Features {{available}} in the E60 initially included iDrive (first introduced in the E65 7 Series), active cruise control, voice control, Bi-Xenon headlights, <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres,</b> active width adjustment seats, active anti-roll barsand active steering. Safety-related items include Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), head-up display, adaptive headlights, night vision and active headrests.|$|R
50|$|It was an {{armoured}} {{version with}} category B4 protection level. Engine choices included E320 CDI, E350, and E500. The vehicles were reinforced with steel and aramid. Other safety equipment included Michelin MOExtended <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres</b> with pressure loss warning system. All models had {{a top speed}} of 240 km/h.|$|R
5|$|Storm II is also {{produced}} in an armoured version, and is offered with an optional 2.8litre VM Motori turbodiesel, automatic transmission, right hand drive, and <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres.</b> AIL {{is capable of}} completing ten vehicles daily. Due to recently passed tax laws, a civilian version is not yet available in the local market.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicle is}} 240 in long, 98 in wide and 100 in tall, with a ground {{clearance}} of 14 in. Its wheelbase is 153 {{in and it}} has a kerb weight of 13000 lb. The vehicle holds [...] of fuel and sits on four ballistic <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres.</b> The vehicle's 20 in are custom-designed and engineered using a solid piece of forged 6061 aluminum.|$|R
50|$|The design drew upon {{experience}} with the Valentine tank prototypes. Fuel and pressure for the flamethower was carried in a trailer with 0.47 in of armour {{and as a result}} weighing about 6.4 LT. The trailer held two fuel tanks with a capacity of 400 gal L and five compressed-air cylinders plus some ancillary piping and a hand pump for filling. The trailer had two wheels fitted with <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres</b> but no shock absorbers nor brakes.|$|R
50|$|The First Win {{is powered}} by a Cummins diesel engine (300HP in the {{original}} configuration, 250HP in the E version) coupled with an Allison 3000 SP automatic transmission (Allison 2500 SP in the E version., providing maximum road speed of up to 100 km/h. The vehicle comes standard with powered steering, independent suspensions and <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres.</b> Ballistic protection is up to STANAG 4569 Level II and mine protection to Level 3b under the hull centre and Level 4a under any station.|$|R

Armament on the TM-170 is optional and it is capable of being equipped with a pintle- or ring-mounted 7.62 mm machine gun, a turret armed with twin 7.62 mm MGs, or a turret armed with a 20 mm cannon.|$|R

The vehicle has top speed of 210 km/h, with GVW of 4200 kg.|$|R
2500|$|The {{transmission}} is a dual-clutch direct-shift gearbox computer-controlled automatic with seven gear ratios, with magnesium paddles behind {{the steering wheel}} and a shift time of less than 150milliseconds, built by Ricardo of England rather than Borg-Warner, who designed the six speed DSG used in the mainstream Volkswagen Group marques. The Veyron can be driven in either semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. A replacement transmission for the Veyron costs just over [...] It also has permanent all-wheel drive using the Haldex Traction system. It uses special Michelin PAX <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres,</b> designed specifically to accommodate the Veyron's top speed, and cost [...] per set. The tyres [...] can be mounted on the wheels only in France, a service which costs [...] Kerb weight is [...] This gives the car a power-to-weight ratio, according to Volkswagen Group's figures, of [...] per ton.|$|R
25|$|All EE-9 Cascavels have {{a similar}} layoutthe driver is seated {{at the front of}} the vehicle and to the left, turrets are {{typically}} fitted above the centre, with motor and transmission situated at the rear. The Cascavel Mk II has a manual turret, but all later variants have electrically powered traverse. Cascavel Mk IIIs are equipped with an Engesa EC-90 90mm gun firing high explosive (HE), high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) or high explosive squash head (HESH) shells in cartridge form; a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun is also mounted to the left of the main armament. The EC-90 has an elevation of +15° and a depression of -8°. It is not stabilised and only mounts a rudimentary optical fire control system, which has been upgraded with a laser rangefinder in Brazilian service. Late production Cascavels were fitted with <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres</b> and a unique central tyre pressure regulator accessible from the driving compartment.|$|R
5000|$|The Mini was {{modified}} during its production {{to improve its}} safety. In 1974 a prototype Mini experimental safety vehicle was built, the Mini Clubman SRV4. It featured a longer crumple zone, a [...] "pedestrian friendly" [...] front-end, <b>run-flat</b> <b>tyres,</b> strengthened door sills, extra internal padding and recessed door handles, the latter having been used earlier on Australian-built Minis owing to local laws. Jack Daniels, {{one of the original}} Issigonis team, is stated to have been working on further safety improvements for the Mini when he retired in 1977. [...] Several times it was thought that safety regulations would stop Mini production [...] Safety improved in 1996, with the introduction of airbags and side-impact bars. [...] The Mini, challenged by increasingly demanding European safety and pollution standards, was planned by British Aerospace to be taken out of production in 1996, but BMW chose to invest to keep the Mini legal until the launch of a new model.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} sleek wedge profile {{was completely}} retained but the tailgate revealed an enormous loadspace accessible by probably the largest estate car aperture available on any European {{car at the}} time. With the rear seat lowered there is a load length of nearly 6 ft, a load width averaging 4 ft, a load height of nearly 3 ft, and an overall carrying capacity of 54 cubic feet (assuming Dunlop Denovo <b>run-flat</b> wheels and <b>tyres</b> are fitted, obviating {{the need for a}} spare wheel).|$|R
