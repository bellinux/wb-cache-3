40|$|The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 {{provides}} immunity {{for volunteers}} serving nonprofit organizations or government entity for harm caused by their acts and omissions if: The volunteer was acting {{within the scope}} of his or her responsibilities {{at the time of the}} alleged act or omission. Appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly licensed, certified or authorized to act.

The harm was not caused by the volunteer operating a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft where the State requires an operator’s license and insurance. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 (VPA) specifically protects a volunteer who ” (1) performs services, which includes officers, directors, and direct service volunteers, (2) volunteers for a non profit organizations or government entity, and (3) either receives no compensations (this does not include reasonable reimbursement for expenses incurred), or does not receive anything of value in lieu of compensations in excess of $ 50 per month or $ 500 per year. The VPA does not reduce the need for good risk management practices that insure the safety of volunteers and progra...|$|E
40|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} image of Victorian Britain as an era of {{unbridled}} capitalism, the Victorians took financial transgressions seriously. Legal reforms passed {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century made it possible for bankers to be held criminally responsible for their actions. The prosecutions which became commonplace by the end of the nineteenth century were high-risk and did not always succeed, but they had important economic and social effects. They restored market confidence in times of crisis, established the City of London’s good reputation, and demonstrated the fairness of the criminal justice system. In addition, by punishing transgressions in a highly visible way, prosecutions defused demand for radical structural reforms, thus bolstering rather than undermining free enterprise. The lack of prosecutions following the recent banking crisis is thought to prove the inadequacy of existing laws and the government is therefore proposing to make <b>reckless</b> <b>misconduct</b> in the management of a bank a criminal offence. But it is doubtful whether such a reform would be either viable or necessary. Laws first passed in Victorian Britain define publishing false information to shareholders in prospectuses and balance sheets as fraud. It is easier to gain convictions based on fraudulent misrepresentation than recklessness, and in the past these laws have been successfully used to convict bankers and other directors who were reckless with their shareholders’ money. These laws are still in place, and have been stiffened since 1900, but regulators have shown little willingness to test their applicability in the current crisis. This absence of political will has led to the effective decriminalisation of fraud. This will make it harder to clean up the City, and will foster radical critiques of the criminal justice system in particular and of the state in general...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) principles in strategic management is propagated in the relevant literature as a criticism of <b>reckless</b> corporate <b>misconduct</b> or as an appraisal of business resources and power. At the same time, the business logic and management challenges of adopting CSR principles in the strategic management of companies remain fairly underdeveloped. To study its management challenges and business logic, we have conducted an explorative case study that investigated the management of a CSR proxy, viz. Health Safety and Environment (HSE), in a multinational company in the petrochemicals. Our study suggests that the {{adoption of}} CSR principles in strategic management is a challenging task even for well prepared companies, which requires a portfolio of activities and resources, i. e. : symbolic actions (e. g. commitment), intangible resources (e. g. communication and training), tangible resources (e. g. equipment), and incentives (e. g. financial benefits, audits). These are apparently based on plausible strategic logic, since their purpose is to minimize risks, save costs, and enhance intangibles such as reputation, trust and social capital. Overall, corporate social responsibility {{is not only an}} ethical issue but also a strategic one and therefore it requires a comprehensive managerial approach...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom’s (UK) {{efforts to}} tackle {{economic}} crime largely {{began with the}} implementation of the recommendations of the Roskill Report in 1986 via the Criminal Justice Act 1987, which created the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The establishment of the SFO was sandwiched between the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Act 1987 during an unprecedented era of banking deregulation. It wasn’t until the creation of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), following the enactment of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, that the efforts to tackle economic crime were revisited by virtue of the FSA statutory objective to reduce financial crime. This, combined with the extensive investigative and enforcement powers of the FSA was part of an innovative attempt to tackle economic crime that arose from within or targeted the financial services sector. Subsequently, the UK’s anti-money laundering laws (AML) were codified by virtue of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; the Fraud Act 2006 was introduced and followed by the much heralded Bribery Act 2010. More recently, the enforcement powers of the new city regulator the Financial Conduct Authority were extended by the Financial Services Act 2012, a new <b>reckless</b> <b>misconduct</b> offence was created by the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 and Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPA) were introduced by the Crime and Courts Act 2013. The aim of these measures was to prevent the UK from continuing to be Europe’s playground for white collar criminals and as a result we have seen record financial penalties imposed on companies by the city regulator for market manipulation, increased fines for weak AML systems, a record number of prosecutions for insider dealing and several DPAs. However, we are left with one pressing question, are these measures fit for purpose to hold corporations liable for economic crime? In January 2017, the Ministry of Justice published its call for evidence Corporate Liability for Economic Crime and proposed five options for reform: 1. 	Amendment of the identification doctrine, 2. 	Strict (vicarious) liability offence, 3. 	Strict (direct) liability offence, 4. 	Failure to prevent as an element of the offence and 5. 	Investigate the possibility of regulatory reform on a sector by sector basis. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} critically analysis the proposals contained in the Ministry of Justice call for evidence and to determine which of these five proposals merits inclusion in the UK’s economic crime agenda...|$|E
40|$|The Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill 2013 / 14 (hereafter Banking Reform Bill) {{is set to}} {{introduce}} a new criminal offence of <b>reckless</b> <b>misconduct</b> by senior bank staff. The introduction of such an offence was recommended in the Final Report of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PCBS) Changing Banking for Good, published 19 June 2013; {{as part of a}} ‘package of recommendations to raise standards’. This particular recommendation had been widely anticipated. A short time before this Report, the PCBS Chair, Andrew Tyrie MP, had bemoaned the lack of ‘orange jumpsuits’ being donned by bankers. Equally, press reportage that ‘reckless bankers’ could ‘face jail’ had started to appear from as early as the close of 2011. 4 Government endorsement of the PCBS recommendations followed quickly from the publication of the latter’s report. On 8 July 2013 the Government Response to the Report to this effect signalled that this would be achieved by adding amendments to the Banking Reform Bill 2013 / 14, first introduced in Parliament 4 February 2013. This has now transpired, by virtue of amendments to the Bill introduced on 9 October 2013. Like the initial PCBS recommendation, government support for the new criminal offence was also widely anticipated. Government favour for such a measure had been strongly signalled in the Treasury Consultation Sanctions for the Directors of Failed Banks, published in July 2012. It had been signposted earlier still by very public declarations of support from Matthew Hancock, MP, a close ally of George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. At one level, this new criminal offence is intended to be very narrow in application, and enforced only very exceptionally. In other respects, analysis of it through the current proposals show it to be a manifestly important measure which will alter the longstanding course of criminal liability for ‘financial sector’ crime in Britain. It is also part of the discourse of the post-crisis regulatory environment encouraging reflection on the past in configuring responses for the future; including suggestions that too little {{attention has been paid to}} ‘lessons of history’. In exploring aspects of both these distinctive angles, attention is paid to how nineteenth-century responses were themselves informed by contemporary Victorian understanding of a ‘conscious past’. Little work has been undertaken on how Victorian responses to financial crime were influenced by a conscious past and the article considers why the introduction of the reckless conduct in banking offence creates such an appropriate juncture for doing so. This is in the light of our own awareness of how criminal law has responded to financial misconduct for over 150 years, and what new approaches might be required to respond to the regulatory challenges of the early twenty-first century...|$|E
