40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{the most}} common disorder of the endocrine system and affects nearly 16 million people in the United States and over 100 million people worldwide. However, all existing conventional methods of home blood glucose monitoring require obtaining a blood sample by pricking the fingertip with a needle or lancet and then using paper strips that change color as soon as exposed to a drop of the blood sample to indicate glucose levels. ^ Diabetic patients are generally recommended to check their blood glucose level 5 to 7 times per day. Since these blood glucose tests are painful, intimidating, laborious, and expensive, they strongly discourage patient compliance. Thus it is necessary to develop a non-invasive blood glucose method which could provide fast, painless, and convenient glucose monitoring to diabetic patients. ^ The study presented here introduces and provides basic scientific and engineering data on a new approach using the Faraday effect of glucose solutions themselves. We call this effect the Magneto Optical <b>Rotatory</b> <b>Effect</b> of glucose or MORE to distinguish it from other applications of the Faraday effect that are used to create closed and open loop polarimetry systems. The “MORE” effect results from nonlinear mixing of conventional optical rotation with Faraday rotation, creating a signal at the Faraday modulator frequency that is indicative of the glucose concentration in the solution. ^ The method to demonstrate MORE signals in the presence of enucleated goats eyes also will be discussed in this study. As far as we are aware, {{this is the first time}} that this type of magnetic <b>rotatory</b> <b>effect</b> of glucose solutions has been proposed or investigated for minimally invasive glucometry, and demonstrated in ex vivo living tissue. ^ The optical glucose sensing technique using the magnetic optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>effect</b> of glucose has many advantages over currently existing invasive and non-invasive methods, since the method is based on shining a brief pulse of light into the front of the eye. A highly coherent light source, accurate optical components, and a sophisticated analyzing system are employed in this study. The optical glucose sensing method introduced in this study can be miniaturized using current integrated optics, optoelectronics, and semiconductor technology and has the potential to provide a low cost, fast, and compact non-invasive glucose sensor for the diabetic patient within the near future. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a dynamic {{stability}} analysis of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite viscoelastic plates subjected to compressive edge loads.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} and computational {{study of the}} response of twisted-cross metamaterials that provide near dispersionless optical rotation across a broad band of frequencies from 19 GHz to 37 GHz. We compare two distinct geometries: firstly, a bilayer structure comprised of arrays of metallic crosses where the crosses in the second layer are twisted about the layer normal; and secondly where the second layer is replaced by the complementary to the original, i. e. an array of cross-shaped holes. Through numerical modelling we determine the origin of <b>rotatory</b> <b>effects</b> in these two structures. In both, pure optical rotation occurs in a frequency band between two transmission minima, where alignment of electric and magnetic dipole moments occurs. In the cross/cross metamaterial, the transmission minima occur at the symmetric and antisymmetric resonances of the coupled crosses. By contrast, in the cross/complementary-cross structure the transmission minima {{are associated with the}} dipole and quadrupole modes of the cross, the frequencies of which appear intrinsic to the cross layer alone. Hence the bandwidth of optical rotation is found to be relatively independent of layer separation. The authors wish to thank Dr. Simon Horsley and Prof. Roy Sambles for their helpful discussions.

For a continuous system, governing equations comprise coupled vibration modes namely transverse vibrations in two orthogonal planes, torsional and axial vibrations. The axial and shear deformation effects together with the <b>rotatory</b> inertia <b>effects</b> are all considered based on the first order shear deformation theory and their effects on the frequencies are investigated. The effects of the initial stress resultants on the frequencies are also studied. After buckling, forward-shifting phenomenon of higher frequencies is noticeably demonstrated.

Using a single-mode Galerkin procedure the nonlinear modal equation is obtained. Direct equivalent linearization is employed. The response of acoustic excitation on moderately thick composite panels is studied. Further, the effects of transverse shear on large deflection vibration of laminates under random excitation are studied. Mean-square deflection and mean-square inplane stresses are obtained for some symmetric graphite-epoxy laminates. Using equilibrium equations and the continuity requirements, the mean-square transverse shear stresses are calculated. The results obtained will be useful in the sonic fatigue design of composite aircraft panels. The analysis is presented in detail for simply supported plate.

40|$|The free {{vibration}} {{characteristics of a}} rotating tapered Rayleigh beam is analysed in this study. Two approaches to the dynamic analysis of a rotating beam. The first proposed approach is the discretization “CDM” method, the structure is reduced to rigid bars, connected together by means of elastic hinges, and lower bound to the true frequencies is obtained. The second approach is a variational Rayleigh–Ritz like method, in which the vibration modes are expressed as a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials. The results are presented for Rayleigh beams with <b>rotatory</b> inertia <b>effects</b> and compared with existing solution. The parameters for the hub radius, rotational speed and taper ratio are incorporated. Numerous numerical examples are proposed for the calculation of the free frequencies of vibration to vary some parameter of taper of the beams.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{in-plane}} free vibrations of multi-stepped and multi-damaged parabolic arches, for various boundary conditions. The axial extension, transverse shear deformation and <b>rotatory</b> inertia <b>effects</b> {{are taken into}} account. The constitutive equations relating the stress resultants to the corresponding deformation components refer to an isotropic and linear elastic material. Starting from the kinematic hypothesis for the in-plane displacement of the shear-deformable arch, the equations of motion are deduced by using Hamilton’s principle. Natural frequencies and mode shapes are computed using the Generalized Differential Quadrature (GDQ) method. The variable radius of curvature along the axis of the parabolic arch requires, compared to the circular arch, a more complex formulation and numerical implementation of the motion equations {{as well as the}} external and internal boundary conditions. Each damage is modelled as a combination of one rotational and two translational elastic springs. A parametric study is performed to illustrate the influence of the damage parameters on the natural frequencies of parabolic arches for different boundary conditions and cross-sections with localizeddamage. Results for the circular arch, derived from the proposed parabolic model with the derivatives of some parameters set to zero, agree well with those published over the past years...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{aims to examine}} the influence of geometric ratios and fibre orientation on the natural frequencies of fibre-reinforced laminated composite plates using finite element method based on Yang’s theory and his collaborators. The transverse shear and <b>rotatory</b> inertia <b>effects</b> were taken into consideration in the developed Fortran computer program. It {{has been shown that}} the use of first-order displacement field provides the same accuracy as higher-order displacement field when the number of elements representing the plate structure is increased (refined mesh). However, poor precision may appear for plates with high thickness-to-side ratio h/a (thickness/side length). This discrepancy limits the application of the developed theory to thick plates (h/a < 0. 5). The various curves show the evolution of the dimensionless frequency (w*) versus fibre orientation angle (q) and illustrate the apparition of a “triple-point” phenomenon engendered by the increase of the plate aspect ratio a/b (length/width) for a specific value of h/a. This point defines the maximum natural frequency and the associated fibre orientation. Also, results show that for high and/or low aspect ratios, the triple-point phenomenon does not occur. This latter is rapidly reached for thick plates than thin plates when the plate aspect ratio a/b is progressively increased. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Rotating machine play an {{important}} role in modern technology. Compressors in ventilating and cooling systems, pumps in power generation facilities, as well as high speed computer are all examples of flexible rotating machinery that must remain functional during and after a sever earthquake. Recent earthquakes have demonstrated that an aseismically designed structure may perform well during a strong earthquake yet still become nonfunctional due to damage in critical nonstructural components. For example, evacuation of several hospitals during the recent Northridge earthquake in the LA area was not caused by structural failure bur resulted from mechanical failure of the systems described above. Rotating machines are key components of such system. Further study into the behavior of these systems and technique for their protection for their protection during severe ground motion is needed. The flexible rotating machine is significantly complex, even for highly simplified models, due to gyroscopic and other effects. This paper presents the coupled, linear partial differential equations of motion of a flexible rotating shaft subjected to ground motion. Classical and finite element methods are developed to solve these equations. The effects of various physical parameters on the response of the system; magnitude, duration, and frequency content of the ground motion; bearing stiffness and damping; flexibility of the deformation and <b>rotatory</b> inertia <b>effects</b> are investigated, Both vertical and horizontal ground motion, individually and in combination, will be considered...|$|R

Based on the analysis of spontaneous strain compatibility and charge of domain walls, we have established the permissible domain arrangements for the ferroelectric phases of different symmetry, which are expected to occur {{in the range of}} the MPB. Examination of (001) -oriented unpoled and electrically poled (along the [001] direction) crystal plates in polarizing microscope reveals a monophase state with the domain structure compatible with the structure theoretically predicted for the Mc monoclinic phase (space group Pm), which was recently discovered in the compositions close to the MPB by x-ray and neutron diffraction studies. In the unpoled crystal the 180 deg. walls between the domains whose spontaneous polarization vectors are parallel to the plane of the crystal plate (i. e. a-domains) are observed.

40|$|Near-field {{explosive}} charges, such as buried land mines, produce localised blast loadings {{which can}} potentially cause {{damage to property}} and/or loss of life in both military and civil structures. As the localised short duration blast pulse affects most severely a small area of a plated structure, boundary effects are not as significant as they are when a quasi-static or global blast loading is applied and full plate action may not be utilised. Many common structural forms are composed of individual plated elements and thus the investigation of localised blast loading effects on plates is a prerequisite to understanding the integral behaviour. Typically, plates are made of ductile materials such as steel, which exhibit considerable post-yield deformation capacity when subjected to such extreme dynamic loads. Analytical study of the dynamic plastic response of rigid-plastic plated structures is {{the aim of the}} present study. A circular plate is studied in the present work and a general form of a localised blast loading function with a spatial variation having a central radial zone with constant pressure and exponentially decaying profile outside the zone is assumed. Assuming that steel exhibits perfectly plastic behaviour and ignoring membrane action, transverse shear and <b>rotatory</b> inertia <b>effects,</b> the static plastic collapse pressure is initially found and the analysis is extended {{to take into account the}} inertial effects arising from dynamic loading. Results for the permanent transverse displacements are found for rectangular and linearly and exponentially decaying pulse loads. For high loads and/or loads of short duration, it was found that the permanent transverse displacement can be found by replacing the applied pulse load by means of an impulsive velocity without great loss of accuracy. Good correlation with numerical simulations obtained from ABAQUS/Explicit is achieved (within 15 % accuracy) for plate geometries falling within the identified limits where membrane and shear effects are negligible. The predicted final transverse displacements are found to be dependent on the loading pulse shape, but the pulse-shape effects are eliminated by using the correlation parameters (effective impulse and pressure) advocated by Youngdahl (1971) [52] to give a single pulse shape-independent curve for the final plate deflection as a function of the effective pressure and effective impulse. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

30|$|A {{number of}} shear {{deformation}} theories {{have been proposed}} to date. The first such theory for laminated isotropic plates was proposed apparently by Stavski (1965). This theory was generalized to laminated anisotropic plates in Yang et al. (1966), Ambartsumyan (1969) and Ambartsumyan and Gnuni (1961). It was shown in Srinivas and Rao (1970), Whitney and Sun (1973) and Bert et al. (1974) that the Yang–Norris–Stavski (YNS) theory (Yang et al. 1966) is adequate for predicting the flexural vibration response of laminated anisotropic plates {{in the first few}} modes. In Whitney and Pagano (1970), the YNS theory was employed to study the cylindrical bending of antisymmetric cross-ply and angle-ply plate-strips under sinusoidal loading and the free vibration of antisymmetric angle-ply plate-strips (see also (Fortier and Rossettos 1973; Shinha and Rath 1975). Using the YNS theory, a closed-form solution for the free vibration of simply supported rectangular plates of antisymmetric angle-ply laminates was obtained in (Bert and Chen 1978). In Noor (1973) were also presented exact three-dimensional elasticity solutions for the free vibration of isotropic and anisotropic composite laminated plates, which serve as benchmark solutions for comparison by many researchers. The free vibration of antisymmetric angle-ply laminated plates, with reference to transverse shear deformations, was investigated in Reddy (1979) using the finite-element method The author also derived a set of variationally consistent equilibrium equations for the kinematic models originally proposed by Levinson and Murthy (Reddy 1984). In Reddy and Khdeir (1989), analytical and finite- element solutions for the vibration and buckling of laminated composite plates were found using various theories of plates to prove the necessity for shear deformation theories to predict the behavior of composite laminates. Using a higher order shear deformation theory, finite-element solutions for free vibration analysis of laminated composite plates were also obtained in (Shankara and Iyengar 1996). The complete set of linear equations of a second-order theory was derived in Khdeir and Reddy (1999) to analyze the free vibration behavior of cross-ply and antisymmetric angle-ply laminated plates. In Singh et al. (2001), the natural frequencies of composite plates with random material properties were determined using a higher order shear deformation theory (including the <b>rotatory</b> inertia <b>effect).</b> The natural frequencies of laminated composite plates were also found in Rastgaar et al. (2006) by employing a third-order shear deformation theory. In Simsek (2010 a), the dynamic deflections and the stresses of a functionally graded simply supported beam subjected to a moving mass were investigated using the Euler–Bernoulli, Timoshenko, and the parabolic shear deformation theory of beams. In Simsek (2010 b), the free vibration of functionally graded beams with different boundary conditions was examined by using the classical, first-order, and different higher order shear deformation theories of beams. A stress analysis of a functionally graded plate subjected to thermal and mechanical loads was performed in Matsunaga (2009) using a two-dimensional higher order theory. A new trigonometric shear deformation theory for isotropic and composite laminated and sandwich plates was developed recently in Mantari et al. (2012), El and Chulkov (1973), where displacements of the middle surface were expanded in terms of tangential trigonometric functions of the thickness coordinate, and the transverse displacements were assumed to be constant across the thickness.|$|R
