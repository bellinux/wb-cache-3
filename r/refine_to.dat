50|$|For example, x ∈ {1,2,3} (where x is {{the value}} of the {{variable}} x after an operation) could be refined to x ∈ {1,2}, then x ∈ {1}, and implemented as x := 1. Implementations of x := 2 and x := 3 would be equally acceptable in this case, using a different route for the refinement. However, we must be careful not to <b>refine</b> <b>to</b> x ∈ {} (equivalent to false) since this is unimplementable; it is impossible to select a member from the empty set.|$|E

50|$|By {{determining}} x for all data, x {{is usually}} {{found to be}} between 0 and 1. If the value is near 0, with a small standard uncertainty, the absolute structure given by the structure refinement is likely correct, and if the value is near 1, then the inverted structure is likely correct. If the value is near 0.5, the crystal may be racemic or twinned. The technique is most effective when the crystal contains both lighter and heavier atoms. Light atoms usually show only a small anomalous dispersion effect. In this case, the Flack parameter can <b>refine</b> <b>to</b> a physically unrealistic value (less than 0 or greater than 1) and has no meaning.|$|E
50|$|Silicon is an earth {{abundant}} element, and is fairly inexpensive to <b>refine</b> <b>to</b> high purity. When alloyed with lithium {{it has a}} theoretical capacity of ~3,600 milliampere hours per gram (mAh/g), which is nearly 10 times the energy density of graphite electrodes (372 mAh/g). One of silicon's inherent traits, unlike carbon, is {{the expansion of the}} lattice structure by as much as 400% upon full lithiation (charging). For bulk electrodes, this causes great structural stress gradients within the expanding material, inevitably leading to fractures and mechanical failure, which significantly limits the lifetime of the silicon anodes. In 2011, a group of researchers assembled data tables that summarized the morphology, composition, and method of preparation of those nanoscale and nanostructured silicon anodes, along with their electrochemical performance.Below are various structural morphologies attempted to overcome issue with silicon's intrinsic properties.|$|E

30|$|Visual {{analytics}} tools aim {{to reduce}} the cognitive load on users during interpretation, intuitively present results of interpretation for communication between researchers, and allow researchers to interactively <b>refine</b> <b>to</b> present relevant information. Recently, there have been attempts at fMRI-UVA in the image analysis phase, exposing some of the uncertainties in the intermediate steps; these allow for decisions to be made about aspects of the data quality, for example, temporal heterogeneity as introduced in Sect.  2.2. Yet, many of the processes in the fMRI pipeline utilise statistical toolkits that introduce the uncertainties without employing any fMRI-UVA. In this section, we discuss the key toolkits, processes and software libraries that are used throughout the pipeline. While our analysis focuses on the visualisation and visual analytics tools, we also introduce standard statistical methods where these are commonplace.|$|E
