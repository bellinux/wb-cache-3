The company’s operations include component manufacturing, painting, and assembling products. The company also purchases a relatively large percentage of components and major assemblies that are needed to support final assembly operations. MAAN uses its own returnable containers to transport purchased parts from suppliers. Due to poor tracking of the containers, the company has been experiencing lost containers and occasional production disruptions at its facility well as at the supplier sites. The objective of this project was to develop a proposal to enable MAAN to more effectively track and manage its returnable containers. The research activities in support of this project included the analysis and documentation of both the physical flow and the information flow associated with the containers as well as some of the technologies that can help with automatic identification and tracking of containers.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of Reusable Packaging in automobile manufacturing facilities, {{as well as}} a comparison to other industries, shows that <b>returnable</b> <b>container</b> systems are not being fully utilized. In this study, methods to return and track packaging materials for reuse are examined. Issues identified through surveys and interviews are summarized, and a recommendation to more fully utilize systems currently in place is proposed. An evaluation based on utilizing the current system will enable us to assign a cost to current operations, and may support an investment in improved systems and technologies. Most of the companies surveyed gauge functionality based on whether or not there are shortages severe enough to stop production. This fact is determined through Gap Analysis, Benchmarking, and Case Studies. A process by which to track losses, costs, turnaround time, etc. of container return systems is currently not seen as a critical function of production, consequently no justification exists for investing in upgrading these systems. A Closed Loop Packaging System refers to a well-defined circuit of shipping and delivery points. This closed circuit is essential to ensure that containers flowing through the system do not get lost (www. returnables. com). Locating and rerouting stray or replacing lost containers can be a significant, unplanned cost related to packaging returns. The automotive industry estimates a minimum of seven percent (7. 00...|$|E
5000|$|In the British and Irish {{metrication}} processes, the pint {{was replaced}} by metric units as the legally defined primary unit of measure for trading by volume or capacity, except {{for the sale of}} draught beer and cider, and milk in <b>returnable</b> <b>containers.</b> The pint can still be used in those countries as a supplementary unit in all circumstances. Local legislation in the UK mandates the use of the pint as a measure for draught beer and cider (in pubs for instance). For milk, if <b>returnable</b> <b>containers</b> are used, the pint can still be the principal unit used, otherwise metric units (usually the non-SI litre) must be used. There is no requirement for the litre quantity to be round numbers: thus the quantity of milk sold in a non-returnable container may be 1 pint, but will have [...] "568 ml 1 pint", or just [...] "568 ml" [...] on the label. Many recipes published in the UK and Ireland still give ingredient quantities in imperial, where the pint is often used as a unit for larger liquid quantities. The Guild of Food Writers recommends that new recipes be published in metric units.|$|R

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) is a contactless identification {{technology that}} {{has proven to}} work well in conjunction with reusable plastic containers (RPCs).

5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in <b>returnable</b> <b>containers,</b> and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Ifco trays (an {{acronym for}} {{international}} fruit container) are containers developed in Germany in 1992 which are primarily used in retail to hold {{fruit and vegetables}} and to transport fish. They are attractive for environmental reasons due to their ease of reuse, their capability of being stacked when full of produce in many different configurations {{and that they can}} be flattened when empty for compact return to producers/shippers/growers or for storage purposes. Their adoption has generated controversy between developed countries which are consumers of produce and developing countries which are producers, primarily due to the cost of using the trays as opposed to using locally produced containers. In particular, many developing countries lack the capital-intensive infrastructure to develop and support the hi-technology plastic molding machinery necessary to produce the returnable trays. Analysis continues to compare the relative benefits of reusable trays, which require a full cycle (use, cleaning and return) versus one-time-use disposable containers which do not require return to the shipper, but instead are disposed of after one use. Disposable containers create a waste-disposal burden on recipients while the <b>returnable</b> <b>containers</b> burden producers who must purchase containers and arrange for a return cycle.|$|R

The authors approach the papers topic from different perspectives, resulting in entirely different points of view and foci. However, within the frame of interdisciplinary collaboration, it gets apparent a common goal exists, to develop strategies and tools facilitating the work of decision makers in logistics. For this purpose one part addresses the management of <b>returnable</b> <b>containers</b> for the automotive industry. The other part describes the improvement of its automatic and reliable identification by means of {{the development of a new}} antenna concept for passive UHF transponders. The described antenna concept has primarily been developed for passive RFID transponders, but it may also be applied for active RFID transponders for increased performance concerning reading and writing ranges and reliability. Moreover, it is possible to utilise the required metallic surface (reflector) in a printing-based manufacturing process to be able to apply the RFID transponder antenna in a functional way to materials having high permittivity, if taken as an example. This can be done due to the fact that the electromagnetic waves coming from the transponder are emitted directional and therefore they enter the subjacent material in the back lobe area of the transponder antenna only slightly. Thus, the obstructive properties of the immediate vicinity are extremely minimised...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the signing}} of NAFTA in 1993, North American {{automotive}} OEMs have moved final assembly and other manufacturing operations from domestic locations to international locations. Mexico provides a relatively inexpensive labor force and is within geographic proximity of the US. Tier One suppliers have also relocated some operations to Mexico, such as American Axle & Manufacturing (AAM) and its Guanajuato Gear & Axle (GGA) facility, where this study was performed. While the proportion of GGA's inbound material sourced in Mexico has increased, this still represents {{a small fraction of}} GGA's supply base. Numerous efforts have been made at localization of suppliers to Mexico, both through existing suppliers relocating and the development of Mexico-based suppliers. For the suppliers remaining in the US and Canada, there are numerous possible transportation solutions, including FTL, stacktrain, LTL, and milkruns. The crux of this thesis lies in the hypothesis that GGA would be better able to optimize logistics, if it had the ability to choose mode and frequency on a real time basis after having a more precise understanding of inbound material flow. A case study was then performed on the optimal manner in which to ship empty <b>returnable</b> <b>containers</b> to suppliers, which is established to be per container demand at the supplier site. Then, a model is developed and tested that takes as input the forecast of raw material shipments from GGA's entire supply base and outputs a set of packing lists that minimizes logistics cost while meeting supplier demand for empty containers. (cont.) The model outputs are tested on a limited basis, but full implementation has not been conducted at the time of writing.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Strawberries are an {{extremely}} valuable crop, {{but they are}} also very sensitive to decay if not cooled and maintained at proper temperatures. Strawberries are typically packaged in the field and quickly transported to a cooling facility, where they are precooled by forcing cold air through the vents of the packaging. Over the last several years, there has been a shift in the packaging used for strawberries. Many of the open-top pint baskets have been replaced by clamshell designs with hinged lids and less vent area. In addition, there has been an increased retail demand for a larger tray that fits five trays to a pallet layer rather than six trays per layer. In this work, strawberries packaged in clamshell containers and a variety of tray designs were precooled in commercial cooling systems. To determine the speed of cooling for each treatment, both the 7 / 8 th cooling time and the cooling coefficient were calculated. It was found that the control package combination (with a design that fits six trays per pallet layer) cooled significantly faster than the other treatments, which fit five trays per pallet layer. It is thought that the cross-orientation of trays that occurs in the five trays per layer configuration may slow cooling if the vents are not designed properly. No major differences were found for cooling using corrugated trays versus <b>returnable</b> plastic <b>containers.</b> It was found that the clamshell container and tray should be designed together and chosen properly to allow maximum air-to-product contact during cooling. Variations in air temperature during commercial cooling tests may cause errors in determining 7 / 8 th cooling times...|$|R
