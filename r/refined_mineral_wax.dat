40|$|Abstract — Transformer is a soul of both {{transmission}} and distribution systems. It performs low voltage to high voltage conversion in transmission lines and similarly high voltage to low voltage conversion in distribution lines. The operation of transformer is decided by the cooling provided to the system. The efficient cooling method is achieved {{by the use of}} forced (or) natural oil cooling medium. The oils used for the purpose of coolants are the hydrocarbons of paraffin (or) naphtha based petroleum products. The oil is used as coolant is made from highly <b>refined</b> <b>mineral</b> oil and it has high dielectric strength. During the operation of transformer there occurs temperature variation in the oil which causes reduction in dielectric strength with emissions of dissolved gases like sulphur, moisture etc. The mineral oil used in existing system is the dominant material in use but therma...|$|R

In order to investigate such possible antioxidant activity, a testing protocol was developed in which oil samples were thermally aged {{in the presence of}} a controlled amount of oxygen, and the time-dependent hydroperoxide and keto functionality concentration was monitored. An indication of antioxidant activity was indeed found, and further experiments were undertaken in order to investigate whether this was caused by the main carotenoid found in carrots, beta-carotene. This was not found to be the case, and other possible explanations for the observed oxidative behavior, still to be investigated, are discussed...|$|R

This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the <b>refining</b> of <b>mineral</b> oil and gas covers certain industrial activities specified in Section 1. 2 of Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, namely the energy industries of the <b>refining</b> of <b>mineral</b> oil and gas sector. In particular, this document covers the following refineries processes and activities: -	Alkylation -	Base oil production -	Bitumen production -	Catalytic cracking -	Catalytic reforming -	Coking -	Cooling -	Desalting -	Combustion of refinery fuels for energy production -	Etherification -	Gas separation -	Hydrogen consuming processes -	Hydrogen production -	Isomerisation -	Natural gas plants -	Polymerisation -	Primary distillation -	Product treatments -	Storage and handling of refinery materials -	Visbreaking and other thermal conversions -	Waste gas treatment -	Waste water treatment -	Waste management. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the <b>refining</b> of <b>mineral</b> oil and gas sector are the emissions to air of volatile organic substances, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, hydrofluoric acid, ammonia, carbon monoxide, dioxins and furans, and dust; emissions to water of oils, benzene, suspended solids, COD, nitrogen, metals (lead, cadmium, nickel, mercury); energy efficiency; and the prevention of emissions to soil and groundwater. The BREF document contains seven chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the <b>refining</b> of <b>mineral</b> oil and gas industry and on the industrial processes and techniques used within this sector. Chapter 3 provides data and information concerning the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumption of raw materials, water and energy, and generation of waste. Chapter 4 describes the techniques to prevent or reduce emissions from installations in the sector. In Chapter 5 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the <b>refining</b> of <b>mineral</b> oil and gas industry.

5000|$|By early 1926, Pedersen had {{designed}} and built a prototype rifle. He had researched Army tactics and operational concepts, and had engineered the tooling for parts manufacture {{as an integral part}} of engineering the gun parts themselves. Such an application of sound research and development made a very strong impression on Army personnel when the rifle was presented for inspection and testing. The rifle was a solid, well-finished weapon, 44 inches (112 cm) long, weighing slightly over 8 pounds (3.6 kg). It utilized a disposable ten-round en bloc clip, a system favored at the time. Pedersen's rifle utilized a sophisticated up-breaking toggle-joint system like the Parabellum P.08 but improved by utilizing delayed blowback. This system was simple and free of both the fragility and severe kick of recoil operation, and the weight and complexity of gas operation (as in the Browning Automatic Rifle). To ease extraction, cartridge cases were coated in <b>mineral</b> <b>wax.</b> This left a thin film that was “hard, and durable, and was not sticky,”. [...] The waxed cases solved the issue of difficult extraction, but hindered acceptance of the Pedersen rifle because officials feared that the wax would attract dirt and cause operating failures.|$|R

50|$|Small {{dry-type}} and liquid-immersed transformers {{are often}} self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. Large transformers {{are filled with}} transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings. Transformer oil is a highly <b>refined</b> <b>mineral</b> oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that {{the average age of}} failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures. Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure. With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information. This underlines the need to monitor, model, forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying, possibly difficult, power loading conditions.|$|R
40|$|South Africa, as {{the owner}} of its minerals, {{introduced}} the charging of mineral royalties targeting economic rents in 2010. The new royalty also promotes further <b>mineral</b> processing (<b>refining)</b> by rewarding refiners with a reduced royalty payment. Such (fiscal) strategy would stimulate the country’s industrial and economic growth and development. This is in line with the main objectives of South Africa’s Mineral Policy framework and the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 2002 (MPRDA), which resulted in the promulgation of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty Act (MPRRA) in November 2008 for implementation on March 1, 2010. The MPRRA stipulates a dual ad valorem, sliding-scale formula method of charging royalties. This dual sliding-scale formula mechanism imposes no specific rate for any minerals. It is based on profitability and automatically recognizes downstream beneficiation of mineral products as it distinguishes between <b>refined</b> and unrefined <b>minerals.</b> The formula provisions for <b>refined</b> <b>minerals</b> allows for a reduction of the royalty rate as beneficiation increases in order to compensate for the higher sales value of refined products. This aligns with the government’s objective to promote local beneficiation of South Africa’s minerals for maximum economic benefit. The purpose of this research is to assess whether this beneficiation objective of the MPRRA would be achieved, thereby ensuring that miners become refiners. To realize this, the methodology used involved a review of beneficiation provisions of past and current mineral royalty systems of some mineral-rich countries. More specifically, applying the lessons from Bradley’s work on the Western Australia royalty system to the South African context; extraction of necessary data for a platinum case study; and analyses of the results. The study indicated that miners are unlikely to become refiners {{as a result of the}} MPRRA and that further research is required to achieve this national objective...|$|R
