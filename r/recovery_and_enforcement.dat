The Tax Reform Act significantly contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s that resulted in the Financial Institutions Reform, <b>Recovery</b> <b>and</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Act of 1989, which dramatically changed the savings and loan industry and its federal regulation, encouraging loan origination.|$|E

[...] Under the law, savings and loans (S) could no longer invest in bonds that were rated below investment grade. [...] Additionally, S were mandated to sell their holdings by the end of 1993 creating a huge supply of low priced assets that helped freeze the new issuance market.|$|E

The toughest financial reform bill in 50 years, FIRREA ended the abuses and reformed the savings and loan industry. FIRREA put controls on state-chartered thrifts, stopped excessive risk taking by savings and loans, limited brokered deposits, banned junk bond investments, and set new capital requirements for savings and loans.|$|R
40|$|Financal {{assurance}} rules, {{also known}} as financial responsibility or bonding requirements, foster cost internalization by requiring potential polluters to demonstrate the financial resources necessary to compensate for environmental damage that may arise in the future. Accordingly, assurance is an important complement to liability rules, restoration obligations, and other regulatory compliance requirements. The paper reviews the need for assurance, given the prevalence of abandoned environmental obligations, and assesses the implementation of assurance rules in the United States. From the standpoint of both legal effectiveness and economic efficiency, assurance rules can be improved. On the whole, however, cost <b>recovery,</b> deterrence, <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> are significantly improved {{by the presence of}} existing assurance regulations. financial assurance, financial responsibility, bonding, environmental insurance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the government has largely ignored economics in its recent attempts {{to deal with the}} deterioration of federally insured depository institutions. The most recent example was the Financial Institutions <b>Recovery,</b> Reform, <b>and</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Act (FIRREA) of 1989. Well documented and widely distributed studies have pointed out the decline of commercial banks. However, the FIRREA completely ignored commercial banks. The paper discusses the pervasive regulatory laxity and forbearance that existed toward banks during the 1980 s despite the consequences of similar regulatory behavior toward savings and loans. The paper also shows how the FIRREA's major provisions regarding savings and loans ignore economic analyses. The paper discusses the implications of economic analysis for more appropriate government responses to the continuing deterioration of depositories.

As {{the savings and loan}} crisis deepened, he turned to Mullins, now an {{assistant}} Secretary of the Treasury, to develop a plan to resolve the crisis. The plan was enacted by Congress on August 8, 1989 as FIRREA (The Financial Institutions Reform <b>Recovery</b> <b>and</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Act of 1989) which created the RTC to dispose of failed thrift assets. The RTC ultimately sold $394 billion in assets of 747 failed thrifts. This approach became a model for banking resolution plans in Sweden, Thailand and elsewhere. [...] Mullins remained popular with Congress and the President. [...] In 1989, Mullins was appointed by President Bush as assistant Secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance. [...] While at the Treasury, Mullins co-wrote a paper on high-yield debt defaults which received the inaugural Smith Breeden Prize.|$|E

50|$|While Part One was {{instrumental}} in re-designing day-to-day relationships between taxpayers and the state, it did not address specific taxes; thus, in 1999-2000 taxpayers still paid multiple taxes with the old rates. Part Two, implemented under Vladimir Putin (enacted in August 2000, effective January 1, 2001) promulgated a flat 13 percent personal income tax rate, and replaced various social contributions with a unified social tax (UST). In 2001 collection of personal income tax increased by 26 percent (adjusted for inflation).

2500|$|The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) {{had been}} created to insure {{deposits}} held by savings and loan institutions ("S", or [...] "thrifts"). [...] Because of a confluence of events, much of the S industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. [...] FSLIC's reserves were insufficient {{to pay off the}} depositors of all of the failing thrifts, and fell into insolvency. [...] FSLIC was abolished in August 1989 and replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). [...] On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision (credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration). The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, <b>Recovery</b> <b>and</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.|$|E
