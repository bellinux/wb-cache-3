50|$|The Arado E.340 was {{designed}} {{with a central}} fuselage containing all four crew members. The cockpit and rear compartment were glazed and pressurized. The Jumo engines and landing gear were mounted to the load-bearing wing centre-section. The tail of the aircraft was a unique design, where the tailplane did not connect the two booms but was cantilevered outwards instead, each similar to the asymmetric BV 141B booms and tail arrangement. Also similarly, this would have provided the rear gunner with a clear range of fire directly behind. The fuselage extended forwards beyond the engines, with the gunners situated behind the cockpit, ahead of the bomb bay and wing spars. The MG 151 cannon in {{the tail of the}} central fuselage would have been controlled with <b>remote</b> <b>aiming</b> through periscopes. There were also two remote-controlled Fernbedienbare Drehlafette FDL 131 13mm gun turrets to be placed above and below the fuselage.|$|E
5000|$|The fire-control {{system uses}} this data to compute a firing {{solution}} for the gunner. The ballistic solution generated ensures a hit percentage greater than 95 percent at nominal ranges. Either the commander or gunner can fire the main gun. Additionally, the Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) on the M1A2 {{can be used to}} locate targets and pass them on for the gunner to engage while the commander scans for new targets. In the event of a malfunction or damage to the primary sight system, the main and coaxial weapons can be manually aimed using a telescopic scope boresighted to the main gun known as the Gunner's Auxiliary Sight (GAS). The GAS has two interchangeable reticles; one for High-explosive anti-tank warhead and MPAT (MultiPurpose AntiTank) rounds and one for APFSDS and STAFF (Smart Target-Activated Fire and Forget) ammunition. Turret traverse and main gun elevation can be accomplished with manual handles and cranks {{in the event of a}} Fire Control System or Hydraulic System failure. The commander's M2HB [...]50 caliber machine gun on the M1 and M1A1 is aimed by a 3× magnification sight incorporated into the Commander's Weapon Station (CWS), while the M1A2 uses either the machine gun's own iron sights, or a <b>remote</b> <b>aiming</b> system such as the CROWS system when used as part of the TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit). The loader's M240 machine gun is aimed either with the built-in iron sights or with a thermal scope mounted on the machine gun.|$|E

50|$|Like other Wii {{games in}} the genre, Water Warfare uses the pointer {{function}} of the Wii <b>Remote</b> to <b>aim</b> and the Nunchuk to move. The game also supports the Wii Zapper and Classic Controller. Unlike other Wii games, the maps change at random every game. For example, a slide that is on a hill in one game would be somewhere else in another.|$|R

Flicking the nunchuk tosses Lara's grapple, and the Wii <b>remote's</b> pointer <b>aims</b> her weapons and flashlight. Also, Lara can speed up while swimming, shimmying, or climbing by quickly shaking the nunchuck. Finally, the adrenaline dodges are activated with motion gestures matching the in-game events (such as throwing a punch or diving out of harm's way).|$|R

50|$|Like other Wii {{games in}} the genre, Onslaught uses the pointer {{function}} of the Wii <b>Remote</b> to <b>aim</b> and the Nunchuk to move. Motion controls are also utilized with a throwing motion of the Nunchuk used to toss grenades and waggling of the Remote to reload. Motion controls are also used to wield a laser whip, and to wipe off insect blood which can blind and damage the player. Players can also issue simple orders to two squad mates who provide additional support, while some levels give the player the chance to pilot a heavily armed vehicle.|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpectral Umixing (SU) in hyperspectral <b>remote</b> sensing <b>aims</b> at {{recovering}} {{the signatures}} of the pure {{materials in the}} scene (endmem-bers) and their abundances in each pixel of the image. The usual SU chain does not take spectral variability (SV) into account, and relies on the estimation of the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the data, related {{to the number of}} endmembers (NOE) to use. However, the ID can be significantly overestimated in difficult scenarios, and sometimes does not correspond to the desired scale and application dependent NOE. Spurious endmembers are then frequently extracted and included in the model. We propose an algorithm for SU incorporating SV, using collaborative sparsity to discard the least explicative endmembers in the whole image. We compute an algorithmic regularization path for this problem to select the optimal set of endmembers using a statistical criterion. Results on simulated and real data show the interest of the approach...|$|R

50|$|Although {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original, there are notable differences between it and the Wii version. The first notable difference is that Frank now operates from out of the mall's security room, and that he advances the main plot of the game by completing missions given to him by Otis, Brad, and Jessie; others see him rescuing the various survivors of the outbreak. While players do not have a single countdown clock for the entire story, missions are individually timed, and Frank is not permitted to roam freely around the mall when on a mission. Another notable difference is that the game has a greater emphasis on gun-based gameplay than the original. Firearms are a completely redefined element of the game - not only do guns now have more ammunition to them, players now using an over-the-shoulder perspective with Frank with aiming, which is further aided through the use of the Wii <b>Remote</b> to <b>aim</b> where the gun is pointing.|$|R

Aboriginal people are the most disadvantaged group in Australia; have much poorer health and lower life expectancy than other Australians; and face many barriers to education and achievement, which are worse in isolated rural areas. One important barrier to educational participation and success is poor child health. OM is a generic term to cover a range of middle ear problems; left untreated, OM results in hearing loss.
