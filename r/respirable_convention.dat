40|$|Tokyo) {{has been}} widely used as a dust size {{classifier}} for a low-volume air sampler in Japan. The sampler uses the historical criterion defined by the British Medical Research Council (BMRC). However, a new sampling convention based on the ISO 7708 respirable dust convention was recently introduced into the Japanese standard for work environment measurement. It is necessary to modify the multi-channel static horizontal elutriator to satisfy the ISO 7708 <b>respirable</b> <b>convention.</b> We propose a modification of the horizontal elutriator, involving the shortening of 11 of the 36 plates to meet the ISO 7708 <b>respirable</b> <b>convention.</b> The relationship between aerosol particle size and penetration for the elutriator was measured in calm air. The measured penetrations were compared with the calculated performance of the sampler and with the sampling convention for the ISO respirable dust. The calculated bias of sampledmasses {{with respect to the}} ISO respirable mass was almost zero for the workplace aerosols...|$|E
40|$|The Health and Safety Laboratory has {{developed}} a miniature respirable sampler {{to gain a better}} understanding of the exposure of workers to hazardous substances when they are wearing respiratory protective equipment (RPE) or helmets with visors in the workplace. The study was in two parts and the first part, described herein, was to develop the sampler and test its collection characteristics. Assessment of the impact of the sampler on RPE safety and its comparability with traditional laboratory-based approaches to measure protection factors was discussed in a second article. The miniature sampler (weight- 5. 4 g, length- 13 mm) was designed to fit into the space available between the nose and chin of an individual inside a filtering facepiece type mask and has a radially omnidirectional inlet with a porous foam particle selector that allows the collection of the respirable fraction on a downstream filter. The sampling efficiency was compared with the <b>respirable</b> <b>convention.</b> A close match with the <b>respirable</b> <b>convention</b> was obtained at a flow rate of 1 l min(- 1) and the 50...|$|E
40|$|Aims of {{this study}} were to develop a respirable size-selective sampler for direct-on-filter (DoF) quartz {{measurement}} at the end-of-shift (EoS) using a portable Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and to determine its size-selective sampling performance. A new miniaturized sampler has been designed to have an effective particle deposition diameter close to the portable FTIR beam diameter (620 mm). The new sampler (named the EoS cyclone) was constructed using a 3 D printer. The sampling efficiency of the EoS cyclone was determined using polydisperse glass sphere particles and a time-of-flight direct reading instrument. Respirable dust mass concentration and quartz absorbance levels of samples collected with the EoS cyclone were compared to those collected with the 10 -mm nylon cyclone. The EoS cyclone operated at a flow rate of 1. 220 l min(- 1) showed minimum bias compared to the international standard <b>respirable</b> <b>convention.</b> The use of the EoS cyclone induced respirable dust mass concentration results similar but significantly larger (5...|$|E
40|$|International {{standards}} establish {{criteria for}} size-selective aerosol sampling for industrial hygiene. Commercially available aerosol samplers {{are designed to}} conform to these criteria. This study uses semi-monodispersed aerosols generated in a vertically aligned test chamber to compare the performance of three commercially available respirable dust samplers, one of which can, in addition, simultaneously sample for thoracic and inhalable dust fractions. Comparison methods are used to calculate a theoretical fractional value based on the appropriate sampling conventions of the total dust concentration and size distribution of test materials. Performance of actual samplers can be conducted by comparing observed results to the theoretical value. Results show {{the design of the}} test chamber and use of fused aluminum oxide is appropriate to conduct simplified performance verification tests for inhalable and respirable dust samplers. This study showed the TSI RespiCon followed the inhalable and <b>respirable</b> <b>conventions</b> closely, but results for the thoracic fraction required the use of a correction factor. The SKC aluminum cyclone tended to undersample the respirable fraction, while the BGI CAS 4 cyclone and the TSI RespiCon appear to most closely follow the convention. Improved selection of test material and characterization of particle sizes are recommended to further develop this method of performance verification...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{particulates}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} complex air pollutants and considerable concern surrounds their environmental impact especially with regards to human health. An investigation of the efficiency of various total inhalable and respirable dust samplers has been conducted to identify the most convenient way of collecting dust particles to examine their physical characteristics. The efficiency of a variety of dust samplers were investigated using limestone dust clouds generated inside an environmental dust chamber. Various sampling periods were employed to establish dust concentrations in the environmental dust chamber. The experimental dust cloud was found to contain on average 55. 74 % of respirable dust as defined by different instruments while a consistent dust concentration of approx 200 mg/m 3 was repeatedly produced. The methods for collecting and estimating airborne asbestos fibre concentrations were studied and found to be extremely limited. Standard optical techniques grossly underestimated both airborne fibre concentrations and respirable dimensions of fibres. The size and dimensions of respirable asbestos fibres are defined by their ability to gain access to the lungs and there is no instrument or technique available at present, which will allow collection and estimation of respirable fibrous dust clouds. A comparison of coal dust particles with similar particles retained in the lungs has shown a difference from the predicted respirable fractions as proposed by the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) and other <b>conventions.</b> <b>Respirable</b> dust sampling instruments may therefore be under sampling larger particles. The difficulty in estimating the characteristics of airborne particulate material has been demonstrated by illustrating urban particulate collection and analysis. The extremely large differences in terms of physical size, and aerodynamic properties of dust particles formed by different materials have been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial hygienists (ACGIH) {{lowered the}} {{threshold}} limit value (TLV) for respirable crystalline silica (RCS) exposure from 0. 05 to 0. 025 mg m− 3 in 2006. For a working environment with an airborne dust concentration near this lowered TLV, the sample collected with current standard respirable aerosol samplers might not provide enough RCS for quantitative analysis. Adopting high flow rate sampling devices for respirable dust containing silica may provide a sufficient amount of RCS to be above the limit of quantification even for samples collected for less than full shift. The performances of three high flow rate respirable samplers (CIP 10 -R, GK 2. 69, and FSP 10) have been evaluated in this study. Eleven different sizes of monodisperse aerosols of ammonium fluorescein were generated with a vibrating orifice aerosol generator in a calm air chamber {{in order to determine}} the sampling efficiency of each sampler. Aluminum oxide particles generated by a fluidized bed aerosol generator were used to test (i) the uniformity of a modified calm air chamber, (ii) the effect of loading on the sampling efficiency, and (iii) the performance of dust collection compared to lower flow rate cyclones in common use in the USA (10 -mm nylon and Higgins–Dewell cyclones). The coefficient of variation for eight simultaneous samples in the modified calm air chamber ranged from 1. 9 to 6. 1 % for triplicate measures of three different aerosols. The 50 % cutoff size (50 dae) of the high flow rate samplers operated at the flow rates recommended by manufacturers were determined as 4. 7, 4. 1, and 4. 8 μm for CIP 10 -R, GK 2. 69, and FSP 10, respectively. The mass concentration ratio of the high flow rate samplers to the low flow rate cyclones decreased with decreasing mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and high flow rate samplers collected more dust than low flow rate samplers by a range of 2 – 11 times based on gravimetric analysis. Dust loading inside the high flow rate samplers does not appear to affect the particle separation in either FSP 10 or GK 2. 69. The high flow rate samplers overestimated compared to the International Standards Organization/Comité Européen de Normalisation/ACGIH <b>respirable</b> <b>convention</b> [up to 40 % at large MMAD (27. 5 μm) ] and could provide overestimated exposure data with the current flow rates. However, both cyclones appeared to be able to provide relatively unbiased assessments of RCS when their flow rates were adjusted...|$|E
