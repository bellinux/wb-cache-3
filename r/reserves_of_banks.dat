50|$|In January 2011 Belarusians {{started to}} convert their savings from {{belarusian}} rubles to dollars and euros. The situation {{was influenced by}} rumors of possible devaluation of the ruble. Exchange rates in Belarus are centralized by the government-controlled National Bank of Belarus. The National Bank was forced to spend $1 billion of the foreign reserves to balance the supply and demand of currency On March 22 it stopped the support to banks. The National Bank also didn't change the exchange rate significantly (3,000 BYR per dollar on January 1 and 3,045 BYR on April 1), so the increased demand of dollars and euro exhausted cash <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks.</b> In April and May 2011 many people {{had to wait for}} several days in queues to buy dollars in the exchange booths. In April Belarusian banks were given informal permission of government to increase the exchange rate to 4,000 BYR for 1 dollar (later 4,500 BYR), but few people started to sell dollars and euro. On May 24 the ruble was officially devaluated by 36% (from 3,155 to 4,931 BYR per 1 dollar). But the shortage of the currency retained. As a result of the shortage, a black market of currency was created. In July 2011 the black market exchange rate was nearly 6,350 BYR per 1 dollar, in August it reached 9,000 BYR per 1 dollar.|$|E

The new era of monetary policy with interest rates at zero and quantitative easing programs {{raise questions about the}} effectiveness of central banking policy and their impact on the banking sector. I find that the zero lower bound reduces liquidity <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> and thus creates less credit supply. The T-LTRO program, developed by the European Central Bank, has helped to tackle this problem. However, the recently expanded asset purchase program reveals the opposite effect.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{recently}} proposed enhancements to the Basel II {{market risk}} framework.

We present an empirical evidence that such an extension of the regulatory capital is not optimal. Firstly, supplementing an unconditional methods of VaR estimation, i. e. normal parametric VaR and historical simulation, by SVaR only lead to unnecessarily high capital requirements even in a low volatile periods whilst the same amount of capital during the crisis could be achieved using either the conditional GARCH VaR with student's-t innovations or the volatility weighted historical simulation.

Cleaning up of the Bank Balance Sheets is essential and urgent to boost growth in coming years, independent loan review mechanism and sale of unproductive assets are some of the ways to arrest the rising NPAs. Since the quality of advances in India particularly the corporate stressed advances are quite poor and huge in comparison to other Asian Pacific emerging countries, if the NPAs are not managed properly there is every chance that the capital and <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> <b>Banks</b> shall not to able to meet the losses arising on account of write off of Bad Loans...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{primarily}} aims to test informational {{efficiency of}} the Turkish stock market with respect to daily changes in such variables as overnight interest rates, the US dollar, German mark, currency basket, free <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks,</b> currency in circulation, money supply aggregates defined as M 1 and M 2, reserve money, monetary base and central bank money. Semi-strong form efficiency is tested by using structural models in which each information variable is decomposed into its anticipated and unanticipated components by employing higher-order autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The paper reports significant deviations from efficient market hypothesis in the Turkish stock market for the period January 1989 to July 1995. The results of the paper have two major implications. First, domestic investors as well as foreign investors who hold approximately 25 % of total tradable shares in Turkey may benefit from the empirical results of the paper to develop profitable trading strategies since all information variables are low-cost and readily accessible. This result is of particular importance to the investors of the European Community (EC) due to the Customs Union Agreement, which has been effective on 1 January 1996, between Turkey and the EC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitative {{general equilibrium model}} with multiple monetary aggregates. The framework incorporates a banking sector and distinguishes between M 1, the monetary base, currency and various measures of reserves: total, excess and non borrowed. We use {{a variant of the}} model to analyze two sets of empirical facts. The first set of facts is that different monetary aggregates covary differently with short term nominal interest rates. Broad monetary aggregates like M 1 and the monetary base covary positively with current and future values of short term interest rates. In contrast, the non borrowed <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> covary negatively with current and future interest rates. Observations like this `sign switch' lie at the core of recent debates about the effects of monetary policy actions on short term interest rates. According to our model, the sign switch occurs because movements in non borrowed reserves are dominated by exogenous shocks to monetary policy, while movements in the base and M 1 are dominated by endogenous responses to non-policy shocks. The second set of facts that we consider is that broad monetary aggregates covary positively with output. We quantify the Friedman and Schwartz hypothesis that this covariation reflects the effects of exogenous shocks to monetary policy, and the hypothesis that they reflect the endogenous response of monetary aggregates to shocks in the private economy. ...|$|E
40|$|The zero {{lower bound}} on nominal {{interest}} rates {{can affect the}} effectiveness of monetary policy potentially in two ways. First, it limits {{the size of a}} change in the policy interest rate when trying to loosen money. For example, when the nominal rate is 0. 5 percent, it obviously cannot be cut by more than 0. 5 percent. Second, it may alter the mechanism of how a movement of the policy rate drives market rates of longer maturities. This paper is an attempt to investigate the latter issue, and, in particular, to empirically examine the effect of monetary policy on the term structure of interest rates when nominal short-term rates are close to zero, using Japanese data in the 1990 s and early 2000 s. We found that when the policy short rate is already zero but longer rates are still positive in the zero interest rate period, an expansionary monetary policy still works through the conventional interest rate channel by pushing down longer rates, although the effect is much weakened relative to the normal time. When the longer rates are already lowered to some level, however (for example, the 10 -year bond rate went down to the level as low as 1. 5 percent during the quantitative easing period of 2001 - 06), a further expansion of the monetary base by increasing excess <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> appears to have little effect in lowering longer-term rates.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the evolving role of reserve requirements {{as a policy}} tool in China. Since 2007, the Chinese central bank (PBC) has relied more on this tool to withdraw domestic liquidity surpluses, as a cheaper substitute for open-market operation instruments in this period of rapid FX accumulation. China’s reserve requirement system has also become more complex and been used to address a range of other policy objectives, not least being macroeconomic management, financial stability and credit policy. The preference for using reserve requirements reflects the size of China’s FX sterilisation task and the associated cost considerations, a quantity-oriented monetary policy framework challenged to reconcile policy dilemmas and tactical considerations. The PBC often finds it easier to reach consensus over reserve requirement decisions than interest rate decisions and enjoys greater discretion in applying this tool. The monetary effects of reserve requirements need to be explored {{in conjunction with other}} policy actions and not in isolation. Depending on the policy mix, higher reserve requirements tend to signal a tightening bias, to squeeze excess <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks,</b> to push market interest rates higher, and to help widen net interest spreads, thus tightening domestic monetary conditions. There are, however, costs to using this policy tool, as it imposes a tax burden on Chinese banks that in turn appear to have passed a significant portion of this cost onto their customers, mostly depositors and SMEs. However, the pass-through onto bank customers appears to be partial. reserve requirements; sterilisation tools; monetary policy; net interest margin and spread; tax incidence; Chinese economy...|$|E
