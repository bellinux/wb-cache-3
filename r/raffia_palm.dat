5|$|Banton has a {{primarily}} agricultural economy, with copra {{farming and}} fishing {{as the main}} sources of livelihood. There is also an indigenous <b>raffia</b> <b>palm</b> handicraft industry. Other crops grown in the island are root crops (such as cassava, sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables. The locals also engage in livestock raising for local consumption, and small-scale shipbuilding of wooden boats and launches.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{is thought}} to be already {{inhabited}} by Filipinos since the pre-colonial period, based on analysis of discovered human remains, coffins, an ancient burial cloth and other archaeological finds by the National Museum in the 1930s. The present settlement was founded in 1622 by the Spanish and is the oldest settlement in the province. During the American colonial period, the municipality changed its name to Jones in honor of American congressman William Jones, who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916. Today, Banton is one of Romblon's thriving municipalities, with an economy dependent on copra farming, fishing, <b>raffia</b> <b>palm</b> weaving, and tourism.|$|E
25|$|Tradition {{settlements}} in the Centre are placed along roads, resulting in large numbers of houses near the road with forest beginning directly behind them. The traditional house is a rectangular structure made of mud bricks and thin, wooden or bamboo posts. Roofs were mostly thatched <b>raffia</b> <b>palm</b> in the past, but they are more often made of corrugated aluminium, iron, or tin today.|$|E

This consists of grassfields—leading {{to the name}} Bamenda grassfields around the city of Bamenda—and short shrubs and trees that shed their foliage {{during the dry season}} as a defence against brush fires and dry weather. <b>Raffia</b> <b>palms</b> grow in the valleys and depressions.|$|R
25|$|In West Africa, the wet phase {{ushered in}} an {{expanding}} rainforest and wooded savanna from Senegal to Cameroon. Between 9000 and 5000 BC, Niger–Congo speakers domesticated the oil palm and <b>raffia</b> <b>palm.</b> Two seed plants, black-eyed peas and voandzeia (African groundnuts), were domesticated, followed by okra and kola nuts. Since {{most of the}} plants grew in the forest, the Niger–Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.|$|E

This is composed of mainly deep dark sea water (ohimiri). Ime ala is considered as the underworld. Ala in addition to embodying nature, is the cosmic base on which the vault of heaven, ígwé, rests. As the foundation of all existence, children's umbilical cords are saved and symbolically buried under a tree to mark the child's first sharing of family owned lands; this tree could either be an oil palm, bread-fruit tree, <b>raffia</b> <b>palm,</b> or plantain tree depending on the cultural region. In some places, such as Nri, the royal python, éké, is considered a sacred and tame agent of Ala and a harbinger of good fortune when found in a home. The python {{is referred to as}} nne 'mother' in areas where the python is revered, it is a symbol of female beauty and gentleness. Killing of the python is expressly forbidden in these places and sanctions are taken against the killer including the funding of expensive human sized burials that are given to slain pythons.|$|E

50|$|Fruit {{makes up}} {{a major portion}} of the agile mangabey diet. They are known to eat at least 42 {{different}} species of fruit. Their tooth structure and powerful jaws allows them to open tough pods and fruits that many other monkeys can not access. Agile mangabeys eat from a number of dominant swamp-forest trees, including dika nuts and sugar plums, when they are fruiting. They also eat fresh leaf shoots from <b>raffia</b> <b>palms</b> when fruits are scarce. Grasses and mushrooms, as well as insects, other invertebrates, bird's eggs and some vertebrate prey, such as rodents, are also eaten.|$|R

50|$|Mzima {{is one of}} Tsavo's {{most popular}} {{wildlife}} attractions owing to its resident populations of hippos and Nile crocodiles. Mzima's isolation makes both species are dependent on its waters: other sources are too distant for them to reach by overland travel. The hippos also sustain an entire food chain. They browse the surrounding savannah by night and return to Mzima's pools by day, where their dung fertilises the water. Fruiting trees such as date and <b>raffia</b> <b>palms,</b> waterberrys and figs grow beside the water, using their submerged roots to absorb nutrients. Their fruits {{are a source of}} food for vervet monkeys and a variety of birds. Below the water's surface, the invertebrates which feed on the hippo dung are preyed on by fish and cormorants.|$|R
50|$|In Africa, the sap used {{to create}} palm wine is most often taken from wild datepalms such as the silver date palm (Phoenix sylvestris), the palmyra, and the jaggery palm (Caryota urens), or from oil palm such as the African Oil Palm (Elaeis guineense) or from <b>Raffia</b> <b>palms,</b> kithul palms, or nipa palms. In part of central and western Democratic Republic of the Congo, palm wine is called malafu. Palm wine tapping is {{mentioned}} in the novel Things Fall Apart by the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe and {{is central to the}} plot of the novel The Palm Wine Drinkard by Nigerian author Amos Tutuola.Palm wine {{plays an important role in}} many ceremonies in parts of Nigeria such as among the Igbo (or Ibo) peoples, and elsewhere in central and western Africa. Guests at weddings, birth celebrations, and funeral wakes are served generous quantities. Palm wine is often infused with medicinal herbs to remedy a wide variety of physical complaints. As a token of respect to deceased ancestors, many drinking sessions begin with a small amount of palm wine spilled on the ground (Kulosa malafu in Kikongo ya Leta). Palm wine is enjoyed by men and women, although women usually drink it in less public venues.|$|R
50|$|In the {{breeding}} season this martin is found near rivers with the steep banks {{that are needed}} for the nest burrows. Suitable habitat occurs along lowland tropical rivers like the Congo or rivers with sandbanks in the highlands of Angola. The highland locations have wide grassy riverways running through miombo woodlands, whereas the Congo Basin is tropical forest with over 200 cm (80 in) of rain a year. The lowland habitats are a patchwork of dry, seasonally flooded and permanently wet woodland, and seasonally flooded savanna, and the swamp forests contain trees such as Symphonia globulifera, <b>raffia</b> <b>palms</b> and Mitragyna species, and the riverbanks are often lined with arrowroot. This martin seems {{to be able to}} adapt to open savanna habitats containing Hymenocardia acida, in which it will roost overnight when not breeding, and is therefore not heavily dependent on the neighbouring forests as long as the riverine breeding sites survive.|$|R
