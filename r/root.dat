5|$|<b>Root</b> {{extensions}} are additions {{of one or}} two sounds, often plosives, {{to the end of a}} <b>root.</b> These extensions do {{not seem}} to change the meaning of a <b>root,</b> and often lead to variant <b>root</b> forms across different descendants. The source and function of these extensions is not known.|$|E
5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering the <b>root</b> of a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within the <b>root</b> of the tooth and is thickest at the <b>root</b> apex. Its coloration is yellowish {{and it is}} softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is {{to serve as a}} medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the <b>root.</b> The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the <b>root</b> apex.|$|E
5|$|Fungi {{affecting}} the roots include Nectria radicicola (Cylindrocarpon destructans), {{a cause of}} <b>root</b> rot and Rosellinia necatrix causing white <b>root</b> rot, while others affect <b>root</b> and bulb, such as Aspergillus niger (black mold), and species of Trichoderma, including T. viride and T. harzianum (=T. narcissi) responsible for green mold.|$|E

5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed <b>root</b> is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms <b>root</b> and verbal <b>root</b> are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called <b>root</b> nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the meanings of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} infective juveniles (IJs) of Heterorhabditis megidis (strain NLH-E 87. 3) to cues from <b>roots</b> of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), thuja (Thuja occidentalis L.) and to larvae {{of the black}} vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus, was studied. Choice assays were conducted in an Y-tube olfactometer filled with moist sand. Infective juveniles were activated {{by the presence of}} intact <b>roots</b> of both strawberry and thuja plants. Some nematodes aggregated in the compartments with <b>roots</b> but most moved away from the <b>roots</b> to the opposite side. Given a choice, IJs showed a preference for strawberry <b>roots</b> above O. sulcatus larvae. No difference in preference was observed between thuja <b>roots</b> and O. sulcatus larvae. The combination of strawberry <b>roots</b> with vine weevil larvae was preferred above <b>roots</b> alone. In the assays with thuja <b>roots</b> and larvae versus thuja <b>roots</b> alone, however, IJs were stimulated to move but showed preference for the opposite compartment away from the arms with <b>roots</b> and larvae. Nematodes responded differently to mechanically damaged <b>roots</b> as opposed to <b>roots</b> damaged by vine weevil larvae. In assays with damaged thuja <b>roots,</b> IJs were most attracted by the <b>roots</b> damaged by larvae, whereas in the strawberry assays IJs showed a clear preference for the mechanically damaged <b>roots.</b> When challenged with a choice between strawberry and thuja <b>roots,</b> IJs moved preferentially to strawberry than to thuja <b>roots.</b> A preference for the combination of strawberry <b>roots</b> plus larvae over the thuja <b>roots</b> plus larvae was also observed...|$|R

40|$|Over the {{temperature}} range of 15 to 35 °C the highest phosphate absorption by proteoid <b>roots</b> occurred at 35 °C {{whereas in the}} case of ordinary <b>roots</b> absorption increased over the entire temperature range. Desorption revealed that a greater fraction of the absorbed phosphate in ordinary <b>roots</b> apparently occurs in the free space. Phosphate absorption, especially by proteoid <b>roots,</b> was increased by the addition of sugars. Proteoid <b>roots</b> were not consistently characterized by higher phosphate absorption than the ordinary <b>roots.</b> Sugars had no significant effect on oxygen uptake by both types of <b>roots,</b> but proteoid <b>roots</b> displayed a higher oxygen uptake than ordinary <b>roots.</b> The results indicate that proteoid <b>roots</b> are metabolically more active than ordinary <b>roots,</b> and that metabolic processes are to a greater extent involved in ion absorption by proteoid than by ordinary <b>roots...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the <b>root</b> node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the <b>root</b> and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the <b>root.</b> The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the <b>root</b> node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E
