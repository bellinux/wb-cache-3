In this paper, groundwater contribution to total runoff as a base flow index was estimated using hydrograph separation in six stream gauging stations in southwest of Iran. The major objective of this research is to distinguish the most suitable automated hydrograph separation and base flow estimation method.

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>filters</b> {{have found}} their way into many {{products}} from every day consumer items such as mobile phones to advanced maritime and military communications and avionics systems. Design of <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> faces two fundamental problems, their stability and synthesis. Recursive filters have more stability problems than nonrecursive filters. Stability of a filter can be determined by the location of the zero valued region of the denominator polynomial of its transfer function. Stability of recursive filters has been studied by many researchers for the past three decades. Several theorems on stability testing and stabilizing <b>recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> have been already proposed. We present a new approach to test the stability problem of the one-dimensional (1 -D) <b>recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> using Lagrange Multipliers.

40|$|Abstract—A {{major problem}} {{in the design of}} <b>recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> is stability. Although an {{unstable}} recursive filter obtained from a design algorithm can be stabilized by reciprocal substitution of the unstable factors of the filter without changing its amplitude response, this stabilization technique cannot be applied if phase response {{is a part of the}} design specifications. In this paper, we propose a new method for the design of <b>recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> with a prescribed stability margin by parameterizing all stable transfer functions and carrying out unconstrained optimization over this class of transfer functions. Three parameterization techniques are described, and closed-form formulas for the gradient functions and Hessian matrices of several typical objective functions are derived. The design technique is expected to be useful in the cases where both amplitude and phase specifications are required in the design.

The {{stability of the}} 2 -D recursive NSHP DAFs is guaranteed by using a spectral factorization-based algorithm. Then, the important characteristics regarding the proposed novel structure are discussed. The design problem of 2 -D <b>recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> using the novel structure is considered. We formulate the problem by forming an objective function consisting of the weighted sum of magnitude, group delay, and stability-related errors. A design technique using a trust-region Newton-conjugate gradient method {{in conjunction with the}} ana-lytic derivatives of the objective function is presented to efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem.

40|$|This study compares baseflow {{estimates}} using chemical mass balance, local minimum methods, and <b>recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> in {{the upper}} reaches of the Barwon River, southeast Australia. During the early stages of high-discharge events, the chemical mass balance overestimates groundwater inflows, probably due to flushing of saline water from wetlands and marshes, soils, or the unsaturated zone. Overall, however, estimates of baseflow from the local minimum and <b>recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> are higher than those based on chemical mass balance using Cl calculated from continuous electrical conductivity measurements. Between 2001 and 2011, the baseflow contribution to the upper Barwon River calculated using chemical mass balance is between 12 and 25 % of the annual discharge with a net baseflow contribution of 16 % of total discharge. <b>Recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> predict higher baseflow contributions of 19 to 52 % of discharge annually with a net baseflow contribution between 2001 and 2011 of 35 % of total discharge. These estimates are similar to those from the local minimum method (16 to 45 % of annual discharge and 26 % of total discharge). These differences most probably reflect how the different techniques characterise baseflow. The local minimum and <b>recursive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> probably aggregate much of the water from delayed sources as baseflow. However, as many delayed transient water stores (such as bank return flow, floodplain storage, or interflow) are likely to be geochemically similar to surface runoff, chemical mass balance calculations aggregate them with the surface runoff component. The difference between the estimates is greatest following periods of high discharge in winter, implying that these transient stores of water feed the river for several weeks to months at that time. Cl vs. discharge variations during individual flow events also demonstrate that inflows of high-salinity older water occurs on the rising limbs of hydrographs followed by inflows of low-salinity water from the transient stores as discharge falls.
