40|$|The Region Connection Calculus (RCC) is a {{well-known}} calculus for representing part-whole and topological relations. It {{plays an important role}} in qualitative spatial <b>reasoning,</b> <b>geographical</b> information science, and ontology. The computational complexity of reasoning with RCC 5 and RCC 8 (two fragments of RCC) as well as other qualitative spatial/temporal calculi has been investigated in depth in the literature. Most of these works focus on the consistency of qualitative constraint networks. In this paper, we consider the important problem of redundant qualitative constraints. For a set Γ of qualitative constraints, we say a constraint (x R y) in Γ is redundant if it is entailed by the rest of Γ. A prime subnetwork of Γ is a subset of Γ which contains no redundant constraints and has the same solution set as Γ. It is natural to ask how to compute such a prime subnetwork, and when it is unique. In this paper, we show that this problem is in general intractable, but becomes tractable if Γ is over a tractable subalgebra S of a qualitative calculus. Furthermore, if S is a subalgebra of RCC 5 or RCC 8 in which weak composition distributes over nonempty intersections, then Γ has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be obtained in cubic time by removing all redundant constraints simultaneously from Γ. As a byproduct, we show that any path-consistent network over such a distributive subalgebra is weakly globally consistent and minimal. A thorough empirical analysis of the prime subnetwork upon real geographical data sets demonstrates the approach is able to identify significantly more redundant constraints than previously proposed algorithms, especially in constraint networks with larger proportions of partial overlap relations.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>geographical</b> <b>reasoning</b> {{is essential in}} geographical education. Strategies developed by the English Thinking Through Geography group (TTG) offer a promising approach to promote <b>geographical</b> <b>reasoning.</b> In the last decade, the TTG approach has become a regular element in geographical education in several countries. Research suggests that teachers acquainted with TTG do not always {{take full advantage of}} the possibilities of these strategies. The adoption of the TTG approach is explored ten years after its introduction in the Netherlands. Findings are presented of a survey conducted among Dutch geography teachers (N = 307) about the significance they assign to <b>geographical</b> <b>reasoning</b> and their use of TTG assignments. The results suggest that teachers use TTG selectively and adapt TTG assignments to fit them into existing practices and beliefs about students and teaching geography. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{framework}} for a declarative approach to spatiotemporal <b>reasoning</b> on <b>geographical</b> data, based on the constraint logical language STACLP, which offers deductive and inductive capabilities. It can be exploited for a deductive rule-based approach to represent domain knowledge on data. Furthermore it is well suited to model trajectories of moving objects, which can be analysed by using inductive techniques, like clustering, {{in order to find}} common movement patterns. A sketch of a case study on behavioral ecology is presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for spatial event prediction that combines a value function approximation algorithm and case-based reasoning predictors. Each of these predictors makes unique contributions to the overall spatial event prediction. The function value approximation prediction is particularly suitable to <b>reasoning</b> with <b>geographical</b> features such as the (x,y) coordinates of an event. The case-based prediction is particularly well suited to deal with non-geographical features such {{as the time of}} the event or income level of the population. We claim that the combination of these two predictors results in a significant improvement of the accuracy in the spatial event prediction compared to pure geographically-based predictions. We support our claim by reporting on an ablation study for the prediction of improvised explosive device (IED) attacks...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} recognized that fuzzy set theory provides useful concepts and tools {{for both the}} representation {{and analysis of the}} uncertainty related to geographical data. Hence the incorporation of fuzzy set methodologies into a DBMS repository for the application domain of GIS should be beneficial and will improve its level of intelligence. Focusing in this area the paper addresses both a representation and a reasoning issue. Specifically, it extends a general spatial data model to deal with the uncertainty of geographical entities, and shows how the standard data interpretation operations available in GIS packages may be extended to support the fuzzy spatial <b>reasoning.</b> Representative <b>geographical</b> operations, such as the fuzzy overlay, fuzzy distance and fuzzy select, are examined, while several real world examples are given...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, photo context {{metadata}} (e. g., date, GPS coordinates) have been {{proved to be}} useful {{in the management of}} personal photos. However, these metadata are still poorly considered in photo retrieving systems. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose an approach to incorporate contextual metadata, in a keyword-based photo retrieval process. We use metadata about the photo shot context (address location, nearby objects, season, light status…) to generate a bag of words for indexing each photo. We extend the Vector Space Model in order to transform these shot context words into document-vector terms. In addition, spatial <b>reasoning</b> and <b>geographical</b> ontologies are used to infer new indexing terms. This facilitates the query-document matching process and also allows performing semantic comparison between the query terms and photo annotations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Noel Castree (2009) regrets that {{academic}} geographers let pass without much fuss, the sesquicentenary {{of the publication}} of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species. In part, this {{is the voice of}} Madison Avenue admonishing the sales team for missing a glorious promotional opportunity: `buy evolution, get geography free'. Castree has also a more serious point to make in remarking that Darwin used <b>geographical</b> <b>reasoning</b> to fundamentally alter the way people think about human life on earth. These issues still matter and Castree implies that the neglect of Darwin is part of geography's more general failure to engage critically with the sort of big-picture views of life on earth that could gain the discipline the popular attention it deserves...|$|R
40|$|This {{quarter was}} largely {{devoted to a}} {{detailed}} study of temperature data acquired by the Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES) on UARS. Our analysis used the same sequence of methods that have been developed, tested and refined on a more limited subset of temperature data acquired by the CRISTA instrument. We focused on a limited subset of our <b>reasoning</b> that <b>geographical</b> and vertical trends in the small-scale temperature variability could be compared with similar trends observed in November 1994 by the CRISTA-SPAS satellite. Results, backed up with hindcasts from the Mountain Wave Forecast Model (MWFM), reveal strong evidence of mountain waves, most persuasively in the Himalayas on 16 - 17 November, 1992. These CLAES results are coherent over the 30 - 50 km range and compare well with MWFM hindcasts for the same period. This constitutes, we believe, the first clear evidence that CLAES explicitly resolved long wavelength gravity waves in its CO 2 temperature channel. A series of other tasks, related to mesoscale modeling of mountain waves in CRISTA data and fitting of ground-based and HRDI data on global scales, were seen through to publication stage in peer-reviewed journals...|$|R
40|$|The spatial world {{consists}} of regions and relationships between regions. Examples of such relationships are that two regions are disjoint or {{that one is}} a proper part of the other. The formal specification of spatial relations {{is an important part}} of any formal ontology used in qualitative spatial <b>reasoning</b> or <b>geographical</b> information systems. Various schemes of relationships have been proposed and basic schemes have been extended to deal with vague regions, coarse regions, regions varying over time, and so on. The principal aim of this paper is not to propose further schemes, but to provide a uniform framework within which several existing schemes can be understood, and upon which further schemes can be constructed in a principled manner. This framework is based on the fundamental concepts of part and of complement. By varying these concepts, for example allowing a part-of relation taking values in a lattice of truth values beyond the two-valued Boolean case, we obtain a family of schemes of spatial relations. The viability of this approach to spatial relations as parameterized by the concepts of part and complement is demonstrated by showing how it encompasses the RCC 5 and RCC 8 schemes as well as the case of `egg-yolk regions'. The use of the approach for discrete regions is discussed briefly...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In {{order to be}} able to draw inferences about real world phenomena from a representation expressed in a digital computer, it is essential that the representation should have a rigorously correct algebraic structure. It is also desirable that the underlying algebra be familiar, and provide a close modelling of those phenomena. The fundamental problem addressed in this paper is that, since computers do not support real-number arithmetic, the algebraic behaviour of the representation may not be correct, and cannot directly model a mathematical abstraction of space based on real numbers. This paper describes a basis for the robust geometrical construction of spatial objects in computer applications using a complex called the “Regular Polytope”. In contrast to most other spatial data types, this definition supports a rigorous logic within a finite digital arithmetic. The definition of connectivity proves to be non-trivial, and alternatives are investigated. It is shown that these alternatives satisfy the relations of a region connection calculus (RCC) as used for qualitative spatial reasoning, and thus introduce the rigor of that <b>reasoning</b> to <b>geographical</b> information systems.

The paper evaluates the space and resources used by tourism {{as the basis for the}} introduction of the tourism eco-rent in the area of Makarska Riviera, a traditional tourism destination. It is divided into three main spatial units: urban areas, bathing zone (beaches), Biokovo Park of Nature.

40|$|There was a {{time when}} almost all Western {{geography}} could be termed environmental history. In the late nineteenth century, physical geographers explained landscapes by describing how they had evolved. Likewise, human geographers saw society as shaped by the directing hands of the environment. By the 1960 s this had very much changed. Process studies shortened the temporal framework in geographical explanation and cut the cord between nature and society. Now, physical and human landscapes were seen as responding to short-term fluctuations around a long-term steady state. Between the homeostatic systems of the geomorphologist and the isotropic surfaces of the economic geographer, {{there seemed to be no}} congress. For a number of reasons, environmental history now enjoys a renewed significance within human geography. I want to explore four sets of reasons why this is so. First, I will look at the continuing importance of an ecological tradition in geography that was always more than mere environmental determinism. In the second place, I will explore how <b>geographical</b> <b>reasoning</b> has continued to be of interest in what we might term big-picture histories. Thirdly, I want to consider how environmental history was treated within Marxist geography. Finally, I intend to consider how the New Cultural Geography has treated the subject. I will conclude by examining some studies that draw upon the best from these four approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is Polish {{discourse}} concerning the Eastern Partnership. The subject creates an opportunity to analyze security policy under current geopolitical conditions {{in the context of}} Poland's membership in the EU. Polish literature concerning eastern issues is dominated by classical geopolitical thinking and numerous references to grand narratives. Therefore, the study explores the critical geopolitics theoretical approach. The theory provides a tool for understanding how identity, security discourses and <b>geographical</b> <b>reasoning</b> are being constructed. Security issues, especially those concerning Russia, are in Polish literature and public debates discussed by means of political realism, i. e. a fight over dominance, a sense of threat, and the need of power maximization. The aim of this thesis is to analyze arguments, which are used in Poland to justify the development of the Eastern Partnership Project. Relying on extensive studies on Estonia's situation, I want to follow through correlations between geopolitics and identity and its influence on Poland's perception of Polish and European security. The aim of the thesis was to show the construction of threats in Poland. I will try to answer the question of whether Polish discourse is actually as uniform as it is seen outside Poland, i. e. whether it is only dominated by references to grand narratives and hostile rhetoric. The thesis applies the methodology of the Copenhagen School, which argues that by talking security an actor aims to move a topic away from conventional politics and legitimatize extraordinary means to be used against the constructed threat. The thesis examines how Poland securitizes and desecuritizes its relations with eastern neighbours and what are the consequences of such movements.
