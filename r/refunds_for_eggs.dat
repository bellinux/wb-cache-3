5000|$|OEM {{policies}} <b>for</b> <b>refunding</b> unused Windows licenses vary.

The same applies for EU, the reported refund as of 2014 is €40 for Windows 8. [...] Other vendors, like Dell, have ad hoc procedures for users to request a refund of a Windows license; one user who received a £55.23 refund from Dell said of the process, [...] "I was pretty gob-smacked {{that it was so}} easy". [...] In some cases, vendors have asked that customers requesting refunds sign non-disclosure agreements.

[...] Other vendors do not issue <b>refunds</b> <b>for</b> Windows licenses.

[...] According to a 1999 Maximum PC article, Dell did not provide <b>refunds</b> <b>for</b> Windows licenses, interpreting the license agreement to [...] "treat the hardware and software as a single package that must be returned". [...] In 2009, Sony refused to offer a partial <b>refund</b> <b>for</b> a customer who declined the Windows Vista EULA, instead offering a <b>refund</b> <b>for</b> the entire computer, which the consumer declined.|$|R
