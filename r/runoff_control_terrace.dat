40|$|Stormwater runoff poses serious {{environmental}} problems {{and public health}} issues in Rwanda, a tropical country that is increasingly suffering from severe floods, landslides, soil erosion and water pollution. Using the WetSpa Extension model, this study assessed the changes in rainfall runoff depth in Rwanda from 1990 to 2016 in response to precipitation and land use changes. Our results show that Rwanda has experienced a significant conversion of natural forest and grassland to cropland and built-up areas. During the period 1990 – 2016, 7090. 02 km 2 (64. 5 %) and 1715. 26 km 2 (32. 1 %) of forest and grassland covers were lost, respectively, while the cropland and built-up areas increased by 135. 3 % (8503. 75 km 2) and 304. 3 % (355. 02 km 2), respectively. According to our estimates, the land use change effect resulted in a national mean runoff depth increase of 2. 33 mm/year (0. 38 %). Although precipitation change affected the inter-annual fluctuation of runoff, the long-term trend of runoff was dominated by land use change. The top five districts that experienced the annual runoff depth increase (all > 3. 8 mm/year) are Rubavu, Nyabihu, Ngororero, Gakenke, and Musanze. Their annual runoff depths increased {{at a rate of}} > 3. 8 mm/year during the past 27 years, due to severe deforestation (ranging from 62 % to 85 %) and cropland expansion (ranging from 123 % to 293 %). These areas require high priority in <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> using <b>terracing</b> in croplands and rainwater harvesting systems such as dam/reservoirs, percolation tanks, storage tanks, etc. The wet season runoff was three times higher than the dry season runoff in Rwanda; appropriate rainwater management and reservation could provide valuable irrigation water for the dry season or drought years (late rainfall onsets or early rainfall cessations). It was estimated that a reservation of 30. 5 % (3. 99 km 3) of the runoff in the wet season could meet the cropland irrigation water gap during the dry season in 2016...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{computer}} model is developed {{to estimate the}} initial investment and annual operating costs of feedlot <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> systems. Costs are estimated for complete control systems consisting of a retention pond, settling basin, clean water diversion-runoff collection structures, disposal site, and an irrigation system. The model requires design inputs and cost inputs. Design inputs consist of: feedlot area, pumping rate, retention pond volume, disposal site area, and average pumping days per year. Cost inputs consist of market prices for system components and service costs. The model is used to estimate the initial investment and annual operating costs of <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> systems capable of complying with proposed Federal water pollution regulations for open beef feedlots. Design parameters for these systems are those developed by Wensink and Miner (1977). <b>Runoff</b> <b>control</b> costs are estimated for one, ten, and 100 acre feediots at seven U. S. locations. For the purpose of cost comparison, budgets are estimated for systems using: four different irrigation systems, 5 pumping rates, seven management alternatives, and two disposal policies. The resulting data are analyzed to determine how investment and operating costs were affected by the following seven criteria: pumping rate, feedlot size, geographic location, management alternative, disposal policy, irrigation system, and operator convenience. Estimated <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> costs are compared to current costs of producing fed beef.

Four different indicators are considered to provide a comprehensive assessment of the potential impacts: total runoff depth, event pollutant load, Event Mean Concentration, and peak concentration during a rainfall event. The results obtained indicate that urban runoff quantity and quality in the catchment have significant variations in rainfall events and a very high rate of non-compliance with surface water quality regulations. Three <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> schemes with the capacity to intercept an initial runoff depth of 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm are evaluated, respectively, and diminishing marginal benefits are found with increasing interception levels in terms of water quality improvement. The effects of seasonal variation in rainfall events are investigated to provide {{a better understanding of the}} performance of the <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> schemes.

40|$|To {{mitigate}} flood damage due to {{a recent}} increase in the frequency and magnitude of heavy rainfall events, the Kamihayashi district in Niigata prefecture, Japan, has undertaken flood mitigation measures using paddy fields by installing <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> devices in drainage boxes of paddy field plots. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the flood mitigation performance of the Paddy Field Dam project in terms of a decrease in discharge volume, drop in channel water level and reduction of inundation damage using combined hydrologic analyses and flood routing. The model constructed for runoff analysis is composed of three modules: a hilly/residential area module in which the overland flow is estimated using the kinematic wave method, a paddy field module in which runoff from paddy fields is calculated using water balance analysis, and a channel network module in which flood routing is performed using a one-dimensional unsteady flow model. The outputs of the first two modules are the input of the third module. The result of the simulation shows the main channel discharge decreased by 26 % and the water level dropped by 0. 17 m in the case of the largest observed rainfall event. The simulated effect was larger for larger rainfall events. In terms of flood water volume, the <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> devices have the effect of reducing the flood damage due to the 50 -year return period rainfall event to almost that due to the 10 -year return period rainfall event.

40|$|During recent years, most open feedlot {{operators}} {{have found}} it desirable and, in some cases, necessary to install <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> facilities. Even though {{the primary purpose of}} feedlot <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> systems is the prevention of water pollution, many producers have found that good management of these systems also offers limited economic benefits in the form of fertilizer nutrients and supplemental irrigation water. Well managed <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> systems also reduce weeds, odors, insects and muddy areas at or near feedlot edges. The <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> system that has proved most satisfactory for all areas of the country is one consisting of clean water diversion, runoff collection, a solids settling facility (or debris basin), a runoff holding pond and pond dewatering equipment (Figure l). Management consists of cleaning solids from the settling facility and pumping out the holding pond when necessary. The amount of labor required for proper management of <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> systems is not excessive, but this type task usually has a low priority in a general farming situation and, therefore, is often not accomplished when it should be. A lack of cattle lot maintenance can lead to undrained muddy areas and to nuisance conditions such as fly and odor problems. Such conditions have also been shown to decrease animal performance. If the settling basin is not cleaned when solids build-up reaches the design-full level, the outlet clogs and more solids carry through to the holding pond. Allowing solids to reach the holding pond reduces its capacity and shortens its useful life unless periodic sludge removal is practiced. Additionally, an excessive accumulation of solids and undrained liquids in the basin frequently results in odor and insect problems. Failure to pump out the holding pond on a timely basis may lead to overflows with dubsequent loss of crop nutrients, water pollution, and potentially to a lawsuit. Clean Water Diversion To minimize the amount of water which must be handled through a runoff-control system; diversion terraces, channels and roof gutters should be utilized and kept in good repair. Keeping clean water diverted away from feedlots decreases the quantity ofliquids to be separated in the settling basin and subsequently stored in the holding pond. Control of clean water effectively reduces the required size of the holding pond or can increase the time between dewatering operations. In· situations where clean water is to be collected for use as irrigation water, it should be diverted around the settling basin directly to the holding pond. Careful sizing and design of the holding pond is essential to ensure adequate capacity for storing both the diverted clean water and feedlot runoff. Runoff can be collected from feedlot areas and diverted to settling basins and holding ponds by using curbs, channels, terraces, pipes or combinations of these. All parts of the <b>runoff</b> <b>control</b> facilities need to be kept free of obstructions such as weeds, tree limbs, and accumulations of solids. Obstructions in runoff collection devices may cause overflows with resultant pollution or nuisance conditions due to unconfined feedlot runoff. Obstructions can also cause solids to settle in areas where removal may be difficult, or impossible. Routine moving and clean-up supplemented with periodic grading and shaping of earthen runoff collection devices will effectively minimize the development of erosive or low, soggy areas...|$|R

40|$|Numerous studies {{conducted}} on highway stormwater <b>runoff</b> and its <b>control</b> with Best Management Practices (BMPs) indicate that sediment {{is the major}} pollutant that affects performance and longevity of BMPs. Currently, there are several knowledge gaps related {{to the effects of}} sediments on highway BMPs: a) how much sediment will be generated by a construction site by a section of highway with its surrounding watershed under different conditions; b) how sediment is intercepted by different BMPs with or without pretreatment sections; and c) what are the effects of these sediments on BMPs’ hydraulic behavior, longevity, and pollutants removal or release. The objectives of this study are to: 1) develop models to predict both surface runoff and sediment yield from highway systems under different conditions; and 2) evaluate how to incorporate models into design and management of BMPs for highway <b>runoff</b> <b>control.</b> RUSLE 2 was used to estimate sediment yield for different settings (e. g., construction sites, different highway sections) under different environmental (e. g., soils, vegetation, slopes) and weather conditions (e. g., different rain events).

Several BMP designs were modeled at each of the highway sites to assess how the sediments would affect longevity of the BMP. Results indicate that BMPs reduce pollutants within channels.
