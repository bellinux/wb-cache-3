5000|$|Having {{identified}} a “relevantly similar situation” (para. 99), and emphasised that “differences based on sexual orientation require particularly serious reasons {{by way of}} justification” (para. 97), the Court should have found a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention because the <b>respondent</b> <b>Government</b> did not advance any argument to justify the difference of treatment, relying in this connection mainly on their margin of appreciation (para. 80). However, {{in the absence of}} any cogent reasons offered by the <b>respondent</b> <b>Government</b> to justify the difference of treatment, there should be no room to apply the margin of appreciation. Consequently, the “existence or non-existence of common ground between the laws of the Contracting States” (para. 98) is irrelevant as such considerations are only a subordinate basis for the application of the concept of the margin of appreciation. Indeed, it is only in the event that the national authorities offer grounds for justification that the Court can be satisfied, taking into account the presence or the absence of a common approach, that they are better placed than it is to deal effectively with the matter ...|$|E

Armenia was an {{international}} human rights case regarding the rights to property to Azeri nationals in the Nagorno-Karabakh region after the majority-Armenian region was occupied by liberating Armenian forces. The judgment of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights on the case originated in an application (no. 13216/05) against the Republic of Armenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by six Azerbaijani nationals on 6 April 2005.

From {{the point of}} view of the responsibility hypothesis, the inßuence of the local unemployment on the <b>respondent’s</b> <b>government</b> approval likelihood is somewhat confusing. During the right government the high local unemployment does not decrease respondent’s approval likelihood, but during the multi-party government it does. Obvious explanation comes from the Centre Party’s dominant position in the rural, high unemployment regions. Otherwise, we get results supporting the class dealignment, the importance of political orientation on government support, the increased likelihood of non-support if facing the risk of being less-well-off, and the positive attitude towards the government of the youngs amidst all the turbulence in the society...|$|R

40|$|While {{political}} scientists {{have become increasingly}} interested in the output of international courts, they have {{paid little attention to}} the manner by which these courts justify their decisions and develop legal norms. We address these issues through a network analysis of European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) citations. We argue that, like domestic review courts, the ECtHR uses its legal justifications at least in part to convince “lower” (domestic) courts of the legitimacy of its judgments. Several empirical observations are consistent with this view. First, country-specific factors do not determine the case-law on which the Court relies. Instead, it cites precedent based on the legal issues in the case. Second, the Court is more careful to embed judgments in its existing case law with respect to the more politically sensitive decisions. Third, the court embeds its judgments in case-law more when the <b>respondent</b> <b>government</b> is from a common law legal system where the courts traditionally rely more on similar justifications. In all, we conclude that the ECtHR by and large uses case law to justify its decisions {{in a way that is}} similar to domestic review courts. Finally, we highlight the utility of applying network analysis to further study the development of international legal norms...|$|E
40|$|This article elaborates upon ideas {{contributed to}} a {{symposium}} considering the possible shape of an Asia Pacific Community, including future trade arrangements within an Asia Pacific Community. It suggests some innovations in dispute settlement {{that could be considered}} for inclusion in such arrangements. The author suggests some innovative mechanisms by focussing on the way in which trade agreements and the dispute settlement mechanisms influence the internal political position of governments. The first mechanism would provide for a pre-quantification of the extent of retaliation that would be permitted should a complaint be successful. This mechanism would encourage respondent governments to focus earlier on weighing the potential loss of political support from exporters with any political support from import competing producers. The second mechanism would provide for free publication of an expert economic report on the economic welfare cost to the respondent of maintaining the protectionist measure subject to the complaint. This mechanism could increase the political weight attributed by the <b>respondent</b> <b>government</b> to the overall economic effects of the controversial measure. The paper further suggests that something similar to the second mechanism could be adopted as a separate transparency mechanism unrelated to dispute settlement. Such a mechanism might make it more likely that governments reform protectionist measures so as to avoiding the possibility of any legal dispute ever arising. An edited version of this paper is forthcoming in (2011) Australian International Law Journal (forthcoming February 2012...|$|E

40|$|Many {{political}} questions specifically {{deal with}} interactions between private actors, and private actors' purchasing {{decisions in the}} free market. Debate often arises when problems are created by free market forces. At this point, the public and government must decide whether under laissez faire capitalism the situation {{should be allowed to}} sort itself out or if the government should intervene to pursue a proposed solution. If a citizen believes that the government should take a laissez faire approach towards economic matters; it would reason that an individual could possibly hold similar views in regards to specific policy questions. The central question this research proposes is: can a survey <b>respondent's</b> support/opposition of <b>government</b> intervention into free markets be used as a predictor for support of specific policies? The authors of this research hypothesize that support/opposition for government intervention {{can be used as a}} predictor for an individual's support of specific policies. This argument can be tested using statistical analysis of existing opinion surveys that test both whether a <b>respondent</b> favors/opposes <b>government</b> intervention and whether a <b>respondent</b> favors/opposes certain <b>government</b> policies. The American National Election Survey from the 2012 election asks both of these sets of questions and provides a large survey sample size for statistical significance. Additionally, by running several case studies, we can solidify any proof or statistical significance that emerges.

40|$|For {{any given}} trade problem, states face a wide menu of options {{from which to}} select trade {{negotiation}} strategies. The trade regime complex includes a central multilateral regime, the World Trade Organization, and over three hundred preferential trade agreements at the bilateral or re-gional level. Other fora for discussing trade policies include the OECD and regional organizations. The resulting “Spaghetti bowl of trade agreements ” as noted by Alter and Meunier (this volume) has attracted much policy debate and research among economists about trade diversion and welfare effects (e. g. Bhagwati and Panagariya, 1996). Certainly {{there is no question}} that the proliferating sets of rules have added complexity for firms and customs officials who must navigate rules of origin and tariff levels that differ by agreement. Equally important is the effect of overlapping institutions for the politics of trade. This paper argues that overlapping institutions influence trade politics at three stages: selection of venue, negotiation of agreements, and enforcement of compliance. First, lobby groups and governments on both sides of a trade negotiation try to choose the set of rules that will favor their preferred outcome. WTO rules that restrict use of coercive tactics outside of the WTO, however, reduce the cost for <b>respondent</b> <b>governments</b> to stand firm against concessions at the bilatera...|$|R
40|$|In trade policy, the {{parallel}} {{process of creating}} regional trade associations, participating in the multilateral trade system, and concluding bilateral arrangements has resulted in overlapping jurisdictions. This forms {{an example of a}} “regime complex ” as defined by Raustiala and Victor (2004, 279) : “an array of partially overlapping and nonhierarchical institutions governing a partic-ular issue-area. ” Each institutional forum has different features regarding the level of legalization and the number of issues and actors. Yet many trade issues could conceivably come up in any of these negotiation fora. Indeed, the ability to choose among competing jurisdictions and use exit as a form of leverage represents a common feature in this style of governance (Hooghe and Marks, 2003). Lobby groups and governments on both sides of a trade negotiation try to choose the set of rules that will favor their preferred outcome. The selection process within the trade regime complex filters the most difficult trade disputes into WTO trade rounds or dispute adjudication, while easier trade problems are resolved in bi-lateral and regional venues. Export industries push their governments to address foreign trade barriers. Yet WTO rules that restrict use of coercive tactics outside of the WTO reduce the cost for <b>respondent</b> <b>governments</b> to stand firm against concessions at the bilateral level.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Almost {{a decade}} {{on from the}} New Zealand Primary Health Care Strategy and amidst {{concerns}} about funding of health promotion, we undertook a nationwide survey of health promotion providers. AIM: To identify trends in recruitment and turnover in New Zealand’s health promotion workforce. METHODS: Surveys were sent to 160 organisations identified as having a health focus and employing one or more health promoter. Respondents, primarily health promotion managers, were asked to report budget, retention and hiring data for 1 July 2009 through 1 July 2010. RESULTS: Responses were received from 53 % of organisations. Among <b>respondents,</b> <b>government</b> funding for health promotion declined by 6. 3 % in the year ended July 2010 and health promoter positions decreased by 7. 5 % (equalling 36. 6 full-time equivalent positions). Among staff who left their roles, 79 % also left {{the field of health}} promotion. Forty-two organisations (52 %) reported employing health promoters on time-limited contracts of three years or less; this employment arrangement was particularly common in public health units (80 %) and primary health organisations (57 %). Among new hires, 46 % (n= 55) were identified as Māori. DISCUSSION: Low retention of health promoters may reflect the common use of limited-term employment contracts, which allow employers to alter staffing levels as funding changes. More than half the surveyed primary health organisations reported using fixed-term employment contracts. This may compromise health promotion understanding, culture and institutional memory in these organisations. New Zealand’s commitment to addressing ethnic inequalities in health outcomes was evident in the high proportion of Māori who made up new hires...|$|R
