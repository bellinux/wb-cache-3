2500|$|Soil {{mechanics}} is {{a branch}} of soil physics and applied mechanics that describes the behavior of soils. It differs from fluid mechanics and solid mechanics {{in the sense that}} soils consist of a heterogeneous mixture of fluids (usually air and water) and particles (usually clay, silt, sand, and gravel) but soil may also contain organic solids and other matter. Along with <b>rock</b> <b>mechanics,</b> soil mechanics provides the theoretical basis for analysis in geotechnical engineering, a subdiscipline of civil engineering, and engineering geology, a subdiscipline of geology. Soil mechanics is used to analyze the deformations of and flow of fluids within natural and man-made structures that are supported on or made of soil, or structures that are buried in soils. Example applications are building and bridge foundations, retaining walls, dams, and buried pipeline systems. Principles of soil mechanics are also used in related disciplines such as engineering geology, geophysical engineering, coastal engineering, agricultural engineering, hydrology and soil physics.|$|E

The URM walls were assumed to span vertically between the ground and a flexible diaphragm or between two flexible diaphragms and to have developed a horizontal crack above the wall mid-height.

40|$|Uniaxial {{compressive}} strength (UCS) of intact rock {{is particularly important}} in <b>rock</b> <b>mechanic</b> studies, especially for those involving civil and mining projects. However, the determination of UCS using direct test is generally expensive, time consuming and almost impossible in preparation of samples for highly weathered sedimentary rocks. In view of this, indirect tests are comparatively cheap, simpler, faster and more convenient to perform either in laboratory or at site. This paper aims to develop an estimation procedure in determining the UCS values of such weak weathered rocks. Among the indirect tests present herein are point load index, Schmidt Rebound hammer, Brazilian tensile test and slake durability test.

40|$|Stress {{determination}} is a {{very important}} step in the assessment of the safety of existing reinforced concrete structures. In <b>rock</b> <b>mechanic</b> this goal is achieved with the over-coring technique. The main idea behind such a technique is to isolate a material sample from the stress field in the surrounding mass and monitor its re-equilibrium deformation response. If the materials remains elastic, and elastic properties are known, stresses may be obtained from the corresponding measured strains. The goal {{of this paper is to}} evaluate if the over-coring technique is applicable to reinforced concrete members. The results of an experimental investigation on the behaviour of compressed concrete columns subjected to the over-coring technique are presented. Considerations about the range of applicability of the technique are made by comparing the measured and the theoretical stresses. After that, results of failure tests on drilled specimens are presented and discussed. Furthermore, the response is compared with that of columns core-bored before the compressive test. Finally, comparisons with numerical analysis are shown...|$|R
