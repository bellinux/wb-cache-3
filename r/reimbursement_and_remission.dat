30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>remission</b> <b>and</b> biologic-free <b>remission</b> after orthopaedic surgery and related clinical factors in non-responder to infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We analyzed 74 patients who were treated with 3  mg/kg infliximab and methotrexate and underwent orthopaedic surgery after non-responder to infliximab with disease activity score (DAS) 28 (CRP) of ≥ 3.2. The rates of <b>remission</b> <b>and</b> biologic-free <b>remission</b> at 52  weeks after orthopaedic surgery were investigated and the clinical factors related to <b>remission</b> <b>and</b> biologic-free <b>remission</b> were analyzed by logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic analyses. The rates of total <b>remission</b> <b>and</b> biologic-free <b>remission</b> were 37 / 74 (50  %) and 9 / 74 (12.2  %), respectively. Regarding orthopaedic surgery, the rates of <b>remission</b> <b>and</b> biologic-free <b>remission</b> were 25 / 38 (65.8  %) and 7 / 38 (18.4  %) for synovectomy, 7 / 20 (35  %) and 0 / 20 (0  %) for arthroplasty, and 5 / 16 (31.3  %) and 2 / 16 12.5) for others including spine surgery and foot surgery. DAS 28 (CRP) at baseline was significantly related to both <b>remission</b> <b>and</b> biologic-free <b>remission.</b> Prednisolone was negatively associated with <b>remission,</b> <b>and</b> DAS 28 (CRP) was related to biologic-free remission by logistic regression analyses. DAS 28 (CRP) below 3.7 was cutoff point for acquiring biologic-free remission of non-responder to infliximab after orthopaedic surgery. Therefore orthopaedic surgery may be effective to obtain remission or biologic-free remission in RA patients treated with biologics.|$|R
