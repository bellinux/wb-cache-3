25|$|Many {{processes}} in a {{wastewater treatment plant}} are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes {{that occur in the}} environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall ecology of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Consequently, in cases where the <b>receiving</b> <b>environment</b> provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as phthalates that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water. In the US and EU, uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the US, see Clean Water Act.) A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.|$|E

An improved understanding of N isotope compositions in effluent will help assess treatment plant processes and performance and will help trace sources of excess nutrients in <b>receiving</b> <b>environments.</b> Here, we assess N budgets and treatment processes in seven wastewater treatment plants and wastewater stabilisation ponds in northern Australia based on concentrations and isotope ratios of N in effluent. We show that Î´ 15 N values in effluent are linked to treatment type, effectiveness of conversion of ammonia and levels of gaseous N emissions. These relationships suggest that N isotope monitoring of wastewater treatment plants and ponds can provide an integrated assessment of treatment performance and gaseous N emissions on a pond- or plant-wide scale that is not readily available through other methods. Our findings further imply that monitoring N isotope ratios in <b>receiving</b> <b>environments</b> cannot be assumed to be universally effective as their sensitivity to uptake of wastewater-derived N will vary with the characteristics of individual treatment systems. Paradoxically, N isotope monitoring is less effective where treatment systems are functioning poorly and where monitoring needs are the greatest...|$|R

30|$|In the future, the LoC concept will {{be useful}} as it opens up the ERA for the {{integration}} of protection goals and puts pressure on EU Member States to specify their environmental policy objectives.

In this context, it is important and needs further attention to recognise that there are various <b>receiving</b> <b>environments</b> across Europe which have their own specificities. If biodiversity levels can be clearly distinguished and protection goal priorities differ between these <b>receiving</b> <b>environments,</b> then this must be accounted for when defining what adverse environmental effects are acceptable, e.g. by the use of regionally adapted LoCs. This also implies that LoCs have to discriminate between species and ecological functions rather than using standardised threshold values across taxa and functions. In this context, species of conservation concern need a separate consideration acknowledging their outstanding role in the conservation of European biodiversity.|$|R
40|$|Australia is a {{generally}} dry continent that experiences highly variable rainfall. Since colonisation urban settlements have been regularly subjected to droughts, floods and water shortages. Rapid population growth with subsequent {{economic growth in}} industry and commerce resulted in dramatic increases in demand for water. The traditional approach to urban water supply largely focused on developing external water sources to meet growing water demands. Concurrently, urban stormwater and wastewater infrastructure is designed on a philosophy of rapid conveyance to <b>receiving</b> <b>environments</b> with reliance on "dilution" in those waters to assimilate wastes. These concepts have limited the capacity of upstream environments to meet urban water demand and of <b>receiving</b> <b>environments</b> to assimilate contaminant loads. As shown in this chapter, the 'big pipe' and 'end of pipe' solutions to water management are gradually being replaced by new integrated water cycle management approaches that aim to be more sustainable and may include small scale and decentralised infrastructure for managing the urban water streams.

50|$|The problems, however, are not {{confined}} to the creek - within the Meola Reef settling zone (in the Waitemata Harbour), both zinc and lead have exceeded alert levels, which means the benthic community (e.g., shellfish and other sediment-dwelling invertebrates) has been seriously impacted.

40|$|Abstract: This study aims {{to assess}} the {{environmental}} impact of wastewater discharges from FERMENCAM. Effluent and wastewater samples were collected respectively at the plant outlet and in the <b>receiving</b> <b>environment,</b> and physico-chemical analyses carried out revealed an organic pollution with a high pollution load that can be observed by phosphate levels in water at the plant outlet. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) is high at the plant outlet (20300 mg of O 2 / L) and 16200 mg of O 2 / L are found in the <b>receiving</b> <b>environment.</b> The BOD 5 /COD (chemical oxygen demand) ratio of effluents discharged by FERMENCAM and that of the <b>receiving</b> <b>environment</b> is 0. 90. This value is higher than 0. 5, meaning that the organic matter of both effluents is highly biodegradable. The results show that the increase in conductivity and decrease in total dissolved salts are due to an excessive mineralization of organic matters. The results show that the chlorophyll synthesis in Amaranthus viridis leaves is linked {{to the quality of the}} environment, and that is why such leaves can easily adapt to the polluted environment. In short, the wastewater impact on water quality of the <b>receiving</b> <b>environment</b> is evident, and these data will allow better environmental protection, thus promoting the development of various waterfront activities. In addition, the need for sustainable wastewater management (wastewater treatment plants, pre-treatment of industrial waters and sensitization) in the study area proves to be vital and urgent in order to improve wastewater qualit...|$|E
