5|$|Downtown, {{maintenance}} of NY10 shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the village}} at Mohawk Street. The highway remains locally owned for three blocks to Incinerator Road, where the route becomes state-maintained once more. During this stretch, NY10 intersects NY5S at Main Street. North of Incinerator Road, the route passes under the Thruway before crossing into the neighboring village of Palatine Bridge at {{the midpoint of the}} Mohawk River. On the northern riverbank, NY10 meets NY5 and overlaps the route westward for a block before continuing northward into the largely <b>rural</b> <b>town</b> of Palatine.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many sources}} have {{identified}} him as {{a native of the}} <b>rural</b> <b>town</b> of Bisacquino, where he was raised, he was actually born in the city of Palermo. His parents, Accursio Cascioferro and Santa Ippolito, were poor and illiterate. The family moved to Bisacquino when his father became a campiere (an armed guard) with the local landlord, Baron Antonino Inglese, a notorious usurper of state-owned land. The position of campiere often involved Mafiosi. According to other sources, at an early age, the family moved to Sambuca Zabut, where he lived for approximately 24 years before relocating to Bisacquino, his recognized power base in the Mafia.|$|E
5|$|Born January 9, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, Matt Bevin was {{the second}} of six {{children}} born to Avery and Louise Bevin.

His father worked at a wood mill, and his mother worked part-time in a hospital admissions department. The family raised livestock and grew much of their own food. At age 6, Bevin made money by packaging and selling seeds to his neighbors. He credits his involvement in 4-H, where he {{served as president of the}} local and county chapters and as a member of the state teen council, with developing his public speaking and leadership skills. He was also involved with the county's Dairy Club.|$|E
40|$|The place {{marketing}} {{concept is}} one of the popular concepts to analyze and promote countries, regions, cities and towns. The intensification of competition for investment, tourism and human resources among European cities and towns has increased the importance of being unique. Consequently this has opened up the field for specialists in marketing and branding in terms of geographic, social, economic, political, cultural and historical and ethno-cultural development. Most of studies on place marketing however focus on the unique selling points and brands of countries, the capitals and the big cities, while <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> need more marketing attention due to overcoming the lack of material and non-material resources in the towns. This is based on the idea of promotion to target markets of unique selling point of the <b>town.</b> These <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> have lots to offer 2 ?? unfortunately nobody have heard about them and the towns do not know what to promote! The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss to what extent the place marketing concept as a necessary condition for an effective promotion of 80 <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> in the seven northernmost regions in Sweden. Towns with more than 50, 000 inhabitants have been excluded from the analysis. The paper presents reasons for using the place marketing concept by <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> in Northern Sweden. Also it contains features of the place marketing concept and its key elements for <b>rural</b> <b>towns,</b> describes the target audience for <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> with their specific needs and wants. This is of outmost importance to these municipalities where a majority of them struggle with declining populations. The theoretical framework of this paper consists of marketing theory, the theory of place marketing, place branding and place development. The empirical material is based upon statistics on local economic development and population trends as well as information about the towns provided on their homepages. A qualitative research method, theory building, and comprehensive integrated approach to practices of place marketing for <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> is used in this paper. The study is giving recommendations for <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> 2 ?? government how to find its unique selling point and to start use the key elements of place marketing concept in more effective and systematic way...|$|R

5|$|During Muñoz Rivera's childhood, Barranquitas {{was a small}} <b>rural</b> <b>town.</b> The family's {{house was}} {{moderately}} large for the time; it was built with wood and its roof was made with zinc. When he was four, his mother home-schooled him with books from a private library owned by his father. By the age of ten, Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town's school, and finished first in his class. He was educated in Spanish and French, and took music classes with Jorge Colombani. His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction. Muñoz Rivera was a serious student with {{a strong interest in}} Miguel de Cervantes' works, in particular Don Quixote. Other authors that he studied include Fernando de Herrera, Tirso de Molina, Luis de Góngora, and Lope de Vega.|$|E
5|$|East of the mall, {{the route}} passes through {{increasingly}} rural areas, {{with the exception}} of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY250 and the Wayne County line. NY31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly <b>rural</b> <b>town</b> of Macedon to the village of the same name. Prior to exiting the village, NY31 meets the southern terminus of NY350 and the eastern terminus of NY31F. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In Palmyra, NY31 joins NY21 through the center of the village.|$|E
5|$|Frank Jonathan Morgan is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Alex Papps. Frank debuted on-screen in the serial's pilot episode {{and was the}} first character to appear. Frank is one of the five foster children of Pippa (Vanessa Downing) and Tom Fletcher (Roger Oakley) who move to Summer Bay to begin a new life. The serial's creator Alan Bateman thought of the idea while observing the locals of a <b>rural</b> <b>town</b> in New South Wales opposing the idea of foster children living in the area. Papps was cast into the role and immediately began receiving fan mail. Frank has been played by actors Bradley Pilato and Michael Scilusa during flashback sequences.|$|E

5|$|In {{the center}} of the hamlet, US9 and NY23 {{encounter}} a complex intersection that features a total of four routes. At the junction, US9 continues to the southwest while NY82 continues southeast along NY23's course. NY23, meanwhile, picks up US9's routing, overlapping with NY9H in a northerly direction that takes both highways across Taghkanic Creek and into the equally <b>rural</b> <b>town</b> of Claverack. The routes remain overlapped into the hamlet of Claverack, where NY23B comes in from the west and finishes its alternate loop of NY23. At the same junction, NY23 leaves the north–south NY9H to resume an eastwest alignment toward the Massachusetts state line.|$|E
5|$|Past Richburg, NY275 {{continues}} on a northeasterly track through the <b>rural</b> <b>town</b> of Wirt, {{running along the}} base of a narrow, largely undeveloped valley surrounding Little Genesee Creek as East Notch Road. The highway slowly increases in elevation for about , intersecting with the western terminus of CR8 (Inavale Road) and passing a handful of farms on its way toward East Notch, a gap between two large hills that serves as Little Genesee Creek's source. It eventually turns north to traverse the pass before winding its way down the opposite side. A short distance later, NY275 intersects with the northern terminus of CR8 as it curves to take a northwesterly track into the town of Friendship.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi {{is known}} from four places on Madagascar, all below 80m (260ft) altitude, of which two {{are on the}} west and two {{on the east side}} of the island. Among the eastern {{collection}} sites, Kianjavato is a <b>rural</b> <b>town</b> surrounded by farmland and secondary forests, where P.raceyi were collected while leaving a hollow in the concrete wall of a house and in a mistnet over a river, and Tampolo is in a heavily disturbed agriculturally used area. Both western localities, Kirindy and Mikea, are in dry forest. In Kirindy, the pipistrelle Hypsugo anchietae has also been recorded. The true distribution of P.raceyi is probably larger than that currently known. Nothing is known about the diet, but vespertilionid bats generally eat insects.|$|E

40|$|Rail {{transportation}} in Peninsular Malaysia {{is a popular}} transportation mode for locals {{to return to their}} hometown but is not frequently used as the mode of transport when travelling for holidays. <b>Rural</b> <b>towns</b> in Peninsular Malaysia have immense opportunity to be promoted as a popular tourism destination without the need of intense modern development. Using train rather than taking a car or a bus would endorse the concept of slowness during travel enabling tourists to enjoy the time taken to travel rather than rushing to travel to a destination. Encouragement of travelling by rail to the <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> will enable improved utilization of the existing rail network and further uplift the travel appeal to <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> in Peninsular Malaysia. In order to promote the concept of slow tourism that would benefit the rural towns’ sustainability, the perception of tourists on travelling slowly by train should first be understood and taken for consideration. A qualitative methodology of in depth interviews with domestic and international tourists whom have travel on trains to the <b>rural</b> <b>towns</b> will be conducted...|$|R

5|$|Monroe's early {{childhood}} was stable and happy. While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the <b>rural</b> <b>town</b> of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E
5|$|Mother {{begins with}} the story of a young, married, American couple who mysteriously vanish from their small, <b>rural</b> <b>town.</b> Two years later, the husband, George, {{returned}} as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again. Years later, in the late 1980s (dated specifically as 1988 in the Famicom version, but kept ambiguous in later releases), a young American boy named Ninten is attacked at home in a paranormal event. His father explains that Ninten's great-grandfather studied psychic powers, and asks Ninten to investigate a crisis occurring across the world, later revealed to be the work of an invading alien race. After finishing a few tasks, Ninten is warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them for her. Ninten returns to Earth and befriends a young boy, Lloyd, who is being teased at an elementary school. The two travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to Ana, a young girl with psychic powers. Ana tells Ninten she saw him in a dream, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.|$|E
