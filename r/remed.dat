The last group was maintained with aldosterone levels comparable to those in untreated <b>REM</b> rats by constant infusion of exogenous aldosterone. <b>REM</b> rats had larger adrenal glands and a > 10 -fold elevation in plasma aldosterone compared to SHAM. <b>REM</b> AIIA rats demonstrated significant suppression of the hyperaldosteronism as well as marked attenuation of proteinuria, hypertension, and glomerulosclerosis compared to <b>REM.</b> <b>REM</b> AIIA + ALDO rats manifested greater proteinuria, hypertension, and glomerulosclerosis than <b>REM</b> AIIA rats.

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about control of marine propellers. All ships and {{underwater}} vehicles, {{as well as}} an increasing number of offshore exploration and exploitation vessels, are controlled by proper action of their propulsion systems. For safe and cost effective operations, high performance vessel control systems are needed. To achieve this, all parts of the vessel control system, including both plant level and low-level control, must be addressed. However, limited attention has earlier been given to the effects of the propulsion system dynamics. The possible consequences of improper thruster control are: • Decreased closed-loop vessel performance due to inaccurate thrust production • Increased vessel down-time and maintenance cost due to unnecessary mechanical wear and tear. • Increased fuel consumption and risk of blackouts due to unpredictable power consumption.

Cytogenetic effects of D. glaucum on mitotic in roots of Vicia faba showed reduction in mitotic activity using three extracts; water, ethanol and ethyl acetate. Chromosomal abnormalities were recorded that included stickiness of chromosomes, chromatin bridge, fragments, lagging chromosome and micronuclei. Protein bands and RAPD analyses of V. faba treated with three D. glaucum extracts revealed some newly induced proteins and DNA fragments and other disappeared.

40|$|Abstract Background In humans, rapid eye {{movements}} (<b>REM)</b> density during <b>REM</b> sleep plays {{a prominent}} role in psychiatric diseases. Especially in depression, an increased <b>REM</b> density is a vulnerability marker for depression. In clinical practice and research measurement of <b>REM</b> density is highly standardized. In basic animal research, almost no tools are available to obtain and systematically evaluate eye movement data, although, this would create increased comparability between human and animal sleep studies. Methods We obtained standardized electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG) and electrooculographic (EOG) signals from freely behaving mice. EOG electrodes were bilaterally and chronically implanted with placement of the electrodes directly between the musculus rectus superior and musculus rectus lateralis. After recovery, EEG, EMG and EOG signals were obtained for four days. Subsequent to the implantation process, we developed and validated an Eye Movement scoring in Mice Algorithm (EMMA) to detect <b>REM</b> as singularities of the EOG signal, based on wavelet methodology. Results The distribution of wakefulness, non-REM (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (<b>REM)</b> sleep was typical of nocturnal rodents with small amounts of wakefulness and large amounts of NREM sleep during the light period and reversed proportions during the dark period. <b>REM</b> sleep was distributed correspondingly. <b>REM</b> density was significantly higher during <b>REM</b> sleep than NREM sleep. <b>REM</b> bursts were detected more often {{at the end of the}} dark period than the beginning of the light period. During <b>REM</b> sleep <b>REM</b> density showed an ultradian course, and during NREM sleep <b>REM</b> density peaked at the beginning of the dark period. Concerning individual eye movements, <b>REM</b> duration was longer and amplitude was lower during <b>REM</b> sleep than NREM sleep. The majority of single <b>REM</b> and <b>REM</b> bursts were associated with micro-arousals during NREM sleep, but not during <b>REM</b> sleep. Conclusions Sleep-stage specific distributions of <b>REM</b> in mice correspond to human <b>REM</b> density during sleep. <b>REM</b> density, now also assessable in animal models through our approach, is increased in humans after acute stress, during PTSD and in depression. This relationship can now be exploited to match animal models more closely to clinical situations, especially in animal models of depression. </p...|$|R
40|$|Each {{year in the}} United States 2. 5 {{million people}} sustain a {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), making TBI {{one of the leading}} causes of death and disability. Difficulty self-regulating behavior is considered a hallmark deficit of TBI and can impede positive rehabilitation outcomes. Traditional clinic-based assessments with TBI cohorts are often compromised due to inaccurate self-reporting caused by self-awareness and/or memory challenges. This project developed out of the need for more adequate and objective assessment methods of behavior after TBI. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify physiological states that may serve as real world, real-time prodromes of behavioral dysregulation when compared to direct behavioral observation during task performance. Adults with TBI (N= 14) were asked to complete a protocol of challenging, problem-solving tasks selected due to their potential to elicit negative responses believed to be indicative of dysregulation and result in task breakdown behaviors. Participants wore a portable biosensor band throughout the completion of all research tasks, which allowed for continuous physiological recordings of heart rate, breathing rate, and heart rate variability. Physiology was then synchronized with post hoc behavioral ratings conducted by trained clinicians from video recordings and analyzed through hierarchical linear mixed model methods to assess both between- and within-subject contribution related to the outcome.

We use this notion to characterize speech acts in terms of preconditions and effects. As an example we show how persuasion dialogues à la Walton & Krabbe can be analyzed in our framework. In particular we show how speech act preconditions constrain the possible sequences of speech acts...|$|E

40|$|Seventeen unmedicated {{patients}} with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 17 age- and sex-matched controls were recorded polygraphically for 3 consecutive nights. Rapid eye movements (<b>REMs),</b> m. mentalis twitches and sawtooth {{waves in the}} EEG were visually scored. <b>REM</b> and twitch densities during <b>REM</b> sleep were significantly higher in the patients than in the controls. The distribution pattern of <b>REMs</b> and twitches was altered in the patients: twitch density peaked in the first <b>REM</b> period and density of <b>REMs</b> showed an even distribution across all the <b>REM</b> periods of the night. In the controls both <b>REM</b> and twitch density increased from the first to the second <b>REM</b> period. We therefore assume that in the narcoleptics phasic activity of <b>REM</b> sleep is disinhibited. Densities of <b>REMs,</b> twitches and sawtooth waves did not correlate {{with one another in}} patients and controls. They appear to be independently regulated. The <b>REM</b> periods of the patients contained 3 times as many waking epochs as those of the controls. This suggests that in narcolepsy the transition REM/waking is selectively facilitated. The REM/NREM ratio of twitch and sawtooth wave densities was the same in patients and controls...|$|R
