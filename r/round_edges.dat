60|$|To {{appreciate}} the full truth of this passage, {{we must understand}} another effect peculiar to the rain-cloud, that its openings exhibit the purest blue which the sky ever shows. For, {{as we saw in}} the first chapter of this section, that aqueous vapor always turns the sky more or less gray, it follows that we never can see the azure so intense as when the greater part of this vapor has just fallen in rain. Then, and then only, pure blue sky becomes visible in the first openings, distinguished especially by {{the manner in which the}} clouds melt into it; their edges passing off in faint white threads and fringes, through which the blue shines more and more intensely, till the last trace of vapor is lost in its perfect color. It is only the upper white clouds, however, which do this, or the last fragments of rain-clouds, becoming white as they disappear, so that the blue is never corrupted by the cloud, but only paled and broken with pure white, the purest white which the sky ever shows. Thus we have a melting and palpitating color, never the same for two inches together, deepening and broadening here and there into intensity of perfect azure, then drifted and dying away through every tone of pure pale sky, into the snow white of the filmy cloud. Over this roll the determined edges of the rain-clouds, throwing it all far back, as a retired scene, into the upper sky. Of this effect the old masters, as far as I remember, have taken no cognizance whatsoever; all with them is, as we partially noticed before, either white cloud or pure blue: they have no notion of any double-dealing or middle measures. They bore a hole in the sky, and let you up into a pool of deep, stagnant blue, marked off by the clear <b>round</b> <b>edges</b> of imperturbable, impenetrable cloud on all sides--beautiful in positive color, but totally destitute of that exquisite gradation and change, that fleeting, panting, hesitating effort, with which the first glance of the natural sky is shed through the turbulence of the earth-storm.|$|E

50|$|Otoconia are {{crystals}} {{of calcium}} carbonate {{and make the}} otolithic membrane heavier than the structures and fluids surrounding it. The otoconia are composite crystallites that overlie the macular sensory epithelium of the gravity receptors of most vertebrates and are required for optimal stimulus input of linear acceleration and gravity. Fishes often have a single large crystal called an otolith, but otoconia from higher vertebrates have numerous crystals, and each apparently single crystal in fact has multiple crystallites that are composed of organic and inorganic components. Ultra-high resolution transmission electron microscopy of rat otoconia shows that the crystallites are 50-100 nm in diameter, have <b>round</b> <b>edges</b> and are highly ordered into laminae. Biomineralization of otoliths and otoconia results mainly from the release of soluble calcium ions, which is in turn precipitated as calcium carbonate crystals.|$|E

By reducing the number of daily trips needed to collect water, the WaterWheel allows women and children in developing countries to devote more time and energy to educational and economic activities. In addition, the WaterWheel is a sustainable solution for water transportation. It does not require any energy or other supplies in order to operate. It also does not require repairs over its 10-15 year life.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, a new coinage was {{introduced}} which omitted the British monarch's portrait, depicting instead The Armorial ensign of Ceylon. Coins issued were aluminium 1 and 2 cents, nickel brass 5 and 10 cents and cupro-nickel 25 and 50 cents and 1 rupee. These coins {{had the same}} shapes and sizes of the previous series but were composed of different materials. In 1976, commemorative seven-sided 2 rupee and ten-sided 5 rupee coins were introduced in limited numbers. In 1978, devaluation prompted aluminum to be the replacement of nickel-brass in the 5 and 10 cents, while shortly after 1 and 2 cents were discontinued. Cupro-nickel 2 rupees and aluminium-bronze 5 rupees coins were introduced in 1984 fully replacing the corresponding banknotes. In 1987, commemorative 10 rupees were released which like the 5 cent coin was square with <b>round</b> <b>edges.</b> In 1998 a bimetallic commemorative 10 rupee coin was released. Like earlier forerunner rupee denominations, these were again only issued in limited supply, not intended to replace the corresponding banknotes.|$|E

The results showed that the hybrid drying could effectively prevent the occurrence of both surface checks and internal checks in the hinoki boxed-heart timber with <b>round</b> <b>edges.</b> Moreover, the hybrid drying time was significantly shortened to 15 hours. The combination of RF heating at the stage of HT/LH treatment resulted in at least following beneficial consequences: reduction of the surface temperature decreasing, attenuation of the tensile stress, promotion of the internal drying, relaxation of the moisture gradient, and inhibition on the extreme drying stress. Therefore, a wood drying strategy with high speed, free of both surface and internal checks could be realized through hybrid drying...|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{adhesive}} response of polymer surfaces structured with arrays of cylindrical fibrils having diameters of 10 – 20 µm and aspect ratios 1 – 2. 4. Fibrils had two different tip shapes of end-flaps and <b>round</b> <b>edges.</b> A preload-induced mechanical buckling instability of the fibrils {{was used to}} switch between the states of adhesion and non-adhesion. Non-adhesion in fibrils with <b>round</b> <b>edges</b> was reached at preloads that caused fibril buckling, whereas fibrils with end-flaps showed adhesion loss only at very high preloads. The round edge acted as a circumferential flaw prohibiting smooth tip contact recovery leading to an adhesion loss. In situ observations showed that, after reversal of buckling, the end-flaps unfold and re-form contact under prevailing compressive stress, retaining adhesion in spite of buckling. At very high preloads, however, end-flaps are unable to re-form contact resulting in adhesion loss. Additionally, the end-flaps showed varying contact adaptability {{as a function of}} the fibril–probe alignment, which further affects the preload for adhesion loss. The combined influence of preload, tip shape and alignment on adhesion can be used to switch adhesion in bioinspired fibrillar array...|$|E
30|$|Cross {{sections}} of polished rice grains were observed with {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The images revealed that sug- 1 and sug-h mutants had loosely packed, abnormal starch granules in the cutting plane compared with the densely packed granules in wild-type polished grains. The sug-h endosperm had starch granule packing that was intermediate between that of sug- 1 and the wild type (Fig. 1 j-o). Starch granules in sug- 1 and sug-h mutants also displayed irregular shapes with <b>round</b> <b>edges,</b> whereas those in the wild type displayed polygonal shapes with sharp edges (Fig. 1 p-r).

30|$|Irregular {{surfaces}} and <b>round</b> <b>edges</b> of non-spherical nanoparticles possess more surface area than spherical particles with smooth surfaces. Hence the binding capacity of these particles to cancerous cells and tissues will be enhanced {{due to their}} surface area and extended residence times in vivo [38]. The rearrangement and aggregation of the smaller particles results in anisotropic triangular structures. The fabrication of anisotropic nanoparticles can be facilitated by the low rate of reduction, room temperature and sometimes with slight modifications in the temperature. This nanostructure remains no longer as triangular nanoprisms, when significant rounding occurs and gets transformed into nanodisks or hexagonal nanoprisms. Due to their aforesaid reasons, different shapes of gold nanoparticles using K. foetidissima extracts obtained {{in this study is}} justified.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} rising demand of {{electronic}} systems with functional density for industrial and automotive applications. Those components, which are typically manufactured by overmoulding blanked metal inserts within an assembly injection process, are often exposed to rough operating conditions. Especially penetrating water {{can lead to}} a severe damage of electronic systems which are often crucial to safety. Leakage can be caused among other things by crack initiation within the polymer at sharp edges of the metal insert as a consequence of stress concentration. In order to reduce stress concentration the effect of metal inserts with <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> and the forming process to manufacture such inserts is investigated. Since typical sheet thicknesses for electronic components are 1 [*]mm and less the dimensions of the <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> are on the scale of micro features.
