40|$|Wavelength {{scanning}} interferometry (WSI) is {{a technique}} for measuring surface topography {{that is capable of}} <b>resolving</b> <b>step</b> discontinuities and does not require any mechanical movement of the apparatus or measurand, allowing measurement times to be reduced substantially in comparison to related techniques. The axial (height) resolution and measurement range in WSI depends in part on the algorithm used to evaluate the spectral interferograms. Previously reported Fourier transform based methods have a number of limitations which is in part due to the short data lengths obtained. This paper compares the performance auto-regressive model based techniques for frequency estimation in WSI. Specifically, the Burg method is compared with established Fourier transform based approaches using both simulation and experimental data taken from a WSI measurement of a step-height sample...|$|E

In the former two steps, a PD- 10 column and 50  mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) were used as the chromatography device and the elution buffer in a gravity flow mode, respectively. In the first <b>resolving</b> <b>step,</b> a 2.5  ml each aliquot of the quenched conjugation reaction mixture {{was applied to the}} column and one ml each fraction was collected into the reservoirs. The early five fractions starting from the second fraction eluted as clear yellow solutions, which showed weaker fluorescence than the seventh and the following fractions emitting much stronger lemon-yellow fluorescence. Only the four elution fractions (from the second to the fifth fraction) containing the conjugated protein were combined together (total volume 22  ml) and concentrated to approximately 4.0  ml using an Amicon Ultra 15 (MWCO: 10  kDa) device. Then, a 2.0  ml each aliquot was subjected to the second <b>resolving</b> <b>step</b> using a PD- 10 column for the purpose of removing the low-molecular weight contaminants completely. At this stage, the yield of recovered protein was 5.3  mg in 7.0  ml solution. This sample was used for the final purification step by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (used column: Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL, bed dimensions: 10  ×  300  mm, bed volume: approximately 24  ml). In this step, 50  mM Tris-hydrochloride containing 150  mM sodium chloride (pH 7.5) was employed as the elution buffer. The flow rate was set to 0.5  ml/min and a 230  μl each aliquot of the sample was applied to the column for an individual run. Two significant peaks at identical positions were detected by the measurement of absorbance at both 280 and 495  nm, and each peak fractions were collected independently. After concentration using an Amicon Ultra 4 (or 15) centrifugation device (MWCO: 10  kDa), the collected samples were subjected to examine the content by a SDS-PAGE analysis. The same sample was also examined in the complex formation experiments with human Fas receptor extracellular domain—human IgG 1 Fc domain (hFasRECD-Fc) using immunoprecipitaion and size-exclusion chromatography analyses.|$|E
40|$|Peroxiredoxins (Prx) {{are central}} {{elements}} of the antioxidant defense system and the dithiol-disulfide redox regulatory network of the plant and cyanobacterial cell. They employ a thiol-based catalytic mechanism to reduce H 2 O 2, alkylhydroperoxide, and peroxinitrite. In plants and cyanobacteria, there exist 2 -CysPrx, 1 -CysPrx, PrxQ, and type II Prx. Higher plants typically contain at least one plastid 2 -CysPrx, one nucleo-cytoplasmic 1 -CysPrx, one chloroplast PrxQ, and one each of cytosolic, mitochondrial, and plastidic type II Prx. Cyanobacteria express variable sets of three or more Prxs. The catalytic cycle consists of three steps: (i) peroxidative reduction, (ii) <b>resolving</b> <b>step,</b> and (iii) regeneration using diverse electron donors such as thioredoxins, glutaredoxins, cyclophilins, glutathione, and ascorbic acid. Prx proteins undergo major conformational changes in dependence of their redox state. Thus, they not only modulate cellular reactive oxygen species- and reactive nitrogen species-dependent signaling, but depending on the Prx type they sense the redox state, transmit redox information to binding partners, and function as chaperone. They serve in context of photosynthesis and respiration, but also in metabolism and development of all tissues, for example, in nodules as well as during seed and fruit development. The article surveys the current literature and attempts a mostly comprehensive coverage of present day knowledge and concepts on Prx mechanism, regulation, and function and thus on the whole Prx systems in plants.

Terraces of the GaAs(2 5 11) surface {{are separated by}} steps along three characteristic directions [3 1 (1) over bar], [4 5 (3) over bar], and [2 (3) over bar 1] which are equivalent to the intersections of the (0 1 1) (I I 3) A. and (I I I) A planes with the (2 5 11) plane, respectively. On the basis of atomically <b>resolved</b> <b>step</b> images, step models were developed and analyzed with help of the electron counting rule (ECR).

The dwells on each pause were distributed nonexponentially, consistent {{with two or three}} rounds of dTTP hydrolysis before each unwinding step. Moreover, we observed backward movements of the enzyme on GC-rich DNAs at low dTTP concentrations.

40|$|The {{trend towards}} managed care health is unmistakable. In 1992, 48 % of all {{health care plans}} were {{classified}} as managed care. The figure rose to 70 % in 1995 (Glazer, 1996), a growth of 46 % in only three years.
