50|$|Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army {{was first}} {{revealed}} in July 2005 in {{an issue of}} Famitsu under the provisional title Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha. The game's choice of subtitle styling was so that the Raidou Kuzunoha games could be distinguished {{from the rest of}} the Devil Summoner series. It was also a reference to and emulation of the novels of Japanese author Edogawa Ranpo. It was first show off in the West at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The game's localization was handled by Atlus USA, and led by <b>regular</b> <b>project</b> leader Yu Namba. As with previous localization works, the team stayed as close as possible to the original text, although some adjustments needed to be made such as a Japanese song being changed to a more recognisable English one, and the removal of a mahjong minigame due to the total lack of a tutorial and its minor player benefits. Something unique to the localized version was the incorporation of 1920s slang into character dialogue. In Europe, the game was published by Koei. The two Raidou Kuzunoha titles received limited reprints in 2012 to commemorate the release of the 3DS port of Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers and give new players a chance to experience earlier entries in the Devil Summoner series. It was explained at the time that their release on PlayStation Network (PSN) was being delayed due to the software the Devil Summoner games were created for being incompatible with the then-current version of PSN. Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army eventually released on PSN on April 1, 2014.|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIn this paper, {{we study}} the well-posedness and {{stability}} analysis of set-valued Lur'e dynamical systems in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The existence and uniqueness results are established under the so-called passivity condition. Our approach uses a regularization procedure for the term involving the maximal monotone operator. The Lyapunov stability {{as well as}} the invariance properties are considered in detail. In addition, we give some sufficient conditions ensuring the robust stability of the system in finite-dimensional spaces. The theoretical developments are illustrated by means of two examples dealing with nonregular electrical circuits and an other one in partial differential equations. Our methodology is based on tools from set-valued and variational analysis. Fondecyt <b>Regular</b> <b>Project</b> 	 1151003; Fondecyt Project 	 315033...|$|E
