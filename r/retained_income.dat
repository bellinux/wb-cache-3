This is because the CMUCPP model is generally viewed by accountants as a 1970s failed inflation accounting model that requires all non-monetary items - variable real value non-monetary items and constant real value non-monetary items - to be inflation-adjusted by means of the Consumer Price Index.|$|E

The effect of the relative price change is called the substitution effect, while the effect due to income having been freed up is called the income effect.|$|E

50|$|CMUCPP was {{authorized}} in IFRS in the IASB's original Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par. 104 (a) in 1989. In {{terms of the}} original Framework, (1989) Par 104 (a) accountants choose CMUCPP to implement a financial capital concept of invested purchasing power, i.e. financial CMUCPP {{at all levels of}} inflation and deflation instead of the traditional HC concept of invested money. They thus implement a CPP financial capital maintenance concept by measuring financial capital maintenance in units of CPP instead of traditional HC nominal monetary units and they implement a CPP profit/loss determination concept in units of CPP instead of in real value eroding nominal monetary units under HCA. Examples of constant items are issued share capital, <b>retained</b> <b>income,</b> capital reserves, all other items in shareholders´ equity, trade debtors, trade creditors, provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities, all other non-monetary payables, all other non-monetary receivables, salaries, wages, rentals, all other items in the income statement, etc. Examples of variable items are property, plant, equipment, listed and unlisted shares, inventory, foreign exchange, etc. Variable items are valued in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) at for example fair value, market value, recoverable value, present value, net realizable value, etc. or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) during non-hyperinflationary periods.|$|E
40|$|They would {{possibly}} be less contentious {{if there was}} conclusive proof that managers were better allocators of capital generated through income retained than investors. Against this backdrop, this study examines {{the question of whether}} correlations exist between the amount of income retained by managers to fund capital and various financial management and investment performance metrics. The objective of the study is to test various hypotheses for relationships between the retention ratio and various management and investment performance metrics. The hypotheses includes testing whether dividends are a significant contributor to investor returns, whether there is a correlation between the retention ratio and the share price, between the retention ratio and total investor returns and between the retention ratio and return on equity. A last hypothesis is to test whether there is a correlation between total returns to investors and return on equity. The results of the study did not support any of the hypotheses and the indication is that no firm or clear relationship between the retention ratio and various performance metrics exists for the sample of South African firms over the survey period, namely share price, total investor returns and return on equity. The study could therefore not conclude whether managers were either good or poor allocators of capital generated through income retained. The study could also not determine whether capital retained did impact on future performance measures of a company or not. This outcome of the study was surprising. It was anticipated that there would be either positive correlations supporting managers’ ability to allocate <b>retained</b> <b>income</b> or negative correlations refuting managers’ ability to allocated <b>retained</b> <b>income.</b> This, however, was not evident. The literature reviewed was clear regarding the mystery surrounding dividend distributions and its role within iii corporate finance, but was divided on the drivers of the behaviour. It was hoped that this study {{would have been able to}} provide some explanation for dividends in a South African mining industry context. The reasons for the outcome are varied but include the questionable credibility of the data with regards to the size of the sample and the period of study. Therefore, no certain conclusions could be made about managers’ ability to allocate capital generated through <b>retained</b> <b>income</b> and the recommendation is for further research to be conducted with a larger sample over a longer period of study before the results are given undue significance.

40|$|The {{classical}} system of taxation, whereby companies are taxed without a deduction for dividends paid and shareholders are taxed on their dividend receipts, results in double taxation of dividends. Split rate and imputation {{systems have been}} developed {{in an attempt to}} mitigate the effects of double taxation of dividends. Double taxation of dividends and differences between corporate and maximum individual marginal tax rates result in corporate tax systems lacking neutrality. Distortions arise between organisational forms, between debt and equity financing and between the retention and distribution of profits. Various methods of integrating corporate and individual taxes have been advocated to overcome the lack of neutrality caused by corporate taxes. Following the introduction of the South African Income Tax Act in 1914, a number of taxes relating to dividends have existed. These have included a Dividend Tax, Non-resident Shareholder's Tax, Undistributed Profits Tax and Secondary Tax on Companies, hereafter referred to as STC. STC is a tax on net dividends declared and results in distributed income being taxed at higher rates than <b>retained</b> <b>income.</b> Despite the implementation of group relief provisions, STC results in an inhibition on the reinvestment of profits {{within the context of a}} group of companies. It is also a major cause of the lack of neutrality of the South African corporate tax system. As a result of the lack of neutrality and inhibition of group reinvestment caused by STC, a full imputation system is suggested as an alternative to replace STC. ...|$|E

One technique explicitly targeted in the new legislation is the grantor <b>retained</b> <b>income</b> trust (the 2 ̆ 2 GRIT 2 ̆ 2). The GRIT is a variation on the inter vivos gift, which has long been used by taxpayers as an estate-planning strategy designed to reduce transfer-tax liability.

However inappropriate as a matter of policy, the inter vivos gift remains a viable and important technique for achieving transfer-tax savings. In the 19802 ̆ 7 s, tax planners began to realize that the GRIT was a particularly attractive method by which to effect an inter vivos gift, making the GRIT {{one of the most popular}} estate-planning strategies. In appropriate circumstances, the GRIT could produce more wealth for its remainderman than a comparable outright gift might produce for a donee. In essence, the GRIT would be structured to require that trust income be paid to the grantor for a period of years designated in the trust instrument. Upon the expiration of this period of years, the trust would terminate, and the corpus would pass to the remainderman...|$|E
