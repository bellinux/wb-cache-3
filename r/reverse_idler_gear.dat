5000|$|Whenever {{the clutch}} pedal is {{depressed}} to shift into reverse, the mainshaft continues to rotate {{because of its}} inertia. The resulting speed difference between mainshaft and <b>reverse</b> <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> produces gear noise grinding. The reverse gear noise reduction system employs a cam plate which {{was added to the}} reverse shift holder. When shifting into reverse, the 5th/reverse shift piece, connected to the shift lever, rotates the cam plate. This causes the 5th synchro set to stop the rotating mainshaft. (13-4) ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{intermediate}} gear {{which does not}} drive a shaft to perform any work is called an idler gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may {{be referred to as}} a reverse idler. For instance, the typical automobile manual transmission engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears. Since a driven gear (gear [...] "A") rotating clockwise will drive a second gear ("B") counterclockwise, adding a third gear to the string means that gear [...] "C" [...] will be spinning the same direction as [...] "A". A typical transmission is designed with [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] gears, so when the engine spins, the outputs shaft spins the opposite direction, which drives the vehicle forward. A <b>reverse</b> <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> setup is actually typically an [...] "A" [...] and a [...] "C" [...] gear, which are not in contact with each other until a [...] "B" [...] gear is moved between them. Since the transmission is designed to move the car forwards when the output is spinning in the opposite direction from the input shaft, when added to the [...] "B" [...] idler gear, it forces the [...] "C" [...] gear to spin {{in the same direction as}} the [...] "A" [...] gear, and thus the input and output shafts are spinning in the same direction, which drives the car in reverse.|$|E

50|$|Reverse gear {{is usually}} not synchromesh, as {{there is only one}} reverse gear in the normal {{automotive}} transmission and changing gears into reverse while moving is not required—and often highly undesirable, particularly at high forward speed. Additionally, the usual method of providing <b>reverse,</b> with an <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> sliding into place to bridge what would otherwise be two mismatched forward gears, is necessarily similar to the operation of a crash box. Among the cars that have synchromesh in reverse are the 1995-2000 Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, '00-'05 Chevrolet Cavalier, Mercedes 190 2.3-16, the V6 equipped Alfa Romeo GTV/Spider (916), certain Chrysler, Jeep, and GM products which use the New Venture NV3500 and NV3550 units, the European Ford Sierra and Granada/Scorpio equipped with the MT75 gearbox, the Volvo 850, and almost all Lamborghinis, Hondas and BMWs.|$|R

This paper offers very valuable reference to product optimization and gear improvement. Instruction The test vehicle makes abnormal sound when the makers have a test for uphill with reverse gear. Entrusted by the makers, we have checked the gearbox. After the disassembling, We find that the tooth of the reverse gear of primary shaft and <b>reverse</b> <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> have fractured, and in this case, the gear pair are scrapping.

50|$|The {{previous}} discussion normally {{applies only}} to the forward gears. The implementation of the reverse gear is usually different, implemented {{in the following way}} to reduce the cost of the transmission. Reverse is also a pair of gears: one gear on the countershaft and one on the output shaft. However, whereas all the forward gears are always meshed together, there is a gap between the reverse gears. Moreover, they are both attached to their shafts: neither one rotates freely about the shaft. When reverse is selected a small <b>gear,</b> called an <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> or <b>reverse</b> <b>idler,</b> is slid between them. The idler has teeth which mesh with both gears, and thus it couples these gears together and reverses the direction of rotation without changing the gear ratio.|$|R
25|$|A {{booster engine}} for steam {{locomotives}} {{is a small}} two-cylinder steam engine back-gear-connected to the trailing truck axle on the locomotive or, if none, the lead truck on the tender. A rocking <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> permits it {{to be put into}} operation by the engineer. It would drive one axle only and could be non-reversible with one <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> or reversible with two <b>idler</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> {{contacts}} directly {{both the}} smaller {{and the larger}} gear, it can {{be removed from the}} calculation, also giving a ratio of 42/13≈3.23. The <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> serves to make both the drive gear and the driven gear rotate in the same direction, but confers no mechanical advantage.|$|R
50|$|In this {{calculation}} {{the planet}} <b>gear</b> is an <b>idler</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{input gear}} in this gear train has 13 teeth and the <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> has 21 teeth. Considering only these gears, the gear ratio between the idler and the input gear can be {{calculated}} as if the <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> was the output gear. Therefore, the gear ratio is driven/drive = 21/13 ≈1.62 or 1.62:1.|$|R

50|$|<b>Idler</b> <b>gears</b> {{can also}} {{transmit}} rotation among distant shafts {{in situations where}} it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, the mass and rotational inertia (moment of inertia) of a gear is proportional to the square of its radius. Instead of <b>idler</b> <b>gears,</b> a toothed belt or chain can be used to transmit torque over distance.|$|R
50|$|If {{a simple}} gear train has three gears, {{such that the}} input gear GA meshes with an {{intermediate}} gear GI which in turn meshes with the output gear GB, then the pitch circle of the intermediate gear rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears. This yields the two relationsThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtainNotice that this gear ratio {{is exactly the same}} as for the case when the gears GA and GB engage directly. The intermediate gear provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an <b>idler</b> <b>gear.</b> The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of <b>idler</b> <b>gears</b> and hence an <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven gear. If the driver gear moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven gear also moves in the clockwise direction {{with the help of the}} <b>idler</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Idler</b> <b>gears</b> {{can also}} {{transmit}} rotation among distant shafts {{in situations where}} it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, but the mass and rotational inertia (moment of inertia) of a gear is quadratic in proportion to its radius. Instead of <b>idler</b> <b>gears,</b> of course, a toothed belt or a roller chain can be used to transmit torque over distance. For short distances, a train of idlers may be used; whether an odd or even number is used determines whether the final output gear rotates the same direction as the input gear or not. For longer distances, a roller chain or belt is quieter and creates less friction, although gears are typically stronger, depending and the strength of the roller chain. A case where numerous <b>idler</b> <b>gears</b> might be used is as described above, where {{there are a number of}} output gears that need to be driven simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|The portal axle is {{a gearbox}} that is {{specially}} designed for off-road driving conditions. It is installed between {{the wheel and}} the axle shaft to give higher ground clearance to the vehicle. The modeling and simulation of spur gears in portal axle is important to predict the actual motion behavior. However, gear train design in portal axle is difficult to study comprehensively due to their relatively low cost and short product life cycle. In this study, modal analysis of portal axle is simulated using finite element method (FEM). Modal analysis is simulated on three different combinations of gear train system commonly designed for portal axle. The three gear trains being analyzed are <b>gear</b> train without <b>idler</b> <b>gear,</b> one <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> and two <b>idler</b> <b>gears.</b> FEM static stress analysis is also simulated on three different gear trains to study the gear teeth bending stress and contact stress behavior of the gear trains in different angular positions from 0 degrees to 18 degrees. The single and double pair gear teeth contact are also considered. This methodology serves as a novel approach for gear train design evaluation, {{and the study of}} gear stress behavior in gear train which is needed in the small workshop scale industries...|$|R

25|$|A {{design feature}} of the Peregrine {{was that it was}} {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve aircraft handling by providing a counter-rotating propeller facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear.|$|R
50|$|An <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> {{does not}} affect the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. Note that in a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. But, of course, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.|$|R
50|$|Another {{scenario}} {{is a series}} of rollers, such as used for pressing paper. Each roller has to be powered, but adding a motor to each one is wasteful. One could simply add a gear onto the end of the shaft of each roller, but that means that each roller would be spinning the opposite direction of the one before. By simply adding a small <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> between each larger gear, the result {{is a series of}} rollers, all being powered in the same direction.|$|R
50|$|In the photo, {{assuming}} the smallest gear {{is connected to}} the motor, it is called the drive gear or input gear. The somewhat larger gear in the middle is called an <b>idler</b> <b>gear.</b> It is not connected directly to either the motor or the output shaft and only transmits power between the input and output gears. There is a third gear in the upper-right corner of the photo. Assuming that gear {{is connected to the}} machine's output shaft, it is the output or driven gear.|$|R

25|$|The drive {{within the}} casing is {{provided}} by a train of spur gears. Accessories are arranged {{on both sides of}} the driveshaft entry, in reducing order of their speed. The gears are usually plain spur gears, running in roller bearings. <b>Idler</b> <b>gears</b> are commonly used between them, to increase the spacing between accessories. Helical gears are sometimes used for the high-torque drives, typically the starter, as these give smoother running. However helical gears also generate an end-thrust, which then requires a more complicated thrust bearing to support them.|$|R
