5|$|Technology {{during the}} Tang period was built also upon the {{precedents}} of the past. Advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> for different lengths of day and night.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (<b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow)</b> and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

40|$|Technical {{problems}} arise during measurement <b>of</b> the volume <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> in district heating systems when the desired measurement uncertainty {{is less than}} one percent. Solid-state laser Doppler velocimeters are able to assess the errors of measurement in conventional, built-in devices for measurement <b>of</b> volume <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> (working standard). The measuring system under review {{is based on a}} modified commercial solid-state laser Doppler velocimeter. The system is investigated and is optimized for minimum measuring uncertainties. The laser beams are injected into the fluid by means of a fit component with four large apertures for variable assembly which is mounted {{directly in front of the}} volumetric device in the pipe section. The suitability of the measuring system for precise measurement <b>of</b> the volume <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> under stationary flow conditions is determined in a hot-water test stand. Network measurements are made to assess the flow characteristics in the measuring cross-section, and systematic analyses are made to determine the measuring accuracies which can be achieved applying the conventional methods for measurement <b>of</b> volumetric <b>flow</b> in the case of little asymmetrical velocity distributions. Practical tests of the measuring techniques and measuring regimes are made under nonstationary flow conditions in the recirculation system of a district heating substation owned by Berliner Kraft- und Licht-Aktiengesellschaft.

25|$|The {{dissipation}} constant is {{a measure}} of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air, and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small glass bead thermistor are 1.5mW/°C in still air and 6.0mW/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> of a fluid past the thermistor.|$|E
25|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{can result}} in internal hydraulic jumps (i.e., hydraulic jumps as internal waves in fluids of different density) in abyssal fan formation. The internal hydraulic jumps {{have been associated with}} salinity or temperature induced stratification as well as with density differences due to suspended materials. When the slope of the bed (over which the turbidity current flows) flattens, the slower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> is mirrored by increased sediment deposition below the flow, producing a gradual backward slope. Where a hydraulic jump occurs, the signature is an abrupt backward slope, corresponding to the rapid reduction in the flow rate at the point of the jump.|$|E
