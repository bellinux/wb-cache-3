It is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB'. When this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving, car calls will be canceled (and the buttons disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or canceled in a single elevator configuration). The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the elevator pit) landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> speed with the hoistway door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) has {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} their construction projects (e. g., INDOT’s construction spending was $ 789 million in 2006 and increased to $ 1, 081. 4 million in 2010); while the level of its in-house inspection staff and resources has either remained the same or declined. There are different strategies {{to deal with the}} need for construction inspection resources and they may include strategies such as outsourcing the inspection of construction activities and using quality control and quality assurance certification programs to reduce the need for in-process inspection. One strategy that could reduce the inspection workload is prioritizing construction activities for inspection. However, reducing the number of inspections also has risks, such as functional failures and reduced design life, if defects are not identified before the work is covered. Thus, available inspection resources should be allocated to the activities with significant risk consequences due to <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection.</b> The objective of this study was to: (1) evaluate the current inspection practices of INDOT and (2) develop a risk-based inspection protocol to facilitate efficient allocation of available inspection resources to minimize the risks associated with <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection.</b> First, the current inspection practices implemented by INDOT, other State Departments of Transportation, and consulting firms were identified and compared. The comparison between the inspection practices revealed that there is consistency between INDOT’s and consultants’ and other State Departments of Transportation’s inspection practices. To develop a risk-based inspection protocol, first, the risk consequences associated with <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> were identified for different transportation construction activities, based on the data collected from 20 site visits to INDOT projects. These risk consequences include short and long-term functional failures, reduced design life, reduced safety, and increased maintenance cost. Based on data collected from 23 state Departments of Transportation, 58 engineers and inspectors from the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), and 20 inspection consultants in the Midwest, the subjective perceived probabilities associated with the occurrence of each risk consequence were encoded using fuzzy analysis. Using these subjective probabilities, the risk impacts due to <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> were derived. The construction activities subsequently were prioritized based on the risk impacts associated with <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> into five priority levels: high, medium-high, medium, medium-low, and low. The greater the risk impacts were due to <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection,</b> the higher the priority would be for inspection of that activity. The study also included identification of value added of inspection and the critical items to be watched for different activities related to transportation construction. Deliverables of this project include: (1) an inspection protocol, (2) an inspection staffing guide and (3) a list of pay items whose documentation requirements need to be modified to enhance the documentation process. The inspection protocol created in this study could assist INDOT in efficient allocation of inspection resources to construction activities...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 ANSI/ASQC Z 1. 4 is {{a widely}} used {{attributes}} acceptance sampling system. A necessary aspect of a scheme, from both a theoretical and psychological viewpoint, is the switching between normal, tightened, and <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> {{as a function of}} quality history. In the latest revision of the standard the switching rules were altered {{to make use of the}} limit numbers for <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> optional. Furthermore, a statement in the standard suggests that this action will have little effect on operating properties. A Markov model was developed to analyze the effect of the limit numbers. The no limit number model was solved analytically. The resulting closed-form results eliminate the need for matrix inversion and show that the maximum average run length on normal inspection is only 12. 7 lots. The results show that use with the limit numbers significantly impacts many performance measures.

40|$|Setting up {{effective}} survey {{strategies for}} biodiversity monitoring in agro-ecosystems {{is a major}} task in order to detect adverse effects on biodiversity before negative changes will manifest. Here, we studied the relative costs required for the monitoring of butterflies and selected diurnal moths (Papilionoidea et Hesperioidea; Zygaenoidea: Zygaenidae) in farmland. Analysing data from a well-established Lepidoptera monitoring system in Switzerland, we assessed the influence of inspection periods, inspection frequency and transect length on counts of diurnal Lepidoptera. Furthermore, we estimated the number of transects in relation to sampling effort necessary to detect changes of a given effect size for recorded species number (and abundance). Reducing the counting frequency from seven to four inspections per season still yielded 80 – 90 % of the species, as long as peak abundances in summer months were included. The variation in observed species number was mostly independent of inspection frequency, but strongly increased when transect length was reduced to less than 1 km. Sedentary Lepidoptera species are especially valuable indicators as their occurrences are directly linked to local effects on biodiversity, {{and the proportion of}} recorded sedentary species was not substantially affected by <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> frequency. Transects of 1 – 1. 5 km length were generally the most cost-efficient to detect an effect on total species number of diurnal Lepidoptera in arable landscapes, given that travelling distances between transects were short. Studying effects on rare species or selected species groups would involve higher sampling intensity and costs. Surveying schemes with <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> frequency and transect lengths can detect changes in species richness and total abundance of diurnal Lepidoptera cost-effectively. Facing expected changes in agricultural policy and management, the results and recommendations presented here will help to implement and improve cost-efficient Lepidoptera schemes to monitor changes in arable landscapes...|$|E

40|$|Analyzing {{inspection}} data is {{an important}} activity in the geometry assurance process, which provides vital information about product and process performance. Since inspection is related to a significant cost, it is desirable with an intelligent inspection preparation where the motive is to gather {{as much information as}} possible about the product and the process with a minimum number of inspection points. In many situations, a large number of inspection points are used despite the fact that only a small subset of points is needed. The reason for this redundancy is that most systems have only a few principal causes affecting groups of variables. In this paper, we use methods of cluster analysis to find these natural groupings of inspection points and to select one representing point from each cluster. Furthermore, if the relationship between some of the process parameters and inspection points are known from experiments or from computer simulations, then the cluster analy sis is combined with sensitivity-based reduction. In this way, an efficient <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> plan is built up.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the cumulative quantity control chart (CQC chart) defined based on the gamma random variable that is the quantity of product inspected in order to observe r (= 1) nonconformities. A CQC chart with a small value of r has a smaller average run length (ARL), but has lower discriminating power for detecting shifts in the nonconforming rate ? than a CQC chart with a large r. In the present paper, inspired by the concepts of double sampling procedures in acceptance sampling as well as <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> in MIL-STD- 105 E and the procedures for CSP plans in MIL-STD- 1235 C, a two-stage CQC chart is proposed aiming at gaining both the advantages of the 1 -stage CQC charts with r = 1 and r = 2. The authors apply a rigorous analytic approach to perform sensitivity analysis to compare the discriminating power of CQC charts in detecting change in ?, rather than using the less rigorous approach of numerical verification based on an ac hoc choice of values of parameters. The authors also obtain and compare the analytic expressions for the ARLs of these CQC charts. Economic analysis of the CQC charts is performed. Numerical examples will be given to compare the performance of these control charts in terms of discriminating power (in detecting shift of ?), ARL, and average total cost, and to show that each of these charts could be the best choice in each specific situation. It is also shown that, when the penalty cost due to nonconformities is relatively low, it is optimal not to apply statistical process control at all.

40|$|Is it {{rational}} {{to reduce}} criminal activities if punishments are increased? While intuition might suggest so, game theory concludes differently.

40|$|Abstract. Greatly <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> {{intervals}} of skin damage repairs pose a significant financial problem for aging commercial aircraft fleets. Such intervals for visual inspections {{are the result}} of simplified conservative repair substantiation analyses, based on the same crack propagation scenarios and curves that were established in the initial project development. These neglect the structural role of external repair (“doubler”) and consider only the increase in hidden crack path. A more refined approach to reassessing inspection intervals after a repair may keep maintenance jobs in accordance with common C-check routines in most cases. This approach, based on new crack growth simulations for worst case scenarios that could occur at the region of repair, uses respective kinetic equation and new geometric stress intensity factor functions, obtained in additional FEM (Finite Element Method) analyses. In particular, for standard rectangular repairs, the number of possible geometric configurations is astonishing considering length, width, skin and “doubler” thickness, reinforced panel dimensions, and frame and stringer cross sections. This investigation deals mainly with defining a minimum sufficient number of intermediate crack length values for FEM analyses in each propagation scenario. A conservative but efficient definition of most relevant parameters for a new numerical analysis campaign is another important issue. The results obtained are helpful for the improvement of the operational efficiency and safety of an aging fleet...|$|E
40|$|The {{automation}} of robotically delivered {{nondestructive evaluation}} inspection shares many aims with traditional manufacture machining. This paper presents a new {{hardware and software}} system for automated thickness mapping of large-scale areas, with multiple obstacles, by employing computer-aided drawing (CAD) /computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) -inspired path planning to implement control of a novel mobile robotic thickness mapping inspection vehicle. A custom postprocessor provides the necessary translation from CAM numeric code through robotic kinematic control to combine and automate the overall process. The generalized steps to implement this approach for any mobile robotic platform are presented herein and applied, in this instance, to a novel thickness mapping crawler. The inspection capabilities of the system were evaluated on an indoor mock-inspection scenario, within a motion tracking cell, to provide quantitative performance figures for positional accuracy. Multiple thickness defects simulating corrosion features on a steel sample plate were combined with obstacles to be avoided during the inspection. A minimum thickness mapping error of 0. 21 mm and a mean path error of 4. 41 mm were observed for a 2 m² carbon steel sample of 10 -mm nominal thickness. The potential of this automated approach has benefits in terms of repeatability of area coverage, obstacle avoidance, and reduced path overlap, all of which directly lead to increased task efficiency and <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> time of large structural assets...|$|E

The implementation of power harvesting, using energy scavenged from ambient sources such as thermal gradients and sources of vibration in conjunction with wireless transmission enables truly autonomous systems, reducing the need for batteries and associated maintenance in often inaccessible locations, alongside bulky and expensive wiring looms. The design and implementation of such a system however presents numerous challenges. A suitable energy source or multiple sources capable of meeting the power requirements of the system, over the entire monitoring period, in a location close to the sensor must be identified.

The goal of this research was to investigate and test new methods that can determine pavement thickness in real time. Three methods were evaluated: laser scanning, ultrasonic sensors, and eddy current sensors. Laser scanning, which scans the surface of the base prior to paving and then scans the surface after paving, can determine the thickness at any point. Also, scanning lasers provide thorough data coverage {{that can be used to}} calculate thickness variance accurately and identify any areas where the thickness is below tolerance. Ultrasonic and eddy current sensors also have the potential to measure thickness nondestructively at discrete points and may result in an easier method of obtaining thickness. There appear to be two viable approaches for measuring concrete pavement thickness during the paving operation: laser scanning and eddy current sensors. Laser scanning has proved to be a reliable technique in terms of its ability to provide virtual core thickness with low variability. Research is still required to develop a prototype system that integrates point cloud data from two scanners. Eddy current sensors have also proved to be a suitable alternative, and are probably closer to field implementation than the laser scanning approach.

However, in many cases, because of their geometrical complexity and inaccessibility, it is difficult to inspect them by the conventional ultrasonic methods. The magnetostrictive transducer technique has several advantages for practical applications, such as a 100 percent volumetric coverage of a long segment of a structure, a <b>reduced</b> <b>inspection</b> time and its cost effectiveness, as well as relatively simple structure. Recently it has been found that the magnetostrictive properties of Fe-Co-V alloy showed superior to the conventional Ni strip.

However, the alternating excitation should be kept as low as possible to avoid unwanted vibration modes. In this paper, the effect of an alternating excitation on the DC bias magnetization of the Fe-Co-V alloy strip was investigated. In order to apply a DC magnetization along the circumference of a small bore tube, an automotive battery is used to bring the Ni strip to a saturated magnetization. In addition, an in-bore torsional guided wave probe was applied to an inspection of a heat exchanger tube. The signal quality was not good enough to compare the case of DC magnetization along the circumference by using a high power DC supply. However, it has a good advantage in that the in-bore guided wave probe can be accessed from the inside of the tube and it can be used for screening purposes such as a heat exchanger inspection. 1...|$|E
