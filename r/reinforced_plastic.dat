25|$|New arrivals {{normally}} receive {{one piece}} of <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> 4 by 5 meters with which to construct their shelter. The plastic, while providing an excellent waterproof layer, is not self-supporting, nor does it provide any insulation.

Housing is built of mud brick, wood, or cane extracted from the surrounding territories and new or scavenged canvas. The other half is thatched roof huts, tents, and mud abodes.|$|E

25|$|The Katana {{has several}} {{distinctive}} features, including its all-composite construction, low-mounted wing, T-tail arrangement, and a castering nosewheel.

The wings themselves have transparent plexiglas panels present so that key control elements can be readily inspected without disassembly.

25|$|Kamorta was {{originally}} {{expected to be}} built using high-tensile imported steel. But lapses in imports lead it to be built by indigenously developed special grade high-tensile steel (DMR249A) produced by state-owned Steel Authority of India from its Bhilai Steel Plant. The ships employs very low under water voice signature and radar cross-section due to its ‘X’ form of hull and superstructure. She is the first Indian Navy ship to be built with carbon fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> which reduces weight and life cycle maintenance costs. The hull of the ship encompassed the bulk of sensors and weapon systems that were also indigenously manufactured by various Indian industries.|$|E
25|$|The helmet may be {{of metal}} or <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> {{composite}} (GRP), and is either connected to a neck dam or clamped directly to a drysuit. The neck dam is {{the lower part of}} the helmet, which seals against the neck of the diver in the same way that the neck seal of a dry suit works. Neck dams may have neoprene or latex seals, depending on diver preference. Attachment to the neck dam is critical to diver safety and a reliable locking mechanism is needed to ensure that it is not inadvertently released during a dive. When using a dry suit, the neck dam may be permanently omitted and {{the lower part of the}} helmet assembly attached directly to the suit.|$|E
25|$|To {{keep the}} rally car {{competitive}} into the 1980s an evolution version, the Chevette HSR, was developed which was successful {{for several more}} years. The modified cars featured glass <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> (fibreglass) front and rear wings, spoiler, bonnet and tailgate (giving the HSR the nickname 'Plastic Fantastic'), revised suspension (particularly at the rear, where extra suspension links were fitted), and other minor changes. Group 4 evolution required a production run of 50 cars incorporating the new modifications; these were made by rebuilding unsold HSs and by modifying customers' vehicles. However, the merger of the Vauxhall and Opel marketing departments resulted in Dealer Team Vauxhall and Dealer Opel Team (DOT) joining to form GM Dealer Sport (GMDS); with the Chevette soon to be obsolete, Opel were able to force the cancellation of the HSR rally programme in favour of the Manta 400.|$|E

40|$|Specimens of {{polymeric}} {{composite materials}} for aviation and space {{applications such as}} glass fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> (GFRP), carbon fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> (CFRP), organic fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> (OFRP), and hybrid plastics (HP) based on epoxy compounds {{were exposed to the}} space environment on the surface of Salyut- 7 orbital station. The space exposure lasted 1501 days as a maximum. The data relating to the change in mechanical properties, mass losses, glass transition temperature, linear thermal expansion coefficient, and microstructure after various periods of exposure are given. It has been found that the change in properties is caused by the processes of binder postcuring and microerosion of the exposed surface of plastics. The phenomenon of strengthening of the surface layer of hybrid composites, due to which the nature of destruction changes at bending loads, has been revealed...|$|R
25|$|The wings have an {{intentional}} twist in their shape which causes the wing roots to stall {{in advance of}} the wingtips, which has the effect of the ailerons being fully effective well after the onset of a primary stall condition. Other unfavourable flight conditions are often guarded against, such as a wing drop, which may only be produced as a consequence of prolonged and excessive elevator application during a steep climbing turn, and can be rectified by the relaxation of back pressure. The control forces across all regimes are well-balanced, which reportedly reduces the frequency to which trimming of the control surfaces may need to be performed. Many of the flight control surfaces, such as the elevators and ailerons, are push-rod actuated, while control of the rudder is achieved via cables. As a measure to protect against instances of over-rotation, a <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> skid is present underneath the tail unit.|$|E
25|$|The 328 is {{furnished}} {{with the same}} supercritical wing design that had been originally developed from Dornier's earlier Do 228, this wing provides the aircraft with both excellent cruise and climb capabilities. The straightforward construction techniques of the Do 228 were also reproduced for the 328, despite making increased use of composite materials {{in areas such as}} the rear fuselage and empennage. The 328 reportedly made greater use of composites than any of its direct competitors at launch, the use of the Kevlar-carbon fiber composites is claimed to have reduced its weight by 20 per cent. Various materials are used across the airframe; amongst these, an aluminium alloy is used for the pressure fuselage and much of the wingbox, a titanium alloy for the tail cone, and glass fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> for the radome and leading edge of the vertical stabilizer. Noise-absorbent material is located across the fuselage, while the cabin wall is hung from isolator brackets to reduce vibration and noise transference.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComposite {{materials}} are mainly {{known for their}} use in high-tech applications like structural aircraft parts. Carbon fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> are characterized by good mechanical properties and low weight, but are relatively expensive and their manufacturing process involves high levels of energy consumption. Due to these disadvantages, the current use of this material in the automotive area is limited. In this paper the energy consumption for the manufacturing process, the utilisation phase, and the recycling phase of three different car models will be investigated. A comparison between the different materials including carbon fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics,</b> aluminium and steel will be performed. Although the manufacturing process of carbon fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> is highly energy intensive, there is an advantage in the overall energy consumption during {{the life cycle of}} its vehicle. In an additional scenario, the energy consumption of the manufacturing process for carbon composites is calculated with 10 % less energy consumption. It will be shown that decreasing the energy consumption in the manufacturing process of carbon composites will offer high potentials for the automotive industry to improve the energy balance with the usage of a high amount of carbon fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics...</b>|$|R
