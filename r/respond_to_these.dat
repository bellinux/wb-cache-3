5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. It was hoped that the Japanese {{military}} would <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve {{to respond to the}} planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 1979, Malaysia {{published}} a map {{that showed the}} island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together {{with the issue of}} sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> acts, and other actions that demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, ethnic mass {{mobilization}} {{is likely}} to be plagued by collective action problems, especially if ethnic protests are likely to lead to violence. Instrumentalist scholars have tried to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> shortcomings. For example, Hardin argues that ethnic mobilization faces problems of coordination and not collective action. He points out that a charismatic leader acts as a focal point around which members of an ethnic group coalesce. The existence of such an actor helps to clarify beliefs about the behavior of others within an ethnic group.|$|E
25|$|In {{the game}} the player takes {{the role of the}} President of the United States or General Secretary of the Soviet Union. The goal is to improve the player's country's {{standing}} in the world relative to the other superpower. During each yearly turn, random events occur that may have effects on the player's international prestige. The player can choose to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> events in various ways, which may prompt a response from the other superpower. This creates brinkmanship situations between the two nations, potentially escalating to a nuclear war, which ends the game.|$|E

25|$|Up to 15 {{cases of}} {{stranded}} manatees {{are reported in}} Puerto Rico each year. Some of these cases involve animals that have died near shore, either from natural causes or human related accidents. Others cases reported consist of live manatees, whether ill, injured or orphaned in need of veterinary attention. The PRMCC is deputized by both the Commonwealth and Federal governments to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> stranding events, and conduct an investigation on the cause of death, including a necropsy, or rescue and transport the live animal to the PRMCC's rehabilitation facility for veterinary treatment and care.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of the birds {{has long been a}} topic for anecdote and speculation. That calls have meanings that are interpreted by their listeners has been well demonstrated. Domestic chickens have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators, and they <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> alarm calls appropriately. However, a language has, in addition to words, grammar (that is, structures and rules). Studies to demonstrate the existence of language have been difficult due to the range of possible interpretations. Research on parrots by Irene Pepperberg is claimed to demonstrate the innate ability for grammatical structures, including the existence of concepts such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Studies on starling vocalizations have also suggested that they may have recursive structures.|$|E

Most of his higher-level political supporters could not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> new charges the way they had the corruption charges. In a hearing prior to the rape trial, a group of thousands of his supporters gathered near the courthouse, as a smaller gathering of anti-rape groups demonstrated on behalf of the alleged rape victim. As he did throughout the trial, Zuma sang Lethu Mshini Wami (Bring me my machine gun) with the crowd, and ANC Youth League and Communist Party Youth League spokesmen spoke in support of Zuma.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{examining}} employers' {{attempts to}} regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> regulations. According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers {{to engage in}} some form of emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a smile and friendly attitude independent of their own mood or temperament at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.|$|E
25|$|From 1720 on, {{the market}} for sugar from Indonesia {{declined}} as the competition from cheap sugar from Brazil increased. European markets became saturated. Dozens of Chinese sugar traders went bankrupt which led to massive unemployment, which in turn led to gangs of unemployed coolies. The Dutch government in Batavia did not adequately <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> problems. In 1740, rumours of deportation of the gangs from the Batavia area led to widespread rioting. The Dutch military searched houses of Chinese in Batavia for weapons. When a house accidentally burnt down, military and impoverished citizens started slaughtering and pillaging the Chinese community. This massacre of the Chinese was deemed sufficiently serious for {{the board of the}} VOC to start an official investigation into the Government of the Dutch East Indies {{for the first time in}} its history.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the {{availability}} of drugs proven to treat neuropathic pain is limited and varies widely from patient to patient. Many developed drugs have either been discovered by accident or by observation. Some past treatments include opiates like poppy extract, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like salicylic acid, and local anesthetics like cocaine. Other recent treatments consist of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, although no substantial research on the actual mechanism of these treatments has been performed. However, patients <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> treatments differently, possibly because of gender differences or genetic backgrounds. Therefore, researchers {{have come to realize}} that no one drug or one class of drugs will reduce all pain. Research is now focusing on the underlying mechanisms involved in pain perception and how it can go wrong in order to develop an appropriate drug for patients afflicted with neuropathic pain.|$|E
