5000|$|The {{alignment}} {{on either}} side of the Spanish Civil War was becoming somewhat diffuse for a growing group of intellectual personalities, both in exile and within Spain, converging on what has been called the third (una tercera) of Spain. This is the case of Manuel de Falla and Ramón Gómez de la Serna (both resided until their deaths in Argentina, but are not identified specifically with either the exiles or with the Francoist authorities, who sought to recruit them), a significant group of Republican exiles to which violence had distanced them from the Republican side since the beginning of the war, called los blancos de París (the whites of Paris): Salvador de Madariaga, Niceto Alcalá-Zamora or Alfredo Mendizabal, and the Spanish Committee for Civil Peace, established in Paris in February 1937), and other significant groups who chose to stay in Spain or who returned in the early postwar years: the physician and essayist Gregorio Marañón or philosophers José Ortega y Gasset, Javier Zubiri and Julián Marías. Symbolically, the three main leaders of the Association of Service of the Republic of 1931 (Ortega and Perez de Ayala Marañón) agreed in its hopeless <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> and the resigned acceptance of the Franco regime, returning to Spain in the 1940s. Meanwhile, a select group of intellectuals from the left of Falangism distanced themselves from the regime (the environmentalist journal Escorial, which received the controversial liberal denomination [...] "Falangism": Pedro Laín Entralgo, Antonio Tovar, Dionisio Ridruejo, Jose Maria Alfaro Polanco, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, José Luis López Aranguren, and Álvaro Cunqueiro, who continued to write most of his work in the Galician language.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{contribute}} to the scholarship on modern female villainy by further exploring the ways in which 20 th century female villains are represented as well as the functions they carry out in the text. In this study, I look at Rómulo Gallegos’ doña Bárbara from Doña Bárbara (1929) and Salman Rushdie’s Indira Gandhi from Midnight’s Children (1981). I argue that both villains are a combination of already-existing forms of evil in more recognizable contexts as well as a <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> and <b>opposition</b> to modern values. Firstly, I examine how the villains both conform and resist the formula of the femme fatale. Secondly, I look at the way they represent national evils. Lastly, I study their relation <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> to the hero(s) and the ways they mark the boundaries that separate binary oppositions. I conclude that modern representations of female villainy continue to reactivate degrading conceptualizations about womanhood...|$|R

This paper argues that the scholarly archive is going though a process of hypertextualization that is not adequately accounted for in theories on hypertext. A methodological approach based on Gerard Genette's theory of transtextuality is proposed {{for a study of}} the hypertextualized archive. This involves a <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the reductionist <b>opposition</b> <b>of</b> hypertext and the fixed linear text, in favor of a study of the intertexts, paratexts and metatexts that work at the interface between texts and archive.

40|$|The fruitfulness and the {{necessity}} of the distinction between values and norms and as principles are investigated by way of the theory of political development, the legal philosophical issue surrounding natural law and positivism and the views of Habermas. In political developmental theory questions centring on value gained legitimate relevancy under the influ­ ence of the post-behaviorist approach. The quest for cultural universalia or values as principles became important in this sphere because {{it seems to be the}} only way to escape from the syndrome of modernity. Through the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oppositions</b> and one-sidedness <b>of</b> legal positivism and natural law and with the aid of the distinction between values, norms and principles the productive contribution of this spurious dilemma is high­ lighted and a clearer delineation is given of the concepts legal develop­ ment and structural violence. In conclusion Habermas's distinction between norms and meta-norms is investigated critically and immanent contradictions in his views are pointed out. The central place which this issue has in his thought can be seen as a confirmation of the importance of this distinction. It is relevant for all the normative disciplines which - in contrast to the natural sciences - focus on the role of linguistic, social, ethical, legal and artistic norms valid for human societies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. This article {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} ways to overcome negative after-effects of intercultural communication. Methodology and theoretical results: To avoid the negative after-effects of intercultural communication caused by the clash of different reality tunnels, {{it is necessary to}} go beyond the framework of the specific symbolical territory, which is seen as the only true reality. Expanding the horizons of life, going beyond the boundaries of a personal reality tunnel can be achieved, in particular, by using parables. Acquaintance with parables helps to extend the set of the world perception models and to change the positions of the communication process participants. Parables act as intermediaries between people of different cultures and mentalities. Owing to its archetypical form, parable becomes {{one of the most popular}} narratives illustrating deep and multi-faceted truths that sometimes cannot be expressed by any other way. Parable serves as an open and flexible model of the world and a model of an individual "I self". This model helps people to constitute themselves as a part of their world. Parable requires to reject its interpretation in the oppositions inherent in a given culture and to reconsider the very way <b>of</b> understanding. <b>Rejection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oppositions</b> provides the possibility of perceiving the world as integrity, unity in diversity, helps to overcome one-sided picture of the inner world of a man and his life in society. Understanding of a parable works towards changing personal position, and human creative nature is actualized. Conclusion: Parables uniquely reflect the real world and contribute to personal understanding of reality. Parables are successfully transplanted into different cultures operating as heritage of a culture-recipient and as a connecting link, which optimizes an intercultural dialogue...|$|R

40|$|The 1911 Canada United States Reciprocity Agreement had {{a central}} role in the campaigns of the Liberal and Conservative parties in the 1911 Canadian General Election.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the changing nature}} <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> within the British political system through {{a study of the}} balance of power between the Conservative Party and its leader in their most recent period in opposition from 1997 to 2010. A literature on the place <b>of</b> the <b>opposition</b> within the British political system was developed as part of post- 1945 studies of the Westminster Model. However, despite dramatic changes in the political environment and the increasing <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the Westminster Model, more recent discussion has neglected systematic study <b>of</b> <b>opposition.</b> More recent writing on the Conservative Party has not been used to examine claims about the changing form and function <b>of</b> <b>opposition,</b> but has assumed the importance of the decisions of particular actors. In order to study the recent Conservative Party with a view to developing our understanding <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> and the expectations upon its leader, the thesis identifies the change in the political environment as central. It suggests dealing with this by utilizing a conceptual framework derived from Presidentialisation theory. This offers a conceptualisation of the political system as a whole, identifying the increasing importance of leadership at its heart. Adapting this to the study <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> suggests examination <b>of</b> three crucial components of leadership activity: the relationship between the party and the leader, the place of the leader within general elections and the place of the leader and opposition within the wider political environment including executive actions. Examination of these areas highlights the substantial ways in which power has moved from the leader to the party alongside the additional resources which the leader can command. It concludes that whilst the changing political environment may have served to make the leader <b>of</b> the <b>opposition</b> appear more powerful and prominent, there are significant structural constraints which prevent the exercise of this power.

50|$|The young Diet Sayler {{was a great}} fan of Brâncuși and Malevich. At {{the start}} of his career he was above all {{inspired}} by Suprematism and Russian Revolution art. He studied the theories and works of the De Stijl and Bauhaus artists. Later he borrowed from Dadaism the principle of chance, on which his own works are based.Sayler arrived at Concrete art by opposing political reality and the doctrine of socialist realism. The drive for change is a central theme in his work.Sayler’s early works are highly colorful. In the years <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> and <b>opposition</b> color disappeared from his work, which became black and white. Following the culture shock of emigration he concentrated on thin lines on white canvases. Towards the end of the 1980s Sayler developed a system of basic elements, which became a repertoire of his painting. Color returned. He produced his ‘Paintings Pieces’, ‘Bivalences’ and ‘Throw Pieces’. The late 1990s saw the creation of wall pieces or ‘Bodies’ and Engrams (‘Norigrammes’) as site-specific installations in the urban architecture. Parallel to this he developed site-specific “Fugues” for the rooms of museums, churches or galleries.|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze factors related to <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care and {{behaviors}} directed towards others in nursing home residents with dementia. Methods: The relationship of lack of understanding, depression, psychosis and pain with <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care and behaviors directed towards others was explored using four assessments from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) within a period of 15 months on 1, 101 residents with dementia in Dutch nursing homes. Presence of depressive symptoms was ascertained using a validated MDS scale, and presence of lack <b>of</b> understanding, <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care, psychosis and pain through the individual MDS items. A structural equation modeling approach and latent growth models were used to investigate the longitudinal relationship between changes in <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care and physical or verbal behaviors directed towards others, and changes in lack of understanding, pain, depression and psychotic symptoms. Results: Changes in lack of understanding predicted changes in <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care, and there was also a relationship between changes in depression and <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care. Changes of behaviors directed towards others were related to changes in lack of understanding and depression. Pain and behaviors directed towards others were unrelated, and psychosis was rather stable throughout. A mediation model suggested that the relationship of lack of understanding with behaviors directed towards others was mediated by <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care. Conclusion: These results indicate that lack of understanding and depression are important factors in development <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care and behaviors directed towards others. The relationship between lack of understanding and behaviors directed towards others is mediated by <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care. Improvement in communication between residents and caregivers, and perhaps also effective treatment of depression may prevent or ameliorate these behaviors directed towards others...|$|R

We report a survey (N> 1100) of climate blog users to identify the variables underlying acceptance and <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> climate science. Paralleling previous work, we find that endorsement of a laissez-faire conception of free-market economics predicts <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> climate science (r ≃. 80 between latent constructs).
