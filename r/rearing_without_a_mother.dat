40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of brooding and group selection for low mortality on post-stress corticosterone and peripheral serotonin in laying hens. Birds in the experiment originated from the same population and were either group-selected for low mortality (low mortality line) or randomly selected (control line) for two generations. Twelve groups of seven birds from each line were used. Within each line, six groups were brooded by <b>a</b> foster <b>mother</b> and six groups were non-brooded. At 33 weeks of age, birds (n = 42 /treatment) were manually restrained for 5 min, during which their behavioral response (number of struggles) was studied. Fifteen minutes after the start of the manual restraint, blood samples were drawn for assessment of plasma corticosterone and whole blood serotonin (5 -HT) concentration. In the low mortality line, 80 % of the birds struggled and vocalized vs. 72 % in the control line (non significant). Birds from the control line had a higher plasma corticosterone concentration after manual restraint than birds from the low mortality line (7. 7 vs. 6. 0 nmol ml- 1). Furthermore, birds from the control line that were <b>reared</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> had <b>a</b> lower whole-blood 5 -HT concentration than birds from the other treatments (45 vs. 48 nmol ml- 1). These results indicate that both brooding and selection for low mortality affect post-stress corticosterone and peripheral serotonin concentration, which may result in a reduced propensity to develop feather peckin...|$|R
40|$|In {{domestic}} chickens, {{the provision}} of maternal care strongly influences the behavioural development of chicks. <b>Mother</b> hens play <b>an</b> important role in directing their chicks’ behaviour {{and are able to}} buffer their chicks’ response to stressors. Chicks imprint upon their mother, who is key in directing the chicks’ behaviour and in allowing them to develop food preferences. Chicks reared by <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> hen are less fearful and show higher levels of behavioural synchronisation than chicks reared artificially. In a commercial setting, more fearful chicks with unsynchronised behaviour are more likely to develop behavioural problems, such as feather pecking. As well as being an inherent welfare problem, fear can also lead to panic responses, smothering, and fractured bones. Despite the beneficial effects of brooding, it is not commercially viable to allow natural brooding on farms and so chicks are hatched in large incubators and <b>reared</b> artificially, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> hen. In this review we cover the literature demonstrating the important features of maternal care in domestic chickens, the behavioural consequences of deprivation and the welfare implications on commercial farms.

Rebels develop after an old queen leaves with a swarm and before a new queen hatches. We hypothesised that larval food lacking queen mandibular pheromones trigger the rebel phenotype. Larvae reared under queenright or queenless conditions were additionally fed with water or a drop of macerated queen mandibular glands. After following development of the bees and subjecting them to dissection, we found that those reared with a queen or fed the macerated glands under queenless conditions developed into typical workers. Only those workers <b>reared</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> queen and <b>without</b> macerated glands added to their food developed into rebels; these rebels had more ovarioles, smaller hypopharyngeal glands, and larger mandibular and Dufour’s glands than did typical workers.
