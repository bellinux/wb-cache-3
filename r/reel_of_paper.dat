25|$|The {{idea for}} On the Road, Kerouac's second novel, was formed {{during the late}} 1940s {{in a series of}} notebooks, and then typed out on a {{continuous}} <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> during three weeks in April 1951. It was first published by Viking Press in 1957. After several film proposals dating from 1957, the book was finally made into a film, On the Road (2012), produced by Francis Ford Coppola and directed by Walter Salles.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the larger}} {{employers}} in Rothschild is the Domtar Paper Mill. The mill was originally built between 1909 and 1910 {{by a group of}} local lumber barons. The mill produced its first <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> in 1910 and was incorporated under the name Marathon Paper Mills. At that time, the area that was to become Rothschild was still considered the Town of Weston. However, the company built and maintained several homes, a community hall, boarding house and general store. As the mill town grew around the paper mill, the area soon became incorporated as the village of Rothschild.|$|E
50|$|Rotary presses {{were used}} for {{high-speed}} work. In the oscillating press, the form slid under a drum around which each sheet of paper got wrapped for the impression, sliding back under the inking rollers while the paper was removed and a new sheet inserted. In a newspaper press, a papier-mâché mixture called a flong {{used to make a}} mould of the entire form of type, then dried and bent, and a curved metal plate cast against it. The plates were clipped to a rotating drum and could print against a continuous <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> at the enormously high speeds required for overnight newspaper production.This invention helped aid the high demand for knowledge during this time period.|$|E
50|$|Bulk {{materials}} such as coal, ores, grains and wood chips are handled by belt, chain, slat, pneumatic or screw conveyors, bucket elevators and mobile equipment such as front-end loaders. Materials on pallets are handled with forklifts. Also used for handling heavy items like <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> steel or machinery are electric overhead cranes, sometimes called bridge cranes because they span large factory bays.|$|R
50|$|Addition took 285 microseconds and {{multiplication}} 20 milliseconds, making arithmetic operations {{much faster}} than the Harvard Mark I. Data {{that had to be}} retrieved quickly was held in electronic circuits; the remainder was stored in relays and as holes in three continuous card-stock tapes that filled another wall. A chain hoist was needed to lift the heavy <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> into place. The machine read instructions or data from 30 paper tape readers connected to three punches, and another a table look-up unit consisted <b>of</b> another 36 <b>paper</b> tape readers. A punched card reader was used to load data, and results were produced on punched cards or high-speed printers. The 19-digit word was stored on the card stock tape or registers in binary coded decimal, resulting in 76 bits, with two extra bits for indicating positive or negative sign and parity, while the two side rows were used for sprockets. The familiar 80 columns of IBM punched card technology were recorded sideways as one column of the tape.|$|R
50|$|The SSEC was {{an unusual}} hybrid of vacuum tubes and {{electromechanical}} relays. Approximately 12,500 vacuum tubes {{were used in the}} arithmetic unit, control, and its eight (relatively high-speed) registers, which had an access time of less than one millisecond. About 21,400 relays were used for control and 150 lower-speed registers, with an access time of 20 milliseconds. The relay technology was similar to the ASCC, based on technology invented by Clair D. Lake (1888-1958). The arithmetic logic unit of the SSEC was a modified IBM 603 electronic multiplier, which had been designed by James W. Bryce. The bulky tubes were military surplus radar technology, which filled one entire wall. The memory was organized as signed 19-digit decimal numbers. Multiplication was computed with 14 digits in each factor. Most of the quoted 400,000 digit capacity was in the form <b>of</b> <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> punched <b>paper</b> tape.|$|R
5000|$|Offset {{printing}} is {{a commonly}} used printing technique {{in which the}} inked image is transferred (or [...] "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used {{in combination with the}} lithographic process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains ink from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a water-based film (called [...] "fountain solution"), keeping the non-printing areas ink-free. The modern [...] "web" [...] process feeds a large <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> through a large press machine in several parts, typically for several metres, which then prints continuously as the paper is fed through.|$|E
5000|$|Green {{is famous}} for his zany and {{slightly}} eccentric behaviour. Members of the Masque Theatre in Northampton were able to recall Green's antics in minute detail many years (decades?) after his departure, and the Northampton Chronicle office was awash with Green stories, all {{on the theme of}} good intentions leading to all-round chaos. At the Leicester Mercury he was firewatching one night with Maurice Barsby. Maurice said when looking at the huge printing presses in the basement [...] "I know how these things work …” Michael said [...] "Go on, then". He pulled the main switches and Maurice pressed the button. The press started but not gradually, and the enormous <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> broke and spewed into the machine-room. So there was no midnight edition of the Mercury, and as the presses did not stop when the button was pressed they had to switch off at the mains. Next day Michael was questioned and then sacked, but not Maurice. Green admits that he [...] "had a reputation for playing the fool." [...] The overnight firewatching job was unpopular, except with lads of 16 or 17 who were too young to be called up; they could drink brown ale, use the typewriters and telephones and smoke the editor’s cigars (leaving burns in the carpet).|$|E
25|$|On 29 September, the ketch Annie Watt {{arrived in}} Adelaide and her captain {{reported}} {{picking up a}} <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> blue printing <b>paper</b> 18 miles North-West of Kangaroo Island. The paper was identified as part of Loch Vennachar's cargo. Three weeks later, the sea began delivering scraps of her cargo to the jagged coast of Kangaroo Island which confirmed the disaster. The steamer Governor Musgrave was sent on two separate occasions {{to search for the}} wreck and any survivors. Weeks of searching by government and local fishing boats produced only flotsam and the body of a young seaman, who was never identified. He was buried in the sand hills of West Bay. The search was eventually abandoned on 12 October.|$|R
