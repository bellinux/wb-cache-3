5000|$|Precedent {{that must}} be applied or {{followed}} is known as binding precedent (alternately metaphorically precedent, mandatory or binding authority, etc.). Under the doctrine of stare decisis, a lower court must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears. In state and federal courts in the United States of America, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a <b>regional</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>court.</b> All appellate courts fall under a highest court (sometimes but not always called a [...] "supreme court"). By definition, decisions of lower courts are not binding on courts higher in the system, nor are <b>appeals</b> <b>court</b> decisions binding on local courts that fall under a different <b>appeals</b> <b>court.</b> Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to {{the same pattern of}} facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings (see Law of the case re: a court's previous holding being binding precedent for that court).|$|R
