40|$|Nutrition is {{considered}} to have an important influence upon the life history of the green sea turtle including regulation of its growth rate, age at sexual maturity, egg production and remigration intervals amongst other influences. It would therefore be expected that the green turtle would select dietary items that would maximise its nutrient intake and balance its energy budget as predicted by optimal,foraging models. Although the feeding ecology of green turtles in seagrass communities has received attention, no study to date has investigated the feeding ecology of green turtles in an algal community. This was the first study to describe the diet and feeding ecology of green turtles foraging in an algal-based community (<b>Heron</b> <b>Reef,</b> Queensland) where seagrasses were absent.

40|$|Where {{multiple}} cores {{have been}} recovered from a single reef, growth models can be constructed. The reef growth model of Marshall and Davies (1982) suggests that following Pleistocene substrate inundation c. 8 ka, high-energy coral head facies and lower energy branching coral facies aggraded on the windward and leeward sides, respectively, with both initially lagging behind sea-level rise and the windward facies attaining modern sea-level sooner than the leeward after sea-level began to stabilise. Once sea-level was attained on the windward margin, progradation was directed primarily towards the backreef/lee. However, Hopley et al.

There are, it is true, gaps to be fonud in most of the great recognised Orders which are difficult to bridge over; but, as a rule, members of one family (or sub-family) are found, by reason of their anatomy or their habits, to grade into one anothor in such a manner as to enable the systematist to group them in a natural sequence. with the paucity of data which exists concerning the Petrels, I have not thought it advisable to subdivide this neglected family at present.

40|$|Despite {{increases}} in the frequency and intensity of disturbances on coral reefs {{over the past few}} decades, the response of subtropical coral assemblages to climate change is poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap on Australian reefs and provide a baseline for future comparisons, we quantified spatial (10 - 100 ’s of kilometres) and temporal (decadal) patterns of benthic assemblages across a latitudinal gradient along the east Australian coastline (23. 5 ° S to 31. 5 ° S). Benthic community composition was quantified at six locations from the southern Great Barrier <b>Reef,</b> Queensland (<b>Heron</b> <b>Reef,</b> 23. 5 ° S, 152 ° E) to northern New South Wales (31 ° S, 153. 1 ° E) and at Lord Howe Island (31. 5 ° S, 159. 1 ° E). Our results indicate significant latitudinal differences in benthic assemblages, while community composition at some sites was more similar to those hundreds of kilometres away than to that of neighbouring reefs. A general trend was observed with decreasing cover of Acroporidae with increasing latitude, corresponding with an increasing cover of Pocilloporidae and Dendrophylliidae. <b>Heron</b> <b>Reef</b> comprised a high proportion of Acropora corals (43 % total coral cover) and coralline algae (44 %). In contrast, high-latitude reefs were dominated by mixed coral assemblages (0 - 52 %) and high macroalgal cover (16 - 27 %). Decadal comparisons of high-latitude reefs showed regional stability of benthic assemblages (9 out of 11 assemblages remained stable at> 75 % similarity), during a period of warming oceans (0. 15 - 0. 24 °C per decade).

40|$|Understanding the {{ecological}} role of benthic microalgae, a highly productive component of coral reef ecosystems, requires {{information on their}} spatial distribution. The spatial extent of benthic microalgae on <b>Heron</b> <b>Reef</b> (southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia) was mapped {{using data from the}} Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper sensor. integrated with field measurements of sediment chlorophyll concentration and reflectance. Field-measured sediment chlorophyll concentrations. 2 ranging from 23 - 1. 153 mg chl a m(2), were classified into low, medium, and high concentration classes (1 - 170, 171 - 290, and > 291 mg chl a m(- 2)) using a K-means clustering algorithm. The mapping process assumed that areas in the Thematic Mapper image exhibiting similar reflectance levels in red and blue bands would correspond to areas of similar chlorophyll a levels. Regions of homogenous reflectance values corresponding to low, medium, and high chlorophyll levels were identified over the reef sediment zone by applying a standard image classification algorithm to the Thematic Mapper image. The resulting distribution map revealed large-scale (> 1 km 2) patterns in chlorophyll a levels throughout the sediment zone of <b>Heron</b> <b>Reef.</b> Reef-wide estimates of chlorophyll a distribution indicate that benthic Microalgae may constitute up to 20 % of the total benthic chlorophyll a at <b>Heron</b> <b>Reef.</b> and thus contribute significantly to total primary productivity on the reef...|$|R
