5|$|<b>Responses</b> <b>are</b> {{polyclonal}} {{in nature}} as each clone somewhat specializes in producing antibodies against a given epitope, and because, each antigen contains multiple epitopes, {{each of which}} in turn can be recognized {{by more than one}} clone of B cells. To be able to react to innumerable antigens, as well as multiple constituent epitopes, the immune system requires the ability to recognize a very great number of epitopes in all, i.e., there should be a great diversity of B cell clones.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} voice acting in the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E

He then tells her he does not care how long he has to wait. Selena replies, telling him how beautiful his <b>responses</b> <b>are,</b> which makes her feel she is falling in love. Selena states that she stops herself from making a mistake that could hurt her. Torres and Selena repeat the song's chorus before the song concludes.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} tested the {{potential}} of teaching multiple response alternatives to mitigate resurgence of a target response. Two experimental arrangements were alternated. In one component a target <b>response</b> <b>was</b> reinforced, then an alternative <b>response</b> <b>was</b> reinforced while the target <b>response</b> <b>was</b> placed on extinction. In the final phase, both <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> placed on extinction. In the second component, a target <b>response</b> <b>was</b> reinforced, then four alternative <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> reinforced while the target <b>response</b> <b>was</b> placed on extinction. In the final phase, all <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> placed on extinction. Six of nine participants demonstrated lower resurgence of the target response following reinforcement of multiple response alternatives. The {{results of this study}} suggest teaching multiple <b>response</b> alternatives <b>is</b> a possible treatment strategy to mitigate response resurgence...|$|R

5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can be talked to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a demon, which initiates a negotiation. For those demons who can talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A negotiation can fail if the wrong <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E
5|$|Contestants' <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> {{revealed}} {{in order of}} their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. A correct response adds {{the amount of the}} contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E
5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E

5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements {{of the people who}} own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of the}} incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E
5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> audited by KPMG.|$|E

5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Translation {{problems}} are {{compounded by the}} women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E
5|$|When a stem is developing, {{the fungus}} is {{negatively}} geotropic, {{so that if}} the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic—they will grow {{at right angles to}} the direction of gravity. Finally, the spines are positively geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> operating simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal.|$|E
30|$|For both {{encoding}} {{items and}} problem-solving items, participants’ <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> coded for whether they correctly represented both slope and intercept. For items that required students to generate equations, slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the value provided as the slope {{in the equation}} was exactly correct, and intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the value provided as the intercept in the equation was exactly correct. For items that required students to generate graphs, intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the graph intersected the correct point on the y-axis. Slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if a straight line calculated with the intercept and the last point of the graph had the correct gradient. For the item in which {{students were asked to}} identify the slope and intercept terms in an equation, <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they correctly identified the appropriate terms. For the item in which students were asked to write a sentence explaining how the terms in the equation related to the graph, slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they conveyed how the slope term in the equation related to the slope of the graph, and intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they conveyed how the intercept term in the equation related to the intercept of the graph.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} satiety and feeding centers (SC, FC) on gastric, cecal and rectal motility were studied in rats anesthetized with urethane. Each center produced excitatory, inhibitory and biphasic responses in these organs. Cecal and rectal responses to stimulation of SC or FC were usually {{the opposite of the}} gastric response; for example, the gastric <b>response</b> <b>was</b> excitatory, whereas cecal and rectal <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> inhibitory. Gastric and cecal excitatory <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> abolished by vagotomy and the rectal response by severance of parasympathetic branches of the pudendal plexus (PSB). Gastric and ceca inhibitory <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> fairly depressed by vagotomy and abolished by successive splanchnicotomy, while the rectal inhibitory <b>response</b> <b>was</b> abolished by severance of inferior mesenteric nerves (IMN) and PSB. It was concluded that the satiety and feeding centers modulate not only gastric motility but also cecal and rectal motility, and that the excitatory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> conveyed through vagus nerves to the stomach and cecum and through PSB to the rectum. The inhibitory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> mediated mainly through vagus nerves, partially through splanchnic nerves to the stomach and cecum, and through IMN and PSB to the rectum.

5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
