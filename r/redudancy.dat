The company's first headquarters were located at Nash's own family home in Timperley, with business operations run from her kitchen table. Originally set up {{to look after the}} interests of vintage motorcycle owners, the business expanded to cover all types of motorbikes. By 1995, following a sustained period of growth, Carole Nash had 30,000 policyholders on its books.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present some <b>redudancy</b> routing {{protocols}} for dual gate networking of a cellular network. To perform routing protocols We {{have to explain}} the networking communication on wireless sensor networks which can vary from a simple star network to an advanced multi-hop wireless mesh network like MANET & VANET which is adhoc networks for vehicular and mobile networks by using Dual gate Protocols. After performing the routing through the centralized management system in cellular network, requester Ad-Hoc node forwards data via its Wi-Fi interface according to the discovered route in the Ad-Hoc mode by using <b>redudancy</b> protocols. This paper also study the principles and features of selecting protocols like ospf(open shortest path first), eigrp(enhanced-igrp) for explaining and conparing the prons and cons of routing protocols. So In this paper we will review the dual gate routing protocol by using reduduancy protoco...|$|E

A {{reliable}} circuit-design methodology [6] {{based on}} simple feed-forward neural networks (without learning) and utilizing averging and thresholding mechanisms, {{is used to}} investigate the robustness of nano-electronic circuits. The methodology, proposed earlier by some au-thors of this paper, provides a viable way of improving the reliability of nanoelectronic systems built with unreliable devices. In this work, single-electron Boolean circuits connected to a single-electron averaging-and-thresholding circuit demonstrated that the probability of proper func-tioning, hence reliability increased with the <b>redudancy</b> factor.

40|$|Abstract. Formal concept {{analysis}} {{has become an}} active field of study for data analysis and knowledge discovery. A formal concept C is determined by its extent (the set of objects that fall under C) and its intent (the set of properties or attributes covered by C). The intent for C, also called a closed itemset, is the maximum set of attributes that characterize C. The minimal generators for C are the minimal subsets of C’s intent which can similarly characterize C. This paper introduces the succinct system of minimal generators (SSMG) as a minimal representation of the minimal generators of all concepts, and gives an efficient algorithm for mining SSMGs. The SSMGs are useful for revealing the equivalence relationship among the minimal generators, which may be important for medical and other scientific discovery; and for revealing the extent-based semantic equivalence among associations. The SSMGs are also useful for losslessly reducing {{the size of the}} representation of all minimal generators, similar to the way that closed itemsets are useful for losslessly reducing the size of the representation of all frequent itemsets. The removal of <b>redudancies</b> will help human users to grasp the structure and information in the concepts...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} {{call for}} universal compression of strings over large, possibly infinite, alphabets. However, {{it has long}} been known that the resulting redundancy is infinite even for i. i. d. distributions. It was recently shown that the <b>redudancy</b> of the strings ’ patterns, which abstract the values of the symbols, retaining only their relative precedence, is sublinear in the blocklength n, hence the per-symbol redundancy diminishes to zero. In this paper we show that pattern redundancy is at least (1. 5 log 2 e) n 1 / 3 bits. To do so, we construct a generating function whose coefficients lower bound the redundancy, and use Hayman’s saddle-point approximation technique to determine the coefficients ’ asymptotic behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|We prove Strassen's {{law of the}} {{iterated}} logarithm for the Lorenz process {{assuming that}} the underlying distribution functionFand its inverseF- 1 are continuous, and the momentEX 2 +[var epsilon]is finite for some[var epsilon]> 0. Previous {{work in this area}} is based on assuming the existence of the densityf:=F' combined with further assumptions onFandf. Being based only on continuity and moment assumptions, our method of proof is different from that used previously by others, and is mainly based on a limit theorem for the (general) integrated empirical difference process. The obtained result covers all those we are aware of on the LIL problem in this area.

40|$|We propose an {{unsupervised}} {{method for}} learning multi-stage hierarchies of sparse convolutional features. While sparse coding {{has become an}} increasingly popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch level. Applying the resulting filters convolutionally results in highly redundant codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the <b>redudancy</b> between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves {{the efficiency of the}} overall representation. In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efficient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasisparse features from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces anything but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse filters, including center-surround filters, corner detectors, cross detectors, and oriented grating detectors. We show that using these filters in multistage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} was case study at Village Unit Cooperation Dau titled “Evaluation of marketing function Accounting Information System at Village Unit Cooperation Dau Malang Residence” The research aimed to evaluated the marketing system Accounting Information System which applied by Village Unit Cooperation Dau Malang Residence. Whether it was {{efficient and effective}} or not. The evaluation hoped to give information about the existing Accounting Information System, so that the management could use it as consideration for policy related with marketing activity. In this research, the writer used descriptive data analysis with phases : (1) analysis to the marketing Accounting Information System input, consisted of documents used in cash and credit sell; (2) analysis to the marketing Accounting Information System, consisted of : (a) function related with cash selling and credit selling; (b) system and procedure of cash selling and credit selling; (c) accounting note used in cash and credit selling; (3) analysis to marketing Accounting Information System, that was selling report. The research showed {{that there were a}} separation between selling, cash revenue, and accounting function in cash selling. In credit selling there also separation between selling function, cash function, credit function and debt collector, also accounting function. Document used had internal check since it had created tested mechanism. But passbook existed for credit selling was <b>redudancy.</b> In cash selling, selling invoice had no authorization from the cashier. There was cash accumulation. In cash selling procedure, the cashier could not give paid sign to the selling invoice after the buyer paid. It could make the transaction illegal since {{there was no evidence that}} the buyer had paid the stock. According to above analysis, the writer able to give suggestion to the Village Unit Cooperation. The selling invoice in cash selling should be authorized by cashier. It would erase the passbook in credit selling since the invoice had represented everything so that it would decrease passbook usage. There would be better to add inspection activities, especially sudden inspection to the stock and livestock unit. The cashier would give ”paid” sign to the selling invoice after the buyer paid. The cash should be give directly to the bank. Keywords: Accounting Information System, marketing function, Village Unit Cooperatio...|$|E
