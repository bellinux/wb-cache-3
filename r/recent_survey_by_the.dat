More than 4,000 Israelis received German citizenship in 2007, a 50 percent increase over 2005.

The seeking, attainment and possession of multiple nationalities by a Jewish individual is allowed by Israeli law, whereas other nations, require a renouncement of foreign citizenship and the voluntary attainment of a foreign citizenship can result in the loss of citizenship in that country. For example, 220 Israeli diplomats to the U.S. have received 'Green card' or Permanent Resident Alien status between 1966 and 1979 [...] but the likelihood is low that these career Israeli government officials permanently emigrated from Israel, but rather they gained a passport of convenience to travel to countries that may be less welcoming of Israeli passports.|$|E

50|$|Graduate medical {{education}} in the United States is regulated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS). Each program must provide “appropriate didactic instruction and sufficient clinical experience in managing problems of the geriatric population.” The published joint ASA/American Board of Anesthesiology content outline for in-training examinations also includes a section on “Geriatric Anesthesia/Aging: The Pharmacological Implications, MAC Changes and the Physiological Implications on Major Organ Systems.” These mandates make geriatric education a requirement for any program in anesthesiology.

A <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs reviewed ACGME policies required by 100 nonpediatric programs.
