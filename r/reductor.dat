Objetivou-se avaliar se a qualidade do efluente da estação é apropriada para a criação da espécie tilápia do Nilo (Oreochromis niloticus) e, em caso negativo, que soluções podem ser dadas para a situação. O trabalho foi desenvolvido em três tanques piscicolas: o primeiro recebeu efluente da estação e alevinos, sem alimentação complementar (denominado TA); o segundo tanque recebeu apenas efluente, (chamado TB); e o terceiro tanque recebeu água natural e alevinos, que foram alimentados com ração artificial, (nomeado TC). As análises de água realizada foram: DQO; ST; SST; SDT; NTK; NH 4 -N; NO 3 -N; PO 4 -P; DBO; medidas de transparência com Disco de Secchi; pH; temperatura; OD e condutividade; Coliformes Totais e Termotolerantes e Clorofila-a. Pretendia-se avaliar a qualidade sanitária dos peixes, bem como presença de Salmonella sp, Coliformes Fecais, Mesófilas e Clostridium sulfito redutores. Devido a problemas observados no decorrer do experimento e não previstos no plano original, tornou-se necessário fazer algumas adaptações na metodologia original. A primeira delas foi a utilização de tanques-rede nos dois tanques que receberam alevinos, até que os peixes atingissem cerca de 25 g. A segunda providência foi a inserção da fase de aclimatação, que consistia em estocar alevinos em reservatórios de água para verificar a aceitabilidade do lote (fase 1) e depois adaptar os alevinos às condições adversas às quais eles seriam expostos (fase 2). Na fase 1, os alevinos foram considerados aptos para o cultivo. Na fase 2, não se percebeu a mortandade de peixes, apesar da condição a qual eles foram expostos ter sido considerada inadequada para a criação da espécie. Contudo, a qualidade da água na fase 2 era melhor que as condições do tanque TA. Observou-se, ao final do experimento, a mortandade total dos alevinos estocados. Um dos motivos que pode ter causado esse fato foram os altos teores de amônia e as baixas concentrações de oxigênio dissolvido. O valor médio de amônia no tanque TA, durante o experimento 2 foi de 22 mg. L- 1 e a concentração média de OD, 2, 4 mg.

Its objective was to evaluate if the effluent quality from the station is appropriate for the creation of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and, if the results are negative, which solutions could be given to the situation. The work was developed in three cultivation tanks: the first one was received effluent form de station and young fish fed with the Plant effluent and received young fish without any complementary food (TA tank); the second one received only treated effluent (TB tank); and the third tank received natural water and young fish, which was given artificial ration (TC tank). The water’s analysis performed were COD, Total Solids, Suspended Solids, Dissolved Total Solids, TKN, Ammonia Nitrogen, Nitrate Nitrogen, Orthophosphate, BOD, Secchi Disk transparency, pH, temperature, DO, conductivity, total coliform, termotolerant coliform, and chlorophyll-a. The intention was also to evaluate the fish sanitary quality through the presence of Salmonella sp, faecal coliform, mesophile and Clostridiun sulfide <b>reductors</b> bactéria. Due to unpredictable problems observed during the planned experiment, it was necessary to make some adaptations to the original proposed methodology. The first one was the utilization of tanks-net inside the two thanks that recived young fish until the fish grew up 25 g. The second was inserted into the original methodology, procedure consisting of stocking young fish in separated water tanks to verify the fish suitability (phase 1) and than adapt the young fish to the adverse conditions they should be exposed (phase 2). During the phase 1, the young fish were considered able to be cultivated. During the phase 2, there was no mortality of the fishes despite the water quality for fish cultivation was considerated inapropriated. However, the water quality in the phase 2 was better than the TA tank. At the end of the experiment, it was observed the number of the stocked of dead fish. One of the reasons caused the mortality was provocate by the high ammonia contents and the low dissolved oxygen concentrations present in the cultivation tanks’ water.

50|$|The TGV 001 {{consisted}} of two power cars with three trailers in between, the whole trainset permanently coupled together. All axles were powered by electric motors, with the advantage of low axle loads and a high power-to-weight ratio. Electric traction also made possible dynamic braking, especially effective at high speeds. Each power car {{had a pair of}} turbines (the TURMO IIIG and then the TURMO X, used in Sud Aviation's Super Frelon helicopter) which ran at constant speed. They were connected to a <b>reductor</b> stage, whose output shaft drove an alternator. Besides the turbine drive, the power cars had control gear for the traction motors, dynamic brake grids, signalling and braking equipment, etc. The TGV001 was articulated, with adjacent vehicles riding on a common truck. This afforded a greater stability (by coupling the dynamics of carbodies) and made space for a pneumatic secondary suspension placed level with the centre of gravity, thus reducing roll in curves. In 5227 test runs covering almost half a million kilometres, the TGV 001 turbotrain exceeded 300 km/h (186 mph) on 175 runs and reached a top speed of 318 km/h (198 mph) on 8 December 1972.

5000|$|Society needs trust {{because it}} {{increasingly}} finds itself operating {{at the edge}} between confidence in what is known from everyday experience, and contingency of new possibilities. Without trust, all contingent possibilities should be always considered, leading to a paralysis of inaction. Trust {{can be seen as}} a bet on one of contingent futures, the one that may deliver benefits. Once the bet is decided (i.e. trust is granted), the trustor suspends his or her disbelief, and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all. Because of it, trust acts as a <b>reductor</b> of social complexity, allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered (or even impossible to consider at all); specifically for cooperation.Sociology tends to focus on two distinct views: the macro view of social systems, and a micro view of individual social actors (where it borders with social psychology). Similarly, views on trust follow this dichotomy. Therefore, on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed, with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust. The behavioural approach to trust is usually assumed [...] while actions of social actors are measurable, leading to statistical modelling of trust. This systemic approach can be contrasted [...] with studies on social actors and their decision-making process, in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain (and allow to model) the emergence of trust.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the rifle were not revealed to the public early on and so some misconceptions occurred through the development period: there was word about a sort of recoil buffer {{in the form of}} a venting system that recovered part of the gases generated by the shot and pushed it back in a space located behind the bolt; during the cycle, the bolt would thus [...] "bounce" [...] on a sort of [...] "gas cushion" [...] that acted as a buffer, dramatically reducing recoil. That provoked more than a disappointment as the production-stage VHS was reported to operate in a much more conventional manner no longer utilizing this buffering system. According to the project deposited at the European Patent Office however it seems that such voices originated from a misconception of related data, i.e. merging in one two different features: a forced air ventilation system similar to the one in Pecheneg machine gun and a mechanical buffer <b>reductor,</b> similar in conception but not identical to the one used in Ultimax 100, a weapon Croatia used in Croatian War of Independence and still has in its reserve inventory. The same patent states also that Vehesica works neither through direct gas impingement nor through a short or long stroke piston, but through a 'tappet' type of closed gas system much like the FN SCAR. There it was also another precedent design sporting some of said features, but it was rejected after the first real testing, so it is also possible that the [...] "gas cushion" [...] was instead a feature of that former model.|$|E
