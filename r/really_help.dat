5|$|In her spare time, Veronica trails Madison out of envy. After ascertaining Tim’s password, Veronica {{finds out}} that Tim is also {{investigating}} the Dean’s suicide {{and that he was}} browsing a site named “Neptune Women’s Clinic”. Veronica visits the ministry of Bonnie’s father, Ted (Chris Ellis) as well as the clinic, although neither <b>really</b> <b>help</b> in the case. She also questions Anthony, one of the witnesses of the Dean’s death (he heard the gunshot). Returning home, Veronica is greeted by Keith, who has received a letter with images of Veronica exiting the clinic. For revenge, they visit the publisher of the photos, but it doesn’t go well. Nevertheless, she does see a picture of one of Dick’s paramours, although she was not as intimate with him as Veronica thought. In the middle of the night, Mindy O’Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) contact Keith, telling him to hurry. It turns out that Steve Botando (Richard Grieco) was trying to break in, and while he is there, Keith {{finds out that}} Cyrus was planning on sending the O’Dell son to a disciplinary school and that Mindy was at the scene of Dean O’Dell’s death.|$|E
500|$|Eduardo Mondlane's successor, future President of Mozambique, Samora Machel, {{acknowledged}} {{assistance from}} both Moscow and Peking, describing them as [...] "the {{only ones who}} will <b>really</b> <b>help</b> us.... They have fought armed struggles, and whatever they have learned that is relevant to Mozambique we will use." [...] Guerrillas received tuition in subversion and political warfare as well as military aid, specifically shipments of 122mm artillery rockets in 1972, with 1600 advisors from Russia, Cuba and East Germany. FRELIMO adopted Marxism-Leninism at an early stage.|$|E
500|$|Andy Gill for The Independent {{newspaper}} took a less favourable view when he said, [...] " [...] has, as {{its title}} suggests, all {{the appeal of}} a discussion with a career adviser." [...] When he described {{the style of the}} album, Gill said, [...] "It doesn't <b>really</b> <b>help</b> matters that as they get more mature, the band appear to be indulging their interest in Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb rather more openly, despite lacking either songwriter's way with a winning melody." [...] In his 2003 book The Rough Guide to Rock, Peter Buckley described the album as [...] "a little gushing and overall disappointing".|$|E
50|$|During an interview, Sobieski {{spoke about}} her views on having {{happiness}} {{and a positive}} attitude: I think that happiness is a very strange thing. And we really feel {{that we have a}} right to this happiness. But I feel like it's constantly fluctuating, and that you can make yourself happy. I think it's an outlook. Having a positive attitude probably sounds like a corny thing to say, but a positive attitude <b>really</b> <b>helps,</b> and respecting your job <b>really</b> <b>helps,</b> and having the support of your family and friends <b>really</b> <b>helps.</b>|$|R

500|$|At first, Myst had no music, {{because the}} Millers {{did not want}} music to {{interfere}} with the gameplay. After a few tests, they realized that the background music did not adversely affect the game and, in fact, [...] "seemed to <b>really</b> <b>help</b> the mood of certain places that you were at in the game." [...] Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of synthesized music that was used in the game and later published as Myst: The Soundtrack. Mixing and effects were done on an E-mu Proteus MPS synthesizer. The soundtrack was recorded over the course of two weeks' evenings. Initially, Cyan released the soundtrack via a mail-order service, but before the release of Mysts sequel, Riven, Virgin Records acquired the rights to release the soundtrack, and the CD was rereleased on April 21, 1998.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's last match {{before the}} final was against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup, which they won 6–1. Despite the margin of victory, Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was adamant that the result meant nothing {{in regards to the}} final: [...] "Defeating Brighton has got us to the next round, but it doesn't <b>really</b> <b>help</b> us in the Carling Cup, we've got a cup final but we won't get carried away." [...] Despite missing the match against Brighton, Dalglish was {{confident}} that Daniel Agger and Craig Bellamy would be fit for the final. Going into the match Liverpool had not won a trophy since they beat West Ham United in the 2006 FA Cup Final. Dalglish stated that victory: [...] "means a lot to me, more importantly {{it means a lot to}} a lot of people who have had to endure a few years when we've not been [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Upon Blaine's first appearance, Criss {{described}} his character {{as being a}} [...] "very charismatic, put-together, composed guy." [...] He stated that although Blaine is gay, he is not [...] "overly queeny, and not too butch either," [...] and that while his sexuality is a [...] "huge part of who he is", {{it is not a}} major facet of how he wishes to be perceived. Due to similarities which stem from their shared sexuality, Blaine [...] "sees a lot of himself in Kurt, in terms of experiences and the way they feel about the world around them. He feels the need to impart his knowledge, be a source of strength for him, and <b>really</b> <b>help</b> him through what he's going through." [...] Initially, Criss felt that the most important element of his character was to give Kurt [...] "someone he can relate to", and demonstrate that Kurt could have [...] "a young out male friend, a support system".|$|E

500|$|The {{role of the}} Evil Queen/Regina went to Lana Parrilla. She {{explained}} the character, [...] "There's always two stories being told when playing Regina. There's the threat of her knowing she's an evil queen and then there's just the pure simple fact that the biological mother has stepped into her world {{and the threat of}} losing her son is just enormous. That's a fear that I think any adopted mother would have. I think that's going to <b>really</b> <b>help</b> the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would never accept the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard back from her management staff.|$|E
500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray gave Justice League #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray {{stated that}} [...] "Johns does {{a terrific job}} of pulling {{together}} what has been essentially four or five separate stories, incorporating not only the three main titles that this will span over the coming months, but introducing several new players into the mix as well." [...] He also praised that the story advanced and showed similar promise that the reboot to the New 52 did in 2011. Joshua Yehl of IGN gave {{the first chapter of}} the Trinity War a 7.8 out of 10. He felt the issue {{set the stage for the}} event and praised the character work. However, he though that the conflict was not presented clearly yet and criticized the lack of the Justice League Dark in the first issue. Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Johns manages to balance personality expositions with story breaks, giving readers a sense of who the opposing sides are, if nothing else. Johns brings lots of big moments to the pages, but the emotions he wrings from those moments <b>really</b> <b>help</b> sell this book." [...] Zawisza was surprised by the amount of time that was spent on Madame Xanadu, feeling as though it was only there for reason to include the Justice League Dark, and was wary that the characters are in danger of being absorbed by the plot. All three praised the art in the issue, especially Ivan Reis' pencils.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Out from Under" [...] {{and the other}} ballads from Circus [...] "have [...] hiccuping emotion from deep {{in the back of}} her throat". Chris Richards of The Washington Post commented that the singer [...] "emerges from her media bender hoping to forget the past" [...] with the song, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone considered it [...] "Spears' best ballad since 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman'". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said [...] "Out from Under" [...] "gleam with acoustic guitars", and that the song, [...] "My Baby" [...] and [...] "Unusual You", [...] "are the album's only attempts at warmth." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic considered the song, along with [...] "My Baby", [...] "a couple of not-good-at-all ballads", while Dave Donnelly of Sputnikmusic said both [...] "subtly evoke the Britney of old: airy pop ballads that benefit from the former Frou Frou producer's sophisticated, layered arrangements." [...] While comparing Circus to Blackout, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "the ballads are back, bringing with them the inevitable sprinkling of tedium". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that both songs [...] "are about five years out of date, and [...] vocals seem anemic and distracted in spite of the confessional lyrics." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today commented that [...] "Spears tosses in a couple of ballads along , but these really aren't her forte. The slew of top-flight producers [...] bolsters her vocal variety of echoes and gimmicky effects, but they don't <b>really</b> <b>help</b> the breathy 'Out From Under' or saccharin 'Unusual You'". Mike Newmark of PopMatters described the song as [...] "nearly-emo" [...] along with [...] "Unusual You," [...] saying both [...] "try for heartfelt and come off flabby." ...|$|E

2500|$|Then the axioms of Zermelo {{set theory}} are {{consistent}} {{because they are}} true in the model Vomega&·2. While a non-constructivist might regard this as a valid argument, a constructivist would probably not: {{while there are no}} problems with the construction of the sets up to Vomega&, the construction of [...] Vomega&+1 is less clear because one cannot constructively define every subset of Vomega&. This argument can be turned into a valid proof in Zermelo–Frenkel set theory, but this does not <b>really</b> <b>help</b> because the consistency of Zermelo–Frenkel set theory is less clear than the consistency of Zermelo set theory.|$|E

2500|$|During Operation Pillar of Defense, Im Tirtzu {{published}} {{an open letter}} in American Jewish newspapers addressed to the New Israel Fund chair. The letter gave examples of NIF funded organizations that Im Tirtzu said accused Israel of war crimes, and asked if the NIF agrees with their accusations. The NIF rebutted Im Tirtzu's charges, stating, [...] "Not one {{of the human rights}} organizations Im Tirtzu attacks accused Israel of war crimes in the recent Gaza action." [...] NIF also quoted Avichai Mandelblit, the IDF's Chief Military Advocate General during Operation Cast Lead: [...] "The organizations are a conduit for getting information on very important matters so that IDF activity is normative.... I'm trying to get at the truth and they <b>really</b> <b>help</b> us do that. Our cooperation with B'tselem [...] stands out.

2500|$|The game {{ended with}} a final score of 79–10. North Texas's points came on a field goal {{in the third quarter}} and a 69-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza to Casey Fitzgerald {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter. The Mean Green finished with 15 yards rushing and 232 yards passing. All three of Oklahoma's quarterbacks saw gametime. Joey Halzle followed Bradford in the third quarter and completed four of his five pass attempts. Nichol finished the game, but did not attempt a pass. The Sooners had 668 yards of total offense against North Texas, the 11th-highest in school history to that point, and 403 passing yards, the fifth-highest in school history to that point. Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t <b>really</b> <b>help</b> either. They got on the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock. I’m not criticizing, I’m just saying that the style of play doesn’t help either.” Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer agreed: [...] "They had no game plan for losing… Because when you can't win a game, you need to run the clock, don't let it stop, don't throw passes incomplete… get the game over with, get on the bus and go home." [...] Stoops requested a running clock for the fourth quarter, but the request was not granted. North Texas's coach handled the loss well and held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win. [...] "When you play a great team like that, you always have the chances of obviously this happening,” Dodge said. [...] "Give credit where credit is due – a great Oklahoma football team. Um ... Wow! Very, very impressive.” ...|$|E
