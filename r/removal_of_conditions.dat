The specificity of the non-covalent interactions of H and L chains was particularly well brought out by competitive recombination experiments where an individual H chain had a choice of recombining with its own L chain or with the L chain obtained from another myeloma protein. In this manner a spectrum of affinities between individual H chains and several L chains was demonstrated. In {{the vast majority of}} recombinations there was a clearcut preference for recombination to take place between the H and L chains derived from the same protein.

40|$|A {{procedure}} (“discrete-trial” avoidance) was {{devised to}} differentiate between the two main theories of responding in Sidman's “free-operant” avoidance procedure.

Although powerful numerical methods, such as the finite element method exist for the investigation of a multitude of problems in structural mechanics, a closed-form analytical method provides the researcher with a faster, cheaper, versatile and more practical tool of analysis. An analytical solution based on the Galerkin-Vlasov variational principle applied to the Donnell-Mushtari equations of motion is developed, with trial functions taken as the products of beam functions.

40|$|The glucose-regulated protein (GRP) {{system in}} {{mammalian}} cells is induced by glucose deprivation, anoxia, the calcium ionophore A 23187, and 2 -deoxyglucose. In Chinese hamster ovary cells the major GRPs are approximately equal to 76, 97, and 170 kDa. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> {{each of these}} four GRP-inducing stresses leads to the coordinate repression of GRPs and induction of the major heat shock proteins at 70 and 89 kDa.

Ethnographic research with industry members reveals some key features of planning practices that underlie such events.

One practice at tender stage is a pricing technique that minimises the tender price while maximising the out-turn cost of a contract by exploiting mistakes in the bill of quantities. Another is the programming of work to maximise its vulnerability to delay.

These and other similar practices may be reported as features of an integrated culture, defined in such a way as to encompass activity and reject Cartesian dualism.
