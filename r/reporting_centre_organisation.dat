40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that the {{empirical}} evidence that the tayloristic option of call <b>centre</b> <b>organisation</b> is limited, has its reasons in structural organisational dilemmata that cannot be solved but only worked upon by call <b>centre</b> <b>organisation.</b> Organisations that use call centre technology may increase their efficiency. But {{at the same time}} they must import and produce organisational slack in order to deliver the expected and promised flexibility. Our point is that they face this problem in a strategic and self-reflexive way especially by recruiting certain types of employees. The status and biographical situation of these employees provides the organisation with useful skills, subjective potential and commitment. Organisational patterns of and employee contributions to slack production vary with different services and customer expectations. " (excerpt...|$|R

40|$|Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) is {{the process}} of {{contracting}} out services to a third party vender either domestically or offshore. The purpose is to rationalise cost by getting rid of non core components of business. Over the last one decade, the BPO organisations in India have witnessed high growth as fierce competition among Multinational organisations to reduce cost has prompted them to shift their non core operations to low cost and high quality destinations like India. Call centres fall under the general umbrella of business process outsourcing. Stress is an unavoidable part of an individual's working life. Various studies conducted on Indian call <b>centre</b> <b>organisations</b> have highlighted the prevalence of high occupational stress. Call centre employees work long shifts, often during night, thus, becoming easy victims of various psycho-physiological ailments. For present study, convenience sampling was used to collect information from three different organisations in National Capital Region in India. Personal interviews were conducted to identify the various factors causing occupational stress among employees of call <b>centre</b> <b>organisations.</b> The major factors identified are monitoring of employees, angry customers, changing identity, performance metrics, and night shift...|$|R
