5|$|Following {{the demise}} of German naval power in the Pacific the fleet unit concept was no longer seen as being relevant, and Australia {{did not have a}} clear role. As a result, post-war budget cuts {{prompted}} the <b>RAN</b> <b>to</b> take the battlecruiser out of active service, as the large share of resources and manpower consumed by Australia could be better used elsewhere in the RAN. In August 1920 the battlecruiser was rated by the Naval Board as 11th out of the RAN's 12 priorities. Accordingly, the ship's company was reduced later that year and she was assigned to Flinders Naval Depot as a gunnery and torpedo training ship. In the event of a major conflict, Australia was to serve in a role akin to coastal artillery. She was not considered to have been placed in reserve at this time, however, as it was not possible for the <b>RAN</b> <b>to</b> provide a trained complement at short notice.|$|E
