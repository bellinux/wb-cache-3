50|$|In entomology, {{the term}} brood {{is used to}} refer to the embryo or egg, the larva and the pupa stages in the life of {{holometabolous}} insects. The brood of honey bees develops within a bee hive. In man-made, <b>removable</b> <b>frame</b> hives, such as Langstroth hives, each frame which is mainly brood is called a brood frame. Brood frames usually have some pollen and nectar or honey in the upper corners of the frame. The rest of the brood frames cells may be empty or occupied by brood in various developmental stages. During the brood raising season, the bees may reuse the cells from which brood has emerged for additional brood or convert it to honey or pollen storage. Bees show remarkable flexibility in adapting cells to a use best suited for the hive's survival.|$|E
5000|$|There {{will often}} be a raised {{reference}} point about 1/3 {{down from the}} nut to the bridge at either the [...] "D" [...] or [...] "Eb" [...] position (where the notes [...] "D" [...] or [...] "Eb" [...] are found on the [...] "G" [...] string)) to represent the 'neck heel' of the acoustic bass. Many EUBs have wooden or metal bars to brace the instrument against the musician's body, to act as the upper bouts of a wooden double bass. The wooden or metal brace bars help the EUB to rest against the player's body in a position roughly {{similar to the way}} a double bass rests against the body. The most complete example of this is the Yamaha 'silent bass' which has a <b>removable</b> <b>frame</b> designed to match the outline of right hand side and left upper bout of an upright bass allowing for easy transference of double bass techniques. Most EUBs are fretless, but a small number are fretted, to facilitate their use by players of fretted electric bass.|$|E
50|$|In modern <b>removable</b> <b>frame</b> hives {{the nursery}} area {{is in the}} brood chamber, which beekeepers prefer {{to be in the}} bottom box. In the late winter and early spring as the brood cycle begins, the queen starts to lay eggs within the winter cluster in {{proximity}} to available honey stores. Honey bees tend to greatly expand the brood chamber as the season progresses. The relative location of the brood chamber within the beehive may also change as bee keepers add more boxes or as wild bees build fresh comb into available cavities. Some beekeepers ensure that the queen will not go into the upper boxes (called supers or honey supers) by placing a screen called a queen excluder between the boxes. The screen has precisely measured open spaces through which a worker bee can pass, but not a queen. Some beekeepers do not use excluders, but try to keep the queen within the intended brood area by keeping a honey barrier of capped honey, which the queen is reluctant to cross, above the brood. In feral hives the honey bees tend to put the brood at bottom center of the cavity, and honey to the sides and above the brood, so beekeepers are trying to follow the natural tendency of the bees.|$|E

40|$|Splint {{is one of}} the therapies {{to support}} the {{periodontal}} healing; aims to stabilize the teeth so the occlusal load can be distributed equally to all other teeth. Periodontal splint can be used temporarily or permanently. The <b>removable</b> <b>frame</b> partial denture can be functioned not only for replacing the missing teeth but also as permanent splint. Initial therapy has been implemented to all cases on this report, consists of scaling, root planning, occlusal adjustment and surgical therapy including curettage, flap operation, but apparently teeth mobility still existed. In order to support the periodontal tissue health, the frame of removable partial denture is needed as splint.

This study reported a case of patient with missing teeth on left and right lower first and second molar, with TMJ symptoms. Other symptoms felt by the patients were ear pain, and shoulder pain. After detailed examination, pre-prosthetic treatment needed by the patient was the TMJ treatment. The usage of occlusal splint {{as one of the}} methods to treat the TMD were i. e. to eliminate the occlusal disorder, to reduce the neuromuscular activity, and to regain a stable centric relation. After splint treatment, an open bite on the posterior teeth appeared. To solve this problem, a <b>removable</b> <b>frame</b> prosthesis enhanced with overlay rest was fabricated. With this prosthesis, the TMJ symptoms stopped recurring.

The company is actively expanding its assortment of products, and through an initiative by Cedervall Arkitekter AB, {{they decided to}} develop a lift for canteens. The company {{had not had a}} similar product in their line before. The aim of this project was to produce a lift for canteens that lives up to the requirements of both the company and the users, and present production material for a fully functioning prototype. In order to achieve the goals, information was gathered from different sources and the problem was carefully analyzed. A user research was conducted and was the starting point of the structured concept generation. The final concept was further developed and through 3 D-CAD models and drawings, a prototype was produced and tested by a cook. The result was a canteen lift made of stainless steel, which attaches to the back of boiling bain maries. A single drive connected to a hand control, elevates the lift. When the lift is in its top position, the canteen can easily be pulled onto a table trolley, without having to be lifted. A <b>removable</b> <b>frame</b> can easily be attached to the lift and facilitates tilting of the canteen in cases when the boiling canteen should be replaced before serving, and the food poured into another canteen.

The peculiar, semispherical form of the box has no predecessor. The surface is decorated with an engraved Tree of Life, with gilding in the leaves. This decoration has parallels in the early ninth century. The box might therefore derive from the Carolingian court workshop of this earlier time.

5|$|In 1970, {{the model}} M400 was released, which {{contained}} 35 notes (G–F) and a <b>removable</b> tape <b>frame.</b> It sold over 1,800 units. By the early 1970s, hundreds {{of the instruments}} were assembled and sold by EMI under exclusive licence. Following a financial and trademark dispute through a US distribution agreement, the Mellotron name was acquired by American-based Sound Sales. Streetly-manufactured instruments after 1976 were sold under the name Novatron. The American Mellotron distributor, Sound Sales, produced their own Mellotron model, the 4-Track, in the early 1980s. At the same time Streetly Electronics produced a road-cased version of the 400– the T550 Novatron. By the mid-1980s, both Sound Sales and Streetly Electronics suffered severe financial setbacks, losing their market to synthesizers and solid-state electronic samplers, which rendered the Mellotron essentially extinct. The company folded in 1986, and Les Bradley threw most of the manufacturing equipment into a skip. From 1963 until Streetly's closure, around 2,500 units had been built.|$|R
50|$|A minipiano {{differs from}} a piano in many ways. The primary factor that sets it apart from types of piano still {{manufactured}} {{today is the}} fact that the soundboard, the piano wires and the mechanics of the instrument which both strike and dampen these strings, are extended beneath the instrument rather than above it (as in an upright piano) or behind it (as in a grand piano). It is also well known for its 'braceless' removable back. Braces are wooden pieces designed to support the structure of the instrument, but are entirely unnecessary when the back consists of a single <b>removable</b> wooden <b>frame</b> with a central support beam. Fabric is firmly stapled to the inside of this removable back to prevent dust getting through. What makes some models of the 'Pianette' quite exceptional is the way the tuning pins extend from behind the metal soundboard at the back into which the tuning pins are inserted through to the front, allowing the instrument to be tuned without actually having to remove the braceless back.|$|R

Materials and Methods: Two finite element models were designed for a second premolar and a <b>removable</b> partial denture <b>frame</b> containing an I-bar clasp. Maximum Principal Stress (S 1) and Von Mises Stress (SEQV) were assessed along a cervicoapical path of nodes in the PDL. Results: Output data for S 1 and SEQV were the same regarding the height of contour. A gradual decrease in both models was observed. A larger decrease was found in the model with the higher angle of cervical convergence. Conclusion: I-bars placed on teeth with lower angles of cervical convergence produce a higher stress to the PDL of abutments...|$|R
40|$|When {{compared}} to a conventional attachment, a (semi) precision attachment for a cast metal <b>frame</b> <b>removable</b> partial denture can perform a number of functions better. Proper assessment of {{the condition of the}} abutment teeth is needed for an adequate indication. Selecting the type of (semi-) precision attachment is primarily determined by the available maxillomandibular space, the crown length as well as the possibility of adequate oral self-care. With regard to technical characteristics, (semi-) precision attachments are classified according to measures of freedom. The distinct types are cast intra- and extra-coronal, adhesive and overdenture (semi-) precision attachments. With the lapse of time, some wear of the different parts of an attachment may occur, requiring specific subsequent care. Whether or not in combination with oral implants, (semi-) precision attachments often offer patients improved self-confidence and self-image. However, the relatively high cost is a barrier to apply (semi-) precision attachments widely...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} prosthetic {{replacement of}} absent teeth, a treatment plan is necessary. In evaluating whether replacement of teeth is sensible, {{the causes and}} consequences of tooth loss must be considered. This concerns information about problems {{having to do with}} the patient, potential complications, purely prosthodontic problems, and specific problems. The patient-related problems require collecting data through patient history as well as a clinical and radiologic examination. Complications are risk-factors which negatively influence the prognosis of general health or of a treatment. Potential complications should be eliminated as much as possible through a preliminary treatment. Purely prosthodontic problems are conditions in the area of absence of several teeth or parts of them, and in the area of occlusal and mandibular stability and articulation. Specific problems may be related to inadequate interocclusal space and the quality of the abutment teeth. A cast metal <b>frame</b> <b>removable</b> partial denture may be a relatively inexpensive and minimally treatment alternative for an expensive and complicated treatment with 1 or more fixed partial dentures...|$|R
25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, linear motion table, stepper motor and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a <b>removable</b> stretching <b>frame,</b> which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|R

50|$|Like {{several other}} glider {{designers}} {{of the early}} 1930s, Lajos Rotter was impressed by Alexander Lippisch's Wien of 1929 and his high performance, single seat Karakán bears its influence. Like the Wien, the Karakán was a high aspect ratio sailplane with a two-piece high wing with a rectangular plan centre section and long, straight tapered outer panels. Both had thick section wings at the root which became progressively thinner over the outer panels. On both designs, ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of these outer panels. Structurally, the wings were similar, with two spars of unequal strength; the forward spar beams were part of plywood covered D-boxes around the leading edges and the rear spar was a lighter simple beam. The wings were fabric covered behind the main spar, as were the ailerons. Both designs had, on each side, an airfoil-faired V-form strut from the lower fuselage to the outer ends of the centre section, the forward member of the V, connected to the main spar, was more substantial than the rear.At a more detailed level, there were many {{differences between the two}} aircraft.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to examine the {{justification}} of forming active prosthetic segments on the abutment teeth for the incline of the elements of removable partial denture. Methods. The investigation was performed during 3 -years observational period, at the Prosthodontic Clinics of Belgrade University Dental School, and the Military Medical Academy (MMA). During the mentioned observation period two groups of 200 patients with different kinds of edentulousness were analyzed, indicated for the design of metal <b>frame</b> <b>removable</b> partial dentures (MFRPD) with cast clasps. A total of 400 patients represented 50 % of the sample chosen by random choice method for the determined observational period and dental institutions. Results. The evaluation of justification of the abutment teeth preparation was done during the analysis of the requirement of forming: guide planes, planes for occlusal rests, vestibular under cut, oral under cut. Conclusion. Upon the evaluation of the performed analyses the following can be concluded: during the composition of every MFRPD it is necessary to use at least two or more guide planes, depending on the type edentulousness of patients' teeth; formation of guide planes is performed in excessively high number of the abutment teeth (over 95 %); during the composition of each particular MFRDP it is necessary to use as more occlusal rests as possible, at least 3, or more, which also depends on the type of patients' edentulousness; composition of the planes for occlusal rest has to be performed in almost all the patients (over 95 % of the abutment teeth); vestibular planes of the abutment teeth should be prepared in over 50 % of the used teeth; oral planes are prepared within the preparation of the abutment teeth for other active prosthetic segments. Conclusion. It is necessary to perform the composition of active prosthetic segments according to the plan established for the study models, both if the preparation of teeth for the adoption of MFRDP elements with clasps represents the use of an uninvasive, or an invasive dental method...|$|R
50|$|The {{president}} of the Women's Centennial Committee was Elizabeth Duane Gillespie, great grand daughter of Benjamin Franklin. Gillespie led the Women's centennial executive committee in raising money to create the first Women's pavilion in exposition history. With the help of Gillespie, the women's centennial committee reached their goal of 82,000 signatures in 2 days {{to raise money for}} the pavilion, she also helped convince Congress to give the committee more money. Female organizers of the event drew upon deeply rooted traditions of separatism and sorority, as they planned, funded and managed their own pavilion and devoted it entirely to the artistic and industrial pursuits of their gender. Their overall goal was to increase female confidence and choices, win woman's social, economic, and legal advancement, abolish unfair restrictions discriminating against their gender, encourage sexual harmony, and gain influence, leverage, and freedom for all women in and outside of the home. They had to build their own building because they lost their spot in one of the larger pavilions (Main Building) due to a large increase in foreign interest. It only took them 4 months to raise the needed funds to build the pavilion. Their goal was to only use women to build their pavilion, even to power their own building. To which they did except for one aspect which was the design of the building. The building was designed by Hermann J. Schwarzmann. The Centennial Women not only showed domestic production but they also employed a popular means for justifying female autonomy outside of the home as well. They did this by demonstrating to visitors what ways women were making a profitable living. When entering the building visitors found exhibits that demonstrated positive achievements and influence such as; industrial and fine arts: wood-carvings, furniture-making, and ceramics; fancy articles: clothing, and woven goods, philanthropy: philosophy, science, and medicine; education; literature; and inventions. The pavilion also exhibited over eighty patented inventions for example: a reliance stove, a hand attachment for a sewing machine, a dish-washer, a fountain griddle- greaser, a heating iron with <b>removable</b> handle, a <b>frame</b> for stretching and drying lace curtains, and a stocking and glove darner. Mexico participated in the pavilion's exhibits, indicating the growth of a sector of elite women during the Porfirio Díaz regime of the late nineteenth century, with many individual women sending examples of woven textiles and embroidery.|$|R
