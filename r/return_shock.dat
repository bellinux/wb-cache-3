This paper also reveals that the relationship between future volatility and its risk premium is surprisingly negative when a negative <b>return</b> <b>shock</b> has been realized.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{stochastic}} volatility model assuming that the <b>return</b> <b>shock</b> has a Skew-GED distribution. This allows a parsimonious yet flexible treatment of asymmetry and heavy tails in the conditional distribution of returns.

Inference is conducted under a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain MonteCarlo methods for computing the posterior distributions of the parameters. More precisely, our Gibbs-MH updating scheme makes use of the Delayed Rejection Metropolis-Hastings methodology as proposed by Tierney and Mira (1999), and of Adaptive-Rejection Metropolis sampling.

(1) It decreases following macroeconomic news announcements; (2) it does not change systematically during the high-news months when firms announce quarterly earnings; and (3) it increases substantially with our measures of dispersion-in-beliefs across traders about the market’s common-factor signal.

40|$|Cycles in the {{behavior}} of stock markets have been widely documented. There is an increasing body of literature on whether stock markets anticipate business cycles or its turning points. Several recent studies assert that financial integration impacts positively on business cycle comovements of economies. We consider three Western equity markets, represented by their respective stock indices: DJIA (USA), FTSE 100 (UK), and Euro Stoxx 50 (euro area). Connecting these three markets together via vector autoregressive processes in index returns, we construct "propagation values" to measure and trace, on a daily basis, the relative importance of a market as a volatility creator within the network, where volatility is due to a <b>return</b> <b>shock</b> in a market. A cross-wavelet analysis reveals the joint frequency structure of pairs of the propagation value series, in particular whether or not two series tend to move in the same direction at a given frequency. Our main findings are: (i) From 2001 onwards, the daily propagation values of markets have been fluctuating much less than before, and high frequencies have become less pronounced; (ii) the European markets are in phase at business cycle frequency, while the US market is not in phase with either European market; (iii) in 2008, the euro area has taken over the leading role.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the asymmetry between {{positive and negative}} returns in their effect on conditional variance {{of the stock market}} index and incorporate the characteristics to form an out-of-sample volatility forecast. Contrary to prior evidence, however, the results in this paper suggest that no asymmetric GARCH model is superior to basic GARCH(1, 1) model. It is our prior knowledge that, for equity returns, it is unlikely that positive and negative shocks have the same impact on the volatility. In order to reflect this intuition, we implement three diagnostic tests for volatility models: the Sign Bias Test, the Negative Size Bias Test, and the Positive Size Bias Test and the tests against the alternatives of QGARCH and GJR-GARCH. The asymmetry test results indicate that the sign {{and the size of the}} unexpected <b>return</b> <b>shock</b> do not influence current volatility differently which contradicts our presumption that there are asymmetric effects in the stock market volatility. This result is in line with various diagnostic tests which are designed to determine whether the GARCH(1, 1) volatility estimates adequately represent the data. The diagnostic tests in section 2 indicate that the GARCH(1, 1) model for weekly KOSPI returns is robust to the misspecification test. We also investigate two representative asymmetric GARCH models, QGARCH and GJR-GARCH model, for our out-of-sample forecasting performance. The out-of-sample forecasting ability test reveals that no single model is clearly outperforming. It is seen that the GJR-GARCH and QGARCH model give mixed results in forecasting ability on all four criteria across all forecast horizons considered. Also, the predictive accuracy test of Diebold and Mariano based on both absolute and squared prediction errors suggest that the forecasts from the linear and asymmetric GARCH models need not be significantly different from each other...|$|E

The model generates plausible consumption, wealth accumulation and portfolio choice profiles. I also perform several sensitivity analyses {{to see the}} importance of our model parameters to the results. I show that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) parameter {{is an important factor}} when individuals make consumption decisions. An individual with low IES accumulates more wealth over the lifetime. Skewness and elongation, governed by g and h parameters respectively, are crucial when individuals make portfolio choices. An individual tend to invest less in risky assets when risky asset returns are negatively skewed and fat-tailed. Finally, I estimate the model parameters that allow the model results to match with empirical mean stock/bond ratio and median wealth/income ratio. I show that the flexibility of Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences and g-and-h stock return distribution allows us to bring the calibrated risk aversion down to lower than 4. ^ The second chapter examines how households should optimally consume and allocate their portfolio choices between stocks and bonds when we recognize that the Social Security benefit is progressive and wage indexed. The household decision rules are fundamentally altered. This chapter also investigates the welfare impacts of possible mistakes made by households in their financial planning process, including portfolio choices, retirement timing, and consumption and saving decisions. We find that retirement timing barely changes welfare at all, while portfolio choice mistakes decrease welfare moderately. On the other hand, consumption and saving mistakes lower welfare tremendously by as much as 14 %. Our findings have important policy implications. Policy makers and financial planners should switch their focus from investment and retirement timing to getting households to consume right and save smartly. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} studying how investment banks affect hedge fund equity investments through acting as prime brokers for hedge funds. The first chapter studies how {{the relationships between}} hedge funds and investment banks are maintained through equity issuance and prime brokerage business. Using a comprehensive dataset of hedge funds and IPO allocations, I examine IPO allocation decisions by investment banks to hedge funds. I find that investment banks whose prime brokers have strong relationships with hedge funds and are lead underwriters of IPOs tend to allocate more IPOs to these hedge funds. Moreover, the allocation to hedge funds is larger when IPOs are underpriced, and the allocations are larger during bearish periods compared to bullish periods. I further document that hedge fund investments in IPOs {{are determined by the}} strength of hedge fund-prime broker relationships, rather than by hedge fund manager skills. I also find that hedge funds which have multiple prime brokers tend to invest in more IPOs. As a result, prime brokers implicitly support hedge funds through favorable IPO allocations. The second chapter finds that hedge funds can profit from anticipating upcoming changes in analysts 2 ̆ 7 recommendations before they become public. I provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that hedge funds that have prime brokerage affiliations with analysts 2 ̆ 7 investment banks have access to information on upcoming analysts 2 ̆ 7 recommendations. Focusing on recommendations issued up to two days following stock holding report date, I find that large hedge funds that are clients of the investment bank (affiliated hedge funds) tend to buy upgrades and sell downgrades in a larger magnitude compared to other hedge funds before the public release of recommendations. Moreover, relative to non-affiliated hedge funds, affiliated hedge funds have a higher probability to trade {{in a way that is}} consistent with upcoming recommendation changes and earn higher (or avoid lower) short-term abnormal returns by buying (or selling) before upgrades (or downgrades). The results indicate that prime brokerage affiliation is an important source of private information on analysts 2 ̆ 7 reports for hedge funds. The third chapter studies hedge funds 2 ̆ 7 equity investment strategies by examining the investment value and risk consequence of their holdings concentration in large-cap and small-cap stocks. We find that stocks, especially small-cap ones, with concentrated hedge fund holdings earn higher future returns than those with less concentrated holdings. We also find that stocks with concentrated hedge fund holdings have higher downside risks, and the holdings concentration expedites the drop of stock performance, especially during financial crisis. In addition, small-cap stocks with higher holdings concentration are associated with hedge funds using higher leverage, consistent with Stein (2009) that deleverage leads to the negative <b>return</b> <b>shock</b> and downside risks in stocks.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in asset pricing. The first essay demonstrates {{the application of a}} Bayesian methodology of regressor selection to factor pricing models. Bayesian Variable Selection (BVS) algorithms offer robust, intuitive methods for determining the inclusion of specific regressors within a regression framework. These algorithms can be vastly more efficient than traditional, frequentist approaches. After constructing a BVS framework, I apply this methodology to test a factor asset-pricing model, using 270 different portfolios, spanning 8 different sorting characteristics, onto 5 popular factors - the Fama-French factors (SMB, HML, MKT), a measure of aggregate "liquidity" (the Pastor-Stambaugh liquidity measure from Pastor and Stambaugh (2003)), and the Carhart measure of momentum (UMD). Results show that the Fama-French three factors have average inclusion probabilities of. 93,. 69, and. 66, respectively. There is marginal evidence that the momentum risk factor is priced (. 22 probability of inclusion). There is little evidence that the measure of liquidity is priced (. 11 probability of inclusion). The apparent nonpricing of liquidity may be due to even liquidity-spreading across portfolios. Applying BVS to the CRSP universe of individual securities from 1962 to 2008, I find a notable reduction in the MKT factor (an average inclusion of. 19), an increase in the intercept (the stock ɑ), a reduction in the inclusion of the momentum factor, and an inclusion of the liquidity factor of. 21. This suggests that the liquidity measure is more relevant when pricing individual securities, and the momentum factor is more relevant when pricing portfolios. In the second essay, I explore one potential channel in which firms are exposed to the idiosyncratic shocks to the returns of other, seemingly unrelated, firms. This essay expands our understanding of flow-related price pressure by demonstrating that induced flow is one channel in which idiosyncratic shocks can affect seemingly unrelated firms (controlling for common factor and industry shocks). Looking at mutual fund portfolios and instrumenting to address potential flow/return endogeneity, I find that the shocks to other firms in common mutual fund portfolios induce future portfolio flows, which induce portfolio rebalancing and result in temporary price pressure on a given firm. A one standard deviation increase in the flow-induced price pressure corresponds to a. 15 -. 6 % increase in daily abnormal firm returns. This pressure fully reverses in 5 - 6 days, and the magnitude is larger if funds experience a net outflow than if they experience a net inflow. Liquid firms are more sensitive than illiquid firms to this price pressure. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that managers experiencing a portfolio <b>return</b> <b>shock</b> adjust the most liquid assets in expectation of fund flows. If investors are unable to properly estimate the correlations induced by being in common portfolios, they are unable to fully diversify away idiosyncratic risk. Finally, the third essay, co-authored with Li An, further expands our understanding of mutual fund managers and the pricing effects that result from their trading behavior. This study investigates a V-shaped disposition effect - the tendency to sell relatively big winners and big losers - in the trading behavior of mutual fund managers. We find that a 1 % increase in the magnitude of unrealized gains (losses) is associated with a 4. 2 % (1. 6 %) higher probability of selling. We link this trading behavior to equilibrium prices and find, consistent with the relative magnitude found in the selling behavior regressions, that a 1 % increase in the magnitude of gain (loss) overhang predicts a 1. 4 (. 9) bp increase in future returns. An overhang variable capturing the V-shaped disposition effect strongly dominates the monotonic capital gains overhang measure of previous literature in predictive return regressions. Alternative V-shaped overhang measures produce similarly consistent results. One of the major contributions of this essay is to step beyond simply documenting the existence of this behavior among mutual fund managers and to shed light on the other predominant characteristics of the managers that are most likely to manifest this effect. Funds with higher turnover, shorter holding period, higher expense ratios, and higher management fees are significantly more likely to manifest a V-shaped disposition effect...|$|E
40|$|Using data on {{corporate}} profits forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, I decompose real stock returns into a fundamental news component {{and a return}} news component and analyze {{the effects of the}} Great Moderation on each. Empirically, the response of each component of real stock returns to the Great Moderation has been quite different. The volatility of fundamental news shocks has declined by 50 % since the onset of the Great Moderation, suggesting a strong link between underlying fundamentals and the broader macroeconomy. Alternatively, the volatility of <b>return</b> news <b>shocks</b> has remained stable over the Great Moderation period. Since the bulk of stock market volatility is attributable to <b>return</b> <b>shocks,</b> the Great Moderation has not had a significant effect on stock return volatility. These empirical findings are shown to be consistent with Campbell and Cochrane's (1999) habit formation asset pricing model. In the face of a large decline in consumption volatility, the volatility of fundamental news shocks declines while the volatility of <b>return</b> <b>shocks</b> stagnate. Ultimately, the effect of a Great Moderation in consumption volatility on overall stock return volatility in the habit formation model is slight. Stock - Prices; Stock market...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} the stochastic volatility model which allows for level shifts in volatility of stock market returns, known as structural breaks. These shifts are endogenously driven by large <b>return</b> <b>shocks</b> (innovations), reflecting large pieces of market news.

In addition to this, it has a number of interesting features which enable us to study the effects of large <b>return</b> <b>shocks</b> on future levels of market volatility.

40|$|Abstract – We {{investigate}} asymmetric volatility effect (the negative {{partial correlation}} between volatility and lagged return), conditioning volatility {{changes to the}} sign of cumulative return {{over the past ten}} days.

We explain the role of past cumulative return based on the behavioral bias labeled “disposition effect ” by Shefrin and Statman (1985). Using a measure of average capital gain instead of cumulative return, to proxy for intensity of disposition effect, as proposed by Grinblatt and Han (2005), we confirm our conjecture that for negative capital gain volatility is more sensitive to <b>return</b> <b>shocks.</b> But we also find, consistently with our argument, that for positive capital gain volatility is less sensitive to <b>return</b> <b>shocks.</b> JEL classification: G 11, G 1...|$|R

40|$|Of the {{two most}} widely {{estimated}} univariate asymmetric conditional volatility models, the exponential GARCH (or EGARCH) specification can capture asymmetry, which refers to the different effects on conditional volatility {{of positive and negative}} effects of equal magnitude, and leverage, which refers to the negative correlation between the <b>returns</b> <b>shocks</b> and subsequent shocks to volatility. However, the statistical properties of the (quasi-) maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of the EGARCH parameters are not available under general conditions, but only for special cases under highly restrictive and unverifiable conditions, such as EGARCH(1, 0) or EGARCH(1, 1), and possibly only under simulation. A limitation in the development of asymptotic properties of the QMLE for the EGARCH(p,q) model is the lack of an invertibility condition for the <b>returns</b> <b>shocks</b> underlying the model.

The results from the VARMA-GARCH model and the VARMA-AGARCH model suggest the presence of volatility spillovers and asymmetric effects of positive and negative <b>return</b> <b>shocks</b> on conditional volatility. Finally, the DCC model suggests that the conditional correlations can vary dramatically over time. In general, the dynamic conditional correlations in rubber spot and futures <b>returns</b> <b>shocks</b> can be independent or interdependent. Keywords: returns, futures returns.

40|$|Abstract__ Of the {{two most}} widely {{estimated}} univariate asymmetric conditional volatility models, the exponential GARCH (or EGARCH) specification can capture asymmetry, which refers to the different effects on conditional volatility {{of positive and negative}} effects of equal magnitude, and leverage, which refers to the negative correlation between the <b>returns</b> <b>shocks</b> and subsequent shocks to volatility. However, the statistical properties of the (quasi-) maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of the EGARCH parameters are not available under general conditions, but only for special cases under highly restrictive and unverifiable conditions, such as EGARCH(1, 0) or EGARCH(1, 1), and possibly only under simulation. A limitation in the development of asymptotic properties of the QMLE for the EGARCH(p,q) model is the lack of an invertibility condition for the <b>returns</b> <b>shocks</b> underlying the model. It is shown in this paper that the EGARCH(p,q) model can be derived from a stochastic process, for which the invertibility conditions can be stated simply and explicitly. This will be useful in re-interpreting the existing properties of the QMLE of the EGARCH(p,q) parameters...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} widely-used multivariate {{conditional}} volatility models is the dynamic conditional correlation (or DCC) specification. However, the underlying stochastic process to derive DCC {{has not yet been}} established, which has made problematic the derivation of asymptotic properties of the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimators (QMLE). To date, the statistical properties of the QMLE of the DCC parameters have been derived under highly restrictive and unverifiable regularity conditions. The paper shows that the DCC model can be obtained from a vector random coefficient moving average process, and derives the stationarity and invertibility conditions. The derivation of DCC from a vector random coefficient moving average process raises three important issues: (i) demonstrates that DCC is, in fact, a dynamic conditional covariance model of the <b>returns</b> <b>shocks</b> rather than a dynamic conditional correlation model; (ii) provides the motivation, which is presently missing, for standardization of the conditional covariance model to obtain the conditional correlation model; and (iii) shows that the appropriate ARCH or GARCH model for DCC is based on the standardized shocks rather than the <b>returns</b> <b>shocks.</b> The derivation of the regularity conditions should subsequently lead to a solid statistical foundation for the estimates of the DCC parameter...|$|R
