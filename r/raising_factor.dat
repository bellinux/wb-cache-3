40|$|The Complex South-Transdanubian Regional Competitiveness Research was a questionnaire-based {{research}} in 2005 - 2007 {{with the main}} goal of measuring competitiveness. Competitiveness can be defined by many people. It is possible to interpret it by region, industry, company or product. During the research we investigated the competitiveness on company level, so those factors which affect the competitiveness of a company. The research team developed a Competitiveness Index, which classifies the competitiveness of companies into different categories. Discriminant analysis was used the test the Index, multivariable logistic regression to examine the different competitiveness groups. When creating the index we took into consideration the changing of target markets, we matched self-maintainment with adaption to changes. We included research and development (as an indication of innovation), {{and the rate of}} marketing budget. We identified the existence of strategic alliances as company networking is a competitiveness <b>raising</b> <b>factor</b> for small and medium-sized enterprises. Further variable included was workforce fluctuation, since motivation and employee satisfaction is in very close relationship with it. Eventually the variables of the Competitiveness Index became the following: research and development, changing of target markets, adaption to changes, rate of marketing budget, participation in strategic alliances, workforce fluctuation. With the help of the Competitiveness Index we created three categories of companies participating in the research. The variables of the competitiveness index created by this way have become the following: falling behind, average, leading. The Index described above can be used to measure regional relative company competitiveness, {{and with the help of}} it, it is possible to give practical advice to develop companies.

The simultaneous {{existence of the}} urban informal sector and the urban unemployment has been explained interms of such efficiency wage relation. Two different production structures have been considered in this paper: first, formal capital is specific to the urban formal sector, while informal capital is mobile between the rural sector and the urban informal sector;second, formal capital is mobile between urban formal sector and the rural sector, while informal capital is specific to the urban informal sector. Our investigation shows that rural subsidization reduces unemployment and <b>raises</b> domestic <b>factor</b> income in both cases. However, such a policy may lower domestic factor income in the original models of Gupta(1997) and Grinols (1992). Subsidization to the urban formal sector raises unemployment and domestic factor income in the two different production structures. However, such a policy may produce ambiguous effect in the original model of Grinols(1991). Interestingly, subsidization to the urban informal sector leads to different effects in the two different cases. In the case of capital mobility between informal sector and rural sector, this raises unemployment and lowers domestic factor income {{and in the case}} of capital mobility between formal sector and rural sector this policy lowers unemployment and <b>raises</b> domestic <b>factor</b> income.

40|$|Development cost {{is defined}} as the ratio of {{development}} expenditures in a given year to reserves added in that year. Changes in development cost are a good proxy for changes in finding cost and in user cost, because discovery, development, and postponement or holding of hydrocarbons in place, are three competing forms of investment. Popular definitions of "finding" cost are an illogical and useless mixture of discovery and development. Although the discovery of large oil fields peaked before 1930, oil reserves added by development increased then stabilized around 1960. Costs tended if anything to decrease through 1972, but the decrease was mostly a one-time gain through the retreat from a costly regulatory scheme. The first price explosion in 1974 saw a strong decline in oil reserves added. The second price explosion was followed by an increase, but the best performance since 1949 - 51 came in 1983 - 85, when oil prices were declining by nearly one fourth in real terms. High oil and gas prices promoted a drilling boom, which <b>raised</b> <b>factor</b> prices and lowered efficiency. Old-field development was therefore inhibited, but then helped as the boom deflated.
