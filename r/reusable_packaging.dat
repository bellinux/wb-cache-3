40|$|<b>Reusable</b> <b>packages</b> are {{logistic}} items {{used for}} the shipments of goods from a producer to its customers and which, once the goods have been consumed by the customers, are {{to be returned to}} the producer. This doctoral thesis addresses the strategic design and the operational management of large independent reverse networks for their return flows when fixed transportation costs apply. At the strategic level, we identify the economic logic by which the allocation of the customers should be made and the optimal shipment sizes determined. We then deal with the issues {{of the size of the}} fleet of <b>reusable</b> <b>packages</b> and of the use and locations of intermediary facilities. We further discuss the impacts of having a standard fleet of packages when compared to a heterogeneous fleet and of capacity limits on transportation. At the operational level, we tackle the problem of the coordination of the flows. Our main contribution is to show that, in large granular networks, finding very good solutions to this problem is relatively easy and natural. We suggest a myopic heuristic procedure to solve this problem and derive lower bounds on the optimal cost. We also evaluate the cost impact of using a discrete review policy instead of a continuous policy and we finally discuss the impact of variability and lead times in transportation. Although the insights are derived for reverse networks, the assumptions used in this thesis are relatively general. The models could easily be applied on delivery networks or integrated forward and reverse networks. (ECON 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{contributes}} {{to address the}} fundamental challenge of build-ing Concurrent Data Types (CDT) that are reusable and scalable at the same time. We do so by proposing the abstraction of Polymorphic Transactions (PT) : a new programming abstraction that offers different compatible transactions that can run concurrently in the same application. We outline the commonality {{of the problem in}} various object-oriented languages and implement PT and a <b>reusable</b> <b>package</b> in Java. With PT, anno-tating sequential ADTs guarantee novice programmers to obtain an atomic and deadlock-free CDT and let an advanced programmer leverage the application se-mantics to get higher performance. We compare our polymorphic synchronization against transaction-based, lock-based and lock-free synchronizations on SPARC and x 86 - 64 architectures and we integrate our methodology to a travel reservation benchmark. Although our reusable CDTs are sometimes less efficient than non-composable handcrafted CDTs from the JDK, they outperform all reusable Java CDTs. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, lab on chips (LOCs) {{require the}} {{development}} of new technologies in order to integrate complex fluidics, sensors, actuators, etc. Such integration requires overcoming both technological bottlenecks and an increase in production cost. We propose a technique to manufacture reusable and complex LOCs made up of SU- 8 resist for the fluidic structure and of glass for the hard packaging, and are compatible with the integration of thick electrodes. The method is based on the combination of two bonding technologies, both based on a wafer bonder. The first one consists of the bonding of a thin photosensitive SU- 8 dry film, which is similar to lamination. The second one is the standard bonding technique which uses a hard substrate covered by an SU- 8 layer. The LOCs that can be obtained by combining these two methods are transparent, and include 3 D microfluidic structures and thick electrodes. Moreover, these LOCs are <b>reusable,</b> <b>packaged</b> and ready to use. In order to validate the concept, we designed an LOC devoted to cell arraying, using dielectrophoresis, as well as to cell electroporation...|$|R

30|$|Sustainable {{consumption}} is {{often associated with}} the purchase of green and/or organic products (Biswas and Roy, 2015). Consumers adopting sustainable purchasing behaviour prefer such products and are willing to pay a price-premium for them (Tuten, 2013). What accounts for the higher price is the higher cost of production so as not pose a danger to the environment (Shobeiri et al., 2016). 61 % of consumers are willing to pay a 5 % higher price to purchase green products (Lim, 2017). Retailers also promote green products within their communication strategies aimed at educating and informing consumers about the characteristics and advantages of such products, as well as the recycling and of eco-friendly, <b>reusable</b> <b>packages</b> or packages made of reused materials (Tuten, 2013; Tariq, 2014). As soon as customers become aware of these aspects, they focus their attention on retailers that promote such behaviour.

40|$|The {{mandatory}} deposit for one-way drinks packaging, {{embodied in}} the German Packaging Ordinance of 1991, entered into force in January 2003, after the condition for its implementation was given {{by the fall of}} the market share of <b>reusable</b> drinks <b>packaging</b> under 72 % in 1997. In this context the author doubts that the German mandatory deposit is an effective instrument to stabilise the market share of ecologically advantageous drinks packaging. Rather it is to be expected that the environmental policy objectives can be accomplished more effectively by a reorientation of the specific environmental policy. Hence it needs to be considered that – even eleven years after the first time decrease of the relevant market share of <b>reusable</b> drinks <b>packaging</b> – an urgent need for action exists in Germany. This practise based analysis therefore deals with packaging-taxes as an alternative environmental policy instrument and points out recommendations against the background of a further amending of the German Packaging Ordinance as well as experiences from the use of packaging taxes in Europe. agri-environmental policy, biodiversity conservation auctions, transaction costs, ecological services, plant biodiversity, experimental economics, EAFRD-Regulation...|$|R

40|$|Computing optimal {{controls}} for nonlinear nonsmooth dynamical systems is an ex-tremely challenging task. In recent years, we introduced {{a family of}} pseudospectral methods for the accurate computation of optimal {{controls for}} highly nonlinear systems. While these methods are applicable for generic nonlinear systems, {{they can also be}} exploited for systems that exhibit certain differential-geometric properties. These tech-niques are encoded in the <b>reusable</b> software <b>package,</b> DIDO. In this paper, we harness the structured sparsity of pseudospectral methods and show that a significant increase in computation speed can be achieved. This facilitates a rapid design of the outer-loop of a two-degree-of-freedom control system. We demonstrate the viability of our approach for several example problems involving smooth nonlinearities, path constraints and control saturation limits. ...|$|R
