40|$|A {{simplified}} ration optimization {{method was}} applied to a beef cattle fattening system to evaluate the utilization of food by-products under various situations. The method was extended to reduce feed costs (i. e., economic factors) and nitrogen and phosphorus excretions (i. e., environmental factors) by introducing penalty coefficients of nitrogen and phosphorus contents in each ingredient of the diet in the objective function in traditional linear programming. Six regional food by-products, five commercial concentrates and two roughages were used as ingredients of the fermented total mixed ration. Constraints for the feed formulation were based mainly on nutrient requirements in the Japanese Feeding Standard for Beef Cattle. The <b>replacement</b> <b>price</b> (or acquisition cost) of food by-products {{was defined as the}} maximum price of food by-products when the feed cost with the use of food by-products was below the cost with the use of conventional concentrates. The results showed that although the replacement prices were not greatly affected by the penalty levels, they were associated with the changes in the substitution rate of food by-products for concentrates and the price of concentrates. The replacement prices were about 16 (yen/kg, as-fed basis) against the present price level of concentrates, when food by-products were substituted for a half of concentrates. Feed compositions were altered and nitrogen and phosphorus excretions were decreased by the changes of penalties, in spite of the small change in the <b>replacement</b> <b>price</b> of food by-products. Both nitrogen and phosphorus penalties greatly reduced the nitrogen and phosphorus excretions, indicating that nitrogen and phosphorus penalty coefficients should be introduced together in the objective function in order to reduce both excretions efficiently...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} key {{features}} of the bargaining process during staged financing between the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur using cooperative bargaining theory. Firstly, we construct a two-stage cooperative bargaining model to study how the price (at which capital is invested) is determined over stages. Then we examine the interrelation of cash flow rights and control rights over the investment stages. We show that the venture capitalist may manipulate his control rights to obtain an unfairly higher share split from the bargaining process. This kind of behavior can only be partly governed by existing mechanisms, such as market reputation. With this model we identify the possible consequences arising from the venture capitalist's opportunism. Finally we examine the existing mechanisms and find that the <b>replacement</b> <b>price</b> {{in the form of}} a certain share works better than that {{in the form of a}} fixed payment. We propose that this model can be used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis as well as the design of effective bargaining process in the future. We also use numerical examples to illustrate our model. Keywords: staged financing, venture capital, bargaining, control rights, opportunism I...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research was initiated {{due to a}} report claiming that The U. S. Navy significantly overestimated repair prices in a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) reward to a contractor. The purpose of this thesis {{is to develop a}} model for improving the prediction of repair price for U. S. Navy inventory items. The thesis examines several prediction methodologies, including a ratio-estimator prediction method that is a modification of the methodology currently in use, as well as regression analysis. In contrast to the ratio-estimator approach, regression is able to utilize a wide range of predictor variables, several of which are evaluated in the thesis research. Results of this analysis reveal that a regression model with logarithmic transformations yields more accurate predictions of repair prices than the current methodology. This improvement is seen especially for items that have the highest <b>replacement</b> <b>price.</b> One feature of the proposed regression-based methodology is that predicted repair prices for the most expensive items are substantially lower than with the current methodology. In the case where that prompted the thesis research, the overstatement of benefit from the PBL would have been reduced by about 30 million under the proposed methodology.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{simulation model}} of a dairy farm was, developed to allow {{the investigation of the}} effects of varying manage~ent decisions in dairy herds. The primary purpose of this model is to quantify the economic effects of different calving patterns with respect to production and reproductive performance. The revenues and costs associated. with dairy cows with different calving patterns were calculated. The feed costs were calculated according to the consumption of forage (silage or grass) and concentrate, as estimated from energy requirements. Furthermore, the <b>replacement</b> <b>price,</b> calf revenue and the financial loss associated with involuntary culling were considered. The economic value of fertility was estimated using this model; the change in gross margin {{as a result of an}} increase in fertility in the herd was estimated by changing the servicing and conception rates in the simulated herd. These changes had consequences for the culling rate and replacement costs. The. change in gross margin resulting from a 10 % absolute change in servicing and a 5 % change in conception rate was estimated to be between Ã‚Â£ 50 and Ã‚Â£ 90 per cow per year. Through improvement of both conception and servicing rates, careful management of reproduction can greatly improve profitability in a dairy herd. The model was also used to examine the economic consequences of relaxing fertility culling in an all-year calving herd. Model validation was conducted using data from National Milk Records; the validation was based on a comparison between the model and two contrasting real herds. The real herds were chosen by looking at the key performance indices within the Herd Companion tool. The model was then parameterised to simulate each of the contrasting real herds in turn.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{contributes}} {{by encouraging}} {{discussions about the}} public policy of setting tariffs for public services based {{on the value of}} the investment made by the providers of these services. The purpose of this study was, in an unprecedented way and by combining theories of equity valuation and finance, to identify the asset valuation method that can lead to a fair value and balance between an affordable price for the consumer and an adequate return on investment for the concessionaires. The value assigned to these assets affects the tariff in two ways: (i) via depreciation/amortization, which affects the cost of service; (ii) via the return on investment, which is the portion that corresponds to the investor’s profit. We analyzed the Brazilian electricity sector, in which the rates set by the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) currently use the new replacement value (NRV) approach. We carried out empirical tests using data available on the ANEEL website from the second cycle periodic tariff review and information obtained in financial statements from 1995 onwards. The analysis included the NVR and restated historical cost (RHC) methods, the latter being updated by the extended consumer price index (IPCA). After the descriptive and statistical analyses, we used the test of means to verify the differences between the variables in terms of NRV vs. RHC. The first conclusion was the absence of {{a significant difference between the}} NRV and RHC methods; that is, on average, the <b>replacement</b> <b>price</b> showed no significant difference to what would be the pure and simple restatement of assets. But this was found to hide something relevant, the fact that this average is derived from two main groups: that of the consumers who are paying more for energy services than they should, which constitutes a visible benefit to investors and loss for these consumers, and that of the consumers who are paying less than they should, which benefits them but harms investors...|$|E

These general fields are called major classifications. Each major classi­fication covers one profession or general line of business, such as: AGRICULTURE ENGINEERING SERVICE lUEDICINE AND SURGERY. Under each major' classification are listed specific activities and these are called minor classifications. For example: AGRICULTURE (Major) Forage Crops (Mino?') Grains (Minor) Sugar Beels (Mino?,) ENGINEERING SERVICE (Major) Civil (Minor) Electrical (Minor) Mechanical (Mino?') 5 MEDICINE AND SURGERY (Maim') hlternal Medicine (M 1 :nor) Obstetrics (MinoT) Pediatrics (Minor) Your prospective member must fit into a minor classification {{under one of the}} major classifications. Suppose she owns a florist shop. Turn to the major classification FLORICULTURE. Under that major you will find eight minors. Since she markets flowers to the retail trade, her minor classification will be "Flowers-retail". Now you have her classified: FLORICULTURE (Maior Classification) Flowers-retail (Minor Classification). If you have no one in your club already filling this classifi­cation, "Flowers-retail", she is eligible to apply for member­ship. A new member is loaned a classification. She is invited to hold a specific classification when invited to membership. Each member is invited to hold the minor classification representing the activity of her firm or her profession. When her membership is terminated, the classification is again open and may be offered to someone else. BALANCED CLASSIFICATIONS AND PERCENTAGES Each club should try to have representation from as many classifications as possible. Representatives of many different kinds of businesses and professions from different parts of a city make for a stronger and more interesting club. In order to maintain a balance of elassifications a club may have only 20 per cent of its membership from one major classification, except in special instances which are indicated in the Guide. These special majors may have 30 per cent representation. For ex­ample: 20 per cent of a club's membership may be accepted under the major CAFETERIAS, RESTAURANTS AND TEA ROOMS. Result: A club with 30 members may have 6 members under this major (each with a different minor). A club with 40 members may have 8 members under this major (each with a different minor). 30 per cent of a club's membership may be accepted under the major BUSINESS SERVICES. Result: A club with 30 members may have 9 members under this major (each with a different minor). A club with 40 members may have 12 members under this major (each with a different minor). It is necessary to remember that these members must rep­resent different activities and must hold different minor classi­fications. For example: I:) The 6 members under the major CAFETERIAS, RESTAU­RANTS AND TEA ROOMS must each represent a different kind of eating establishment (automat, cafe, cafeteria, cater­ing establishment, coffee shop, delicatessen, lunch room, restaurant or tea room). Two members cannot represent the same kind of establish­ment (unless both represent the same firm and one is being offered associate membership, see Article XVII, Section 3 of the By-Laws). It is wise for each club to make a survey of its own member­ship. First, a committee makes a careful study of the classifica­tions already represented in the membership of the club. The next step is to make a list of classifications unfilled. The third step is to survey the community for outstanding women who represent those unfilled classifications. EUGIBIUTY The Membership Committee in determining eligibility for membership must learn the following: 1. Whether the prospective member holds an independent or executive position and arnli. her_ livelihood therefrom. 2. What minor classification her business or profession would entitle her to hold. 3. Whether this minor classification is open in the club. 4. Whether she is personally desirable and whether her membership would add to the prestige of the club. The position held by the person determines her eligibility. The prospective member must be practicing her profession in­dependently or must be holding an executive position in relation to the firm or institution she represents. Briefly, an executive is a "decision maker". Unquestioned executive job titles are: manager, owner, partner, director, superintendent, president, vice-president, etc. Non-executive job titles are: bank clet'k, bookkeeper, file clerk, newspaper reporter, receptionist, record librarian, salesperson, stenographer-secretary, technician and visitor. If a prospective member lacks an executive title, her application should be accompanied by a letter from her employer specifically confirming her executive status. It is advised that clubs write the headquarters office regarding any questions concerning eligibility or classification. SUMMARY OF RULES A member represents a specific line of activity. The general field covering her activity is the major and the specific line is her minor. 20 per cent of a club's membership may be accepted under each major (except in some instances when 30 per cent may be accepted). The job title (such as manager) determines eligibility but the business of the firm determines her classifi­cation. 7 Since Quota is a union of clubs under the title of Quota Club International, Inc., the President and General Secretary, with GUIDEthe Membership Classification Committee, reserve the right todeny membership to any proposed member if, in their judgment,such action seems to be to the best interests of Quota Club Inter­ACCOUNTING national. The Membership Committee may also take necessary action to find acceptable minors in specialized cases of doubtful classifications. Appeals from such action may be taken to the Board of Directors of Quota Club International by any local club. Pending consideration of any application for membership the International President shall have the power to suspend action by a club or organizer as to a person proposed for membership. Only the Board of Directors of Quota Club International may make changes in the Guide. Clubs have the privilege of requesting the International Board of Directors to approve ad­Certified ditional minor classifications. Clubs should not invite a prospec­Chartered tive member to membership unless an open classification has been found in the Guide to offer her. Persons cannot be accepted for whom there is no classification in this Guide. Changes in the Guide are not retroactive and it is not neces­sary to drop members whose classifications fail to conform. After June, 1952, prospective members must be admitted in accordance with classifications listed in this Guide. NOTES Care of Guide: It {{is the responsibility of the}} local Membership Chairman to bring her copy of the Classification Guide to all business meet­ings and all meetings of the Membership Committee. It is her duty, when she leaves office, to deliver her copy of the Guide to the new Membership Chairman. It is also the duty of the Club President, when she leaves office, to hand her copy to her successor. Side Headings: Words in italics, such as Services, are side headings only_____ mLa" _ 1 lQ.

40|$|In {{his article}} “The Allocation of Resources in the Presence of Indivisibilities,” Scarf {{points out that}} the major problem {{presented}} to economic theory by the presence of indivisibilities is the impossibility of detecting optimality {{at the level of the}} firm, or the economy as a whole, using the creation of profitability based on competitive linear prices. In the absence of such competitive prices, Scarf instead introduces a quantity test. Further development of the quantity test idea has lead to algorithms that are used to solve parametric integer programming problems. However, the quantity test is not a fully acceptable <b>replacement</b> of <b>prices</b> to analyse markets with indivisibilities. Recently, O’Neill et al. have suggested a new scheme that generates discriminatory equilibrium prices in markets with non-convexities. In this paper we elaborate this idea even further and use it to generate non-linear price functions that can be interpreted as a non-linear pricing scheme for markets with non-convexities...|$|R
30|$|These reforms {{essentially}} {{involved a}} <b>replacement</b> of <b>price</b> supports with direct subsidy payments based on historical production. Since DP do not directly affect farmers’ price uncertainty as price supports do, these payments theoretically have a less distorting effect on production and risk decisions (Sckokai and Moro 2009). DP have the potential, however, to increase farmers’ wealth, {{which tends to}} slightly increase the risk appetite {{over the long term}} (Kazukauskas et al. 2013). Decoupled subsidies ought to reduce income variability as they are more predictable and not dependent on production (Fidrmuc et al. 2013) cited in (Kazukauskas et al. 2013). However, it is this very predictability that makes decoupled payments attractive as collateral to financial institutions (Rizov et al. 2013). This gives farmers the opportunity to increase debt levels and increase production which can ultimately lead to higher income risk. DP also act as a type of income insurance for farmers which crowds out other “natural” risk management strategies such as diversification and may induce less risk averse behaviour (El Benni et al. 2012; Falco et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{programming}} {{to solve the}} Markov decision process problem of optimal insemination and replacement decisions was adapted to address large dairy herd management decision problems in the US. Expected net present values of cow states (151, 200) {{were used to determine}} the optimal policy. States were specified by class of parity (n = 12), production level (n = 15), month of calving (n = 12), month of lactation (n = 16), and days open (n = 7). Methodology optimized decisions based on net present value of an individual cow and all replacements over a 20 -yr decision horizon. Length of decision horizon was chosen to ensure that optimal policies were determined for an infinite planning horizon. Optimization took 286 s of central processing unit time. The final probability transition matrix was determined, in part, by the optimal policy. It was estimated iteratively to determine postoptimization steady state herd structure, milk production, replacement, feed inputs and costs, and resulting cash flow on a calendar month and annual basis if optimal policies were implemented. Implementation of the model included seasonal effects on lactation curve shapes, estrus detection rates, pregnancy rates, milk <b>prices,</b> <b>replacement</b> costs, cull <b>prices,</b> and genetic progress. Other inputs included calf values, values of dietary TDN and CP per kilogram, and discount rate. Stochastic elements included conception (and, thus, subsequent freshening), cow milk production level within herd, and survival.

On May 13, David Rader was hired to serve as both offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach as the replacement for both Aaron Price and Eric Price. On May 23, Dave Ungerer was hired to serve as special teams coach as the <b>replacement</b> for Aaron <b>Price.</b> The final coach added was Charlie Harbison as running backs coach as the replacement for Kasey Dunn.|$|R
50|$|In the New Year, {{a series}} of injuries, {{including}} to full-back Ginger Price and captain George Carter, led to a fall off in form. In the Hampshire Senior Cup, the holders Freemantle were defeated at the second attempt in the semi-final (in which Angus was sent off) leading to the final, where St. Mary's lost to a team from the Royal Engineers. In the final, <b>Price's</b> <b>replacement,</b> Rowthorn, suffered serious internal injuries, thus ending his football career. Shortly afterwards, St. Mary's recruited a replacement full-back, when they signed Lachie Thomson from Stoke. Thomson {{was the first of}} several players to be recruited from Stoke; he would be joined by six of his former Stoke colleagues by October 1895.|$|R
5000|$|The Animals' {{recording}} was {{propelled by}} a bass guitar riff from Chas Chandler, soon joined by an electric twelve-string guitar riff from Hilton Valentine; {{in the view}} of musicologist Walter Everett, the doubled line gave the song its strength. Dave Rowberry (Alan <b>Price's</b> <b>replacement)</b> on organ gave the record the sound that distinguished the Animals from other [...] "British Invasion" [...] groups, differing from Dave Clark Five's Mike Smith's through its darker timbre. Music writer Dave Marsh compared the dual part to a rock version of pointillism. Then lead singer Eric Burdon's low-pitched, gruff vocal entered with lyrics that author James E. Perrone thought rhetorically matched Burdon's origins from Tyneside in the working class North East England: ...|$|R
30|$|On {{the basis}} of this study on intake and {{digestibility}} of nutrients, rumen fermentation attributes and nutritional profile of Malpura sheep, it may be suggested that complete rations using non conventional feed ingredients could be successfully made and tried in the diet of sheep {{to bridge the gap between}} demand and supply and to get maximum economic production. Feed costs were reduced by 26 % when PJP replaced up to 50 % of the concentrate diet of sheep, without affecting their growth (Sawal et al. 2004). The local price of PJP is observed to be 25 % of the price of concentrate mixture and thus at 40 % level of <b>replacement</b> the <b>price</b> would be reduced by 30 %. In a series of experiments, Talpada et al. (2002) also found suitability of incorporating PJP in the complete diet of crossbred calves. Thus, PJP that is available at ease with the farmers of semi-arid/arid tropics could very well substitute cereal grains and oil cakes in the concentrate mixture. This would encourage the incorporation of unutilized or underutilized feeds and thereby harnessing and optimizing maximum benefit from the available natural resources for sustainability.|$|R
40|$|The high {{replacement}} {{costs of}} aircraft gas turbine blades and vanes {{have created a}} fast-growing, highly-specialized segment of the aircraft repair industry. The economic rationale for repair in lieu of replacement is prima facie. The metallurgical rationale is less certain, but satisfactory flight performance over the past twenty-five years at least attests to the technical adequacy of blade and vane repairs. Blade repairs, other than re-coating, generally consist of weld overlays on low-stress blade tip or tip shroud locations. On average, high-pressure turbine blades undergo two repair cycles before replacement. Low-pressure turbine blades similarly require repair but are replaced less frequently. Dimensional restoration of a subtly distorted component to demanding original equipment standards is a real engineering challenge. Coating technology is an equally sophisticated aspect of blade repair. Vane repairs are more avant-garde ranging from platform dimensional restoration to complete airfoil replacement. Vane airfoil crack repair is commonplace and involves a multiplicity of metallur. gical processes {{many of which are}} still maturing. The future of blade and vane repair, like the past, will be determined by <b>replacement</b> part <b>pricing.</b> The technical considerations will remain as they are but repair will probably become less labor-intensive as automation becomes more feasible...|$|R
40|$|The {{installment}} {{of a new}} government has augmented the prospect for implementing disinflation and exchange rate unification in Myanmar. A {{close look at the}} state budget shows that the reform of the budget system for state economic enterprises (SEEs) is essential. Reforms need to hold the <b>replacement</b> of controlled <b>prices</b> including the official exchange rate with market prices in SEE operations, and the separation of the SEEs from the state budget. But separating the SEEs from the state budget will necessitate careful planning to cope with SEE bankruptcies which would imposes another fiscal burden on the government. Therefore, economic viability must be a criterion for the continuation of their operations.

40|$|The {{success of}} river {{restoration}} was estimated using the ecosystem services approach. In eight pairs of restored–unrestored reaches and floodplains across Europe, we quantified provisioning (agricultural products, wood, reed for thatching, infiltrated drinking water), regulating (flooding and drainage, nutrient retention, carbon sequestration) and cultural (recreational hunting and fishing, kayaking, biodiversity conservation, appreciation of scenic landscapes) services for separate habitats within each reach, and summed these to annual economic value normalized per reach area. We used locally available data and literature, did surveys among inhabitants and visitors, {{and used a}} range of economic methods (market value, shadow <b>price,</b> <b>replacement</b> cost, avoided damage, willingness-to-pay survey, choice experiment) to provide final monetary service estimates. Total ecosystem service value was significantly increased in the restored reaches (difference 1400 ± 600 € h...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAs part of wider {{developments}} {{to improve}} the quality of the UK National Accounts, ONS will introduce two key improvements to the methods by which volume estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) are calculated in the Blue Book 2011 consistent Quarterly National Accounts release, which will be published on 5 October 2011. The first will be the harmonisation of the deflators used across the accounts. The second is <b>replacement</b> of Retail <b>Price</b> Index (RPI) series with Consumer Price Index (CPI) series in forming the deflators. This article sets out how these changes will affect the components of the UK National Accounts. It also explains how this will bring the UK methods into line with international best practice and improve the coherence of volume measures within the UK National Accounts, as well as assisting international comparability. ...|$|R
50|$|Vernon played irregularly for Middlesex Second XI from 1970, {{and made}} his first-team debut in 1974 as an opening bowler. In July 1974, in his third County Championship match, he took 6 for 58 and 5 for 54 against Somerset, twice dismissing Viv Richards leg-before, and dismissing Brian Close for a pair, the first in Close's long career. Vernon took four wickets in seven balls in the second innings. With his pace he was {{regarded}} as a possible long-term <b>replacement</b> for John <b>Price</b> in the Middlesex team, but he was unable to maintain his form, and his appearances in first-class cricket were irregular. His best List A cricket figures came in his first match, when he took 3 for 13 off eight overs against Yorkshire in June 1974. He toured Bangladesh with MCC in 1976-77.|$|R
