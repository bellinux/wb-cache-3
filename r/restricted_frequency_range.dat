Use of VCD to complement the IR allows one to add sign information to the frequency information so that features occurring in the overlapping <b>frequency</b> <b>ranges</b> that might arise from different secondary structures can be better discriminated.

Three-dimensional measurements of the surfaces of the tympanic membrane and of the auditory ossicles malleus, incus and stapes are carried out and geometrical models are created. On the basis of these data, finite-element models are constructed and the dynamic behaviour of the combinations tympanic membrane with malleus in its elastic suspensions and stapes with annular ligament is simulated.

40|$|Hyperacusis is a {{frequent}} auditory disorder where sounds of normal volume are perceived as too loud or even painfully loud. There is {{a high degree of}} co-morbidity between hyperacusis and tinnitus, most hyperacusis patients also have tinnitus, but only about 30 - 40 % of tinnitus patients also show symptoms of hyperacusis. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of hyperacusis, detailed measurements of loudness discomfort levels (LDLs) across the hearing range would be desirable. However, previous studies have only reported LDLs for a <b>restricted</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>range,</b> e. g. from 0. 5 to 4 kHz, or from 1 to 8 kHz. We have measured audiograms and LDLs in 381 patients with a primary complaint of hyperacusis for the full standard audiometric frequency range from 0. 125 to 8 kHz. On average, patients had mild high-frequency hearing loss, but {{more than a third of}} the tested ears had normal hearing thresholds, i. e. ≤ 20 dB HL. LDLs were found to be significantly decreased compared to a normal-hearing reference group, with average values around 85 dB HL across the frequency range. However, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that LDL measurements are neither sensitive nor specific enough to serve as a single test for hyperacusis. There was a moderate positive correlation between hearing thresholds and LDLs (r = 0. 36), i. e. LDLs tended to be higher at frequencies where hearing loss was present, suggesting that hyperacusis is unlikely to be caused by hearing threshold increase, in contrast to tinnitus for which hearing loss is a main trigger. Moreover, our finding that LDLs are decreased across the full range of audiometric frequencies, regardless of the pattern or degree of hearing loss, indicates that hyperacusis might be due to a generalized increase in auditory gain. Tinnitus on the other hand is thought to be caused by neuroplastic changes in a <b>restricted</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>range,</b> suggesting that tinnitus and hyperacusis might not share a common mechanism...|$|E

However, the main defects of the plane speaker are their multiresonance of the vibrating membrane.

The large frequency separation is often one of the first outputs from asteroseismic studies because it can help constrain stellar properties like mass and radius. We have used three methods for estimating the large separations: use of individual p-mode frequencies, computation of the autocorrelation of frequency-power spectra, and computation of the power spectrum of the power spectrum. The values of the large separations obtained by the different methods are offset from each other and have differing sensitivities to the realization noise. A simple model was used to predict solar cycle variations in the large separations, indicating that the variations are due to the well-known solar cycle changes to mode frequency.

40|$|The cochlea behaves like {{a bank of}} band-pass filters, segregating {{information}} into different frequency channels. Some aspects of perception reflect processing within individual channels, but others involve the integration of information across them. One instance of this is sound localization, which improves with increasing bandwidth. The processing of binaural cues for sound location has been extensively studied. However, while the advantage conferred by bandwidth is clear we currently know little about how this additional information is combined to form our percept of space. We investigated the ability of cells in the auditory system of guinea pigs to compare interaural level differences (ILDs), a key localization cue, between tones of disparate frequencies in each ear. Cells in auditory cortex, believed to be integral to ILD processing (Excitatory from one ear, Inhibitory from the other: EI cells), separately compare ILDs over <b>restricted</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>ranges,</b> not consistent with their monaural tuning. In contrast, cortical EE (Excitatory from both ears) cells showed no evidence of frequency-specific processing. Both cell types are explained by a model in which ILDs are computed within separate frequency channels and subsequently combined in a single cortical cell. Interestingly, ILD processing in all inferior colliculus cell types (EE and EI) is largely consistent with processing within single matched frequency channels from each ear. Our data suggests a clear constraint on the way that localisation cues are integrated: cortical ILD tuning to broadband sounds is a composite of separate frequency-specific binaurally sensitive channels. This frequency-specific processing appears after the midbrain...|$|R

For example, the volcanic tremor prior to the magma eruption at Sakurajima, western Japan (Kamo et al. 1977), represented a clear series of spectral peaks within 1 – 10  Hz that changed with time, suggesting a resonance of the conduit and temporal changes of the properties of the material within it. On the other hand, volcanic tremors with a period near 15  s were also observed at the Aso volcano; this was related to the resonance of a shallow crack (e.g., Kawakatsu et al. 2000). Aki and Koyanagi (1981) reported that a continuous harmonic tremor under Kilauea, Hawaii, varied with time in relation to the flow of magmatic fluid in a deep magma source. Volcanic tremors were also observed during a phreatic eruption (e.g., Ogiso et al. 2015).

Here, we used in vivo two- photon calcium imaging {{to measure the}} sensitivity of layer II/III neurons in mouse primary auditory cortex (A 1) to interaural level differences (ILDs), the principal spatial cue in this species. Although most ILD-sensitive neurons preferred ILDs favoring the contralateral ear, neurons with either midline or ipsilateral preferences were also present. An opponent-channel decoder accurately classified ILDs using the difference in responses between populations of neurons that preferred contralateral- ear-greater and ipsilateral-ear-greater stimuli. We also examined the spatial organization of binaural tuning properties across the imaged neurons with unprecedented resolution. Neurons driven exclusively by contralateral ear stimuli or by binaural stimulation occasionally formed local clusters, but their binaural categories and ILD preferences were not spatially organized on a more global scale. In contrast, the sound frequency preferences of most neurons within local cortical regions fell within a <b>restricted</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>range,</b> and a tonotopic gradient was observed across the cortical surface of individual mice.

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) man-made noise levels {{are based on}} measurements performed in the 1970 s. Measurements carried out since then showed that the noise caused by ignition systems reduced, but man-made noise in business areas and city centers increased. But the interference scenario changed: from analog communication systems in relatively free space to digital systems in living areas, often semi-enclosed such as offices, industrial production areas, and even cars and trains. Measurements in these semi-enclosed environments show a much higher, up to 60 dB, manmade noise level. The higher noise level is not only due to a shorter distance {{to the source of}} emission, but mainly due to mistakenly assumption that compliance with a harmonized product standard is sufficient evidence of compliance with the European EMC directive. This is an incorrect and a wrong assumption. The EMC directive gives essential requirements to comply with. The use of harmonized product standards only gives a presumption of conformity.

Indeed, classical quasi-static methods generally neglect the inertia effect of the porous sample and the coupling between the surrounding fluid and the frame: they are <b>restricted</b> to low <b>frequency</b> <b>range</b> (< 100 Hz) or specific sample shape. In the present method, the porous sample is placed in a cavity to avoid a lateral airflow. Then a specific electrodynamic ironless transducer is used to compress the sample.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of methods for the validation of complex non-linear models of helicopter dynamics using measured flight data. The approach which has been adopted is based on the use of a series of simplified descriptions involving linearised models for each flight condition. Estimates of parameters in each of these linearised models, as found from the application of system identification techniques to flight data, are compared with parameter values in an equivalent linearised description obtained from the theoretical nonlinear model. In broad terms the aim is to achieve matching trends for both sets of parameters and thus establish the validity of the nonlinear model from which the linearised descriptions are derived. This use of system identification techniques as a means of validating flight mechanics models has required the development of improved tools for helicopter parameter identification. Frequency-domain methods of identification have been found to have advantages over more conventional time-domain methods. Important advantages of the methodology include the use of a <b>restricted</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>range</b> for the estimation of parameters of the rigid-body model and the incorporation of time delays into the model. Both of these are facilitated by the formulation of the problem in the frequency domain and have been found to provide practical benefits in the estimation of parameters of six-degrees-of-freedom models in which higher-order dynamics associated with rotor modes cannot be represented explicitly...|$|E

However, little is known about changes in the separate components of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), which may be distinguished by examining phase gradients. The effects of aspirin on the phase gradient of the DPOAE 2 F 1 –F 2 obtained with fixed frequency ratio sweeps were studied longitudinally in a group of twelve subjects in whom a temporary hearing loss was induced by aspirin consumption. DPOAE were recorded daily for two days pre-aspirin consumption, during the three days of aspirin consumption and two days afterwards. DP-grams were recorded over a <b>restricted</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>range</b> centered on 2, 3, 4 and 6 kHz with the following stimulus levels: L 1 /L 2 of 60 / 50 – 80 / 70 in 10 -dB steps. The effects of aspirin on the phase gradients varied between the subjects and across frequency: the general trend was that the phase gradient became steeper across successive sessions for the higher frequencies, while no significant effect was found at the lower frequencies. These results suggest that aspirin may have more persistent effects on cochlear function than are disclosed by measurements of hearing threshold level or DPOAE amplitude. Particularly, DPOAE phase gradient appears to be increased by aspirin consumption and has not recovered two days after cessation of aspirin intake, despite almost complete recovery of DPOAE amplitude and hearing threshold levels. These findings may suggest differential effects on the distortion and reflection mechanisms considered to underlie DPOAE generation...|$|E

We applied a previously proposed algorithm for the detection of such events and investigated their incidence and frequency in baseline and recovery sleep after 40  h of sustained wakefulness in 27 healthy young subjects. The changes in oscillatory events induced by sleep deprivation were compared to the corresponding spectral changes. Both approaches revealed, on average, an increase in low frequency activity and a decrease in spindle activity after sleep deprivation. However, the increase of oscillatory events in the delta range and decrease in the sigma range occurred in a more <b>restricted</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>range</b> compared to spectral changes. The mean relative power spectra showed a significant increase in theta and alpha activity after sleep deprivation while, on average, the event analysis showed only a weak effect in the theta band. The reason for this discrepancy is that the spectral analysis does not distinguish between diffuse activity and clearly visible temporally localized oscillations, while the event analysis would detect only the latter. Additionally, only a few individuals clearly showed activity in the theta or alpha frequency bands. Conversely, event analysis revealed that some individuals showed an increased rate of sleep spindles after sleep deprivation, a fact that was not evident in the relative power spectra due to a decrease in background activity.

An interferometer array in space providing arcminute angular resolution images at frequencies of a few MHz would allow {{a wide range of}} problems in solar, planetary, galactic, and extragalactic astronomy to be attacked. These include the evolution of solar radio emissions associated with shocks driven by coronal mass ejections and searches for coherent radio emission from supernova remnants and relativistic jets. In addition, it is likely that unexpected objects or emission processes will be discovered by such an instrument, as has always happened when high resolution astronomical observations first become possible in a new region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Astronomical Low Frequency Array (ALFA) mission will consist of 16 identical small satellites forming an aperture synthesis array. The satellites will cover the surface of a spherical region ≈ 100 km in diameter, thus providing good aperture plane coverage in all directions simultaneously. The array will operate in two medes: 1) “snapshot” imaging of strong, rapidly changing sources such as solar radio bursts and 2) long-term aperture synthesis observations for maximum sensitivity, high dynamic range imaging. In both cases a large number of array elements is needed...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{deconvolution}} of three-component teleseismic P-waves is investigated {{using the}} autocorrelation of the P to SV scattered waves. By {{assuming that the}} P to SV scattering coefficients are random and white, the autocorrelation of the SV component (SVA) provides {{an estimate of the}} autocorrelation of the source and distant earth signature. This is similar to using the autocorrelation of a reflection seismogram for deconvolution in exploration seismology where the P to P scattering coefficients are assumed to be random and white. For earthquake data the source signature is generally not minimum phase. However a minimum phase wavelet obtained from the SV autocorrelation can be used to deconvolve the original data that have been processed to be minimum phase. The SVA approach has been tested using synthetic data and then applied to observed teleseismic data from the 1993 Cascadia experiment. Since deconvolution results are often <b>restricted</b> in <b>frequency</b> <b>range,</b> an extrapolation of the deconvolved frequency spectra is next investigated using an autoregressive (AR) approach and an extended time-domain deconvolution approach to obtain better temporal resolution. A prediction error filter is used to perform the autoregressive extrapolation to estimate the unknown spectral values of the deconvolution results. An extended time-domain deconvolution approach is also developed where the deconvolved spectra are enhanced using increased high-cut filters for the time-domain deconvolution. The AR and extended time-domain deconvolution approaches are compared using synthetic data and observed data from the GBA seismic array in India. The deconvolution of vertical component seismic data using the SVA technique is finally applied to selected INDEPTH II and CDSN seismic stations to investigate the P-wave velocity structure in southern Tibet. The deconvolved vertical component seismic data are inverted for P-velocity crustal structure and the resulting Moho depths at each station are compared with the depths obtained by the inversion of receiver functions by Mitra et al. (2005). ...|$|R
