2500|$|A new ACR {{was added}} to the Viper line-up after the 2008 model year. Its {{upgrades}} were more drastic than the original, including street-legal racing tires (Michelin Pilot Sport Cups which Michelin describes as [...] "Ultra-High Performance Sport tires"), two-piece brake rotors, adjustable suspension, and significant aerodynamic <b>revision.</b> <b>No</b> engine modifications were made, so power and torque remain at 600hp (450kW) and 560lb·ft (760 N·m) as in the standard SRT-10. The ACR is street-legal, and is similar to the MOPAR Viper that Dodge displayed at various auto shows. Weight was also decreased by [...] by using the [...] "Hardcore Package", without AC, radio, speakers, amplifier, trunk carpet, hood pad or tire-inflator. Its aerodynamic upgrades produce up to 1000 pounds (4.45 kN) of downforce at , or roughly 10 times the downforce the standard Viper SRT-10 can produce at the same speed. The interior was upgraded only by the addition of a beacon-tripped lap timer (Hardcore Edition Only).|$|E
60|$|Another {{class of}} facts, not {{relating}} to cultivated plants, deserves attention. I allude {{to the production}} of galls. Every one knows the curious, bright-red, hairy productions on the wild rose-tree, and the various different galls produced by the oak. Some of the latter resemble fruit, with one face as rosy as the rosiest apple. These bright colours can be of no service either to the gall-forming insect or to the tree, and probably are the direct result of the action of the light, {{in the same manner as}} the apples of Nova Scotia or Canada are brighter coloured than English apples. According to Osten Sacken's latest <b>revision,</b> <b>no</b> less than fifty-eight kinds of galls are produced on the several species of oak, by Cynips with its sub-genera; and Mr. B.D. Walsh (23/48. See Mr. B.D. Walsh's excellent papers in 'Proc. Entomolog. Soc. Philadelphia' December 1866 page 284. With respect to the willow see ibid 1864 page 546.) states that he can add many others to the list. One American species of willow, the Salix humilis, bears ten distinct kinds of galls. The leaves which spring from the galls of various English willows differ completely in shape from the natural leaves. The young shoots of junipers and firs, when punctured by certain insects, yield monstrous growths resembling flowers and fir-cones; and the flowers of some plants become from the same cause wholly changed in appearance. Galls are produced in every quarter of the world; of several sent to me by Mr. Thwaites from Ceylon, some were as symmetrical as a composite flower when in bud, others smooth and spherical like a berry; some protected by long spines, others clothed with yellow wool formed of long cellular hairs, others with regularly tufted hairs. In some galls the internal structure is simple, but in others it is highly complex; thus M. Lacaze-Duthiers (23/49. See his admirable 'Histoire des Galles' in 'Annal. des Sc. Nat. Bot.' 3rd series tome 19 1853 page 273.) has figured in the common ink-gall no less than seven concentric layers, composed of distinct tissue, namely, the epidermic, sub-epidermic, spongy, intermediate, and the hard protective layer formed of curiously thickened woody cells, and, lastly, the central mass, abounding with starch-granules on which the larvae feed.|$|E
