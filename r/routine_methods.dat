500|$|During Leopold's illness {{performances}} were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According {{to the writer}} and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J.C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, [...] "an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the <b>routine</b> <b>methods</b> of his [...] contemporaries". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical [...] "Symphony No. 0" [...] from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765. Wolfgang also wrote his first vocal works, the motet [...] "God is our Refuge", K. 20, and the tenor aria Va, dal furor portata, K. 21.|$|E

50|$|The term aseptic is {{frequently}} a misnomer, implying {{a lack of}} infection. On the contrary, many cases of aseptic meningitis represent infection with viruses or mycobacteria that cannot be detected with <b>routine</b> <b>methods.</b> While the advent of polymerase chain reaction has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such as enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus in the CSF, many viruses can still escape detection. Additionally, mycobacteria frequently require special stains and culture methods that make their detection difficult. When CSF {{findings are consistent with}} meningitis, and microbiologic testing is unrevealing, clinicians typically assign the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis - making it a relative diagnosis of exclusion.|$|E

These lodgings were located conveniently close to several concert rooms, and to the residences of both J.C Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. Bach, a son of Johann Sebastian Bach, soon became a family friend; Nannerl later recalled Bach and the eight-year-old Wolfgang playing a sonata together, taking turns to play a few bars individually, and that [...] "anyone not watching {{would have thought it}} was played by one person alone". There is no record that the Mozarts met Abel, but Wolfgang knew his symphonies, perhaps through the medium of the annual Bach-Abel concert series, and was much influenced by them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Accurate and {{reliable}} routine in vitro diagnostic testing is needed by physicians to help provide appropriate {{care for their}} patients. These goals, which have been common to both health care professionals and manufacturers, are now mandated by law. Achieving and assessing acceptable performance {{have a number of}} common challenges. Once acceptable levels of accuracy are defined, performance can be evaluated by component: precision; bias; specificity (random interferences); and stability. Each component affects our ability to achieve and maintain performance within an acceptable window. A key element in achieving and assessing the accuracy of test results is the use of well characterized reference or designated comparison methods that are performed under stringent process control. A feature often overlooked in the analytical process is the specification of sample matrices to be analyzed. Differences in composition between patient samples and processed fluids present a challenge for calibrating and assessing performance of <b>routine</b> <b>methods.</b> To manage these differences in sample matrices, we have demonstrated success in establishing calibration of <b>routine</b> <b>methods</b> with patient samples, so that <b>routine</b> <b>methods</b> correlate with designated methods. From these correlations, values are assigned to calibrators. Effective process control contributes to vial-to-vial uniformity. Calibration flui...|$|E
