5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks on humans {{is that the}} copper shark is so similar to other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks.</b> Victims and witnesses are unlikely to correctly identify which type of genus Carcharhinus shark {{is responsible for the}} attack. Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> like the copper.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> the blacknose shark is viviparous: after the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection {{through which the}} mother provides nourishment. Off the United States, males are thought to reproduce every year, while females reproduce every other year.|$|E
5|$|Finally some sharks {{maintain}} a placental {{link to the}} developing young, this method is called viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.|$|E

25|$|Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific are {{dominated}} by whitetip, blacktip and grey reef shark. Coral reefs in the western Atlantic Ocean {{are dominated}} by the Caribbean reef shark. These sharks are all species of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> and all have the robust, streamlined bodies that are typical of the <b>requiem</b> <b>shark.</b> They are fast-swimming, agile predators that feed primarily on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Other species of reef sharks include the Galapagos shark, the tawny nurse shark and hammerheads.|$|R

5|$|Carcharhiniformes: Commonly {{known as}} ground sharks, the order {{includes}} the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, blacktail reef, whitetip reef, and oceanic whitetip sharks (collectively called the <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks)</b> {{along with the}} houndsharks, catsharks, and hammerhead sharks. They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{abundance}} in certain areas, the Caribbean reef shark {{is one of}} the least-studied large <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks.</b> They are believed {{to play a major role}} in shaping Caribbean reef communities. These sharks are more active at night, with no evidence of seasonal changes in activity or migration. Juveniles tend to remain in a localized area throughout the year, while adults range over a wider area.|$|E
5|$|Like other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E

50|$|The Pacific spadenose shark (Scoliodon macrorhynchos) is {{a species}} of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> in the family Carcharhinidae. It was once {{regarded}} as conspecific to the spadenose shark (S. laticaudus).|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic {{sharpnose}} shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) is a <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> in {{the family}} Carcharhinidae, found in the subtropical waters of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, between latitudes 43°N and 18°N.|$|R
5|$|The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezii) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil, and is the most commonly encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea. With a robust, streamlined body typical of the <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> this species is difficult to tell apart from other large members of its family such as the dusky shark (C. obscurus) and the silky shark (C. falciformis). Distinguishing characteristics include dusky-colored fins without prominent markings, a short free rear tip on the second dorsal fin, and tooth shape and number.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks.</b> This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (Prionace glauca), lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E

50|$|The Pacific smalltail shark (Carcharhinus cerdale) is {{a species}} of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> in the family Carcharhinidae. It was {{described}} in 1898, but later mistakenly merged with Carcharhinus porosus. The mistake was corrected in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Carcharhinus humani {{also known}} as the Human's whaler shark is a species of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> in the family Carcharhinidae. It inhabits the western Indian Ocean near the Socotra Islands, off Kuwait, Mozambique, and South Africa.|$|R
5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E
5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of bony fishes, as well as eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As with other members of its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E
5000|$|Carcharhinus tjutjot, {{also known}} as the Indonesian whaler shark is a species of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae. Until recently, it was thought to be a junior synonym of the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri).|$|R
5000|$|Carcharhinus coatesi {{also known}} as the Coates's shark is a species of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> found off {{northern}} Australia (from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Fraser Island in Queensland) and possibly also off the coast of New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|Scoliodon is a genus of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> {{and part}} of the family Carcharhinidae. It was {{formerly}} thought to include only a single Indo-Pacific species, the spadenose shark (S. laticaudus), but recent taxonomic research has found two species, and the formerly excluded junior synonyms need to be resurrected.|$|R
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} cephalopods, bony fishes, and other {{cartilaginous}} fishes, the copper shark is a fast-swimming predator {{that has been}} known to hunt in large groups, utilizing their numbers to their advantage; however for {{most of the time they}} remain solitary. Off South Africa, this species associates closely with the annual sardine run, involving millions of southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax). Like other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> it is viviparous, with the developing embryos mainly nourished through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of 7 to 24 pups every other year in coastal nursery areas, after a gestation period of 12 or perhaps as long as 21 months. It is extremely slow-growing, with males and females not reaching maturity until 13–19 and 19–20 years of age respectively.|$|E
5|$|Galapagos {{sharks are}} active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals {{have a much}} more varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend to remain in shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E
5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is a robust and {{streamlined}} species with a moderately long, broad snout and large, round eyes. The five pairs of gill slits are short. There are 12–14 tooth rows {{on each side}} of both jaws, with one or two small teeth at the symphysis (middle of the jaws). The upper teeth are broad with oblique triangular cusps and coarse serrations near the base; the lower teeth have erect cusps with fine serrations. The first dorsal fin is large and triangular, originating above or slightly forward of the free pectoral fin tips. There is a ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are proportionately longer than in most <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> and falcate (sickle-like) in shape, with pointed tips.|$|E
5|$|The {{oceanic whitetip shark}} (Carcharhinus longimanus), {{also known}} as Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, brown shark, nigano shark, oceanic white-tipped whaler, and silvertip shark, is a large pelagic <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> inhabiting {{tropical}} and warm temperate seas. Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.|$|R
500|$|C. longimanus has a 'typical', {{although}} somewhat flattened <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> body, {{often with}} a mildly humpbacked aspect.

50|$|The grey {{sharpnose}} shark, Rhizoprionodon oligolinx, is a <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> of {{the family}} Carcharhinidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific Oceans, between latitudes 30° N and 18° S, from the surface to a depth of 36 m. It can reach a length of about 70 cm.|$|R
5|$|Like other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are {{provisioned}} {{by the mother}} through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female as a prelude to mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating occurs from January to March and birthing occurs in October and November following a gestation period of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating occurs from late October to early November and birthing occurs around the same time the following year, following a gestation period of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E
5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks {{spend much}} of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> which rely on ram {{ventilation}} and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within a particular area of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver the two of them into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E
50|$|The {{blue shark}} (Prionace glauca) is {{a species of}} <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> in the family Carcharhinidae, that inhabits deep waters in the world's {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Preferring cooler waters, blue sharks migrate long distances, such as from New England to South America. The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|C. longimanus has a typical, {{although}} somewhat flattened <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> body, {{often with}} a mildly humpbacked aspect. It is bronze, brown, bluish, or grey dorsally (the colour varies by region), and white ventrally (although it may occasionally have a yellow tint). The oceanic whitetip shark is a medium-sized <b>requiem</b> <b>shark.</b> The largest specimen ever caught measured 4 m, an exceptionally large size considering few specimens are known to exceed a length of 3 m. The maximum reported weight is 170 kg. The female is typically larger than the male by 10 cm. Males attain sexual maturity at 1.7 to 1.9 m and females about 1.8 to 2.0 m. In the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s, the mean weight of oceanic whitetip sharks was 86.4 kg. In the 1990s, the sharks of the species from the same area averaged only 56.1 kg.|$|R
