Nokian winter tyres have been described as a favourite of critics and have been well received in winter test <b>results</b> <b>by</b> several publications. Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance, offering lower fuel consumption. Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year-round use by having different tread patterns on the lateral and medial aspect of the tread. One pattern is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all-season pattern.|$|E
5|$|The EU {{accession}} referendum {{passed with}} 66.27% of votes cast in support and 33.13% against EU membership for Croatia. There were 0.6% blank or invalid votes. Even though all Croatian citizens were voting {{in a single}} constituency for the referendum's purposes, the State Election Committee published the <b>results</b> <b>by</b> individual counties, cities, and municipalities. The referendum passed in all Croatian counties. The greatest support for the referendum was recorded in Međimurje and Brod-Posavina counties at 75.73% and 72.61% respectively. The lowest support for the EU accession was recorded in Dubrovnik-Neretva County, where 42.22% votes were cast against the proposal. The Croatian diaspora voted 83.13% in support. Only 18 out of 556 cities or municipalities in Croatia voted against the referendum proposal. Of those, six are in Split-Dalmatia County, four in Koprivnica-Križevci County, two in Zagreb and Dubrovnik-Neretva counties each, and a single municipality in Istria, Primorje-Gorski Kotar, Šibenik-Knin and Zadar counties each.|$|E

5|$|The first tests using {{electric}} detonators and solid pits {{were performed on}} 7 and 14 February 1945; until then primacord-based initiation was employed. The {{electric detonators}} showed a significant improvement in the achieved compression degree and symmetry, and were used on all RaLa tests thereafter. Based on these <b>results,</b> <b>by</b> the end of February {{the design of the}} gadget, as the bomb was euphemistically known, was settled. Other test methods were also necessary, as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets that plagued the early implosion designs, but RaLa was the most important.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933 Karl Paul Link and his lab of chemists working at the University of Wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay. It took five years for Link's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6mg of crystalline anticoagulant. Next, Link's student Mark A. Stahmann took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell's and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 3,3'-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named dicoumarol. They confirmed their <b>results</b> <b>by</b> synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} two {{adaptive}} interlaced-to-progressive conversion techniques {{in which the}} adequacy of the estimated motion vector is evaluated. If the motion vector is unlikely to give a good temporal motion compensated interpolation result, spatial interpolation is favored or selected to avoid temporal artifacts. In the first proposed interlaced-to-progressive conversion technique, called spatio-temporal weighted adaptive interlaced-to-progressive conversion, the interpolated value is a weighted sum of four interpolation filter results: the <b>result</b> <b>by</b> spatial vertical interpolation, the <b>result</b> <b>by</b> spatial directional interpolation using steerable filters, the <b>result</b> <b>by</b> temporal interpolation without motion compensation and the <b>result</b> <b>by</b> temporal motion-compensated interpolation. The most favored interpolation result of these four will receive the highest weight.
