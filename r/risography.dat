40|$|Preface (excerpt) : 'This concise {{volume is}} the result of almost a year of conversation, tests and planning. Produced on the now {{ubiquitous}} Risograph (Riso RP 3700), our intentions from the beginning of this project were to explore how the machine could be used to create original images, rather than reproduce existing one. 'The structure of this publication, and the experiments carried out within, have been greatly inspired and guided by Bruno Munari's Original Xerographies. Nearly all of the images used throughout Original <b>Risographies</b> were supplied by Robin Kirkham & Harry Blackett of An Endless Supply. These images were then treated according to the different possibilities apparent within the Risograph's mechanical operation, and its accompanying production software. The results of these tests are displayed over the following chapters, with accompanying notation from Adrian Holme that explores the theoretical context of reproduction in art, design and literature. The exception to this is the chapter entitled Nature Table, for which we commissioned Peter Nencini to develop a series of compositions as a calibration tool' Charlie Abbott, Jake Hopwood, Alex Hough, Alice Lindsay & Peter Willis Published in a limited edition of 500...|$|R
