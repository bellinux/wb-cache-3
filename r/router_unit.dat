40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an integrated circuit {{and to a}} method of arbitration in a network on an integrated circuit. According to the invention, a method of arbitration in a network on an integrated circuit is provided, the network comprising a <b>router</b> <b>unit,</b> the <b>router</b> <b>unit</b> comprising a first input port, a second input port and an output port, wherein the <b>router</b> <b>unit</b> receives at least one first packet via the first input port, and wherein the <b>router</b> <b>unit</b> receives at least one second packet via the second input port, the <b>router</b> <b>unit</b> arbitrating between the first packet and the second packet, characterized in that the step of arbitrating is performed using a first label and a second label, the first label being attached to the first packet, and the second label being attached to the second packet.; This method relies on {{the perception that the}} arbitration performed by a router should be based on connection arbitration instead of input port arbitration. This means that instead of merely arbitrating between the contending input ports in a router, the arbitration should also take into account the connections to which packets correspond. This can be done by attaching labels to the packets, which labels are used in the arbitration process. In this way, it is possible to achieve a fair allocation of bandwidth to different connections, regardless of on which input ports these connections are established...|$|E
40|$|Component based {{reconfiguration}} <b>router</b> <b>unit</b> (RRU) {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective solutions to improve function extended. It can satisfy the urgent need of multi-network and multi-business. Component composition and compositional reasoning are the core technologies and frontier research areas in RRU. Based on the characteristics of RRU and software components and inspired by software component reusing, 3 component composition mechanisms are proposed in this paper to integrate software components simply and conveniently. And it is argued to compose interfaces at the same time of component composition, consequently to generate more powerful and more abstract interfaces to support integration of coarse-grained components and raise the abstract level of component composition. Moreover, based on the Wright’s research on formal specification of software architecture, compositional reasoning algorithms about the behaviors of composite component as well as the protocols of composite interfaces are developed, which establish a foundation to analyze, validate, simulate composite systems. Meanwhile, according to the characters of RRU, we also consider the limited of resource in component composition process. At last we present the implement of component composition...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{architecture}} for a 2 -D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) -based encoder that handles computations {{along the border}} efficiently by using the method of symmetric extension. We choose symmetric extension (SA) as opposed to zero padding or periodic extension since (i) the coefficients generated by SA {{can be used to}} obtain perfect reconstruction and (ii) it is better suited for low bit rate coders. The proposed architecture is similar to the existing 2 -D DWT architectures for zero padded images with the notable exception that additional <b>router</b> <b>units</b> are now required to reorder the data. Reordering is essential to sustain the computation of successive problem instances in symmetrically extended images. We show that the router can be implemented using simple combinational logic, resulting in minimal area overhead. 1.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the effective mitigation of the Single Event Effects (SEEs) in commercial State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) data handling devices to provide high performance and fault-tolerant data handling architectures for space missions. It concentrates upon Single Event Functional Interrupts (SEFIs), whereby a single particle hit in sensitive device cross-section leads to unexpected device behaviour. Reports of SEFIs are increasing in all key data handling technologies, e. g. memories, microprocessors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and on-board local area networks (LANs). Constructing a high performance on-board data handling (OBDH) architecture will therefore require {{a large number}} of resources to cope with problem of SEFIs. This research proposes an architectural/system-level approach to SEFI mitigation, where a global supervisor is added into the architecture to monitor heterogeneous OBDH units. In the proposed OBDH architecture, all units are connected through a router-based Space Wire network. A supervisor is a radiation hardened microprocessor, {{which is part of the}} <b>router</b> <b>unit.</b> The supervisor expects to receive special detection and diagnosis (DAD) packets from the underlying units. Health information collected through these packets is compared with designer's input to produce any fault signature. The supervisor intervenes when the state of a unit does not match expectations or DAD packets stop arriving. In such an event, the supervisor will apply a recovery procedure based on fault signature observed and any previous recovery record for that unit Theoretical and experimental analyses are presented to establish practicality of the scheme. The outcome of this thesis is a SEFI-tolerance methodology aimed at applications that demand for SOTA commercial technologies and increased availability but cannot afford high cost and resources associated with traditional redundancy-based mitigations. This is particularly useful for small satellites where very limited mass, volume and power resources preclude the use of multiple-redundant system-based architectures. Therefore, it promises a measurable increase in small satellite utility across range of mission performance requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{realization}} of quantum computers and quantum Internet requires not only quantum gates and quantum memories, but also transistors at single-photon levels {{to control the}} flow of information encoded on single photons. Single-photon transistor (SPT) is an optical transistor in the quantum limit, which uses a single photon to open or block a photonic channel. In sharp contrast to all previous SPT proposals which are based on single-photon nonlinearities, here I present a novel design for a high-gain and high-speed (up to THz) SPT based on a linear optical effect - giant circular birefringence (GCB) induced by a single spin in a double-sided optical microcavity. A gate photon sets the spin state via projective measurement and controls the light propagation in the optical channel. This spin-cavity transistor can be directly configured as diodes, <b>routers,</b> DRAM <b>units,</b> switches, modulators, etc. Due to the duality as quantum gate and transistor, the spin-cavity unit provides a solid-state platform ideal for future Internet - a mixture of all-optical Internet with quantum Internet...|$|R
40|$|Our {{modeling}} of PERT {{is composed of}} three parts: window adjustment, RED emulation, and queuing behavior. We start with the window dynamics. Similar to [7], we consider a single-link scenario and assume the forward propagation delay from the source to the router is negligible and thus the round-trip time R(t) measured by the end-user at time t is composed of backward propagation delay Tp and queuing delay Tq(t − R(t)), i. e., R(t) = Tp + Tq t − R(t). (1) Denoting by C the link’s capacity and by q(t) the queue size at time t, queuing delay Tq(t) can be approximated by q(t − R(t)) /C. Note that delay R(t) in the last expression is because the queuing delay perceived by the user at time t is actually experienced by the <b>router</b> R(t) time <b>units</b> earlier. Then, window dynamics of a PERT end-flow is written as...|$|R
40|$|The Permit based Locking {{design pattern}} {{provides}} fast acquisition and release of locks without network communication even in distributed systems build around a central lock server. Instead of plain locks, the server manages "permits to lock", and passes them to those clients which probably need the lock next. If a client hosts a permit, the associated lock can be acquired immediately without server interaction. If a permit asked for {{is not present}} at the server but at some other client, it can be revoked. Lock-Permit, Distributed Locking A network management system provides access to a pile of telecommunication hardware. The switches, <b>routers</b> and transmission <b>units</b> are supervised and controlled by human operators as well as automated network administration tools. Since the hardware components are highly distributed, a central server carries {{a model of the}} complex network. The set of hardware components is, depending on the workload, temporally organized into subsections, each with an operator assigned to it. Therefore, there is almost no potential for collisions when accessing the components. But since they are still possible, it is necessary to serialize the access to the hardware in order to prevent interference between different operators or tools. This is done by means of locking capabilities, also provided by the central model server. Although seldom a real benefit, the pessimistic lock acquisition and release causes most of the network traffic, wasting a lot of communication bandwidth for "administrational " sugar, just in case … Contex...|$|R
40|$|With {{a growing}} focus on {{sustainability}} {{many companies are}} proactively assessing their product and supply chain footprints. Cisco {{is a leader in}} the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) industry and is working to define best practices and standards. Product life cycle assessment (LCA) capability is an important competency as customers begin to request environmental impact data. The current LCA standard is to use a commercial software package, such as GaBi or SimaPro, but these tools require significant workforce resources. Often the majority of the time spent completing the assessment is focused on areas that have a minimal contribution to the overall product footprint. Industry specific estimation techniques are being developed which will allow for assessments to be completed with fewer resources. The goal of this work is to evaluate the footprint of a single rack <b>unit</b> <b>router</b> using a full life cycle assessment. Results from the life cycle assessment show that the use phase contributes over 95 % of the total global warming potential (carbon footprint) given the selected assumptions. For the production phase, printed circuit boards and integrated circuits contribute over 70 % of the total global warming potential. The iNEMI Eco-Impact Evaluator methodology allows for a significant reduction in analysis time to calculate a footprint and offers a valid option for creating life cycle assessments. The footprint results from this estimation technique show similar trends when compared to the results of the full life cycle assessment. The use phase is predicted to be the dominant phase. Based on a detailed comparison, the iNEMI Eco-Impact Evaluator methodology shows great promise as an option to generate product life cycle assessments with lower analysis time. This technique will allow users to integrate LCA capability into the design cycle and make valuable trades to reduce the environmental impact of future products. by John J. Conway. Thesis (M. B. A.)
