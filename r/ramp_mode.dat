Despite of the wide literature on theoretical and experimental methods for increasing engine power, {{there is a general}} lack of data about tests on racing engine performance due to the obvious manufacturers' reluctance to spread information, especially for recent high technological level applications. This paper, instead, presents all the main results of the experimental tests conducted on a motorbike engine both in the original stock arrangement and in a modified configuration proposed in compliance with the Technical Regulations of the 2007 FIM Road Racing Supersport Italian Championship (CIV). Traditional testing techniques (steady-flow discharge coefficients measurements and chassis dynamometer tests performed in the slow speed <b>ramp</b> <b>mode)</b> are chosen to reduce time and costs and to limit engine wearing while obtaining an acceptable degree of accuracy. It is also proved that the tests to assess the improvements obtained with design changes could not have been completed in the steady-state mode using a single engine because of the short life cycle of racing engines due to wearing, which would have altered the comparisons.

40|$|Aims/Objectives : This {{in vitro}} study was {{designed}} to measure and compare the temperature rise in the pulp chamber with different light curing units. Materials and Methods : The study was done in two settings- in-vitro and in-vivo simulation. In in-vitro setting, 3 mm and 6 mm acrylic spacers with 4 mm tip diameter thermocouple was used and six groups were formed according to the light curing source- 3 Quartz-Tungsten-Halogen (QTH) units and 3 Light-Emitting-Diode (LED) units. For the LED units, three modes of curing like pulse-cure mode, fast mode and <b>ramp</b> <b>mode</b> were used. For in-vivo simulation, 12 caries free human third molar tooth with fused root were used. K-type thermocouple with 1 mm tip diameter was used. Occlusal cavity was prepared, etched, rinsed with water and blot dried; bonding agent was applied and incremental curing of composite was done. Thermal emission for each light curing agent was noted. Results : Temperature rise was very minimal in LED light cure units than in QTH light cure units in both the settings. Temperature rise was minimal at 6 mm distance when compared to 3 mm distance. Among the various modes, fast mode produces the less temperature rise. Temperature rise in all the light curing units was well within the normal range of pulpal physiology.

Their catalytic activities towards diesel soot combustion and NO oxidation to NO 2 were analyzed with the purpose to identify the nature of the copper entities over ceria-based supports to promote diesel soot combustion. The catalysts were characterized by N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at − 196 °C, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, H 2 -TPR and reducibility tests under inert atmosphere. Activity tests were performed towards NO oxidation to NO 2 (from 25 °C to 700 °C) and diesel soot combustion in NOx/O 2 atmosphere, under <b>ramp</b> <b>mode</b> (from 25 °C to 700 °C) and isothermal conditions (450 °C).

40|$|Background and Aim: With recent {{introduction}} of packable composites, it is {{claimed that they}} apply less stress on tooth structure because of reduced polymerization shrinkage, and similarity of {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} to tooth structure. However, the high viscosity may in turn cause less adaptation, so it is not clearly known whether these materials strengthen tooth structure or not. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate fracture resistance of maxillary premolars, receiving hybrid or packable composite restorations with different methods of application and curing. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, seventy five intact premolars were randomly assigned to five groups of 15 teeth each. One group was maintained intact as the control group. Similar MOD cavities were prepared in the other teeth. The teeth in group two were restored with Spectrum in incremental layers and light cured with 500 mw/cm 2 intensity. The third group were filled with Surefil and cured with light intensity of 500 mw/cm 2. The groups four and five were restored with Surefil in bulk technique with two different modes: 500 mw/cm 2 intensity and a <b>ramp</b> <b>mode</b> (100 - 900 mw/cm 2) respectively. After thermocycling, force to fracture was assessed and degree of conversion (DC) at the bottom of cavities was evaluated for different modes and methods. The curing and placement methods in groups tested for DC (A to D) were the same as fracture resistance groups (2 to 5). Data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: All the restored groups showed significantly less fracture resistance than the control group, but had no significant difference among themselves. DC of Spectrum was higher than Surefil. Bulk method with 500 mw/cm 2 light intensity, significantly decreased DC. DC in bulk method with high light intensity was not significantly different from incremental method with 500 mw/cm 2 light intensity. Conclusion: Placement techniques, light intensity and type of composite had no influence on the fracture resistance. The use of packable composite with bulk technique and 500 mw/cm 2 intensity or less is not recommended in 4 mm depth cavities due to insufficient DC...|$|E

40|$|Rh metal was {{implemented}} as a core {{component in the}} so-called three-way automotive exhaust catalyst (TWC) due to its excellent properties such as thermal stability, poison resistance and inert behaviour to react with any support materials. These catalysts are often loaded with small amount of promoter elements such as Ce and Zr that enhance their overall catalytic performances and catalyst lifetime. It is therefore desirable to develop new CeOx-based catalyst with both high redox activity and high thermal resistance. Samples of two surface coverages of rhodium on a non-porous high area alumina been synthesised; at 1. 6 Rh and 4 wt % Rh loading. Ceria and zirconia have been deposited on the pre-supported Rh catalysts by the controlled surface reaction between the reduced Rh surface and an organometallic precursors: Zr(acac) 4 and Ce(acac) 3, with different cerium : zirconium ratios: Ce:Zr; 1 : 0, 1 : 1, 2 : 1, 0 : 1. Ceriated Rh catalysts have been also prepared by a different synthesis method, wherein the ceria was deposited on ?-Al 2 O 3 and subsequently Rh metal was added. A series of Rh catalysts produced has been characterised ex situ by BET surface area measurement, TEM, STEM HAADF, EDX, XPS, and XAFS. The combination of Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS), Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EDE) techniques in a synchronous, time-resolved manner {{has been applied to}} determine the complementary information about structural and kinetic changes of the chemical system throughout CO exposure and two catalytic processes: CO oxidation and the reduction of NO by CO in the temperature range between 298 K to 573 K. It has been shown that advanced characterisation techniques, used in the time-resolved, in situ manner were needed {{in order to understand the}} behaviour of these complex catalytic systems under operating conditions. The effects of the catalysts’ composition, temperature and pulsed gas flow on catalyst performance have been effectively mapped by the combined DRIFTS/MS/EDE studies. The synthesis procedure has been found to be crucial to achieve the desired interaction between CeOx and Rh particles. No enhancement of ceriated Rh catalysts was observed when ceria was deposited directly on ?-Al 2 O 3 (method I). The addition of each promoter element by the controlled surface modification procedure (method II) exhibits multiple effects on the catalysts performance. The DRIFTS/XAFS studies have confirmed that CeOx and ZrO 2 facilitate the protection of Rh particles against extensive oxidation in atmospheres of air, O 2 and CO. Larger Rh core particles of ceriated and zirconiated Rh catalysts have been observed when compared with undoped Rh samples. DRIFTS results indicate that by interaction of CO with Rh particles a significantly larger amount of linear CO species was formed on the ceriated Rh surface than in the non-ceriated Rh catalysts case suggesting the presence of predominant metallic Rh phase for that system. Moreover, only ceria doping was found to improve the catalytic activity of promoted Rh catalysts throughout CO oxidation in the temperature <b>ramp</b> <b>mode</b> under different (O 2 /CO) gas composition...|$|E

In this research an approach investigating the system integration of the whole transfemoral limb has been undertaken. An integrated limb system was built based on two already existing but ‘stand-alone’ prosthetic joints by creating an appropriate control system and communication architecture. Two additional functionalities that require inter-joint communication were implemented: standing <b>mode</b> and <b>ramp</b> descent <b>mode</b> to support those challenging situations for transfemoral amputees. The development and biomechanical assessment of the <b>ramp</b> descent <b>mode</b> were undertaken to establish if integrated inter-joint control has the potential to change gait characteristics compared to non-integrated isolated single-joint control. Four different conditions (no braking, braking of foot, braking of knee and braking of the whole limb) were assessed trying to replicate non-integrated and integrated control in a systematic manner. The biomechanical assessment from the two amputee studies conducted revealed that braking of the whole limb showed the largest differences compared to the different conditions with some reaching statistical significance however the findings of the gait studies were inconsistent. There were some indications of increase of braking ratio, reduction in propulsive impulse and decrease of self-selected speed however not all results could be replicated. Overall this could indicate a more controlled ramp descent.

The DESY-II electron/positron synchrotron at the DESY site in Hamburg has a circumference of 292.8 m and is mainly used as an injector for the PETRA-III storage ring. However, it also supplies beam to three test beam areas, one of them being the test beam area 21. Its dipole magnets operate in a sinusoidal <b>ramping</b> <b>mode</b> with a frequency of 12.5 Hz. Therefore, one DESY-II cycle takes 80 ms, and the bunch length is around 30 ps. The DESY-II synchrotron is equipped with movable carbon fibres. If positioned in the beam, bremsstrahlung photons are created, escaping the beam line tangentially. Subsequently, the photons are converted to electron/positron pairs on a secondary metal target. Their energy distribution reaches up to 6 GeV. Using a dipole magnet, this secondary electron/positron beam is spread out.

40|$|Several {{experiments}} and theoretical models of intermediate energy heavy ion collision physics {{are presented in}} this thesis. Statistical and dynamical aspects of nuclear collisions are widely discussed these days, particularly {{in connection with the}} multifragmentation phenomenon and the possible link to a liquid-gas phase transition in the spinodal region of nuclear matter phase diagram. Experimental techniques which allow us to measure various parameters of hot and dense (equilibrated) regions (emission sources) formed in a heavy ion collision are well established nowadays. In recent CHIC (Celsius Heavy Ion Collaboration) experiments the properties of such sources were measured using slowly <b>ramping</b> <b>mode</b> of the CELSIUS storage ring. In this thesis the entropy and chaos production in nuclear collisions is discussed in connection with the t/d/p ratios. Subthreshold pion production explores collective effects in heavy ion collisions and brings additional information about the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. Continuous pion production excitation functions were measured in the beam energy region from far below the nucleon-nucleon threshold up to the delta dominant region. Mass and angular dependencies of pion production are discussed. A version of the molecular dynamics (MD) model which includes pion production in direct nucleon-nucleon collisions was developed and experimental data were analysed in the scope of this model. Properties of the emission sources formed in heavy ion collisions at energies below 50 A MeV were studied in the experiments of fragmentation type performed by CHIC. Temperatures of these sources were extracted from fragment energy spectra and from "isotopic effect". A version of the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model, where the Pauli potential is introduced into the Hamiltonian, was combined with the statistical multifragmentation model (SMM) and used to explore dynamical and statistical properties of the reaction development. The artificial neural networks were utilized for the analysis of data from the CHICSi detector which is described in details in this thesis...|$|R

The charge transfer inefficiency is evaluated for both CCD modes {{with regard to}} the injected charge, and the influence of the rising and falling time effect is explored. Controlling the ramp and especially reducing its abruptness allows to get much lower CTI in BCCD mode. In contrary, we did not observe any effect of the <b>ramp</b> on SCCD <b>mode,</b> due to the presence of interface traps at the silicon - oxide interface...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} ZIF- 8 crystal size on the {{morphology}} {{and performance of}} Fe–N–C catalysts synthesized via the pyrolysis of a ferrous salt, phenanthroline and the metal-organic framework ZIF- 8 is investigated in detail. Various ZIF- 8 samples with average crystal size ranging from 100 to 1600 nm were prepared. The process parameters allowing a templating effect after argon pyrolysis were investigated. It is shown that the milling speed, used to prepare catalyst precursors, and the heating mode, used for pyrolysis, are critical factors for templating nano-ZIFs into nano-sized Fe–N–C particles with open porosity. Templating could be achieved when combining a reduced milling speed with a <b>ramped</b> heating <b>mode.</b> For templated Fe–N–C materials, the performance and activity improved with decreased ZIF- 8 crystal size. With the Fe–N–C catalyst templated from the smallest ZIF- 8 crystals, the current densities in H 2 /O 2 polymer electrolyte fuel cell at 0. 5 V reached ca. 900 mA cm − 2, compared to only ca. 450 mA cm − 2 with our previous approach. This templating process opens the path to a morphological control of Fe–N–C catalysts derived from metal-organic frameworks which, when combined with the versatility of the coordination chemistry of such materials, offers a platform for the rational design of optimized Metal–N–C catalysts...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrated}} electromyogram of {{the first}} dorsal interosseous muscle in normal humans presents a brief early burst in voluntary ballistic abduction of the index finger. Unexpected decrease in torque load {{does not change the}} burst. By contrast, in fast ramp abduction with a time to peak of 0. 5 second, the electromyographic activity is fairly continuous up to the peak displacement, and it is silenced with a delay of 50 msec by unexpected unloading. Thus fast ramp, but not ballistic, voluntary contractions are under current long loop control from proprioceptive input. In a second set of experiments, the analysis of single motor unit potentials with highly selective electrodes in interosseous muscle indicated that ballistic thresholds are smaller than ramp thresholds under either isotonic or isometric conditions. However, the recruitment rank of the motor units was identical in finger abductions carried out in either <b>ramp</b> or ballistic <b>modes.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The NCP 1589 D is a {{low cost}} PWM {{controller}} designed to operate from a 5 V or 12 V supply. This device is capable of producing an output voltage as low as 0. 8 V and converting voltage from as low as 2. 5 V. It is easy to operate and provides an optimal level of integration to reduce size and cost of the power supply. It operates in <b>Ramp</b> Pulse Modulation <b>mode</b> for superior load step and release response. In addition to fast transient response, it also includes a 1. 5 A gate driver design and light load efficiency features such as adaptive non−overlap circuitry and diode emulation. It normally operates at a range of 200 − 500 kHz in continuous current conduction mode, which reduces with current at light load for further power saving.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} NASA’s super pressure balloon {{depends on a}} thorough understanding of the shell's polyethylene film behavior. The super pressure balloon film in-evitably undergoes deformation during deployment. Therefore, it is imperative that one knows the deformation limits of the film; since, excessive deformation of the film may inter-fere with its gas containment purpose, and thus ultimately results in longevity and/or per-formance issues of the balloon flight. The super pressure balloon has two principal loading modes during its operational life: a slow <b>ramp</b> pressure <b>mode</b> during deployment and initial pressurization, and a near-constant pressure mode during the day-night cycle. During these loading modes, the levels of stresses in the film are different. The film is expected to expe-rience higher stresses during the initial stages of the balloon deployment until the film de-forms a finite percentage forming the lobes between tendons. Consequently, after the balloon deploys, the level of stresses will reduce due to the polyethylene film’s intrinsic viscoelastic property and the geometric changes of the lobes. Therefore, it is practical to have a failure limit that accounts for the different modes of loading during the operational life cycle of the balloon. Thus, the objective of this work is to establish a failure limit for the polyethylene film by experimentally studying the mechanical and physical properties of the film. Specifi-cally, the creep behavior as a function of strain rates and formability properties of the film are investigated and correlated to the morphological changes in polyethylene in order to es-tablish a deformation threshold and operational guidelines...|$|R
40|$|The SRS is {{a second}} {{generation}} synchrotron radiation source which ramps from its injection energy of 600 MeV to 2 GeV relatively slowly (~ 1 minute). Improvements in orbit control have been achieved using discrete corrector application at specific points during the ramp, but this requires regular dedicated beam studies time to re-optimise the stored steering files to match the gradual uncorrected orbit degradation with time. The installation of two new Insertion Devices (IDs) in the ring, with their consequent much reduced vertical aperture specifications, will demand {{a higher degree of}} position control and unacceptable use of resources. A ramp orbit control servo program has been commissioned and is in operational use in the normal (multibunch) <b>mode</b> <b>ramp,</b> operating with a loop time of 2 seconds. Results from this, together with a modification to allow the handling of specific conditions used in a relaxed emittance mode (for single bunch filling), are shown. Since the servo must be "fail-safe " to avoid irradiation of the new ID vessels, methods to handle BPM failures are discussed. ...|$|R

This study focuses on dual mode PRT systems, which means vehicles that can switch from the PRT network to the normal road network at odoff <b>ramps.</b> Hypothetical dual <b>mode</b> PRT systems based on current knowledge are drxeloped,and conjoint analysis used to measure customer responses to the variable attributes of the potential systems.

40|$|We analyze {{data of the}} AMPTE/IRM {{spacecraft}} downstream of a supercritical, quasi-perpendicular {{bow shock}} with an upstream #beta# (ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure) greater than unity. The observed ion temperature anisotropy (T_p _p_e_r_p_e_n_d_i_c_u_l_a_r _t_o > T_p _p_a_r_a_l_l_e_l) satisfies the mirror instability criterion and the mirror growth rate is positive. We investigate the low-frequency magnetic fluctuations and find that several minutes downstream of the shock <b>ramp</b> the compressive <b>mode</b> dominates in two frequency intervals below the local proton gyrofrequency. Bandpass filtering of the two frequency ranges shows that the particle pressure and magnetic pressure vary in anti-phase, as is typical for the mirror mode. In addition, we estimate the proton compressibility, i. e., {{the ratio of the}} relative fluctuations of proton density and magnetic field and the Alfven ratio, i. e., the ratio of fluctuations of the bulk velocity and the Alfven velocity. Combining these results we find strong indications for the existence of mirror waves in the region downstream of the bow shock. The observed spectrum of the mirror waves has a two-banded structure.

40|$|The present project (Start date: 07 February 2013) aims to investigate, for {{the first}} time by in situ time-resolved X-ray powder diffraction, the {{structural}} modifications and the desorption kinetics during the thermal regeneration of synthetic zeolites used for removal of non-polar organic compounds from contaminated waters. Co-proposer: Giuseppe Cruciani and Luisa Pasti, University of Ferrara. The project was approved (2012 / 2 / 2) and financed by the international Commitees of EUROPEAN SYNCHROTRON RADIATION FACILITY (CH- 3510, 9 shifts allocated). The aim was to study the structural and kinetic response to heating of zeolite ZSM- 5 after adsorption of 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE), methyl tert-butyl-ether (MTBE), toluene (TOL) and of a mixtures of these contaminants from aqueous dilute solutions. Powder diffraction data have been collected (as a function of time, both in temperature <b>ramp</b> and isotherm <b>modes</b> in order to obtain information on: i) evolution of the zeolite crystal structure (relocation of extra-framework species and symmetry modifications); ii) site selective kinetic parameters of desorption process.
