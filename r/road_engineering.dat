5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and <b>road</b> <b>engineering</b> practices.|$|E

2500|$|Speed {{reduction}} {{has traditionally}} been attempted {{by the introduction of}} statutory speed limits. [...] Traffic speeds of 30km/h (20mph) and lower are said to be more desirable on urban roads with mixed traffic. [...] The Austrian city of Graz, which has achieved steady growth in cycling, has applied 30km/h limits to 75% its streets since 1994. [...] Zones where speeds are set at 30 km/h (or 20mph) are gaining popularity [...] as they are found to be effective at reducing crashes and increasing community cohesion. Speed limits which are set below the speed that most motorists perceive to be reasonable for the given road require additional measures to improve compliance. [...] Attempts to improve speed limit observance are usually by either education, enforcement or <b>road</b> <b>engineering.</b> [...] "Education" [...] can mean publicity campaigns or targeted road user training.|$|E
2500|$|Until 1960, Portuguese {{military}} forces serving in Guinea were composed of units led by white officers, with commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato) {{serving in the}} enlisted ranks. [...] General Spínola's Africanization policy eliminated these discriminatory colour bars, and called for the integration of indigenous Guinea Africans into Portuguese {{military forces}} in Africa. [...] Two special indigenous African counterinsurgency detachments were formed by the Portuguese Armed Forces. [...] The first of these was the African Commandos (Comandos Africanos), consisting of a battalion of commandos composed entirely of black soldiers (including the officers). [...] The second was the African Special Marines (Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos), Marine units entirely composed of black soldiers. [...] The African Special Marines supplemented other Portuguese elite units conducting amphibious operations in the riverine areas of Guinea {{in an attempt to}} interdict and destroy guerrilla forces and supplies. [...] General Spínola's Africanization policy also fostered a large increase in indigenous recruitment into the armed forces, culminating the establishment of all-black military formations such as the Black Militias (Milícias negras) commanded by Major Carlos Fabião. [...] By the early 1970s, an increasing percentage of Guineans were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers in Portuguese military forces in Africa, including such higher-ranking officers as Captain (later Lt. Colonel) Marcelino da Mata, a black Portuguese citizen born of Guinean parents who rose from a first sergeant in a <b>road</b> <b>engineering</b> unit to a commander in the Comandos Africanos.|$|E
