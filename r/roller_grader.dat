40|$|Introduction: Iran {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{producers}} of almonds. According to the statistics released by FAO (2011), Iran with more than 110000 tons of almonds is the third in rank throughout the world. However, most Iranian almonds are presented as an unsorted and unpackaged product. Some producers sort their products by hand which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. So, there is an essential need for suitable grading and packaging machines especially for the export of almond kernels. Grading, which is sometimes called sorting, is basically separating the material in different homogenous groups according to its specific characteristics like size, shape, color and on the basis of quality. Weighing {{is one of the}} best methods for grading agricultural products based on size, but due to its high cost and complexity of operations, usage of weigh size sorting machines is practically limited. So, sizing of most agricultural products is accomplished based on their dimensional attributes such as diameter, length, thickness or a combination of them. Field study shows that recently vibrating sizing machines are used for grading almond kernels. This type of sizing machine is huge, expensive, noisy and it consumes a lot of energy. Thus, the main objective of the present study was the design, development and evaluation of a new prototype of an almond kernel sizing machine. Materials and methods: It is important that the machine could resolve defects of existing vibrating machines. It should provide efficient and cost effective sizing for a wide range of kernel sizes and shapes. Furthermore, it should be of simple construction and be able to accept manual feeding. Previously conducted experiments showed that the thickness of the kernel is the most appropriate dimension for its sizing. Among the different types of dimensional sizing machines, the divergent <b>roller</b> <b>grader</b> which grades the products based on their thickness is considered to be one of the simplest options. So, a divergent <b>roller</b> <b>grader</b> was developed and built in this research. The prototype consisted of two diverging rotating rollers which were made of mild steel with an outside diameter of 95 mm and a length of 700 mm. They were mounted to provide an adjustable slope towards the wide opening end. These roller beds were fixed on a box shaped frame of size 500 × 1000 × 1200 mm. The slope and counter-rotating action of the rollers encouraged the kernels to continue moving toward the end where the gap between the rollers was the widest. A tray was fixed at the feeding end of the machine for feeding the kernels. A provision was given to adjust the gap from a minimum to a maximum level. Based on the required activate torques of the rollers, an electric 74 W motor was selected to drive the machine. The power transmission mechanism consists of two pulleys 150 and 250 mm diameters and a V belt type A with a length of 1448 mm. The center distance of the pulleys is calculated to be 410 mm. Standard criterions of weighted sorting error index (C ̅_R), weighted sorting efficiencies index (EW) and operation capacity (Q) were used to evaluate the machine. Practical analysis showed that the machine’s performance is influenced mainly by the slope of the rollers, the rotation speed of the rollers, and the feeding rate of the product. In order to evaluate the performance of the prototype, a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications for each test was done. The performance evaluation was carried out for three levels of feeding rates (600, 1000, and 1400 kg 8 h- 1, three levels of slopes (2, 7, and 12 degree), and three rotation speeds of rollers (50, 80, and 110 rpm). Spreadsheet software MSTATC and SPSS were used to analyze the data and the Duncan's multiple range tests were used to compare the means. Results and discussion: Analysis of variance showed that all three studied factors have significant effects on evaluating standard criterions of C ̅_R, EW, and Q at the 1...|$|E

These along with other P.W.D. transport vehicles and plant such as Malcolm Moore <b>graders,</b> <b>rollers</b> and loaders etc. were maintained by P.W.D. mechanics in P.W.D. workshops.|$|R
50|$|J.D. Adams & Company {{was founded}} in 1885 by Joseph D Adams who invented the first leaning-wheel pull grader and was based in Indianapolis. The company {{manufactured}} construction machinery including sheepsfoot <b>rollers,</b> dozers and <b>graders</b> from its factory. The company catalogues also listed products by Acme Road Machinery Company though the association is unknown beyond the product listings. In 1955 LeTourneau-Westinghouse purchased J.D. Adams & Co and continued to operate under the name until 1960.|$|R
50|$|While {{the use of}} air {{transport}} generally restricted the availability of heavy equipment, some artillery was broken down and transported by air to the Buna-Gona area. Another notable exception was equipment of the 43rd General Service Regiment. On 25 November, 210 men of the regiment were flown to Dobodura to construct more runways. Transported with them were two tractors, five mowers, a sheepsfoot <b>roller</b> and a <b>grader.</b> All of these were disassembled and cut down to allow loading and then reconstructed on site.|$|R
50|$|The Jeffery Manufacturing Company {{steadily}} grew until 1940. In 1904, Jeffery {{purchased the}} Ohio Malleable Iron Company {{to ensure a}} reliable supply of iron {{for the production of}} their barrows and hand trucks. Ohio Malleable was located along the same railroad track as Jeffery a few blocks north of First Avenue. In 1926, Jeffery purchased a British company called the Diamond Coal Cutter Company, which was renamed the British Jeffery Diamond Limited. A couple years later, J.A. Jeffery retired and president of the company, Robert Gillespie stepped up. His first action as the figurehead was to invest two million dollars into the purchase of Galion Iron Works, a manufacturer of road <b>rollers</b> and <b>graders</b> for sale to local and state governments. Jeffery Manufacturing survived the Great Depression and company prosperity continued into the immediate post war years. However, a new company called Jay Manufacturing moved into central Ohio and began challenging Jeffery Manufacturing. Jeffery began to fail when the company neglected to replace its underground coal hauler with the new rubber tired hauler, an innovation that would save the company time and money because the rubber tires did not require built tracks as mine shafts were extended. As the Jeffery main branch began to fail, its subsidiaries excelled and kept the company afloat. In 1961, Jeffery Manufacturing completely merged with the British Galion Company, creating the new corporate name of Jeffery Galion, Inc.|$|R
40|$|Construction {{traffic noise}} {{continues}} to grow and it is accompanied by {{an increasing number of}} complaints from people exposed to the noise. The historical dimension of noise pollution in urbanized society identified ‘noise’ as being unwanted or undesirable sound created by construction vehicles that are considered harmful to human health and quality of life. The most important issue is sleep disturbance. However, the assessment of construction traffic noise is highly complex. Objective of this research is to determine the characteristics of noise induced by construction traffic and normal traffic. Sound levels were measured by using Sound level meter (SVAN 971) and four channel seismograph at different locations near roads where heavy construction vehicles such as ABC truck, empty truck, <b>roller</b> and motor <b>grader</b> passing through. In order to compare with ambient condition, noise induced by normal vehicles (i. e., car, three-wheeler, van, bus.) was also measured. Most of the construction vehicles induced noise, which are higher than the noise induced by the normal vehicles. Among the normal traffic, three-wheelers produce noise greater than other normal vehicles. It was found that construction traffic induced noise as high as 109 dB (L(A) max), 79. 2 dB (L(A) eq). Construction traffic produces noise at relatively low frequencies with high amplitude. Low frequency noise can be easily transmitted through structures and it can cause windows and other elements to rattle. The noise with tonal or impulsive characteristics is likely to be more annoying than noise without such characteristics...|$|R
