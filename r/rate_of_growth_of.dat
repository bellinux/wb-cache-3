Sales totaled 24,660 units in 2015, consisting of 10,420 all-electrics and 14,190 plug-in hybrids. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese plug-in segment slowed down from 2013, with annual sales falling behind Europe, the U.S. and China during 2014 and 2015. The decline in plug-in car sales reflects the Japanese government and the major domestic carmakers decision to adopt and promote {{hydrogen fuel cell vehicles}} instead of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{profitability}} {{of the agricultural}} sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom. Despite its dependence on the British market, Argentina managed a 6.7% annual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> exports between 1870 and 1890 {{as a result of}} successful geographic and commodity diversification.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the Antarctic scallop is {{very slow}} {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} the paths <b>of</b> economic <b>growth</b> generated by the dynamic input-output model.

Conditions <b>of</b> achieveing postulated <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the sectors and those of stability of the whole economic system have been formulated.

The approach to the problem presented in the paper is applicable also in the case of degeneracy of the matrix of capital-input coefficients.

25|$|In neoclassical {{economic}}s, {{economic growth}} is described with growth models (e.g., the Solow–Swan model) in terms of equilibrium ("steady state"). Input per worker and output per worker grow at the same rate. Therefore, capital intensity remains constant over time. At the same time, in equilibrium, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> employment is constant over time. Translated into terms of labor theory of value, {{this means that the}} value composition of capital does not rise, and the constant <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> employment also indicates, in terms of the labor theory of value, that {{there is no reason for}} the rate of profit to decline.|$|E
