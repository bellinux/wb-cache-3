25|$|In 1820, Godwin {{published}} Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main {{argument was}} against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted {{had occurred in}} the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple {{would have to have}} at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, if I had not taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus’s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close my argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can I have any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.|$|E

Three electors shall be chosen to submit names of fresh candidates for the Great Council, on the ... approval of the Doge." [...] But strict as these provisions were, they did not suffice to restrict the government to the aristocracy. It was soon decreed [...] "that only those who could prove that a paternal ancestor had sat on the Great Council, after its creation in 1176, should now be eligible as members.... It is in this provision that we find the essence of the Serrata del Maggior Consiglio.... The work was not completed at one stroke.... In 1315 a list of all those who were eligible ... was compiled.

40|$|Na temelju detaljne analize arhivskog materijala autor razmatra nazočnost doseljenika iz Zadra i šireg zadarskog područja u Puli. U matičnim knjigama grada Pule (u razdoblju od 1613. do 1817. godine) spominje se devet mjesta i područja: Biograd, Ist, Kaštel Žegarski, Kornati, Obrovac i Premuda jedanput, Nin dvaput, Pag šest puta, a Zadar čak 112 puta. An {{analysis}} of the data of the city of Pula’s registers of births – located in the Pazin State Archive – proved very beneficial in researching and understanding the past of the southernmost Istrian city locality during the Modern Age. Namely, these historical sources enable a broad insight into the process of continual immigration into this region. At that time Pula was a very significant harbor on the Venetian maritime routes towards Dalmatia and the Levant. However, in the city the number of deaths constantly exceeded the number of births so that it could continue to be a city settlement only owing to immigration. As the seat of the Venetian general proveditore for Dalmatia and Albania, Zadar at that time had an important political, strategical and economic role. The presence of people from Zadar was strong and continuous. There is no mention of them in the records only from 1736 to 1760 and from 1790 to 1805. In the period covered by the research project they were recorded in all the Pula registers from 1613 to 1817. Such a conclusion does not, however, hold for the settlements of the wider Zadar region which are also mentioned in the registers but most frequently only once (Biograd, Ist, Kaštel Žegarski, Kornati, Obrovac and Permuda). Only Pag and Nin are mentioned more than once. 50 immigrants are recorded in the register of the dead, 37 in the register of baptism, 22 in the list of those who took Confirmation and 17 in the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages.</b> 126 persons moved to Pula on a temporary or permanent basis from the Zadar region. Migrations from the broader Zadar region to Istria and Pula doubtlessly represented a very interesting and substantial contribution {{to a better understanding of}} the total connections of regions which at the time were very distant from one another. Indeed, they directly confirm the existence of significant migratory currents within the Venetian provinces on the Adriatic as well as of connections between Istria and Dalmatia...|$|E
