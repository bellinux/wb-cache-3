In particular, the tackled issues regard the strategic planning {{of the number of}} facilities used to transfer the intermodal transport units and the capacity/frequency of the transportation means. A real case study is considered, namely a <b>rail-road</b> <b>terminal</b> located in southern Italy.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the promotion of the environmental friendly modes, the European Commission has launched a number of research projects aiming at evaluating technical and organisational innovations that can improve the performance of the freight transport operations in the rail sector. The scope {{of this paper is to}} present a modelling approach focusing on the comparative evaluation of conventional and advanced <b>rail-road</b> <b>terminal</b> equipment. The set of models used, consists of an expert system for the terminal design, a model simulating terminal operations and a macro-model implementing rail operating forms and assigning freight flows in the transport network. This approach stems from the fact that the time savings due to efficient terminal transshipment can be used effectively only in combination with advanced rail operating forms. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

The activities were focused on three corridors (Rhine-Alp, Orient and Central North-South Corridors). The goal is to initiate cross-border cooperation of the trade unions along the corridors in order to monitor, ensure and improve social conditions of railway workers.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the market of goods became globalized, {{increasing}} international trade {{relations and the}} demand for long distance transportation. As a consequence of the larger distances traveled and of the containerization of goods, maritime transportation became more efficient and reliable. In the hinterland, intermodal (rail-road) freight transportation emerged as a competitive alternative to truck-only transportation. In one of its possible meanings, intermodal freight transportation is the multimodal chain of container-transportation services [1] that, e. g., brings containers from (or to) the seaport by barge or rail to (or from) an intermodal terminal in the hinterland from where they are shipped by truck to their final destination (or origin). This study focus on inland intermodal freight transport, in particular, on the rail–truck transport of cargo containers in Belgium. This European country has a long rail system and in the last years has readapted this system in order to handle with containerized cargo. Since 2004, some <b>rail-road</b> <b>terminals</b> have been built and new intermodal services between the seaports of Belgium have been established. In addition, with the aim of promoting the modal share of intermodal rail-road transport, the federal government of Belgium started subsidizing part of the rail transport cost and of the transshipments costs at the <b>rail-road</b> <b>terminals.</b> With these investments the intermodal freight flows in Belgium have increased.

A particular way to model rail-road transport on hub-and-spoke networks is outlined and illustrated on the trans-European networks. The market area of an optimal eight hubs network configuration is presented both for the "p"-hub median and the "p"-hub centre problem.

The approach consists of two phases: 1) modifying a previous approach {{by some of the}} authors, a linear integer programming problem is solved to maximize the train commercial value, keeping into account urgencies and priorities; 2) hence, a heuristics is used to take into account prosecuting containers and reduce the number of wagons to be re-handled.

But the project not concerns transport corridors and hinterland access. However, no port can develop without its links with its hinterland. That’s why we analyse the issues relating to the hinterland transport development {{with respect to the}} with interconnected rail network of West African countries. This network project allows us to build up a multimodal/intermodal transport network from and to {{the port of}} Cotonou since inland terminals may have an important role in enlarging port market areas through enhancing hinterland penetration capacity. Our findings show that if two <b>rail-road</b> <b>terminals</b> are located, one in Dosso and the other one in Parakou, it will allow a saving of about 112 million euro, promote local economies and sustainability...|$|R
40|$|In network {{location}} problems, {{the number}} of potential locations is often too large {{in order to find}} a solution in a reasonable computing time. That is why aggregation techniques are often used to reduce {{the number of}} nodes. This reduction of the size of the location problems makes them more computationally tractable, but aggregation introduces errors into the solutions. Some of these errors will be estimated in this paper. A method that helps to isolate the best potential locations for <b>rail-road</b> <b>terminals</b> embedded in a hub-and-spoke network will further be outlined. Hub location problems arise when it is desirable to consolidate flows at certain locations called hubs. The basic idea is to use the flows of commodities and their geographic spreading as input to determine a set of potential locations for hub terminals. The exercise will be done for the trans-European networks. These potential locations can then further be used as input by an optimal location method. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The European {{transport}} policy {{has focused on}} sustainable transport solutions. One of its objectives for freight transport is to restore the balance between modes and to develop intermodality. Among {{the various types of}} intermodal transports, this research is concerned with <b>rail-road</b> container <b>terminals</b> embedded in a hub-and–spoke network. These terminals will further be referred to as hubs. Hub-and-spoke networks have been implemented in a number of transportation systems when it is favourable to consolidate and disseminate flows at certain locations called hubs. The efficiency of such a network depends on the location of the hubs. The problem is to find the optimal hub locations and to allocate the remaining nodes to these hubs. This problem is known as the p-hub median problem (p-HMP) where p is the number of hubs to locate. This location-allocation problem is proved to be NP-hard. The time needed to solve it increases as the number of nodes exponent three. Thus, in order to model rail-road transport on the trans-European networks, a subset of nodes that can be considered as good potential locations is needed. We applied the p-HMP to a set of potential locations obtained by both spatial aggregation of demand nodes using hierarchical clustering methods and by a flow-based approach which takes the flows of commodities and their geographic spread into account. They showed that the latest method gives better results and that is why it is retained to determine a set of potential locations. The set of potential locations is used as input for an iterative procedure. One of the main contributions of this research is to propose this iterative procedure based on both the p-HMP and the multi-modal assignment problem. Moreover, the objective function of our p-hub median formulation includes the costs for pre- and post-haulages by road, trans-shipment (according to the number of handled containers into account) and rail haulage. Furthermore, in the p-hub median problem, the total demand is assigned to the hubs. In this research however, the demand can be assigned over all the transportation modes, with the possibility (but not the obligation) of using the trans-shipment facilities. Finally, we presents a methodology able to compare road and rail-road intermodal market areas that takes the network structures, the operation costs and the location of the <b>rail-road</b> <b>terminals</b> into account. This methodology is applied to the optimal configurations obtained by the resolution of the p-HMP and the p-hub centre problem (p-HCP) for the whole trans-European network. Indeed, p-HMP has an efficiency goal by minimizing the total transportation cost. The hub network design obtained by this method can sometimes lead to unsatisfactory results when worst-case origin-destination pairs are separated by a very large distance. Therefore, the p-HCM meets the equity objective by minimizing the maximum cost of a combined transport...|$|R
30|$|With {{the above}} findings, the {{research}} {{indicated that the}} InnovaTrain transhipment horizontal technique, in particular the aspect of <b>rail-road</b> intermodal <b>terminal,</b> was suitable for the transportation of LDHV, time sensitive goods by rail freight, in direct competition to road transport. From all four cases studies, it was clear that, without a freight integrator of some kind, rail operators were unlikely to succeed with purely technical solutions. Particular attention had {{to be given to}} the management and communication of information flow among the several actors or collaborating organisations [38], so the research recommended that the technical solution be complemented by a freight integrator who would provide the link between all main parties (rail and/or transport operators and shippers/consignees) and also aggregate cargo to realise full-load train service and eliminate empty running.|$|R
30|$|The depot is a {{population}} of nodes that represent a <b>rail-road</b> freight <b>terminal</b> and smaller depots connected by road haulages. Nevertheless, all depots share common attributes, including the generation of freight transport demand, waiting lists, resource pools, and the calculation of key performance indicators, the ones widely used in the system analysis of logistics performance. Scenario generation is controlled by a dynamic event. Historical orders are disaggregated by the data adaptor. Freight demand might be satisfied {{by more than one}} container for large goods. The waiting list is the collection array of the temporarily stored products that are delayed because of the unavailability of a tractor. Resources are pools of common specified objects, which include containers and parking slots. Performance indicators document the economic and environmental measurements that change over time and are visible through a user interface. The interface also outputs simulation data into spreadsheets.|$|R
30|$|The {{penetration}} of seamless intermodal transport is evidenced {{in the urban}} transport context. With urban rail transit systems aimed for regional mobility and accessibility, <b>rail-road</b> intermodal <b>terminals</b> are nowadays serving traffic flows of multiple sources. These sources include urban distribution and passenger transport. The physical flows are utilising shared infrastructure space and make the planning of terminal and network {{an important part of}} management. For strategic planning of urban rail transit systems, Sharav et al. used graph theory and performance measurements for comparing the alternatives of transit network design [5]. Through spatial data analysis, Aklilu and Necha assessed the accessibility of public transport with the particular aspects of service area coverage and the quantification of transit users [6]. A queue model was developed for optimisation of walkways, a facility design issue inside the transit terminal [7]. Tang and Hu developed an agent-based model for understanding pedestrian dynamics and interactions in the public space, and the associated transition from micro-level organisations to the global phenomena [8] that might be critical for the infrastructure. The model projected the crowd flow, total travel time, density, and public accessibility that support facility design of transit terminals.|$|R
40|$|The paper evaluates {{technical}} and logistics developments {{that could lead}} to increased economic and technical efficiency of <b>rail–road</b> transport <b>terminals.</b> The main design parameters are identified (length and utilisation of transhipment tracks, train and truck arrival behaviour/patterns, type and number of handling equipment, mean stacking height in the storage area, terminal access system and procedures) and analysed. A comparative evaluation of selected conventional and advanced technologies is performed by use of an analysis tool that was developed on purpose. This tool consists of three modules (an expert system, a simulation model and a cost calculation module). The overall outcome of the analysis is a number of cost-versus-volume curves for various terminal configurations. The paper concludes with two groups of results: (a) a comparative evaluation of conventional and advanced technologies that reveals similarities in terms of track numbers and the associated area requirements as well as differences in terms of layout flexibility, number of equipment, stacking policies and personnel requirements. Each design is proved effective for a certain cargo volume range. (b) A critical assessment of terminal capacity issues.

40|$|AbstractThe {{topic of}} freight {{transport}} by rail, {{is a complex}} theme and, in recent years, a main issue of European policy. The legislation evolution and the White Paper 2011 have demonstrated the European intention to re-launch this sector. The challenge is to promote the intermodal transport system {{to the detriment of}} road freight transport. In this context, the intermodal freight terminals play a primary role for the supply chain, they are the connection point between the various transport nodes and the nodal points where the freight are handled, stored and transferred between different modes to final customer. To achieve the purpose, proposed by the EC, are necessary the performances improvement of existing intermodal freight terminals and the development of innovative intermodal freight terminals. Many terminal performances improvement is have been proposed and sometime experimented. They are based both on operational measures (e. g. horizontal and parallel handling, faster and fully direct handling) and on innovative technologies (e. g. automatic system for horizontal and parallel handling, automated gate for data exchange) inside the terminals, with often-contradictory results. The research work described in this paper (developed within the EU project Capacity 4 Rail) focusses on the assessment of effects that these innovations can have in the intermodal freight terminals. The innovative operational measures and technologies have been combined in different scenarios, to be evaluated by a methodological approach including to other an analytical methods and simulation models. The output of this assessment method are key performance indicators (KPI) setup according to terminals typologies the proposals and related to different aspects (e. g. management, operation and organization. In the present work suitable KPIs (e. g. total/partial transit times) for to evaluate have been applied. Finally, in addition to methodological framework illustrated, a real case of study will be illustrated: the intermodal <b>rail-road</b> freight <b>terminal</b> Munich-Riem (Germany) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{commissioned}} by Falköping Municipality {{as part of}} the EU Interreg IIIB North Sea Programme project SustAccess. SustAccess intends to contribute to an improved and sustainable accessibility between rural areas and gateways around the North Sea. The improved accessibility between gateway and hinterland should be achieved by promoting and by delivering sustainable transport solutions. The purpose of this report is to describe the dry port concept, and to identify and classify existing dry port applications in Sweden. The emphasis is on organisational forms of the dry ports as well as on roles of the actors involved in the implementation process. The report will be used as a base for the future work within SustAccess. Responsible for the report is Division of Logistics and Transportation at Chalmers University of Technology. After presentation of a theoretical framework with the dry port concept, the Swedish intermodal transport system, that is {{the context in which the}} terminals work in, is explained. Then a terminal inventory including intermodal <b>rail-road</b> <b>terminals</b> that handle unit loads and have or develop a rail connection to a seaport is forwarded. Data about the surveyed terminals is also presented in an appendix. The issue of intermodal terminal development is deepened in the five case studies Älmhult, Eskilstuna, Åmål, Alvesta and Jönköping. The terminal developments are selected for illustrating and investigating different aspects and they represent different scales of operation, ownership and maturity. As there are differences in sizes of terminal areas, in TEUs handled a year, or in range of services offered there are also differences in organisational forms and types of ownerships of the same. Many of the surveyed terminals are owned either entirely by a municipality or jointly by a municipality and commercial actors within the system, such as rail operator or shipper. Even within CargoNet's terminal network, ownership differs; those terminals situated in the ports of Trelleborg, Norrköping and Helsingborg are owned and operated by the ports. While, for example, Älmhult is operated by CargoNet but owned jointly by CargoNet, the municipality and IKEA. However for many of the CargoNet terminals, the rail tracks are owned and maintained by Banverket, and the land is owned by Jernhusen. Activities regarding the implementation of the Åmål terminal went in a very informal way probably due to the fact that a transhipment terminal already existed and only had to be moved to another place. In addition, the terminal is of a small-scale and simple type. Therefore no official planning report was made nor were consultants involved in the planning of the terminal; however the implementation was financed by various actors, including the EU programme Mål 2 Västra. Compared to Åmål, where goods flows already existed at the old terminal and was just moved to the new one, Eskilstuna terminal was built to create a flow, i. e., to attract H&M in the area. Hence, the terminal was a pawn in a larger game aiming at attracting logistics activities to Eskilstuna. The Eskilstuna terminal implementation was then financed entirely by the public utility organisation Eskilstuna Energi & Miljö. Älmhult is an example of a mature terminal that was the first to diverge from the norm of being owned and operated by the national railway. The terminal was initiated and is partly owned by the dominant shipper IKEA, a fact that reputedly has deterred other shippers from using the terminal. The reasoning is that IKEAs strong role might imply that the terminal pays less attention to other shippers' load units. Alvesta is an example where the location at an intersection between main rail lines has fostered an interest in developing a terminal. Jönköping, finally, has a terminal in Ljungarum and the area is likely to be appointed a national intermodal terminal. The issue is that Ljungarum is old, restrained in capacity and extension possibilities are meagre while the logistics activities are expanded in Torsvik. The local and regional authorities and shippers together with transport operators and infrastructure administrations have been strongly committed to the task. Personal commitment by the municipality's development manager and by some strong shipper representatives has been instrumental for the development. For the future structure of the Swedish intermodal terminal network, the awaited freight transport bill will be of utmost importance. The risk is that the increased interest and funding by the government will imply further concentration to fewer and larger terminals, but vague statements have been made by Banverket that also smaller terminals might enjoy funding and at least not worse conditions. Nevertheless, the relative competitiveness of smaller terminals close to the national terminals might suffer...|$|R
