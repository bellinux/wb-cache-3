40|$|LHCb Software {{is made up}} of {{a variety}} of {{software}} packages, including legacy code written in Fortran, a new software framework written in C++, as well as many externally developed packages. It is typical that each package is developed and maintained by a different person and therefore evolves independently of the other packages. A set of working and production areas has been set up to ensure that developers can release their packages at any time without disturbing the main development line. The software librarian maintains the packages in a CVS code repository, and a release procedure has been established that makes use of a special tool for building the LHCb data processing applications on the various supported platforms. Here we describe in detail the configuration management requirements that led to the adoption of CMT as our software <b>release</b> <b>tool</b> and our experience using this tool over a 1 year period...|$|E
