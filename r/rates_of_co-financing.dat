40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyse some results of {{cost-benefit}} analysis {{in a sample of}} ISPA (Structural Instrument for pre-accession countries) projects. The focus is particularly on the variability of financial and economic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> return and how to integrate this information in the EU co- financing mechanism. We investigate, through the analysis <b>of</b> variance <b>of</b> <b>co-financing</b> <b>rate,</b> to which extent variability <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> is due to structural characteristics (sectors, countries) or to the existence of a residual variance due both to specificity of the project and discretional element of the appraisal method, which may constitute an information noise. We find that the variance <b>of</b> <b>co-financing</b> <b>rate</b> across countries is poorly explained by different composition of sectors of investment. This suggests the need to reinforce a more consistent approach to evaluation and co-financing. We suggest some possible solutions.

The case studies present examples <b>of</b> how private <b>co-financing</b> <b>of</b> national roads works in practice. In these cases, private co-financing is regulated by the development agreement. The analysis points out that problems can arise when the parties in a development agreement are not equal. I denna uppsats presenteras fenomenet privat medfinansiering av statliga vägar. I teoriavsnittet visas att det idag inte finns någon lagreglering av privat medfinansiering. En reglering föreslås dock i ett tillägg till gällande plan- och bygglag (2010 : 900). I fallstudier presenteras exempel på hur privat medfinansiering av statliga vägar går till i praktiken. Där framkommer att privat medfinansiering regleras i exploateringsavtal.

40|$|Subsidized {{microfinance}} institutions (MFIs) provide affordable {{credit to}} small entrepreneurs. Many industrialized countries regulate MFIs. But {{in a market}} with accessible small business financing, regulatory loan ceilings can jeopardize the supply of microcredit to the most disadvantaged people. This is because small entrepreneurs in need of above-ceiling credit {{have the option to}} combine a ceiling-high microcredit with a supplementary loan from a regular bank. By reducing information asymmetry, this type <b>of</b> <b>co-financing</b> may prompt MFIs to divert credit away from entrepreneurs seeking below-ceiling loans.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{results of}} cost-benefit analysis (CBA) {{in a large}} sample of ISPA (Structural Instrument for Pre-Accession countries) projects co-financed by the European Union to support investment in transport and environment. The research {{focus is on the}} empirical analysis of the variability of financial and economic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> return and how to integrate this information in the EU co-financing mechanism. We investigate to what extent the variability of expected returns and <b>of</b> EU <b>co-financing</b> <b>rates</b> is due to structural project characteristics (sectors, countries) or to other unexplained factors, including errors in the appraisal. We find that while the absolute level of grants is related to sectors, the EU co-financing rate depends on countries. There is no justification in economic analysis of such a country bias, because the variability <b>of</b> economic <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> returns is unrelated either to sector or country factors. These findings points to the need of a more consistent approach to evaluation and EU <b>co-financing</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure supported by the EU funds. We suggest possible improvements, based on the idea to offer an incentive to projects with high-expected economic␣rates of return relative to a benchmark and showing ex-post the realism of the initial analysis.
