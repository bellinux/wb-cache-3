The investigations are conducted for laboratory parametric <b>resonance</b> <b>screen.</b> The measuring test is performed for four cases of tension force values. The full sheet metal instead of the sieve is used. For each considered case the natural frequency of the plate and the parameter modulation frequency are determined.

40|$|Ukrainian {{patent on}} {{invention}} No. 87369 The invention relates to a material separation method, substantially {{by means of}} screens, {{and can be used}} in the coal, metal mining, building ant other industries. The inventive method for resonance excitation of the screen sieving mesh involves statically tensioning the sieving mesh and exposing it to frequency vibration action. The static tension of the sieving mesh is stabilised in relation to the opposite displacements of the sides thereof and the vibration action is substantially performed in the plane of the sieving mesh transversally to the above-mentioned sides thereof. The inventive <b>resonance</b> <b>screen</b> comprises a bed connected to a frame, to which the sieving mesh is attached with the longitudinal sides thereof, and at least one vibrator. The frame is designed in the form of elements which are not linked to each other and are arranged on the opposite sides of the mesh, at least one of said elements being connected to the bed by means of at least one stabilising device {{in the form of an}} elastic element located in the plane of the mesh and being provided with a vibrator...|$|E

These novel, tumor-specific proteins provides a unique opportunity {{for the development of}} highly selective anticancer drugs {{that has yet to be}} exploited. A particularly clear example is provided by Ewing's Sarcoma Family Tumors (ESFT) which contain a characteristic t(11; 22) translocation leading to expression of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI 1. EWS-FLI 1 is a disordered protein that precluded standard structure-based small molecule inhibitor design.

These findings provide proof of principle that inhibiting the interaction of mutant cancer-specific transcription factors with the normal cellular binding partners required for their oncogenic activity provides a promising strategy for the development of uniquely effective, tumor-specific anticancer agents.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{discusses}} and {{evaluates the}} ap-proaches {{that can be}} applied to perform frequency scan-ning natured subsynchronous damping analysis by means of electromagnetic transient simulation. In this paper these time domain transient simulation related techniques are referred as dynamic frequency scanning techniques to separate them from the traditional frequency scanning technique applied to subsynchronous <b>resonance</b> <b>screening</b> studies. The two traditional dynamic frequency scanning approaches, modal response and signal injection method, are based on the analysis of the subsynchronous response of the electromechanical system on one single frequency at the time. Although multi-run functionalities has made these methods convenient to use, they cannot be consid-ered effective, or screening study natured, if the damping analysis require for example modeling of highly detailed control systems or sensitivity studies covering high num-ber of operational conditions and parameters. Therefore, spectral injection technique allowing the analysis of sub-synchronous response over the whole subsynchronous frequency range at once is introduced to subsynchrnous damping analysis. The implementation of different dy-namic frequency scanning methods is presented and the performance of the methods is evaluated using two differ-ent subsynchronous torsional interaction scenarios...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In a {{prospective}} cohort study, the authors followed 112 women whose Poly Implant Prothèse silicone breast implants were recalled. Magnetic resonance imaging results and clinical consequences were previously published. The authors compared magnetic <b>resonance</b> imaging <b>screening</b> with explantation results {{to study the}} diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging in this unique unselected and nonbiased group. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED TWELVE: women with 224 proven Poly Implant Prothèse implants after a mean implantation time of 10 years were enrolled in 2011. All women underwent magnetic <b>resonance</b> imaging <b>screening</b> and were offered explantation. The explantation details of 107 women could be compared with magnetic resonance imaging results. RESULTS: Of 107 women, 29 (27 percent) {{had at least one}} ruptured implant at explantation, and 44 of 214 explanted implants (21 percent) were ruptured. The magnetic resonance imaging results correctly diagnosed 154 intact and 35 ruptured implants. Sensitivity and specificity were 80 percent and 91 percent, respectively. The positive predictive value was 69 percent, and the negative predictive value was 95 percent. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging is comparable to previously published data from other manufacturers of modern silicone implants but lower than that of some recent validation studies in selected symptomatic women. The authors believe that this study is representative of common daily practice as they followed normal day-to-day magnetic resonance imaging protocol without using multiple independent readers. The authors hope that this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion to screen asymptomatic women with modern silicone breast implants.

40|$|SummaryLysine {{acetylation}} {{of human}} tumor suppressor p 53 {{in response to}} cellular stress signals is required for its function as a transcription factor that regulates cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis. Here, we report small molecules that block lysine 382 -acetylated p 53 association with the bromodomain of the coactivator CBP, an interaction essential for p 53 -induced transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor p 21 in response to DNA damage. These chemicals were discovered in target structure-guided nuclear magnetic <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>screening</b> of a focused chemical library constructed based on the structural knowledge of CBP bromodomain/p 53 -AcK 382 binding.

40|$|When it was {{suggested}} that a new recombination mechanism (Resonant Radiative Recombination (RRR)) which, based on very general physical arguments, should happen in dense plasmas and promises to provide useful information for the local temperature and density diagnostics of plasmas, they assumed the existence of <b>screening</b> <b>resonances.</b> For model potentials the existence of <b>screening</b> <b>resonances</b> has been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt in a number of calculations. The key question, how well those potentials describe the dominant effects of a real plasma remains open. The relation of theoretical predictions to experimentally measurable effects is an important issue at the present stage of their research. In particular, RRR is expected to account for enhanced recombination rates of low energetic electrons with their ions, since the first stage is the resonant capture of a slow electron by an atom or ion. The mechanism that traps an electron is a combination of complicated many-body interactions of the ions and electrons. For clarity they start here, however, with a discussion in terms of local potential traps the shapes of which are determined predominantly and in an average way by two factors: the degree of screening present at the ionic site and the degree of short-range order in the immediate neighborhood of this ion...|$|R

BC-specific distress, general distress, and RP (cognitive and affective) were assessed, two months before a surveillance appointment. Cumulative lifetime risk (CLTR) of developing breast cancer was trichotomised into: (1) CLTR of 60 - 85 % (mutation carriers), (2) CLTR of 30 - 50 %, and (3) CLTR of 15 - 30 %.

Surveillance consists of biannual physical examination, annual mammography, annual MRI and monthly breast self-examination (BSE). OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between psychological distress and reported BSE frequency. METHODS: Two months prior to surveillance demographics, BSE frequency, general distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the somatic scale of the Symptom Checklist- 90) and breast cancer-specific distress (Impact of Event Scale) were assessed in 316 women (mean age 40. 5 years, range 21 - 63 years). RESULTS: The majority (57 %) reported performing monthly BSE. Ten percent reported never performing BSE, 20 % less frequently than once a month and 13 % at least once a week. Women below the age of 40 who examined their breasts more frequently than recommended (i. e. at least once a week) were shown to be significantly more distressed than the other women in the sample (p = 0. 03). These women represented 15 % of all the women below the age of 40 years in our study sample.

It is crucial to understand the disturbances in the metabolic network after SCI to identify injury mechanisms and opportunities for treatment intervention. Through plasma 1 H-nuclear magnetic <b>resonance</b> (NMR) <b>screening,</b> we identified 15 metabolites that made up an "Eigen-metabolome" capable of distinguishing rats with severe SCI from healthy control rats. Forty enzymes regulated these 15 metabolites in the metabolic network. We also found that 16 metabolites regulated by 130 enzymes in the metabolic network impacted neurobehavioral recovery. Using the Eigen-metabolome, we established a linear discrimination model to cluster rats with severe and mild SCI and control rats into separate groups and identify the interactive relationships between metabolic biomarkers in the global metabolic network. We identified 10 clusters in the global metabolic network and defined them as distinct metabolic disturbance domains of SCI. Metabolic paths such as retinal, glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid metabolism; NAD-NADPH conversion process, tyrosine metabolism, and cadaverine and putrescine metabolism were included. In summary, we presented a novel interdisciplinary method that integrates metabolomics and global metabolic network analysis to visualize metabolic network disturbances after SCI.

Ferulic acid proved an efficient inhibitor of type B trichothecene biosynthesis and TRI 5 gene expression in Fusarium liquid cultures. In this work several natural and natural-like compounds belonging to phenol and hydroxylated biphenyl structural classes were tested in vitro to determine their inhibitory activity towards TRI 5. The recombinant TRI 5 was expressed in E. coli, and the interaction with different inhibitors was analyzed by Surface Plasmon <b>Resonance</b> (SPR). The <b>screening</b> of inhibitors was performed in both direct and competitive binding format to determine which inhibitors could compete with the binding of farnesyl pyrophosphate to the enzyme active site. A combination of inhibition kinetics and computational modeling of interacting-structures may facilitate the testing of novel potential TRI 5 inhibitors and the prediction of their inhibitory mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{vaccinia virus}} (VACV) A 41 L gene encodes a {{secreted}} 30 kDa glycoprotein that is nonessential for virus replication but affects the host response to infection. The A 41 protein shares sequence similarity with another VACV protein that binds CC chemokines (called vCKBP, or viral CC chemokine inhibitor, vCCI), and strains of VACV lacking the A 41 L gene induced stronger CD 8 + T-cell responses than control viruses expressing A 41. Using surface plasmon <b>resonance,</b> we <b>screened</b> 39 human and murine chemokines and identified CCL 21, CCL 25, CCL 26 and CCL 28 as A 41 ligands, with Kds of between 8 nM and 118 nM. Nonetheless, A 41 was ineffective at inhibiting chemotaxis induced by these chemokines, indicating {{it did not}} block the interaction of these chemokines with their receptors. However the interaction of A 41 and chemokines was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by heparin, suggesting that A 41 and heparin bind to overlapping sites on these chemokines. To better understand the mechanism of action of A 41 its crystal structure was solved to 1. 9 A resolution. The protein has a globular beta sandwich structure {{similar to that of}} the poxvirus vCCI family of proteins, but there are notable structural differences, particularly in surface loops and electrostatic charge distribution. Structural modelling suggests that the binding paradigm as defined for the vCCI-chemokine interaction is likely to be conserved between A 41 and its chemokine partners. Additionally, sequence analysis of chemokines binding to A 41 identified a signature for A 41 binding. The biological and structural data suggest that A 41 functions by forming moderately strong (nM) interactions with certain chemokines, sufficient to interfere with chemokine-glycosaminoglycan interactions at the cell surface (microM-nM) and thereby to destroy the chemokine concentration gradient, but not strong enough to disrupt the (pM) chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was funded by}} the Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under the Food Institutional Research Measure as part of the National Development Plan. A surface plasmon <b>resonance</b> (SPR) biosensor <b>screening</b> assay was developed and validated to detect 11 benzimidazole carbamate (BZT) veterinary drug residues in milk. The polyclonal antibody used was raised in sheep against a methyl 5 (6) -[(carboxypentyl) -thio]- 2 -benzimidazole carbamate protein conjugate. A sample preparation procedure was developed using a modified QuEChERS method. BZT residues were extracted from milk using liquid extraction/partition with a dispersive solid phase extraction clean-up step. The assay was validated in accordance with the performance criteria described in 2002 / 657 /EC. The limit of detection of the assay was calculated from the analysis of 20 known negative milk samples to be 2. 7 μg kg− 1. The detection capability (CCβ) of the assay was determined to be 5 μg kg− 1 for 11 benzimidazole residues and the mean recovery of analytes was in the range 81 – 116 %. A comparison was made between the SPR-biosensor and UPLC–MS/MS analyses of milk samples (n = 26) taken from cows treated different benzimidazole products, demonstrating the SPR-biosensor assay to be fit for purpose...|$|R
