40|$|ObjectiveSince 2007, the Japanese Red Cross Blood Center has {{provided}} prestorage leukocyte-reduced {{red blood cell}} concentrates in which the leukocytes were reduced soon after collection. We have established a miniaturized bypass system (140 mL) to reduce the perioperative inflammatory responses. This {{study was designed to}} reveal the effectiveness of leukocyte-reduced <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> transfusion on perioperative inflammatory responses in pediatric cardiac surgery. MethodsBetween May 2006 and June 2008, 50 consecutive patients weighing less than 5 kg who underwent a surgical procedure with <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> transfusion using a miniaturized bypass system were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-five patients before 2007 received stored <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> in which leukocytes were reduced with a filter just before transfusion (group A). After 2007, 25 patients received the prestorage leukocyte-reduced <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> transfusion (group B). The postoperative peak C-reactive protein level, peak white blood cell count, peak neutrophil count, percentage body weight gain, inotrope score, plasma lactate concentration, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, and length of intensive care unit stay were compared as the perioperative inflammatory response and morbidity for both groups. ResultsThere {{were no significant differences in}} peak white blood cell count, peak neutrophil count, percentage body weight gain, and inotrope score between the groups. The peak C-reactive protein level in group A was significantly greater than that in group B (6. 7 ± 4. 7 vs 4. 2 ± 3. 6 mg/dL, P <. 05). The lactate concentration at 12 and 24 hours after surgical intervention in group A was significantly greater than that in group B (3. 1 ± 2. 5 vs 1. 9 ± 1. 1 mmol/L [P <. 05] and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 vs 1. 4 ± 0. 2 mmol/L [P <. 05], respectively). The postoperative mechanical ventilation time and intensive care unit stay in group A were significantly greater than those in group B (5. 9 ± 7. 4 vs 2. 1 ± 2. 0 days [P <. 05] and 9. 8 ± 7. 9 vs 5. 0 ± 2. 1 days [P < 0. 05], respectively). Multivariate analyses showed that the leukocyte-reduced <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> transfusion reduced the peak C-reactive protein level (in milligrams per deciliter; coefficient, − 2. 95; 95 % confidence interval [CI], − 4. 66 to − 0. 93; P =. 003), postoperative mechanical ventilation time (in days; coefficient, − 3. 41; 95 % CI, − 6. 07 to − 0. 74; P =. 013), and intensive care unit stay (in days; coefficient, − 4. 51; 95 % CI, − 7. 37 to − 1. 64; P =. 003). ConclusionsOur study revealed that in neonates and small infants, compared with transfusions with stored red blood cell concentrate, transfusion of leukocyte-reduced red blood cell concentrates was associated with reduced perioperative inflammatory responses and improved clinical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} open reduction internal fixation and {{total hip arthroplasty}} directions, results and complications associated with internal fixation in managing these fractures. Methods: In 8 years at 4 centers, 61 patients with associated acetabular fractures (Letournel classification) were treated. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups. The total hip arthoplasty (THA) group consisted of 30 patients, while the open reduction internal fixation group had 31 patients. The average age of the patients was 74. 7 years. The following parameters were compared: the duration of surgery and hospitalization, the international unit of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> transfusion, the time for the verticalization of the patient, perioperative complications, Harris hip score, and the short form (12) health survey. The clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months and annually thereafter. Patients with post-traumatic osteoarthritis formed the third comparison group. P ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant according to the analytical Student’s t-test. Results: The P < 0. 05 in favor of the THA group was: surgical time, length of stay, number of the international unit of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> transfusions, verticalization, quality of life and hip function, a reduction of perioperative complications and reinterventions. Conclusions: Our experience shows that the THA treatment for acetabular fractures in the elderly is to be preferred...|$|E
40|$|A 13 -year-old patient {{developed}} severe shock due to {{administration of}} a Yersinia enterocolitica-contaminated <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate.</b> Y. enterocolitica (serotype O: 9, biotype II) was cultivated from the residual {{blood in the}} blood bag and from a stool sample of the blood donor. In the donor's plasma immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG antibodies against Yersinia outer proteins (YopM, -H, -D, and -E) were found. Since the donor remembered a short-lasting, mild diarrhea 14 days prior to blood donation, a transient attack of Yersinia enteritis {{may be associated with}} a longer than expected period of asymptomatic bacteremia that causes contamination of donor blood. Serological screening for IgM antibodies against Yersinia outer proteins might offer a way {{to reduce the risk of}} transfusion-associated Y. enterocolitica sepsis...|$|E
40|$|Pathogen {{inactivation}} {{systems are}} {{in use in}} many European countries as routine procedures. However, a pathogen inactivation system for erythrocytes is currently not available. Although significant improvements {{have been made to}} decrease the incidence of transfusion-transmitted infections, risks remain for infectious disease agents specific to <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates,</b> such as parasitic infections resulting in babesiosis and malaria. The pathogen inactivation system for erythrocytes utilizes S- 303 and glutathione for the treatment of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates.</b> Preclinical studies to assess the pathogen inactivation efficacy and toxicology as well as preliminary clinical studies have been completed. Preclinical studies have shown log reduction for leukocytes, several viruses and bacteria in excess of 4 to 6 logs. Preclinical toxicology studies were conducted to enable the initiation of two phase III clinical studies in the USA for support of acute and chronic anemia. A second-generation system was developed after observation of an unexpected immune response in two chronic anemia patients. Preclinical pathogen inactivation studies, serological evaluations and a clinical study to evaluate survival of S- 303 -treated erythrocytes have been completed to support advanced development of the S- 303 pathogen inactivation system.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of endurance training on the clinical outcome in patients with haematological neoplasms receiving high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. A group of cancer patients followed an exercise program during hospitalization (training group; n = 37). The program was comprised of walking on a treadmill following an interval training pattern for 30 minutes daily. Patients in the control group (n = 43) did not train. By the time of hospital discharge the use of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> was significantly higher for control group compared to the training group (P= 0. 03). Duration of hospitalization, duration of fever, severity of fever or severity of infections showed {{no significant difference between the}} groups. Except for a slight increase of serum transaminases no hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal or cardiac complications were observed. The significant lower use of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> in the training group could be caused by stimulation of hematopoiesis by physical activity. We conclude that aerobic exercise can be safely carried out immediately after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. As the patients trained only in 29 percent of the time of hospitalization one possible reason why the majority of the investigated parameters failed to reach statistical significance may be the low number of training sessions. Nevertheless physical training should be part and parcel of rehabilitation in cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Background. Since cryoprecipitate, {{fibrinogen}} concentrate, or recombinant activated factor VII is {{not approved}} by public medical insurance in Japan, we retrospectively assessed blood product usage {{in patients with}} obstetric hemorrhage at our tertiary obstetric center. Material and Methods. 220 patients with obstetric hemorrhagic disorders who underwent blood product transfusion in our institution during a 5 -year period were reviewed for the types and volumes of blood products transfused. Results. There was a significant positive correlation (P< 0. 001) between the volume of RCC (<b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate)</b> transfused and that of FFP (fresh frozen plasma), irrespective of underlying obstetric disorders. The median of FFP to RCC ratio in each patient was 1. 3 – 1. 4, when 6 or more units of RCC were transfused. Conclusions. In transfusion for massive obstetric hemorrhage in terms of appropriate supplementation of coagulation factors, the transfusion of RCC : FFP = 1 : 1. 3 – 1. 4 may be desirable...|$|E
40|$|BioMed 2013 14 - 16 November 2013, Bangkok, ThailandBefore each {{transfusion}} of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate,</b> a final ABO compatibility test {{is carried}} out at the patient's bedside {{on a piece of}} card and interpreted visually. Despite this ultimate test, transfusion accidents still occur due to group incompatibility, which can be lethal. In order to improve this test, we have developed a specific device based on microarrays for the validation of a smart and safe transfuser in the context of critical transfusional situations. This miniaturized device incorporates a biochip to analyze ABO compatibility in order that the hemagglutination reaction of red blood cells with IgMs in solution be replaced by specific capture and concentration of IgMs on microarrays. Results indicate that a specific immunocapture is obtained with globular concentrates and with different total blood.

40|$|Post-partum obstetric {{haemorrhage}} is {{a leading}} cause of mortality among Japanese women, generally treated with haemostatic measures followed by supplementary transfusion. Commonly used in the setting of severe trauma, massive transfusion protocols (MTPs), preparations of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with additional supplements, have proved effective in decreasing patient mortality following major obstetric bleeding events. Although promising, the optimal configuration of RBC and FFP utilized for obstetric bleeding needs to be verified. Here, we conducted a systematic literature review to define the optimal ratio of RBC to FFP for transfusion therapy during instances of obstetric bleeding. Our analysis extracted four retrospective, observational studies, all demonstrating that an FFP/RBC ratio of ≥ 1 was associated with improved patient outcomes following obstetric haemorrhage. We therefore conclude that, from the standpoint of haemostatic resuscitation, an FFP/RBC ratio of ≥ 1 is a necessary condition for optimal clinical management during MTP administration in the field of obstetrics. Hence, we further propose an optimized MTP strategy to be utilized in the setting of severe obstetric bleeding...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we present the {{application}} of a method for the identification of homologous blood transfusions using forensic genetic techniques based on DNA typing. Ex vivo mixtures of human blood samples - either whole <b>blood</b> or <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> - simulating homologous blood transfusions at different percentages of the donor were typed for a panel of 16 highly variable DNA short tandem repeats (STR). Tested samples included also mixtures, which gave false-negative results if assayed by the reference flow cytofluorimetric method, which is based on the recognition of target antigens located on the membrane of the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell.</b> The recognition of triplets and quadruplets at various loci gave information of the presence of cells belonging to different individuals, as it is the case for homologous blood transfusions. Specificity and sensitivity of the method were assessed in the validation study. The method proved to be unequivocally specific since it was able to recognize all single profiles of each individual, clearly discriminating them from mixtures. Sensitivity resulted {{as a consequence of the}} percentage of the donor aliquot in the total volume of the mixture. Although the source of DNA in a blood sample is represented only by nucleated white <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> the same procedure resulted effective also in detecting mixtures of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> (RBCC) from leukodepletion procedure: DNA of the donor from the residual white <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> resulted still detectable, even if with an expected loss of sensitivity.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{contains}} {{the data collected}} in 2007, pursuant to Section 21 German Transfusion Act, and {{an analysis of the}} supply situation over the past 8 years. As in previous years, all blood donation centres located in Germany transmitted data on the collection, manufacture, import and export of blood components for transfusion. According to these data, a total of 6. 7 million blood collections were performed in 2007. With 4. 7 million, the portion of whole blood donations was at the level of previous years, whereas the number of apheresis donations rose again, to 1. 9 million. The portion of autologous blood collections accounts for only 1. 1 % and thus continues to decline. Since 2003, the number of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> prepared has been a constant 4. 5 million transfusion units. The decay of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> on the user side in 2000 accounted for 5 % while in 2007 it was just above 3 %, referred to the total quantity of data reported as transfused and decayed. The manufacture of platelet concentrates rose from 366, 000 to 480, 000 transfusion units between 2003 and 2007. The production of therapeutic single plasmas, too, markedly increased in 2007 (to 1. 2 million transfusion units). In 2007, 2. 2 million I of plasma for fractionation were collected in Germany. In addition, 1. 0 million I were imported, and 1. 8 million I were exported. The quantity available in Germany from a pure arithmetic point of view of 1. 4 million I was almost entirely allocated to basic fractionation so that a sufficient plasma supply can be assumed. Due to the fact that manufacturing capacities are still lacking in Germany, recombinant factors need to be imported in their entirety. Since 2003, Germany has by far been the leader in Europe with more than 20 I of fractionation plasma collected per 1, 000 inhabitants. Furthermore, regarding the manufacturing figures of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates,</b> platelet concentrates, and therapeutic single plasma, Germany is in the top third for all these products compared with other European countries. The manufacture of allogeneic stem cell products for haematopoietic reconstitution, obtained by apheresis, has continuously risen to 4, 700. A large portion of this (1, 810 transplants) could be exported while only a small number (179 preparations) had to be imported. The manufacture of autologous stem cell preparations from cord blood has risen drastically to more than 10, 000 in 2007. The interest in the figures collected in compliance with Section 21, German Transfusion Act remains high both in Germany and at an international level. Meanwhile reliable data are available...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{beneficial}} effect of blood transfusion on kidney graft survival requires {{the presence of}} leukocytes in the transfusate, but a minimal dose has not been defined, nor has the role of individual leukocyte subsets been investigated. In the Netherlands, a standard pre-transplant blood transfusion consists of a buffy coat (BC) -depleted <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> (RBCC) containing a maximum of 1. 2 x 10 (9) residual leukocytes per unit. However, leukocyte subset composition is not standardized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using FACS analysis, this study compared the residual leukocyte composition of RBCCs produced by Compomat((R)) and Optipress((R)), two currently used top-bottom systems. RESULTS: While the total leukocyte content of the RBCCs was equivalent in both press types (0. 5 x 10 (9)), the percentage of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) was significantly higher in the Compomat {{as compared with the}} Optipress system (p < 0. 0001), resulting in significantly higher numbers of transfused T cells, B cells, HLA-DR-positive cells, NK cells and stem cells.

40|$|The {{color of}} <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> (RBCC) limits its {{application}} in human food, {{but there is}} potential {{to use it for}} second-generation bioplastics. Several methods have been developed to remove color from RBCC, but they are expensive or may produce difficult-to-remove toxic residues. Hydrogen peroxide treatment is a cheaper alternative. The effects of RBCC concentration, pH, and reaction temperature were the most important factors influencing the decolorizing process. They were investigated with the aim of developing a method that could be scaled to commercial level for producing a bioplastic feedstock. Initial trials showed pH was an important factor for decolorization and foaming. At pH 15 there was a 96 % reduction in solution color and 8. 4 % solids were lost due to foaming. There was a 76 % reduction in solution color at pH 2 and only 2. 6 % solids were lost due to foaming. The optimal reaction conditions were to centrifuge 9 % w/w, pH 2 aqueous RBCC solution to remove aggregates. The solution was reacted at 30 °C with 7. 5 g of 30 % (w/w) hydrogen peroxide.

40|$|Red {{blood cells}} undergo {{a series of}} {{biochemical}} fluctuations during 35 – 42 -day storage period at 1 °C to 6 °C. The sodium/potassium pump is immobilised causing a decrease in intracellular potassium {{with an increase in}} cytoplasmic sodium levels, glucose levels decline, and acidosis occurs as a result of low pH levels. The frailty of stored erythrocytes triggers the formation of haemoglobin-containing microparticles and the release of cell-free haemoglobin which may add to transfusion difficulties. Lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress to band 3 structures, and other morphological and structural molecular changes also occur leading to spheroechinocytes and osmotic fragility. These changes that transpire in the red cells during the storage period are referred to as “storage lesions. ” It is well documented that gamma irradiation exacerbates storage lesions and the reports of increased potassium levels leading to adverse reactions observed in neonates and infants have been of particular concern.

40|$|Early {{resuscitation}} of {{septic shock}} patients reduces the sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. The main goals of septic shock resuscitation include volemic expansion, maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery, guided by central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, mixed or central venous oxygen saturation and arterial lactate levels. An aggressive fluid resuscitation, possibly {{in association with}} vasopressors, inotropes and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> transfusion {{may be necessary to}} achieve those hemodynamic goals. Nonetheless, even though fluid administration {{is one of the most}} common interventions offered to critically ill patients, the most appropriate type of fluid to be used remains controversial. According to recently published clinical trials, crystalloid solutions seem to be the most appropriate type of fluids for initial resuscitation of septic shock patients. Balanced crystalloids have theoretical advantages over the classic solutions, but there is not enough evidence to indicate it as first-line treatment. Additionally, when large amounts of fluids are necessary to restore the hemodynamic stability, albumin solutions may be a safe and effective alternative. Hydroxyethyl starches solutions must be avoided in septic patients due to the increased risk of acute renal failure, increased need for renal replacement therapy and increased mortality.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the storage time of human leukodepleted <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> compromises intestinal microvascular oxygen concentration oxygen (muPo(2)) during isovolemic exchange transfusion at low hematocrit. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting: University research institute laboratory. Subjects: Male Wistar rats. Interventions: Intestinal muPo(2) was determined by Pd -porphyrin phosphorescence life-time measurements. Measurements and main results: Rats were brought near {{to a state of}} oxygen supply dependency by hemodilution with a pasteurized plasma protein solution to a hematocrit of 14. 3 +/- 1. 1 % (n = 24). Subsequently, an isovolemic exchange transfusion with human leukodepleted <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> stored for 2 - 6 days (fresh, n = 8), 2 - 3 wks (intermediate, n = 8), or 5 - 6 wks (old, n = 8), was performed to {{determine whether}} intestinal muPo(2) would be preserved. Immunologic reactions were avoided by washing the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> three times before use. Isovolemic exchange with fresh and intermediate <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> maintained muPo(2), whereas old cells decreased muPo(2), with 26 %. Subsequent transfusion with <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> (hematocrit- 60 %) until reaching a hematocrit of 32. 4 +/- 2. 1 % (n = 24) increased intestinal muPo(2) in all three groups to the same extent between 28 % and 32 %. No changes in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability, as determined by a Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer, could be demonstrated during 5 wks of storage. Conclusion: This study shows that at low hematocrit, the oxygen delivering capacity of human <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> stored 5 - 6 wks is reduced compared with fresh <b>cells</b> and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> stored for an intermediate period. Although <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> stored for 2 - 3 wks are completely devoid of 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate, their oxygen-delivering capacity to the intestines was the same as fresh <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> Our study showed that <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability was preserved during storage, suggesting that other mechanisms may account for the observed decrease in oxygen delivery by <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> stored 2 - 3 wk...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{associations}} between perioperative blood transfusions and later recurrence of solid tumors have yielded conflicting results. A previous analysis of transfused patients suggested that recurrence {{was associated with}} transfusion of whole blood as opposed to <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates.</b> Additional analyses were performed on patients with cancers of the colon, rectum, cervix, and prostate to determine if patients receiving whole <b>blood,</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> only, or no transfusions had differing outcomes. Patients receiving 1 unit or more of whole blood had uniformly poor outcomes compared with nontransfused patients (p less than 0. 001). In contrast, patients receiving only <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> had progressively worse recurrence and death rates with increasing numbers of transfusion, suggesting {{the presence of a}} dose-effect relationship. Employing multivariate techniques, blood transfusion of {{less than or equal to}} 3 units that included any whole blood were independently and significantly associated with earlier recurrence (p = 0. 003) and death due to cancer (p = 0. 02). Transfusions of less than or equal to 3 units of blood comprised solely of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> were associated with no greater risk of recurrence than that seen in patients receiving no transfusion (p = 0. 50). These results provide a potential explanation for the disparate results reported in studies of blood transfusion and cancer outcome. The marked difference in outcome seen between patients receiving a few units of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and comparable patients receiving even one unit of whole blood are consistent with the hypothesis that transfusion of stored blood plasma causes earlier tumor recurrence in some instances. Strategies for reducing these risks might include avoidance of whole blood transfusions when only 1 - 3 units are required, more conservative transfusion practice, use of autologous blood transfusions, and perhaps, use of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> washed free of plasma and white cell debris.

In this period, 324 patients received the transfusion of blood components, 302 patients received 983 units of red cells (<b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate,</b> resuspended, washed, filtered), 17 patients received 5050 ml of platelets (single-donor concentrate or pooled platelet concentrate) and 5 patients received 2200 ml of fresh frozen plasma. An average use of red cell transfusion is 3, 26 units, platelet concentrate 5, 54, fresh frozen plasma 2 units per oncological patient who receives transfusion. The use of red cell units and platelet concentrate transfusion was adequate (91, 85 % of patients received transfusion of red cells when Hgb< 70 g/l, 89, 2 % of patients received platelet concentrate transfusion when platelet count was less than 20 x 109 /l). During radio and chemotherapy we noticed a decrease of hematological parameter values, whereas the experimental group patients were dependent on blood product transfusion. Statistically, a significant decrease of hemoglobin level and platelet count was observed in the patients treated only with radiotherapy, who are the greatest consumers of blood products...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT CONTEXT: Thrombotic microangiopathy {{syndrome}} or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) describes distinct diseases sharing common pathological features: microangiopathic {{hemolytic anemia}} and thrombocytopenia, without any other apparent cause. CASE REPORT: An 18 -year-old second-trimester primigravida {{presented with a}} history of fifteen days of intense weakness, followed by diarrhea over the past six days. She reported having had low platelets since childhood, but said that she had never had bleeding or menstrual abnormalities. Laboratory investigation showed anemia with schistocytes, thrombocytopenia and hypohaptoglobulinemia. <b>Red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> and platelet transfusions were performed. The hypothesis of TTP or HUS was put forward and ADAMTS 13 enzyme activity was investigated. The patient evolved with increasing platelet counts, even without specific treatment, and she was discharged. One month afterwards, she returned presenting weakness and swollen face and legs, which had developed one day earlier. The ADAMTS 13 activity was less than 5 %, without presence of autoantibodies. Regarding the two previous admissions (at 9 and 16 years of age), with similar clinical features, there was spontaneous remission on the first occasion and, on the second, the diagnosis of TTP was suspected and plasmapheresis was performed, but ADAMTS 13 activity was not investigated. CONCLUSION: To date, this is the only report of congenital TTP with two spontaneous remissions in the literature This report reveals the importance of suspicion of this condition in the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia without any other apparent cause...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we observed extensive clotting and fibrinolysis in blood from the thoracic cavities during cardiopulmonary bypass. We hypothesized that retransfusion of this suctioned blood could impair hemostasis. In this prospective clinical study we investigated the effect of suctioned blood retransfusion on systemic blood activation and on postoperative hemostasis. During coronary artery bypass grafting in 40 patients, suctioned blood was collected separately. It then was retransfused to the patient {{at the end of}} the operation (n = 19), or it was retained (n = 21). During the study, 12 consecutive patients, randomized in two groups of 6, were analyzed for biochemical parameters indicating blood activation and clotting. The immediate and significant increase in circulating concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex, tissue-type plasminogen activator, fibrin degradation products, and free plasma hemoglobin demonstrated the eff ect of suctioned blood retransfusion. Moreover, the increased concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex and fibrin degradation products indicated renewed systemic clotting and fibrinolysis as a direct result of the retransfusion of suctioned blood. Concentrations of all indicators mentioned remained significantly lower in the retainment group. The clinical data showed that retainment of suctioned blood resulted in significantly decreased postoperative blood loss (822 mL in the retransfusion group versus 611 mL in the retainment group; p < 0. 05) and similar or even reduced consumption of blood products (513 versus 414 mL <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> and 384 versus 150 mL single-donor plasma; both not significant). We conclude that retransfusion of highly activated suctioned blood during cardiopulmonary bypass exacerbates wound bleeding...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, studies {{suggesting}} a reduced oxygen delivery by stored <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> (RBCCs) have initiated {{a discussion about}} the use of fresh versus old blood.

40|$|Background: Large use of {{allogeneic}} <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> (RBCc), albeit {{necessary in}} major surgery, may influence patients' outcome. Design and methods: We introduced an integrated strategy including patients' evaluation and supplementation associated with autologous blood collection and saving to support major elective surgery at our hospital since 2008. After 2 years of stabilization of this approach, we analyzed {{the results obtained}} in 2010 in terms of allogeneic blood usage and reduction of transfusion of stored RBCc. Results: Analyzing 2010 results we found that usage of total autologous RBCc units was increased by 2. 2 folds, of "not stored" autologous RBCc units by 2. 4 folds and of allogeneic RBCc unit transfusion reduced by 65 %. The significant {{reduction in the number}} of transfused allogeneic RBCc units associated with the use of "fresher" blood could prevent patients' complications due to immunomodulation and biologic/metabolic disregulation.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the psychrophilic properties of Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis as contaminants of donated <b>blood.</b> MethodsBags with <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> (RBCCs) of A, B, and AB blood groups were inoculated with a bacterial suspension of Y. enterocolitica (0 : 3 and 0 : 8) and Y. pseudotuberculosis (serovars I and III) and stored at 4 °C for 30 days. Bacterial growth was measured at selected intervals after inoculation. Initial strains and their subcultures (isolated after 30 days’ incubation at 4 °C) were tested for glycolytic activity and susceptibility to the bactericidal action of human serum. ResultsIt was found that all strains grew well in the RBCCs of A, B, and AB groups. After incubation at 4 °C they increased their glycolytic activity and became {{more sensitive to the}} killing ability of human serum. ConclusionsThe prolonged storage of contaminated Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis RBCCs at 4 °C induces bacterial multiplication to high levels and stimulates glycolytic activity of bacterial cells...|$|R
40|$|After the {{introduction}} of solvent/detergent-treated plasma (ESDEP) in our hospital, an increased incidence of hyperfibrinolysis was observed (75 % vs 29 %; P = 0. 005) compared {{with the use of}} fresh frozen plasma for liver transplantation. To clarify this increased incidence, intraoperative plasma samples of patients treated with fresh frozen plasma or ESDEP were analyzed in a retrospective observational study. During the anhepatic phase, plasma levels of D-dimer (6. 58 vs 1. 53 microg/mL; P = 0. 02) and fibrinogen degradation products (60 vs 23 mg/L; P = 0. 018) were significantly higher in patients treated with ESDEP. After reperfusion, differences increased to 23. 5 vs 4. 7 microg/mL (D-dimer, P = 0. 002) and 161 vs 57 mg/L (fibrinogen degradation products, P = 0. 001). The amount of plasma received per packed <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate,</b> clotting tests, and levels of individual clotting factors did not show significant differences between the groups. alpha(2) -Antiplasmin levels, however, were significantly lower in patients receiving ESDEP during the anhepatic phase (0. 37 vs 0. 65 IU/mL; P 0. 95 IU/mL) because of the solvent/detergent process. Therapeutic consequences for the use of ESDEP in orthotopic liver transplantation are discussed in view of an increased incidence of hyperfibrinolysis caused by reduced levels of alpha(2) -antiplasmin in the solvent/detergent-treated plasma. IMPLICATIONS: The use of solvent/detergent virus-inactivated plasma is of increasing importance in the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus transmission. Since the use of this plasma during orthotopic liver transplantation has increased, the incidence of hyperfibrinolysis was observed. Clotting analysis of the patients revealed small alpha(2) -antiplasmin concentrations because of the solvent/detergent process...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether {{improving the}} metabolic status of {{red blood cell}} concentrates before freezing could extend the postthaw shelf life beyond 14 days while still meeting the requirements for hemolysis (0. 8 %) and total adenylate (> 82 % of original values). At Day 8 after collection, four leukoreduced red blood cell concentrates in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) were pooled, mixed, and split (n[*]=[*] 4). Of these concentrates, two were rejuvenated in Rejuvesol. In addition, two leukoreduced red blood cell concentrates in phosphate-adenine-glucose-guanosine-gluconate-mannitol (PAGGGM) were pooled, mixed, and split at Day 8 after collection (n[*]=[*] 4). All concentrates were glycerolized, frozen, and stored for at least 2 weeks at - 80 °C. After thawing and deglycerolization, from each pair, one <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> was resuspended in SAGM, and one was suspended in AS- 3. During postthaw storage at 2 to 6 °C for 35 days, all concentrates were sampled weekly and analyzed for hematologic, metabolic, and morphologic parameters. Both Rejuvesol and PAGGGM treatment produced increased adenosine triphosphate and total adenylate and 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate levels compared with untreated red blood cell concentrates. Regardless of prefreeze Rejuvesol or PAGGGM treatment, postthaw hemolysis remained below 0. 8 % during 7 days in SAGM and during 35 days in AS- 3. At Day 35 of postthaw storage in AS- 3, total adenylate in nonrejuvenated red blood cell concentrates had decreased to 72 % of the original values; whereas, in prefreeze Rejuvesol-treated and PAGGGM-treated concentrates, adenylate values were still were at 101 % and 98 %, respectively. Based on maximum allowable hemolysis of 0. 8 % and total adenylate content greater than 82 % of the original value, thawed, prefreeze Rejuvesol-treated or PAGGGM-treated red blood cell concentrates can be stored for 35 days at 2 to 6 ºC in AS-...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite the {{introduction}} of smaller cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuits for paediatrics, it is frequently necessary to add irradiated <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrate</b> (IRBC) to maintain adequate haemoglobin levels and the oxygen carrying capacity. Irradiation of blood weakens the cell membranes and results in an increase of lactate and potassium concentration. In addition, prolonged shelf time of IRBC may enhance its lactate level. To avoid the adverse effects of increased lactate and potassium concentration during paediatric bypass, prewashing of homologous blood in a cell-saving device was implemented at our institution. A retrospective audit of clinical data was performed to assess the relevance of this method. METHODS: Preceding {{the introduction}} of the blood pre-washing, we investigated 14 units of IRBC for lactate, potassium levels and shelf time. Afterwards, we evaluated the CPB and laboratory data from 69 patients with body weight < 10 kg and the lactate levels in the priming of the bypass circuit. RESULTS: The shelf time of blood units was 7. 6 ± 2. 7 days (minimum 5, maximum 14 days) with lactate concentration of 12. 6 ± 2 mmol/ land potassium concentration of 16. 2 ± 4. 7 mmol/l. In the priming after pre-washing, the lactate concentration was significantly lower than the standard priming (2. 5 ± 0. 9 vs 4. 5 ± 20 mmol/l, p = 0. 002). At the start of bypass, the lactate concentration after pre-washing was still lower (1. 5 ± 0. 4 vs 1. 9 ± 0. 9 mmol/l; p = 0. 04), {{but at the end of}} bypass we detected a significant increase of lactate in the pre-washed group (1. 5 ± 0. 4 vs 2. 2 ± 1. 1 mmol/l, p = 0. 01). There was no significant difference between the groups at the end of bypas...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTransfusion safety lies on {{the strict}} {{application}} of measures aimed: at avoiding the occurrence of acute hazards, {{as far as they}} can be prevented by e. g. the ABO compatibility for <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> and therapeutic plasma; at reducing the frequency of other acute accidents such as TRALI or post-transfusion GVH (based on the implementation of measures which prove to be largely efficacious though not completely); and at reducing delayed incidents and hazards. The implementation of such immunological safety measures also aim at favoring the transfusion efficacy, in avoiding the lysis of transfused red cells or platelets. Perfect immunological compatibility (match) is impossible because transfused cells expose several hundreds of molecular variants with antigenic properties. Adaptive immunity is largely based upon antigen/antibody conflicts and it predominates in transfusion immunological hazards, but inflammation (as well as other components of innate immunity) is now acknowledged as a major actor of transfusion immunological linked hazards...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} bleeding in high risk critically ill patients during high volume, citrate based continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). DESIGN: A prospective 1 -year observational cohort study comparing citrate based CVVH with nadroparin based CVVH. PROCEDURES: Critically ill patients with multiple organ dysfunction {{and in need of}} CVVH were observed for bleeding complications during their CVVH sessions. Pre-defined criteria determined that patients were treated with citrate based CVVH in case of active bleeding or increased risk for bleeding. Otherwise nadroparin was used as anticoagulant. Statistical and outcome methods: The incidence of bleeding complications, the number of transfused <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> and the filter-run-time were recorded. Analyses were made by non-parametric tests. MAIN FINDINGS: Fifty-five patients received 272 CVVH sessions. In the citrate group 14. 8 % experienced a bleeding complication compared to 25 % in the nadroparin group (p= 0. 04). The number of transfused <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrates</b> was not different between groups. The nadroparin group had a longer filter run time (median 31. 5 hours versus 22. 5 hours, p= 0. 0001).
