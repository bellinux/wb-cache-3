The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, {{the company}} {{encountered}} delays in implementing its plans. Neither {{of the two}} main line railway companies were interested in investing in the line, so the W's promoters approached the DR for assistance. In 1911, Albert Stanley, {{managing director of the}} DR, agreed that it would finance the construction, if the promoters would guarantee a return of £6,000 per year for ten years. The DR was to cover any shortfall below 4.5 per cent <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital.</b> To provide additional capacity for Sutton trains on the DR's Wimbledon branch, the DR published a bill on 21 November 1911 seeking permission to construct additional tracks on the L owned section from Wimbledon to East Putney. The works were approved by the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1912, which received assent on 7 August 1912. The L was to build the additional tracks with the DR covering the cost.|$|E

30|$|The {{main reason}} we now predict a {{slowdown}} of China’s potential growth rate is {{the trend in}} labor supply. As the working-age population stops growing, not only will the labor supply itself restrict economic growth but more importantly, labor shortages will generate diminishing <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital,</b> which has exerted little constraint on Chinese economic growth through the period of unlimited labor supply. Therefore, if the potential labor supply can be further developed and human capital significantly improved, not only factor bottlenecks but also diminishing <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> will be mitigated.|$|R

25|$|If {{the entire}} process up to the stage of {{printing}} is handled by an outside company or individuals, and then sold to the publishing company, it is known as book packaging.

25|$|PHEVs {{and fully}} {{electric}} cars may allow for more {{efficient use of}} existing electric production capacity, much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time. This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology known as charge control to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads. This is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology. By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities {{as well as their}} owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime, and provide a greater <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> for electricity infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|A {{different}} way to understand the aggregation problem does not involve the Classical pricing equations. Think about {{a decrease in the}} r, the <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> (corresponding to a rise in w, the wage rate, given that initial levels of capital and technology stay constant). This causes a change in the distribution of income, the nature of the various capital goods demanded, and thus a change in their prices. This causes a change in the value of K (as discussed above). So, again, the rate of return on K (i.e., r) is not independent of the measure of K, as assumed in the neoclassical model of growth and distribution. Causation goes both ways, from K to r and from r to K. This problem is sometimes seen as analogous to the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results (e.g., by Mas-Colell 1989) in general equilibrium theory, which shows that representative agent models cannot be theoretically justified, except under restrictive conditions (see Kirman, 1992 for an explanation of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results as an aggregation problem). Note that this says that it's not simply K that is subject to aggregation problems: so is L.|$|E

40|$|Using a two-sector {{endogenous}} growth model, {{the speed of}} convergence is determined primarily by the gap in rates of return between physical and human capital.

500|$|In 1898, Knut Wicksell {{proposed}} a monetary theory centered on interest rates. His analysis used two rates: the market interest rate, {{determined by the}} banking system, and the real or [...] "natural" [...] interest rate, determined by the rate of <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital.</b> In Wicksell's theory, cumulative inflation will occur when technical innovation causes the natural rate to rise or when the banking system allows the market rate to fall. Cumulative deflation occurs under the opposite conditions causing the market rate {{to rise above the}} natural. Wicksell's theory did not produce a direct relationship between the quantity of money and price level. According to Wicksell, money would be created endogenously, without an increase in quantity of hard currency, as long as the natural exceeded the market interest rate [...] In these conditions, borrowers turn a profit and deposit cash into bank reserves, which expands money supply. This can lead to a cumulative process where inflation increases continuously without an expansion in the monetary base.
