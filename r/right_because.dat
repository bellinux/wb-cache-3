5|$|With no {{government}} subsidy (s=0) the resulting equilibrium {{will be the}} standard Cournot outcome, {{as shown in the}} graph by the intersection of the best response functions. A subsidy however has the effect of shifting the domestic firm's best response function to the <b>right.</b> <b>Because</b> its output is subsidized, the domestic firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the <b>right.</b> <b>Because</b> he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally <b>right.</b> <b>Because</b> all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

If Bush were 'doing the weather-vane thing' he 'would have done something differently.|$|E
25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema and I must say a very difficult one. I {{had to work with}} a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was <b>right</b> <b>because</b> I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E
25|$|Employees have a {{right under}} s94 of the Act not to be unfairly dismissed. This is {{probably}} the most important <b>right,</b> <b>because</b> it would usually be under an action after dismissal that a former employee would complain that his other rights were breached. Firstly, it is unusual to commence litigation against an employer while still working for them. Secondly, some rights such as the right to reasonable notice before dismissal (s.86) can logically only be breached when someone is dismissed.|$|E

25|$|Both Anthony and Stanton {{joined the}} lecture circuit about 1870, usually {{traveling}} from mid-autumn to spring. The timing was <b>right</b> <b>because</b> {{the nation was}} beginning to discuss women's suffrage as a serious matter. Occasionally they traveled together but most often not. Lecture bureaus scheduled their tours and handled the travel arrangements, which generally involved traveling {{during the day and}} speaking at night, sometimes for weeks at a time, including weekends. Their lectures brought new recruits into the movement who strengthened suffrage organizations at the local, state and national levels. Their journeys during that decade covered a distance that was unmatched by any other reformer or politician.|$|E
25|$|Prominent BBC {{appointments}} {{are constantly}} {{assessed by the}} British media and political establishment for signs of political bias. The appointment of Greg Dyke as Director-General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist, {{as well as a}} friend of Tony Blair. The BBC's current Political Editor, Nick Robinson, was some years ago a chairman of the Young Conservatives and did, as a result, attract informal criticism from the former Labour government, but his predecessor Andrew Marr faced similar claims from the <b>right</b> <b>because</b> he was editor of The Independent, a liberal-leaning newspaper, before his appointment in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{ordinances}} of secession {{passed by}} the individual states, those of three—Texas, Alabama, and Virginia—specifically mentioned {{the plight of the}} 'slaveholding states' at the hands of northern abolitionists. The rest make no mention of the slavery issue, and are often brief announcements of the dissolution of ties by the legislatures. However, at least four states—South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas—also passed lengthy and detailed explanations of their causes for secession, all of which laid the blame squarely on the movement to abolish slavery and that movement's influence over the politics of the northern states. The southern states believed slaveholding was a constitutional <b>right</b> <b>because</b> of the Fugitive slave clause of the Constitution.|$|E

500|$|These {{traditions and}} ways of Indian life have been in effect {{for so long that}} this type of {{lifestyle}} is what women have become accustomed to and expect. [...] Indian women often do not take full advantage of their constitutional <b>rights</b> <b>because</b> they are not properly aware or informed of them. [...] Women also tend to have poor utilisation of voting <b>rights</b> <b>because</b> they possess low levels of political awareness and sense of political efficacy. [...] Women are not often encouraged to become informed about issues. Due to this, political parties do not invest much time in female candidates because there is a perception that they are a [...] "wasted investment." ...|$|R
25|$|It is {{suggested}} that these workers should fight back and protect their own labour rights, yet {{a lot of them}} in developing countries are ignorant about their own <b>right</b> <b>because</b> of low education level. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016), most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.|$|E
25|$|This high Mass is the norm; {{it is only}} in the {{complete}} rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood. Thus, the rubrics of the Ordinary of the Mass always suppose that the Mass is high. Low Mass, said by a priest alone with one server, is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing. Its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high Mass. For instance, the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the Gospel, because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high Mass; he turns round always by the <b>right,</b> <b>because</b> at high Mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his term, Netanyahu {{was opposed}} by the {{political}} left wing in Israel and lost support from the <b>right</b> <b>because</b> of his concessions to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. He was accused of appointing an attorney general who would reduce the charges and prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence to go to trial. In 1999, Netanyahu faced another scandal when the Israel Police recommended that he be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; Israel's attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence.|$|E
