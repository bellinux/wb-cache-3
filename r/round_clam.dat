The {{elongate}} macoma (Macoma tenta) get their name from their elongated shell with a shell proportion (width/length) that {{is greater than}} 1.5. The narrowed macoma clam’s shells {{tend to be more}} elongated than the Baltic macoma’s shells and have a smoother, pearly sheen that is slightly iridescent. The smooth shell may have several fine concentric growth lines which indicate yearly growth. Their color is white to yellowish compared to the pinkish tint of the Baltic macoma clam. They have a narrowed posterior end that is slightly twisted or curved to the left and the anterior end is long and <b>rounded.</b> These <b>clams</b> have one foot which helps to hold them in place and two siphons, tube-like structures in which water flows. Their long, thin, flexible siphons are of unequal length and fully retractable. The narrowed macoma clam only grows to a length of approximately three-quarters of an inch.|$|R
