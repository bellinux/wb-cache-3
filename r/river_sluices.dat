50|$|This project {{consists}} {{of a series of}} dams interconnected by tunnels and canals for harnessing the waters of the Parambikulam, Aliyar, Sholiyar, Thunakadavu, Thekkadi and Palar rivers, flowing at various elevations, for irrigation and power generation. The scheme is an outstanding example of engineering skill. At present, the discharges are being let down through three sets of slucies/ canals, viz., Pollachi Canal, Vettaikaranpudur Canal and the <b>river</b> <b>sluices.</b> Under this scheme, the irrigation discharges let down through river slucies of the Aliyar Dam utilized for power generation in a power house at the toe of the dam.

50|$|In 1649, {{interest}} in the drainage of the Bedford Level resumed, and a second Drainage Act was obtained. It {{became known as the}} 'Pretended Act', and authorised William Russell, the 5th Earl of Bedford, to carry out further work, the chief of which was a second channel parallel to the Bedford River. Vermuyden was again the engineer, and the new channel was completed in 1652. The Bedford River became known as the Old Bedford River, and the new channel became the New Bedford <b>River.</b> <b>Sluices</b> were built at Earith and Denver, and the river carried most of the flow of the River Great Ouse, resulting in its old course via Ely becoming just a drainage channel. The Corporation of the Bedford Level was set up, and took control of the river and the drainage channels, {{under the terms of the}} General Drainage Act, passed in 1663. This move was not popular with those engaged in navigation on the Great Ouse, as the sluices were operated for the benefit of the drainage scheme, and boats often had to wait for days or weeks while the sluices remained closed. The destruction of the Denver Sluice in 1713, caused by exceptional flood levels, was celebrated by the boatmen, but the resultant flooding led to the Corporation building a new sluice between 1748 and 1750. The concerns of the boatmen were placated by the provision of a navigation lock in the structure.|$|E

50|$|The Bhadra Dam {{project was}} the {{irrigation}} scheme to be {{undertaken by the}} National Water Management Project (NWMP), {{with the aim of}} increasing agricultural prosperity, particularly for rice production. The dam was built to a height of 59.13 m (above the river bed level) between 1947 (start of construction) and 1965 (year of commissioning). It has a gross storage capacity of 2.025 km3, live storage of 63.00 BCF at full reservoir level and a dead storage of 8.50 BCF at RL (reservoir level) of 631.54 m. The storage created by the reservoir is according to the allocation of 61.70 BCF (1.747 km3 including direct evaporation of 0.14 km3) of water made under the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal Award. The dam is built on a shattered rock based with a central masonry spillway. It has an earthen embankment on the left side and a rock hillock on the opposite side. The Ogee type spillway in the middle section of the river has been provided with four numbers of vertical lift gates over a width of 18.28 m and designed for a discharge of /s. In addition, two number <b>river</b> <b>sluices</b> are also provided to pass a discharge of /s. The annual siltation load considered in the design is 10.78 million cubic feet per square kilometer of catchment area. The canal outlets provided in the dam, initially for Hydropower generation followed by irrigation, consists of the left Bank canal outlet to discharge /s and two right bank canal outlets to pass a discharge of /s. There are several islands in the reservoir area which have been developed for tourism.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this report}} is to {{investigate}} the measure for controlling inside-levee inundation by flexible sluice gate operation {{in the event of}} tsunami in rivers. In order to prove the validation of our two-dimensional model, it is first applied to the simulation of the flood inundation in the Shiribetsu River by the 1993 Earthquake Tsunami off the Southwest coast of Hokkaido. Then it is used for predictions of tsunami run-up and subsequent inundation in both varying tsunami height and gate openness. It is shown that complete gate closure can increase the inundation risk of residential area particularly in the flooding time. A new sluice operation, namely, keeping a loophole of inside-levee discharge is proposed to resolve this problem. Numerical experiments in the targeted <b>river</b> <b>sluice</b> gate show the effectiveness of the measure for a key solution for inhibiting flooding for a certain period of time...|$|R

2500|$|Below Denver, the {{situation}} was {{complicated by the fact}} that there were six bodies with responsibility for the river in 1913. No dredging took place, as there was no overall authority. The training walls were repaired in 1930 by the King's Lynn Conservancy Board, and the Great Ouse Catchment Board reconstructed and extended them in 1937. After major flooding in 1937 and 1947, and the North Sea flood of 1953, flood control issues became more important, and the Cut-Off Channel was completed in 1964, to carry the headwaters of the River Wissey, River Lark and River Little Ouse to join the <b>river</b> near Denver <b>sluice.</b> The Great Ouse Relief Channel, which runs parallel to the main river for [...] from here to Wiggenhall bridge, was constructed at the same time.

5|$|In {{the most}} complex placer mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire <b>river</b> into a <b>sluice</b> {{alongside}} the <b>river,</b> and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom.

25|$|Because {{the gold}} in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, the early forty-niners simply panned for gold in California's rivers and streams.

50|$|To remedy this situation, a new chamber {{was built}} below the lock {{creating}} a staircase lock.

2500|$|Embanking the River Hull, and {{carrying}} water {{away from the}} carrs in a lower level channel was suggested by several engineers, but there was opposition to making the scheme really efficient.

The Beverley and Barmston Drainage Act was finally obtained in 1798, and work began.

It contains a reservoir of , or about 20% of the Nile's annual flow; the intended reservoir level is 300 metres above sea level, with the Nile level downstream of the dam being about 265 metres.

In 1911, the factory was bought by the Budapest-based Rimamurány-Salgótarján Iron Works, which remained the owner until 1924. In 1918, the furnaces stopped {{for a period of}} sixteen years, a main reason being a lack of coke and coal. In turn, these fuels were scarce because of difficulties in transporting along the railways from the coal-producing Jiu Valley. There were 1116 employees in 1916.|$|R
