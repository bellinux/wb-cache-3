40|$|ABSTRACT: Breathing {{disturbances}} during snoring {{have been}} quantified by face mask pneumotachography and oesophageal catheters. In order to nonobtrusively investigate respiratory mechanics during nonapnoeic snoring {{in relation to}} sleep disturbances, we employed calibrated respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP). In 10 snorers, RIP recordings were studied during nonapnoeic snoring without arousals in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, nonapnoeic snoring with repe-titive arousals in NREM sleep and wakefulness. Results were compared to RIP recordings in undisturbed NREM sleep and wakefulness in seven healthy non-snorers. Compared to wakefulness and undisturbed NREM sleep in nonsnorers, snoring was associated with predominant thoracic breathing, ribcage/abdominal asynchrony, and increased fractional inspiratory time. Preceding arousals during snoring, inspi-ratory flattening of time-derivatives of <b>RIP</b> <b>volume</b> signals, and marked ribcage/abdom-inal asynchrony indicated pronounced flow limitation. Low variation coefficients of respiratory cycle time (< 10 %) and tidal volume (< 20 %) discriminated snoring periods without arousals from snoring periods with arousals and from wakeful-ness periods, with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 99 %. Snoring periods with arousals were identified {{by the presence of}} snoring combined with high coef-ficients of variation of cycle time (≥ 10 %) and tidal volume (≥ 20 %), with a sensi-tivity of 96 % and a specificity of 100 %. Thus, characteristic patterns of ribcage/abdominal motion recorded by respira-tory inductive plethysmography differentiated breathing in sleep disruptive snor-ing from simple snoring...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the production trade-off between two land use options. In the first option - total protection from logging (TP) - water is used for hydroelectric power(HEP) generation and in a water regulatory dam to support continuous treated water production downstream. The other option - reduced impact logging (RIP) - integrates water uses with logging practices. With TP, natural sediment flow into the river system is low. Under <b>RIP,</b> sediment <b>volume</b> increases severalfold: almost five times in the water regulatory dam and almost three times into the three HEP water intake ponds. Timber, Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Background and objective: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess the accuracy of respiratory inductive plethysmographic (<b>RIP)</b> estimated lung <b>volume</b> changes at varying positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) during different degrees of acute respiratory failure. Methods: Measurements of inspiratory tidal volume were validated in eight piglets during constant volume ventilation at incremental and decremental PEEP levels and with increasing severity of pulmonary injury. RIP accuracy was assessed with calibration from the healthy state, from the disease state as the measurement error was assessed, and at various PEEP levels. Results: Best results (bias 3 %, precision 7 %) were obtained in healthy animals. RIP accuracy decreased with progressing degrees of acute respiratory failure and was PEEP dependent, unless RIP was calibrated again. When calibration was performed in the disease state as the measurement error was assessed, bias was reduced but precision did not improve (bias - 2 %, precision 9 %). Conclusions: RIP accuracy is within the accuracy range found in monitoring devices currently in clinical use. Most reliable results with RIP are obtained when measurements are preceded by calibration in pulmonary conditions that are comparable to the measurement period. When RIP calibration is not possible, fixed weighting of the RIP signals with species and subject size adequate factors is an alternative. Measurement errors {{should be taken into}} account with interpretation of small volume changes...|$|R
