25|$|Edwards won {{his second}} {{race of the}} year at Richmond in September, {{assuming}} the lead on a cycle of pit stops and holding off Kurt Busch in the last laps, earning him an additional three points for Chase seeding. Edwards' win however caused controversy as it was discovered that Edwards jumped in front of leader Paul Menard on a <b>restart</b> <b>to</b> take the lead for the final time; an action that NASCAR gave penalties for in the past. Following the controversy, NASCAR changed the rules to permit anybody to beat the leader to the start-finish line as long as they accelerate past the restart line first.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Pocono, Earnhardt started 9th. He ran {{inside the}} Top 10 {{for most of}} the race, and took the lead from Greg Biffle with 14 laps to go. Earnhardt had built up a lead in excess of three seconds when the caution came out for Kurt Busch's cut tire on lap 154, erasing his lead. He then sweated out a four lap shootout on the last <b>restart</b> <b>to</b> take his 3rd win of the year, marking the first time since 2006 that a driver swept both Pocono races (Denny Hamlin was the last driver). This win tied Earnhardt with Jimmie Johnson and Brad Keselowski for most wins of the season up to that point.|$|E
25|$|Félix da Costa's {{qualification}} race victory {{ensured that}} he started from pole position in the main event but lost the lead to his fast-starting teammate Sette Cãmara and second place to Ilott. Félix da Costa was able to reclaim second from Ilott and was 0.7 seconds behind Sette Cãmara before a safety car period neutralised the race and retook first from Sette Cãmara at the lap-seven restart. He pulled away from his teammate until a three-lap safety car period caused his advantage to be reduced to nothing and fended off an overtaking manoeuvre from Sette Cãmara at the <b>restart</b> <b>to</b> keep the first position. Rosenqvist overtook Sette Cãmara for second {{and was unable to}} draw close enough to affect an pass on Félix da Costa who remained in the lead {{for the rest of the}} race to win his second Macau Grand Prix. There were two lead changes and two yellow flags during the course of the race.|$|E

25|$|He had a {{far more}} {{successful}} Nationwide Series season than Sprint Cup Series season, including a win at the NAPA 200 at Montreal. In the race Edwards had a top-ten position until a final green-white-checker finish put him in third spot on the restart. Edwards passed Andrew Ranger for second and recovered from spinning his tires on the <b>restart</b> <b>to</b> catch up with dominant leader Marcos Ambrose. Edwards was unable to pass the Australian champion until the final turn of the final lap when Ambrose jumped over the curb too high. Edwards passed him and won the race in a big shock to the racing world; a finish considered {{to be one of}} the greatest of the sport. Edwards was elated about getting his first road course win at one of the most famous tracks in the world; has said that the Montreal race is his favorite winning performance, and that Marcos had chatted with him that week and taught him about the track during meetings which he credited for his success.|$|E
25|$|When racing resumed, Bird kept {{first place}} and {{was in front of}} both Mahindra cars. Di Grassi was seven seconds in arrears of Gasly, {{although}} the latter had fallen off the pace of the leading battle, and the two were separated by the yet-to-stop Frijns. Bird used the <b>restart</b> <b>to</b> increase his lead to three seconds over both Mahindra drivers without using too much electrical energy. D'Ambrosio spun at the chicane, and although his car's rear-end was damaged, his rear wing remained in tact. Félix da Costa steered to the inside of Duval, but spun at the first turn, falling behind Duval's teammate d'Ambrosio. Prost caught di Grassi and placed extensive pressure onto the latter for fifth position. Rosenqvist's team noticed his car had an energy readout issue, and they prompted teammate Heidfeld to overtake him for second position on lap 36 to see whether he could draw closer to Bird and pass him. Rosenqvist fell behind quickly so that his problem could be solved in a calmer environment. The manoeuvre allowed Bird to further extend his advantage by one second. Piquet was handed a drive-through penalty because he had not served an earlier ten-second penalty—which was issued to him after changing his engine—at his car swap. D'Ambrosio drove to the inside of teammate Duval entering the sixth turn, and passed him, enabling Félix da Costa to draw closer to both Dragon cars. One lap later, Félix da Costa braked later than Duval, but made contact with Duval at the first corner hairpin. Félix da Costa was issued with a drive-through penalty as a result.|$|E
25|$|In the 2013 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, Johnson won {{his record}} fourth All-Star race after a fast pit stop {{allowed him to}} start the final 10-lap sprint in second, and later managed to pass Kasey Kahne for the victory. One week later, Johnson {{finished}} 22nd after spinning sideways late in the race. At Dover, Johnson led 143 laps, but finished 17th when he jumped Juan Pablo Montoya on the last restart causing NASCAR to issue him a penalty. He was able to redeem himself for this mistake the following week at Pocono by earning the pole position, leading the most laps, and winning his third race of the season, which increased his point lead to 51 points over Edwards. This also snapped a nine-year winless streak for Johnson at Pocono since sweeping both of the track's 2004 NASCAR Cup Series races. At the Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan, Johnson closed in on Greg Biffle for the lead with less than ten laps left, but suffered a flat tire with less than five laps to go. Johnson would finish the race in 28th, his worst finish of the season to that point. Johnson then finished ninth at Sonoma. At Kentucky, Johnson started third. He had the dominant car of the race, leading 182 of 267 laps. However, on a restart on lap 246, Johnson was slow {{to get up to}} speed and was subsequently touched and spun by Joey Logano, costing Johnson a shot at the win and giving the race to Matt Kenseth. Johnson was able to charge through the field after the caution and <b>restart</b> <b>to</b> salvage a ninth-place finish.|$|E

500|$|Limbo was {{generally}} praised for its puzzle {{design and the}} simplicity of its controls. Jake Gaskill of G4 TV {{was impressed by the}} complexity of the puzzles based on the two simple actions of jumping and grabbing onto objects, similar to LittleBigPlanet, with a variety of elements to assure [...] "you're always facing something new and challenging" [...] during the game. Game Informer Matt Miller commented that part of the success of Limbo is that [...] "every one of these [...] stands alone"; the game accomplishes this in Miller's opinion by varying the elements throughout the game, and preventing the player from getting too accustomed to similar solutions since [...] "everything changes". GameSpy's Ryan Scott believed that the game empowered the player to work through solutions themselves, and its puzzle design, [...] "with its elegant simplicity, offers up what feels like a world of meaningful possibilities". The frequency of death was not considered a distraction from the game; not only were the deaths seen as necessary as part of learning and overcoming each obstacle, but reviewers found the checkpoints where the player would <b>restart</b> <b>to</b> be plentiful throughout the game. Will Freeman of The Guardian praised the game but noted that beyond the [...] "smoke and mirrors" [...] of Limbo artwork, the game is [...] "undermined by the title's lack of innovative gameplay", which he says has been seen in earlier platform games.|$|E
