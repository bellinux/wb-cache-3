40|$|International audienceThe lateral-torsional {{stability}} of circular arches subjected to radial and follower distributed loading is treated herein. Three loading cases are studied, including the <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> with constant direction, the <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> directed towards the arch centre, and the follower <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> (hydrostatic load), as treated by Nikolai in 1918. For the three cases, the buckling loads are first {{obtained from a}} static analysis. As {{the case of the}} follower <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> (hydrostatic load) is a non-conservative problem, the dynamic approach is also used to calculate the instability load. The governing equations for out-of-plane vibrations of circular arches under <b>radial</b> <b>loading</b> are then derived, both with and without Wagner's effect. Flutter instabilities may appear for sufficiently large values of opening angle, but flutter cannot occur before divergence for the parameters of interest (civil engineering applications). Therefore, it is concluded that the static approach necessarily leads to the same result as the dynamic approach, even in the non-conservative case...|$|R

50|$|A {{spherical roller}} thrust bearing is a rolling-element bearing of thrust type that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. The bearing is designed to take <b>radial</b> <b>loads,</b> and heavy axial loads in one direction. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the shaft washer that may be misaligned in respect to the housing washer. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape of the house washer.|$|E

40|$|Automobile {{wheel is}} an {{important}} component in vehicles to support the vehicle weight and maintain the contact between the vehicle body and road. Automotive wheels have evolved over the decades using materials from steels to aluminum and magnesium alloys. Aluminum wheels have gain popularity over steel wheels because they have less weight, better cosmetic appearance, and higher thermal conductivity for faster dissipation of heat from brakes. A rim is subject to mainly <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> and inflation pressure. The <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> is exerted on the rim as a vertical reaction force by road surface on four tires to balance the weight of a car. The <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> is applied to the rim at the bead seats with the tire, following a cosine function distribution around the contact area. The tire air pressure is applied directly on the rim at its outer side and indirectly at the rim flange. This project studied the influence of the <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> and the tire inflation pressure on the stress and displacement distribution in the wheel rim. A computer aided design model of an aluminum alloy wheel rim is analyzed using ANSYS. The geometrical parameters of the rim is further optimized to reduce weight...|$|R

5000|$|Principally, the {{simplest}} way to accomplish the yaw bearing tasks with gliding elements is with two gliding planes for the axial loads (top and bottom) and a radial gliding surface for the <b>radial</b> <b>loads.</b> Consequently, the gliding yaw bearing comprises three general surfaces covered with multiple gliding pads. These gliding pads come in sliding contact with a steel disk, which is usually equipped with gear teeth to form a gliding-disk/gear-rim. The teeth may be located at the inner or the outer cylindrical face of the disk, while the arrangement of the gliding pads and their exact number and location vary strongly among the existing designs. To assemble the gliding yaw bearings, their cages split in several segments that are assembled together during wind turbine installation or manufacturing.|$|E

50|$|Tapered roller thrust {{bearings}} consist of small tapered rollers arranged {{so that their}} axes all converge at a point on the axis of the bearing. The length of the roller and {{the diameter of the}} wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the bearing face without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as <b>radial</b> <b>loads.</b> They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{paradigm}} {{precedent for}} MonoMetro {{is that of}} the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, but the technology of MonoMetro is quite different. The trains are suspended from six-wheeled bogies (or trucks America) running along a narrow gauge pair of rails; MonoMetro is thus a railway and not a monorail. The rails have a concave cross section and the wheels a corresponding convex profile. The vehicle load hangs centrally from a pivoting joint located at the intersecting radial load lines of the wheels. According to the patent [...] "this configuration moves the pivot point away from the wheel-track contact point (as in the Wuppertal Schwebebahn) to the point of intersection of the <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> through the wheels. There is no torque acting on the bogie frame causing loss of contact with the track raceway as would happen if the load and bogie assembly were rigidly connected". The patent compares this to monorail technology that instead require a much heavier guideway and heavier bogies to overcome torsional forces and also need complex superelevation to provide passenger comfort on corners. The patent says propulsion will be provided by linear induction motors.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary {{bearings}} hold {{rotating components}} such as shafts or axles within mechanical systems, and transfer axial and <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> {{from the source}} of the load to the structure supporting it. The simplest form of bearing, the plain bearing, consists of a shaft rotating in a hole. Lubrication is often used to reduce friction. In the ball bearing and roller bearing, to prevent sliding friction, rolling elements such as rollers or balls with a circular cross-section are located between the races or journals of the bearing assembly. A wide variety of bearing designs exists to allow the demands of the application to be correctly met for maximum efficiency, reliability, durability and performance. The term [...] "bearing" [...] is derived from the verb [...] ""; a bearing being a machine element that allows one part to bear (i.e., to support) another. The simplest bearings are bearing surfaces, cut or formed into a part, with varying degrees of control over the form, size, roughness and location of the surface. Other bearings are separate devices installed into a machine or machine part. The most sophisticated bearings for the most demanding applications are very precise devices; their manufacture requires some of the highest standards of current technology.|$|E

40|$|A {{circular}} arch with in-plane <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> uniformly distributed around the arch axis is primarily sub-jected to uniform compression. Under this action, the arch may suddenly deflect laterally and twist {{out of the}} plane of loading and fail in a flexural-torsional buckling mode. In most studies of the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of arches under uniform compression, the directions of the uniformly distributed loads are assumed to be unchanged and parallel to their initial directions during buckling. In practice, arches may be subjected to hydrostatic or to uniformly distributed directed <b>radial</b> <b>loads.</b> Hydrostatic loads always remain normal to the tangent of the deformed arch axis, while uniformly distributed directed <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> always remain directed toward a specific point during buckling. These uniform <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> may act at a load height, such as at the top surface of the cross-section. In this case, the <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> produce an additional torsional moment during buckling which affects the flexural-torsional buckling of the arch. This paper uses both virtual work and static equilibrium approaches to study the elastic flexural-torsional buckling, effects of the load height on the buckling of {{circular arch}}es under uniform compression (that is, produced by uniformly distributed dead or by directed <b>radial</b> <b>loads),</b> and closed form solutions for the buckling loads are developed. 1...|$|E
