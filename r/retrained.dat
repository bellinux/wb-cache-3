50|$|Attentional <b>retraining</b> is the <b>retraining</b> of {{automatic}} attentional processes. The method of <b>retraining</b> varies but has typically employed computerized training programs. The term originally indicated <b>retraining</b> {{of attention to}} rehabilitate individuals after a brain injury who suffered from neurological disorders of attention including hemineglect, perseveration, limited attention span, and even ADHD. However, in more recent research and clinical applications attentional <b>retraining</b> has also been applied {{as a type of}} cognitive bias modification. In this application, attentional <b>retraining</b> refers to the <b>retraining</b> {{of automatic}} attentional biases that have been observed in high levels of anxiety.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{study of}} adult job <b>retraining</b> in further {{education}} and industry. Through indepth case studies of {{a small number of}} chemical and engineering companies and one college of further education, it attempts to develop an understanding of the broader relationship between further education, industry and government as it pertains to <b>retraining.</b> Data was collected by unstructured interview and participant observation. Supporting data was collected by means of postal questionnaires. The thesis is divided into four parts. Part one examines national government training and <b>retraining</b> policy; a policy characterised by ambiguity and ambivalance. Part two reviews the development of further education, and assesses the adult job <b>retraining</b> provision within one particular college. Part three examines <b>retraining</b> in industry and describes the enterprise restructuring under which <b>retraining</b> took place in three chemical companies. On the basis of findings outlined in Parts two and three, Part four asks whether further education is equipped to provide the type of <b>retraining</b> which industry believes it requires. The thesis concludes that, because industry and further education acknowledge two different concepts of <b>retraining,</b> a structural disengagement occurs. Further education seeks to provide individuals with general competencies whereas industry is concerned with enterprise specific <b>retraining.</b> The remainder of Part four examines the <b>retraining</b> experience {{from the point of view}} of trainees and students and looks at the way skills, in the context of training and <b>retraining,</b> undergo reconstruction. This thesis contributes to an area which is currently under-researched; and at a time of structural change within industry and further education, issues relating to <b>retraining</b> become important. The thesis examines this restructuring and suggests ways in which <b>retraining</b> can be reorganised for the benefit of industry, communities and individuals...|$|R

5|$|Following {{reports of}} {{disciplinary}} problems, VI Corps ordered an investigation, {{which took place}} over four days while elements of the battalion were still engaged at Rittershoffen. It recommended that the battalion be withdrawn and <b>retrained</b> before returning to combat under a new commander, while Major-General Edward H. Brooks, the corps commander, instead recommended that the battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units. General Alexander Patch, commanding Seventh Army, agreed with Brooks, suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed from the men of service units, themselves replaced by {{the men of the}} 827th. This was contentious, however; the number and status of segregated combat units was a matter of intense political debate, and converting a black combat unit to a service one, in favor of white troops, was likely controversial.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{is presented in}} this paper for improving the performance of neural network classifiers in video object tracking applications, based on a <b>retraining</b> procedure at the user level. The procedure includes (a) a <b>retraining</b> algorithm for adapting the network weights to the current conditions, (b) semantically meaningful object extraction which plays the role of the <b>retraining</b> set and (c) a decision mechanism for determining when network <b>retraining</b> should be activated. The <b>retraining</b> algorithm takes into consideration both the former and the current network knowledge in order to achieve good generalization and reduce <b>retraining</b> time. Object extraction is accomplished by utilizing depth information, provided by stereoscopic video and incorporating a multiresolution implementation of the Recursive Shortest Spanning Tree (RSST) segmentation algorithm. Finally the decision mechanism in this framework depends on a scene change detection algorithm. Results are presented which illustrate the performance of the proposed approach in real life experiments...|$|R

At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} <b>retrained,</b> they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E

5|$|The first air {{transport}} unit in SWPA {{was called the}} Air Transport Command, which was formed at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland on 28 January 1942. It was equipped with five C-53s originally bound for the Philippines, and two B-18s and a C-39 that had escaped from there. Only two of the original 14 pilots were fully qualified on transports; the remaining 12 had to be <b>retrained.</b> Of the 19 airmen, 12 were trained as aircrew members. It was redesignated the 21st Transport Squadron on 3 April. On the same date, the 22nd Transport Squadron was formed at Essendon Airport in Victoria with former KNILM and RNEIAAF aircraft that had arrived in Australia from Java. The two squadrons were redesignated the 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons on 26 July. The RAAF formed four transport squadrons in February and March 1942, and No. 33 Squadron RAAF began flying a regular passenger and freight service from Townsville to Port Moresby on 5 March.

40|$|A {{feed-forward}} {{neural network}} artificial model, or multilayer perceptron (MLP), learns input samples adaptively and solves non-linear problems for data that are noisy and imprecise. Another variant of MLP, known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has additional features such as weight sharing, local receptive field, and subsampling, making CNN superior in handling challenging pattern-recognition tasks. Although CNN has improved the performance of MLP, the complexity of its structure has caused <b>retraining</b> processes to become inefficient whenever new categories or neurons using a winner-takes-all approach are added at the classifier stage. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} <b>retrain</b> the complete network set when new categories are added to the network. However, such a <b>retraining</b> incurs additional cost and training time. In this paper, we propose a <b>retraining</b> scheme that could overcome the mentioned problem. The proposed <b>retraining</b> scheme generalizes the feature of extraction layers, hence the <b>retraining</b> process only involves the last two layers instead of the whole network.

At the end of the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program (NCARP), it was found that fisherpeople had not been highly motivated to take advantage of <b>retraining</b> opportunities. The second stage of assistance to fishery workers, The Atlantic Groundfish Strategies Labour Adjustment Component (TAGS) followed NCARP with a five year income and programs support structure that also included prominent <b>retraining</b> opportunities. [...] The impact of personal and situational influences which were thought to be crucial to an individual's decision to <b>retrain</b> was studied through the administration of a questionnaire to <b>retraining</b> NCARP/TAGS recipients. Data from the questionnaires were analyzed through multiple regression and crosstabulation analyses. Results indicated that the factors which appear to primarily influence motivation to <b>retrain</b> were not inherent to an individual and may thus be modified to foster and promote an increased willingness to <b>retrain</b> in the future. Background variables such as age, gender, marital status, completion of high school and number of dependents did impact in part on attitudes toward <b>retraining</b> but the major influences emerged {{in the form of the}} socio-psychological variables (degree of reliance on the fishery, perceived age, perceived school ability, self-actualization, attachment to the community, significant others and career planning).
