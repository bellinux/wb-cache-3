25|$|On Hesselberg {{all forms}} (high forest, coppice-with-standards, coppice) and types (temperate {{coniferous}} forest, mixed forest, deciduous forest) of forests can be found. The coppice {{in the upper}} regions of the northern slope has the strangest appearance. After coppicing more light reaches the ground and thermophile animals such as the sand lizard thrive. Later, when the canopy closes again, many other specialised animals such as the Eurasian woodcock find a suitable habitat. All game that is typical of German forests (for example hare, roe, red fox, and squirrel) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of woodpeckers and the crying of cuckoos contribute to {{the mood of the}} wood as well as the singing of countless birds. Various Ranunculaceae—such as liverworts and wood anemones—are the signs of spring in Hesselberg's forests. In May ramsons turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a carpet of green and white blooms. After blooming the intense odour of garlic fills the air. The various species of orchids such as the <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> have become increasingly rare. The Turk's-cap lily, which belongs to the lily family, can still be found relatively often but flower's diversity is in need of protection. The erica and the Cytisus scoparius prefer the iron sandstone layers of the lower parts of the slopes.|$|E
500|$|Raasay {{is home to}} the Raasay vole (Clethrionomys glareolus erica), a {{subspecies}} of bank vole, {{which is}} darker and heavier than the mainland variety and found nowhere else in the world. It is possibly a survivor of a Scandinavian race. Murray (1973) states that a single specimen of a pine marten, otherwise missing from the Hebrides, was found on the island in 1971. [...] No other records for this species exist. Raasay is one of only four of the Inner Hebrides where mountain hares breed. Raasay is regularly visited by white-tailed sea eagles and golden eagles and there are populations of otter, red deer and European rabbit (which were thoughtlessly introduced by the island's proprietor in the 19th century). Stoat and weasel are found in small numbers as are water shrew. It also supports a rich variety of plants, including red broomrape, dark <b>red</b> <b>helleborine,</b> mountain avens and numerous other saxifrages, orchids, alpines and ferns. The carline thistle (Carlina vulgaris) was apparently extant in the 1970s, but a recent survey found no evidence of its continued existence. There are several stands of mixed woodland.|$|E

5000|$|Mainly beeches {{and silver}} firs {{grow in the}} deep and damp soil and form a dense canopy [...] For this reason, low {{shrubbery}} is almost entirely absent and only shade tolerant plants like enchanter's-nightshade, arum and woodruff grow there. The {{major part of the}} forest stands on dry and nutrient-poor soil. Durmast oak, field maple and whitebeam, as well as the non-local conifer scots pine are to be found here. In addition, pinnate coralroot, dog's mercury, as well as carex and various orchids, for example bird's-nest orchid and <b>red</b> and white <b>helleborine</b> grow here. Oak and hornbeam forests grow in some places. Ash-alder communities dominate the headwater regions.|$|R

5000|$|When {{used for}} flowers, red often refers to purplish (red deadnettle, red clover, <b>red</b> <b>helleborine)</b> or pink (red campion, red valerian) colors.|$|E
50|$|Hawkley is {{situated}} {{in an area of}} outstanding natural beauty, sitting on the Hangers Way. Hawkley Warren, an important site for <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine,</b> borders the village.|$|E
50|$|On some hidden {{parts of}} the reserve orchids like the dark <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis atrorubens) the fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera) and many others grow year by year.|$|E
50|$|The wood {{consists}} of an extensive tract of the Chiltern escarpment. It contains beech woodlands, scrub and chalk grassland. It {{is one of three}} extant British locations for the <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> orchid.|$|E
50|$|Species of {{tree and}} shrub include ash, downy birch, hazel, hawthorn, yew and rowan. In the woods shrubs such as wild privet and spindle can be found. More rare is dark <b>red</b> <b>helleborine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cephalanthera rubra, {{known as}} <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine,</b> is an orchid found in Europe, North Africa and {{southwest}} Asia. Although reasonably common {{in parts of}} its range, this Cephalanthera {{has always been one}} of the rarest orchids in Britain.|$|E
50|$|He is {{best known}} as the co-discoverer (with K. Turner) of <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine</b> at Hawkley Warren, near Petersfield, in 1986, one of only three British sites where this species {{remained}} extant {{at the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{including}} rigid buckler fern, angular Solomon's seal, limestone fern, {{and dark}} <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> {{are to be}} found on the pavement. The nationally scarce rigid buckler-fern Dryopteris submontana is abundant on Hutton Roof Crags. Blue moor grass is also nationally scarce but abundant here.|$|E
50|$|Magnesian {{limestone}} grassland supports an {{assemblage of}} calcicolous plants adapted to growing in thin soils with a short sward. The quarry holds {{one of the largest}} British populations of the dark <b>red</b> <b>helleborine,</b> Epipactis atrorubens; a survey in 2010 found nearly 1700 flowering spikes of this nationally rare species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} most of Europe, east to the Urals {{and as far as}} 60 degrees north. It is however rare in Britain, the Low Countries and western France. It also occurs in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia and in various parts of southern Asia as far east as Iran.|$|E
50|$|Ruabon Moors {{are part}} of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and hold a wide variety of plant and animal life. Large parts of the moors are covered with heather. Where there are {{outcrops}} of limestone on the surface a number of scarce plants can be found such as prickly sedge, dark <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> and rigid buckler-fern.|$|E
50|$|The site's primary {{interest}} lies in {{the fact}} that it is one of three sites in Britain where <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine</b> Cephalanthera rubra remains; this orchid grows on a north-west facing slope. The others being Workman's Wood in Gloucestershire and Windsor Hill SSSI, a site in the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire. The species was first found at Hawkley Warren in 1986 by K. Turner and Ralph Hollins.|$|E
50|$|The Dark <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine</b> favours {{warm and}} dry locations, with soil basic to neutral in pH, nutrient-poor, and permeable. It grows in loose rock, scree, or sandy soils above a {{limestone}} substrate, including dunes, lawns, or open forest. It is also a pioneer species, which settles in fallow areas, road embankments, and waste dumps, {{in the early to}} middle stages of ecological succession, among communities of grass and bush and light birch stands.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{parts of}} the woods are {{dominated}} by various conifers and the flora of the forest floor is rather poor of species in most areas. Where chalk comes to the surface layers, it can present some rare and more interesting plant species though, like the rare lady's-slipper orchid growing {{side by side with}} plants like pennywort, smell fox and <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> for example. Note: In Denmark all orchids are to be protected and it is not allowed to pick them.|$|E
50|$|The lower eastern {{slopes of}} the {{mountain}} have a landscape of pastureland, small farms and woods. The higher moorland above Fron-dêg, known as the Fron-dêg Flat, has typical moorland vegetation of heather, bilberry and sedge; rarer plants include the dark <b>red</b> <b>helleborine.</b> Hill farming is still practised, with sheep grazing across the moor. There are still surface remains of former lead workings, particularly in the areas known as Pool Park and Gwter Siani, with the foundations of old engine-houses, managers' residences and chimneys being visible in some places.|$|E
5000|$|The Dark <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine</b> is {{widespread}} across Europe, and {{is found in}} the north to the subarctic, in the south to the Mediterranean, and in the east to Western Siberia and the Caucasus. (Codes) [...] The orchid grows at altitudes from sea level to 2400 m, and so can be found in mountainous regions such as the southern Alps. In Central Europe it has been in decline in recent decades. It is not, however, one of the most severely threatened species of orchid. The species is also reportedly naturalized in one location in the US State of Vermont.|$|E
50|$|Viidumäre {{nature reserve}} {{consists}} mostly of pine- and oak-forest, complemented with meadows, bogs and traditionally utilised wooded meadows. The nature reserve {{is located in}} the west of Saaremaa, on the oldest and highest lying part of the island. The nature reserve is important for its great biodiversity. As regards to the flora, the nature reserve is home to the Rhinanthus osiliensis, a species of rattle which can only be found on Saaremaa and Gotland islands in the Baltic Sea. Other notable species include <b>red</b> <b>helleborine,</b> marsh helleborine, Kashubian vetch and rock whitebeam. The bird life is rich with species like black woodpecker, Eurasian pygmy owl, black stork and white-tailed eagle as typical representatives. Mammals such as elk and wild boar are frequent in the area. Facilities for visitors include bird watching towers, hiking trails with information boards and a visitor centre.|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and <b>Red</b> <b>helleborine.</b> Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, {{on the slopes of}} the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.|$|E
40|$|In 2007 and in {{previous}} years, {{as part of}} ongoing attempts to improve <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> Cephalanthera rubra seed-set, hand pollination of florets has been undertaken at a small colony of this species in Buckinghamshire, southern England. Natural pollination rarely occurs (one mature pod recorded in 10 years) at this site. In 2007, hand pollination resulted {{in the production of}} four seed pods, of which one withered and died. Upon ripening, the three remaining pods were removed for attempted micropropagation of the seeds. Ongoing conservation management has probably benefited the solitary bee Chelostoma campanularum which now appears fairly plentiful at the site, but despite the presence of this <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> flower visitor, natural pollination remains virtually unrecorded at this locality; field observations suggest that C. campanularum is in fact probably not large enough to act as an effective <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> pollinator as it can slip {{in and out of the}} flowers without removing the pollinia, unlike it larger relative C. fuliginosum, absent from the UK but which is a known pollinator of <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> in continental Europe...|$|E
40|$|Investigated {{have been}} the {{questions}} of the reproductive biology of six rare species of orchids in Permsky region (bulb calipso, long-leave and <b>red</b> <b>helleborine,</b> gnat kokushnik) {{with the aid of}} the light microscope, using the constant and temporal acetokarmine preparations; in the base of the antecological observation were the methods, offered by A. N. Ponomarev (1960). The complete embryological picture of formation of the male and female gametophyte, the process of fertilizing, the development of the embryo and endosperm has been obtained. The fertility of the mature pollen grains has been determined. It has been established, that the cross-pollination with entomophilia - the basic strategy of pollination of the studied species, the relaization of which is hindered. The self-pollination is excluded with mutual arrangement of the anther and stigma on hinostemia. The obtained data are necessary in the development of measures on the protection of the rare and disappering species of orchids with the vulnerable points in its biology of multiplication taken into account. This information can be used in considering the questions of the adaptive evolution. The data of peculiarities of the biology of the rare orchids of the Urals can be used in the study process, when teaching the courses of botany and protection of nature in the higher and middle special teaching establishmentsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
