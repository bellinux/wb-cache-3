MTV said that [...] "Roman Reloaded {{seems to be}} a return to the hard-core rap style Nicki first entered the game with on mixtapes like Beam Me Up Scotty......How the title track will fit on Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded remains to be seen, but as a standalone, it proves {{that when it comes to}} simply spewing <b>rap</b> <b>bars,</b> Nicki Minaj is still the queen bee." [...] Billboard said that [...] "Unlike the RedOne-produced dance-pop candy of 'Starships' or the Grammy-premiered exorcism drama of 'Roman Holiday', 'Roman Reloaded' is a more traditionalist hip-hop offering, featuring hard-hitting production and guest verses from Lil Wayne." ...|$|R

In 2010, he starred in the film Caged Animal, alongside Ving Rhames, Gillie Da Kid and Robert Patrick. In 2015, Nipsey Hussle was featured in The Sexy Getting Ready Song in the pilot episode of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, <b>rapping</b> two <b>bars</b> before abruptly stopping and commenting on the protagonist's grooming routine.|$|R

He also maintained the diss was [...] "...nothin’ personal. I ain’t never really reached out to Dre, or Dre ain’t never really reached out to me, so it ain’t a shot against him, it’s just, my focus is on what I’m doing now." ...|$|R
50|$|This is {{the first}} Height With Friends project largely created with live instruments. The {{majority}} of the album's songs stray from the beats and rhymes format, employing chord structures and production styles from other forms of music. The rhyme schemes themselves sometimes resemble folk or pop verses, {{more than they do}} standard sixteen <b>bar</b> <b>rap</b> verses.|$|R

The beat of the song has a soft, smooth reggae feel, the chorus is sung R&B style, and the verses are 16 <b>bar</b> <b>raps</b> like American style hip-hop.|$|R

5000|$|It {{had been}} many years since modern {{machinery}} had replaced section crews, so Holtzberg spoke with older or retired roadmasters who might remember the callers, or {{know where they}} might be living. She managed to locate a number of callers and interviewed them in their homes. However, the men {{found it difficult to}} call track in their living room as opposed to being out on the track with the sound of <b>rapping</b> lining <b>bars</b> to call against. They met at a nearby railroad club that was rebuilding a depot museum. In this familiar environment the men quickly began to remember the old calls, and especially so when a train passed by blowing its whistle.

40|$|The rap {{mutation}} in Escherichia coli prevents {{the growth of}} bacteriophage lambda. Phage mutations that overcome <b>rap</b> inhibition (<b>bar)</b> have been mapped to loci in the pL operon. We cloned and sequenced three mutations in two of these loci: barIa to the left arm of the lambda attachment site (attP) and barII in the ssb (ea 10) gene. The mutations represent single base-pair changes within nearly identical 16 -base-pair DNA segments. Each mutation disrupts a sequence of dyad symmetry within the segment. Plasmids carrying a bar+ sequence downstream to an active promoter are lethal to rap, but not rap+, bacteria. The bar sequences isolated from the lambda bar mutants are not lethal. We synthesized a minimal lambda barIa+ sequence, 5 '-TATATTGATATTTATATCATT, and cloned it downstream to an inducible promoter. When transcribed, this sequence is sufficient to kill a rap strain...|$|R
5000|$|Rap Reviews' Matt Jost {{scored the}} album as a 7.5 {{out of ten}} and noted [...] "On the face of it, Riches, Royalty, Respect {{delivers}} the goods. 'In Too Deep' conjures up the familiar {{portrait of the artist}} as a cold-blooded, cocaine-slinging hustler entrapped by the trap. Producer DJ Supa Dave sets the scenery to music by digging deep into symphonic soul. Yet like virtually all comebacks from rap's elder statesmen, Riches, Royalty, Respect reveals certain shortcomings {{that may or may not}} have been present before but become apparent as rap history advances. Advocates of the arform will argue that Kool G Rap and most of today's successful rap acts are worlds apart artistically. They are absolutely right, but for a Kool G <b>Rap</b> the <b>bar</b> is placed higher than chart positions and numbers of social media followers".|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Vanilla Ice had a {{worldwide}} smash hit with Ice Ice Baby {{and it was}} just as popular in London as anywhere else. Young Enygma had never ever heard music that was so heavily reliant on lyrics like that before and a young African living in London had a most unlikely introduction to the artform that is rapping. Enygma memorised all the lyrics and did the same for MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This and Will Smith's theme song to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. in 1991, 11-year-old rapping duo Kris Kross emerged on the scene and because these boys looked like him (particularly the late Mac Daddy), Enygma felt encouraged that the craft was not inaccessible to little boys such as himself. Over the next decade, he collected music by 2pac, Notorious BIG, Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem, Xzibit, DMX, Busta Rhymes, Naughty By Nature, Warren G, Will Smith, Lil Kim, Missy Elliot and Rakim. In 1997, Mase released 24 Hours To Live featuring the Lox, Black Rob and DMX {{in one of the most}} explosive posse cuts at that time. This inspired Enygma, after years of writing poems, to pen his first <b>rap</b> <b>bars.</b> In 2001 during his Senior 6 vacation in London, he wrote an album intending to record with his producer and cousin, Vince Vaider. But as fate would have it, Vaider's computer malfunctioned and was unable to provide the instrumentals as planned. Ironically, Enygma's laptop also crashed, causing him to lose all the lyrics he had written for his album. This led Enygma to abandon rapping as he was beginning University life and aside from performing at one campus show a year, did not have time to pursue it as a craft. He did however meet GNL Zamba, Wordstorm, Navio, The Mith and Langman during his University days. Relationships that would later prove instrumental to his career, although he did not this at the time.|$|R
50|$|The song's first verse {{tells of}} G Rap and his sidekick Bill Blass {{being sent to}} {{retrieve}} money from a cocaine-addicted bartender named Jimmy who is in debt to the mob. He is unable to pay the money, however, and they are instructed to kill him instead. Blass distracts him while G <b>Rap</b> enters the <b>bar</b> through the back entrance, and kills Jimmy by shooting {{him in the back}} of the head and stabbing him with a knife. He describes committing various robberies in verse two and, in verse three, tells of how his mob boss betrayed him and attempted to have him and Blass killed. They take revenge by throwing him from a skyscraper.|$|R
60|$|At length, I {{felt the}} keel come {{down upon the}} sands; and then I knew {{we were on the}} bar. This {{happened}} amid a whirlwind of spray; with nothing visible but the white foam of the waters, and the breakers around us. The first blow threw both masts out of the steps; ripping up the decks to a considerable extent. The next minute we were on our beam-ends; the sea making a clear breach over us. All we could do, was to hold on; and this we did with difficulty. I and the two blacks got on the weather-quarter of the schooner, where we lashed ourselves with the main-sheet. As this was a stout rope, something must part, before we could be washed away. The craft made but two <b>raps</b> on the <b>bar,</b> when she drifted clear.|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli rap mutant {{inhibits}} vegetative {{growth of}} bacteriophage lambda. Phage mutations termed bar, which overcome the rap defect, have been mapped to three genetic loci in the pL operon. Plasmids with a lambda wild-type bar DNA segment cloned downstream from an active promoter cannot be maintained in rap mutant bacteria. The viability of a rap mutant strain decreases rapidly after induction of transcription through bar regions present on plasmids. Under these (restrictive) conditions {{the expression of}} plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase and plasmid DNA replication are arrested, but plasmid RNA synthesis continues for several hours. Analysis of protein extracts from E. coli <b>rap</b> cells containing <b>bar</b> plasmids revealed that both plasmid and bacterial protein synthesis are inhibited under restrictive conditions. In addition, unlike other RNAs tested, the chemical half-life of bar RNA increases 3. 5 -fold relative to the half-life of bar RNA under permissive conditions. We propose that transcription through the bar region, or the accumulation of bar RNA, results in an irreversible defect in cellular mRNA translation. This defect eventually kills the rap cells, and thus prevents bar plasmid maintenance. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|PaRappa the Rapper is {{a rhythm}} {{game in which}} the main character, Parappa, must make his way through each of the game's six stages by rapping. As the teacher <b>raps,</b> a <b>bar</b> {{at the top of}} the screen will appear, showing symbols that match up to the teacher's lyrics. The player must then make Parappa rap in {{response}} to the teacher by pressing the buttons with the correct timing to match the teacher's line.During gameplay, a [...] "U Rappin'" [...] meter determines the player's performance, ranking it as either Awful, Bad, Good or Cool. By consistently staying on beat, players will stay in the Good ranking area. If the player performs a bad line, a lower ranking will flash, and if the player performs badly twice in a row, he will drop to Bad, followed by Awful. To regain a higher ranking, the player must play well twice in a row to move up a rank. To clear a stage, the player must have a Good ranking by the end of the song. If the player ends the song on a Bad or Awful ranking, or drops below Awful ranking at any point in the song, they will fail the song and have to start over. After the game has been cleared once, the player can attempt to achieve a Cool ranking. This is achieved by freestyling in a manner different from the predetermined lyric. If the player performs a successfully impressive freestyle when the Cool rank is flashing, they will enter Cool mode. In this mode, the teacher will leave the stage, allowing the player to rap freely and earn some large points. If the freestyling fails to impress twice in a row, the teacher will return and gameplay will resume in the Good ranking. Ending the stage with a Cool rank often results in a special level ending, and clearing all stages on Cool Mode unlocks a bonus mode with characters Katy Kat and Sunny Funny.|$|R
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} is [...] "Survival". It is a [...] "sweetly funky number" [...] which tries to [...] "convey a loosely drawn {{narrative}} of the punishment she endured from the media and her feelings {{leading up to the}} release". It has a lyrical allusion to the singer's 1986 single [...] "Live to Tell", with double-tracked strong vocals and harmonies. In the song, Madonna enhanced the rhythmic sounds more and compressed the bass sounds, in order to cater to the then musical trend. Containing multiple hooks, [...] "Survival"'s lyrics are about dualities like heaven/hell, up/down, angels/saints. [...] "Secret", the second song, begins with just the sound of Madonna's voice singing over a rhythmic, folksy guitar in descending chord sequence, before opening up to a sparse, retro rhythm section. A deep percussion starts around the one minute mark, accompanied by wah-wah ascending string line, supporting the descending guitar. Towards the end, an upper harmonic melody is added to display variance. Madonna's voice remains {{at the center of the}} song's production, as she sings lyrics such as [...] "happiness lies in your own hand". Throughout the song, Madonna also sings the lyrics [...] "My baby's got a secret", however she never discloses what the secret may be. During the next song, [...] "I'd Rather Be Your Lover", Madonna lusts after the unattainable through processes of negotiation: [...] "I could be your sister, I could be your mother, We could be friends, I'd even be your brother". Towards the middle of the song, an eight <b>bar</b> <b>rap</b> break is taken by singer and rapper Meshell Ndegeocello, who raps: [...] "Tell me what you want / Tell me what you need...". Madonna interrupts, with her voice foregrounded and juxtaposed over the short interjections of Ndegeocello's rap part. A trip hop track, the song is musically comparable to the tracks on Portishead's 1994 album, Dummy, and also contains influences of new jack swing. It uses a sample from [...] "It's Your Thing" [...] performed by Lou Donaldson.|$|R
5000|$|... "Braveheart" [...] {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics, who were however divided in opinion on its rap section. Scottish newspaper the Daily Record awarded the song a four (out of five)-star rating and quipped, [...] "Little Mix sound like old ladies compared to this". Idolator's Sam Lansky deemed the track [...] "one {{of the most}} blisteringly cool dance-pop singles in a long while," [...] and lauded it as [...] "weird, dark, pummeling and thoroughly out-of-the-box." [...] Lansky went on to deem [...] "Braveheart" [...] a [...] "ravey radio smash in the making". Maxie Molotov-Smith of Fortitude Magazine honed the song as a [...] "monstrous rave-ruckus" [...] and commended the group's [...] "in-your-face" [...] attitude and [...] "immoveable" [...] confidence on the track. In addition, Molotov-Smith praised the song's [...] "colossal and euphoric instrumental that invites any listener to lose themselves in the hammering bass line." [...] Fuse's Jeff Benjamin deemed the song a [...] "fiery, in-your-face banger". Stephanie Ochona of Renowned for Sound gave the song a {{four and a half}} (out of five)-star rating, and deemed it [...] "a beast of a track". She praised the song's [...] "infectious" [...] beat, [...] "catchy" [...] chorus, and the group's [...] "beautiful voices that fit in perfectly with each other". Furthermore, Ochona complimented the song's mix of singing and rapping, opining that it showcased the girl band's diversity. [...] 4Music described the track as an [...] "urban dance hit perfect forNew Years Eve". Music website Sugarscape.com stated that they were [...] "a little obsessed" [...] with the song and deemed its rap section [...] "ridiculously amazing". In a review of Welcome to the Jungle, Entertainmentwise's Nick Reilly commented: [...] "We're grabbed from the moment that the song opens by the club sound that leads the track. This, paired with a fantastically tenacious chorus and an unexpected diversion into <b>rap</b> sets the <b>bar</b> pretty damn high {{for the rest of the}} album!" [...] Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie described [...] "Braveheart" [...] as [...] "the perfect follow-up" [...] to [...] "Trouble" [...] and [...] "a sexy little number you won't be able stop your body from reacting to". AndPop's Rebecca Mattina commended the track's immediate bassline, [...] "sultry" [...] vocals and McCarthy's [...] "sassy" [...] rap solo, and felt that [...] "Braveheart" [...] was [...] "perfect" [...] for electropop fans who need a [...] "heart-thumping jam". While James Cabooter of the Daily Star dubbed the song a [...] "brilliantly bizarre EDM smash". Gay Times journalist Lee Dalloway said the track was [...] "certainly worthy of a good rinsing on the club circuit", and commended its [...] "well-crafted" [...] pitch and [...] "on the floor" [...] credential.|$|R
40|$|As {{the most}} recent manifestation of youth culture, hip hop culture, {{including}} rap music, has attracted attention from scholars in {{a broad range of}} fields. Most of this work, however, has originated from the English-speaking world, and focuses primarily on cultural aspects. Very little analysis of rap music texts has been performed by scholars of German literature; Severin Peters’ Romantische Lyrik und Rap-Texte als Ausdruck „progressiver Universalpoesie” (F. Schlegel) – Ein Vergleich {{is one of the few}} exceptions. Peters claims that this apparent neglect results from a lack of knowledge in the field. This thesis attempts to fill that gap. The first part of the thesis presents a brief history of the development of German rap music in three major phases: in the first (1983 - 1992), German rappers had to adapt the US style to different local circumstances to achieve the attempted authenticity. In the second phase (1992 - 2000), artists and fans formed a collective identity by exchanging knowledge at “jams,” often staged at local youth centres. This travelling among different local scenes led to the beginnings of a nation-wide German rap scene. In the third phase (2000 to the present), increasing commercialisation has helped hip hop culture and rap music become more widespread. Rather than retaining a simple collective identity, however, individual artists have become more important, and the scene is highly differentiated both regionally and in terms of commercial vs. political orientations. The development of rap music in Germany can be compared to the development from modernist to postmodernist culture: from avant-garde artists who began rapping in German and led the way for a collective youth culture, to the differentiated and more individualistic aspects of art in postmodernity and contemporary rap in Germany. The second part of the thesis presents a methodology for interpreting German rap music, based on Horst Frank’s traditional lyrical analysis. Aspects of German rap that need to be considered in such an analysis are pointed out, using examples from the rap song “Da läuft was schief” (Blumentopf). On the basis of this methodology, three contemporary German rap texts are analyzed in the third part of the thesis. The artists selected vary in style, approach and renown, to offer a representative assortment in the limited framework of the thesis. The analysis of “Rechte Dritter” (Eins Zwo) discusses the use of quotations by both DJ and rapper in order to demonstrate some of the aesthetic possibilities of <b>rap</b> music. “Viele <b>Bars</b> Parkbankblues” (Purkwa) deals with individualistic problems within the context of a pre-determined life. “ 3 Minuten” (Prinz Pi) uses media-images that describe youth and forms them into a critique of both media and contemporary society. All three texts vary in style as well as in content. The thesis concludes by pointing out the possibilities for German scholars to interpret contemporary German rap music. Rap is an art form with more than twenty years of history, and it deals with the problems of contemporary society. Since its texts can also be analysed in the same manner as a poem, the aesthetic qualities of the art form are obvious. This thesis aims to provide methods to analyse rap in order to point out both its importance and its potential for further studies...|$|R
