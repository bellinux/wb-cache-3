Kesslee, whose body had been reconstructed by the cybernetic surgeon Che'tsai (James Hong), reveals that Tank Girl has unknowingly been bugged. Deetee is killed. While the <b>Rippers</b> turn the tide of the battle, Jet Girl kills Sergeant Small (Don Harvey), who had earlier sexually harassed her. Kesslee reveals that Sam is in the pipe, her life {{endangered}} by rising water. Tank Girl uses her tank to kill Kesslee, then pulls Sam out of the pipe. The film ends with an animated sequence showing water starting to flow freely. Tank Girl drives down rapids, pulling Booga behind on water-skis, then takes them over a waterfall, shouting for joy.|$|E

The ten Australian beach culture themed attractions cost approximately A$56million. These included The Green Room, Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, The Rip, The BRO, Temple of Huey, Cave of Waves, Wiggle Bay, and Pipeline Plunge. Since then, four additional water slides: two called Little <b>Rippers,</b> one called The Wedgie and one called the Triple Vortex, have been added.|$|E

5000|$|Night After Night After Night (1970) was a low-budget {{production}} that cast a high court judge (played by Jack May) as a demented copycat <b>Ripper</b> who attacks prostitutes in London's Soho. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s tenuous {{links with the}} <b>Ripper</b> case were introduced into films for commercial reasons; sexploitation horror movies Blade of the <b>Ripper</b> (1970), The <b>Ripper</b> of Notre Dame (1981) and The New York <b>Ripper</b> (1982) have little relation to the <b>Ripper</b> beyond the title. The <b>Ripper</b> of Notre Dame was directed and co-written by Jesús Franco, whose Jack the <b>Ripper</b> (1976) stars Klaus Kinski as a murderous doctor whose mother was a prostitute. What the Swedish Butler Saw (1975), in which Jack the <b>Ripper</b> hides in a photographic studio, {{is little more than}} softcore pornography. Thrillers Jack the Mangler of London (1973), Fear City (1984), Night <b>Ripper</b> (1986) and Jack's Back (1988) received poor reviews, as did the Japanese pink film Assault! Jack the <b>Ripper.</b> Edge of Sanity (1989) is lent [...] "post-Psycho gravitas" [...] by the casting of Anthony Perkins as [...] "Dr Jekyll" [...] and his alter-ego [...] "Jack Hyde", but was still condemned by critics [...] "as a tasteless exercise".

He also served as assistant commander for Logistics/Fleet Support responsible for incorporating test program modifications into production aircraft, ensuring the fleet obtained maximum effectiveness of air assets, and supporting the aircraft throughout their operational life. On May 20, 1972, former VF-11 skipper Feightner delivered introductory remarks at the Red <b>Rippers</b> change of command ceremony commemorating 45 years as the Navy's oldest continuous fighter squadron. After 33 years of service, Feightner retired from active duty on June 30, 1974.|$|E
500|$|In the comics, the <b>Rippers</b> are {{considerably}} more kangaroo-like. However, Talalay wanted real actors rather than stuntmen in suits playing the roles. She asked Hewlett to redesign the <b>Rippers</b> {{to make them}} more human, allowing them to have the actual actors' facial expressions. Requests were sent out to [...] "all the major make-up and effects people", including Stan Winston, whose prior work included the Terminator films, Aliens, and Jurassic Park. Talalay said that while she considered Winston to be the best, she did not expect to hear back from him. When she did, she still did not think that {{she would be able to}} afford his studio on her budget. A meeting was arranged and Winston insisted on being given the project, saying the <b>Rippers</b> would be: [...] "the best characters we've had the opportunity to do." [...] Winston's studio cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget. Eight <b>Rippers</b> featured in the film: half were given principal roles, the others were mainly in the background. Each Ripper had articulated ears and tails which were activated by remote control, and the background <b>Rippers</b> also had mechanical snouts which could be activated either by remote control or by the movement of the actors' mouths. Each Ripper's make-up took about four hours to apply. Three technicians from Winston's studio were required to work on each Ripper's articulations during filming; no puppets or digital effects were used for the <b>Rippers.</b>|$|E

She re-examines all of his old crime scenes and finds hidden clues that lead to him, as well as learning the fact that all of the women he murdered were Assassins. She later finds a message left by the <b>Ripper,</b> which reveals that he never forgave Jacob for failing to protect his mother from being killed by Starrick's men. Evie deduces that the <b>Ripper</b> is waiting for her at Lambeth Asylum, where he was imprisoned before Jacob recruited him into the Brotherhood. Meanwhile, the <b>Ripper</b> returns to the Asylum and murders his former tormentors. Evie arrives shortly after the <b>Ripper</b> and kills him in battle. Afterwards, she finds an imprisoned but still alive Jacob. With the <b>Ripper</b> dead, Abberline agrees to cover up the <b>Ripper's</b> identity as an Assassin in order to protect the Brotherhood.|$|R
500|$|Jack the <b>Ripper</b> {{features}} {{in hundreds of}} works of fiction and works which straddle the boundaries between fact and fiction, including the <b>Ripper</b> letters and a hoax Diary of Jack the <b>Ripper.</b> The <b>Ripper</b> appears in novels, short stories, poems, comic books, games, songs, plays, operas, television programmes, and films. More than 100 non-fiction works deal exclusively with the Jack the <b>Ripper</b> murders, {{making it one of}} the most written-about true-crime subjects. The term [...] "ripperology" [...] was coined by Colin Wilson in the 1970s to describe the study of the case by professionals and amateurs.

500|$|The mysterious <b>Rippers</b> {{slaughter}} {{guards at}} the W compound, then escape. Kesslee uses Tank Girl to lure the <b>Rippers</b> into the open, but they gravely wound him and Tank Girl and Jet Girl escape during the attack. Jet Girl steals a fighter jet from W and Tank Girl steals a tank, which she modifies heavily. The girls learn from the eccentric Sub Girl (Ann Cusack) that Sam is working at a sex club called Liquid Silver. They infiltrate the club, rescue Sam from a pedophile, Rat Face (Iggy Pop), and then humiliate the club's owner, [...] "The Madame" [...] (Ann Magnuson), by making her sing Cole Porter's [...] "Let's Do It" [...] at gunpoint. W troops break up the performance and re-capture Sam. Tank Girl and Jet Girl wander the desert and find the Rippers' hideout. They learn that the <b>Rippers</b> are supersoldiers created from human and kangaroo DNA by a man called Johnny Prophet. Tank Girl befriends a Ripper named Booga (Jeff Kober), while a Ripper named Donner (Scott Coffey) shows romantic interest in Jet Girl. Despite the objections of the Ripper T-Saint (Ice-T), who is suspicious of the girls, the Rippers' leader Deetee (Reg E. Cathey) sends the pair out to capture a shipment of weapons. The girls bring the weapon crates back, though {{most of them are}} empty. After finding Johnny Prophet dead in one of the containers, the girls and the <b>Rippers</b> realize that W has tricked them.|$|E
500|$|Unreal Tournament is {{an arena}} first-person shooter, with {{head-to-head}} multiplayer deathmatches being {{the primary focus}} of the game. The single-player campaign is a series of arena matches played with bots, where the player competes for the title of Grand Champion. The player moves up the tournament ladder in order to challenge the current champion, Xan, a mysterious being with exceptional skill. Also available is a Practice mode, in which, as its name implies, the player practices a match. Match settings (such as score and time limits) can be customized. Also available are [...] "mutators" [...] which drastically alter [...] gameplay aspects, such as [...] "InstaGib", the use of which makes players compete with instant-kill weapons instead of the normal ones. Weapons include Enforcers, Rocket Launchers, and <b>Rippers,</b> which fire ricocheting blades. Most weapons have two firing modes which have different effects: for example, <b>Rippers</b> can also fire non-ricocheting blades which explode on impact. A special weapon is the Redeemer, which causes a very large and powerful explosion.|$|E

500|$|The {{greatest}} all-rounder of his era, Wills {{saw himself}} principally as a bowler. With a repertoire that included [...] "sparklers, <b>rippers,</b> fizzers, trimmers and shooters", he varied his pace and style considerably, and {{was quick to}} work out a batsman's weak points. Noted for his deceptive slow deliveries, dropping mid-flight and big on break, Wills' fast round arm balls sometimes reared head-high from the pitch, terrorising his opponent. English batsman Sir David Serjeant said that Wills was the only bowler he ever feared. He was known to carefully study an umpire before deciding whether to throw. A trickster, he would ask the umpire to watch his feet lest he go over the crease, and then [...] "let go a throw for all he was worth". His most flagrant throws were likened to that of a baseball pitcher.|$|E
500|$|The slide {{tower in}} the {{southeast}} corner of the park contains five slides designed for those who desire a mild thrill. Some of the slides on this tower interact with Dreamworld's Cyclone roller coaster. The Little <b>Rippers</b> are two ProSlide duelling cannon bowl slides. The slides can accommodate guests riding in either one or two person tubes. Riders begin in one of two parallel chutes before entering tunnels and splitting off in opposite directions. Each tunnel has a steep drop into the bowl element of the ride, after which the raft drops down through the centre and into a run-out chute. The other three slides on this tower are collectively known as The Temple of Huey. Guests can ride in a single or double tube. All three slides are ProSlide Pipelines.

The invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as the Axeman of New Orleans, the Boston Strangler, and the Beltway Sniper. Examples derived from Jack the <b>Ripper</b> include the French <b>Ripper,</b> the Düsseldorf <b>Ripper,</b> the Camden <b>Ripper,</b> the Blackout <b>Ripper,</b> Jack the Stripper, the Yorkshire <b>Ripper,</b> and the Rostov <b>Ripper.</b> Sensational press reports combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders have confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts a shadow over later serial killers.|$|R
