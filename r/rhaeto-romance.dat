Although remaining Austrian possession until 1920 (as a part of kronland Tyrol), aside from being home for an ethnic German-speaking minority, Ampezzo never became a German-speaking territory and conserved its original language, Ladin, a <b>Rhaeto-Romance</b> language.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the centuries}} of Roman rule, the Raeti became {{predominantly}} Latin-speakers. It {{has been suggested}} that a surviving relic of the Raeti's Latin speech is the Romansh language, one of the so-called [...] "Rhaeto-Romance languages". Romansch survives today in a few valleys of Swiss canton Grisons (most of which is today German-speaking). However, a Raetian origin for Romansch is uncertain, as <b>Rhaeto-Romance</b> languages appear most closely related to the Gallo-Romance group, strengthening the argument that the Raeti had adopted Celtic speech before Latinisation.|$|E
2500|$|... (also spelled Romansch, Rumantsch, or Romanche; Romansh: , rumàntsch, [...] or [...] ) is a Romance {{language}} spoken predominantly {{in the southeastern}} Swiss canton of Grisons (Graubünden), where it has official status alongside German and Italian. It is used as the medium of instruction in schools in Romansh-speaking areas. Romansh has also been recognized as a national language of Switzerland since 1938, and as an official language since 1996, along with German, French and Italian. It is sometimes grouped by linguists with Ladin and Friulian as a <b>Rhaeto-Romance</b> language, though this is disputed.|$|E
2500|$|Occitan is {{fundamentally}} defined by its dialects, {{rather than being}} a unitary language. That point is very conflictual in Southern France, as many people do not recognize Occitan as a real language and think that the next defined [...] "dialects" [...] are languages. Like other languages that fundamentally exist at a spoken, rather than written, level (e.g. the <b>Rhaeto-Romance</b> languages, Franco-Provençal, Astur-Leonese, and Aragonese), every settlement technically has its own dialect, with the whole of Occitania forming a classic dialect continuum that changes gradually along any path {{from one side to}} the other.

2500|$|Menn {{was born}} in Geneva as the {{youngest}} son of four to Not (<b>Rhaeto-Romance</b> language form for Louis) Menn, a confectioner from Scuol in the canton of Grisons, and Charlotte-Madeleine-Marguerite Bodmer, {{the daughter of a}} wealthy farmer from Coinsins in the Canton de Vaud. Already at the age of twelve, Menn took drawing lessons from the little-known Jean Duboi (1789–1849), and later, he entered the drawing school of the Geneva Arts Society. The repeated claim that he was also a pupil of the famous enameller Abraham Constantin (1785–1855) appears to be erroneous. In 1831, Menn was second in the annual drawing competition of the Geneva Art Society. The following year, he entered the studio of the Swiss history painter Jean-Léonard Lugardon (1801–1884), who was a pupil of Baron Gros(1771–1835) and acquainted with Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780–1867). There, Menn was educated in figure drawing and composition before heading for Paris, where, in fall 1833, he entered the studio of Ingres. He was, therefore, no beginner when meeting the master, but needed some polishing and refinement in his art. In a letter to his friend Jules Hébert, Menn reported on the new situation: ‘Everybody, even the eldest in the studio tremble before Mr. Ingres. One fears him a lot {{in such a way that}} his corrections have a great impact. He is of an extreme sensibility,’ [...] while the education in Ingres’ studio has been described by Théophile Silvestre, as follows: 'The students spend half of their time studying nature and half studying the masters among which they are especially attached to Phidias, the bas-reliefs of the Parthenon, classical sculpture in general.’ This explains why among Menn's early works there are many copies after the Parthenon frieze that was accessible in Paris in a set of plaster casts at the École des Beaux-Arts since 1816. [...] (Fig. 2). Menn also copied several works by Raffael, Titian [...] (Fig. 3), Veronese and Rubens in the Louvre, and works by Ingres.|$|E
