40|$|We {{report the}} {{production}} of ultracold heteronuclear 7 Li 85 Rb molecules in excited electronic states by photoassociation (PA) of ultracold 7 Li and 85 Rb atoms. PA is performed in a dual-species 7 Li- 85 Rb magneto-optical trap (MOT) and the PA <b>resonances</b> <b>are</b> <b>detected</b> <b>using</b> trap loss spectroscopy. We identify several strong PA resonances below the Li (2 s 2 S 1 / 2) + Rb (5 p 2 P 3 / 2) asymptote and experimentally determine the long range C 6 dispersion coefficients. We find a molecule formation rate (P_LiRb) of 3. 5 x 10 ^ 7 s^- 1 and a PA rate coefficient (K_PA) of 1. 3 x 10 ^- 10 cm^ 3 /s, the highest among heteronuclear bi-alkali molecules. At large PA laser intensity, we observe the saturation of the PA rate coefficient (K_PA) close to the theoretical value at the unitarity limit. Comment: 7 page...|$|E

40|$|This work {{provides}} a detailed {{investigation of the}} measured in-plane field-swept homodyne-detected ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra of an extended Co/Cu/NiFe pseudo spin valve stack using a nanocontact (NC) geometry. The magnetodynamics are generated by a pulse-modulated microwave current and the resulting rectified dc mixing voltage, which appears across the NC at <b>resonance,</b> <b>is</b> <b>detected</b> <b>using</b> a lock-in amplifier. Most notably, {{we find that the}} measured spectra of the NiFe layer are composite in nature and highly asymmetric, consistent with the broadband excitation of multiple modes. Additionally, the data must be fit with two Lorentzian functions in order to extract a reasonable value for the Gilbert damping of the NiFe. Aided by micromagnetic simulations, we conclude that (i) for in-plane fields the rf Oersted field {{in the vicinity of the}} NC plays the dominant role in generating the observed spectra, (ii) in addition to the FMR mode, exchange dominated spin waves are also generated, and (iii) the NC diameter sets the mean wavevector of the exchange dominated spin wave, in good agreement with the dispersion relation.

40|$|Manipulation and readout of spin qubits {{in quantum}} dots made in III-V {{materials}} successfully rely on Pauli blockade that forbids transitions between spin-triplet and spin-singlet states. Quantum dots in group IV materials {{have the advantage}} of avoiding decoherence from the hyperfine interaction by purifying them with only zero-spin nuclei. Complications of group IV materials arise from the valley degeneracies in the electronic bandstructure. These lead to complicated multiplet states even for two-electron quantum dots thereby significantly weakening the selection rules for Pauli blockade. Only recently have spin qubits been realized in silicon devices where the valley degeneracy is lifted by strain and spatial confinement. In carbon nanotubes Pauli blockade can be observed by lifting valley degeneracy through disorder. In clean nanotubes, quantum dots have to be made ultra-small to obtain a large energy difference between the relevant multiplet states. Here we report on low-disorder nanotubes and demonstrate Pauli blockade based on both valley and spin selection rules. We exploit the bandgap of the nanotube to obtain a large level spacing and thereby a robust blockade. Single-electron spin <b>resonance</b> <b>is</b> <b>detected</b> <b>using</b> the blockade.

40|$|The {{manipulation}} and readout of spin qubits in quantum dots {{have been successfully}} achieved using Pauli blockade, which forbids transitions between spin-triplet and spin-singlet states. Compared with spin qubits realized in III-V materials, group IV materials such as silicon and carbon are attractive for this application because of their low decoherence rates (nuclei with zero spins). However, valley degeneracies in the electronic band structure of these materials combined with Coulomb interactions reduce the energy difference between the blocked and unblocked states, significantly weakening the selection rules for Pauli blockade. Recent demonstrations of spin qubits in silicon devices have required strain and spatial confinement to lift the valley degeneracy. In carbon nanotubes, Pauli blockade can be observed by lifting valley degeneracy through disorder, but this makes the confinement potential difficult to control. To achieve Pauli blockade in low-disorder nanotubes, quantum dots {{have to be made}} ultrasmall, which is incompatible with conventional fabrication methods. Here, we exploit the bandgap of low-disorder nanotubes to demonstrate robust Pauli blockade based on both valley and spin selection rules. We use a novel stamping technique to create a bent nanotube, in which single-electron spin <b>resonance</b> <b>is</b> <b>detected</b> <b>using</b> the blockade.

40|$|We show TDESR {{to measure}} the high {{frequency}} electron spin resonance spectra of the molecular nanomagnet Fe 3 CrSMe. We demonstrate {{the use of a}} mechanically-detected EPR setup with optical excitations and tunable frequency sources to induce magnetic <b>resonance</b> transitions which <b>are</b> <b>detected</b> <b>using</b> cantilever torque magnetometry. Furthermore we show how we combined TDESR with Photon excited Torque Magnetometry (PheToM) to excite and detect a spin forbidden transition (S= 6 to S= 7) in Fe 3 CrSMe. The results are compared to simulations and AC-SQUID results. The use of spin-forbidden transitions is particularly tempting, as it allows connecting otherwise separated Hilbert spaces. This enables to operate qubits in an excited state, without disrupting their ground state coherences. Such spin-forbidden manipulation scheme had been proposed nearly thirty years ago by the pioneer of molecular magnetism O. Kahn, but has remained unobserved due to the considerable experimental diffculties involved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{demonstrate}} the J-coupling connectivity network between the amide, aliphatic, and aromatic proton resonances of metabolites in human brain using two-dimensional (2 D) localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY). Two different global water suppression techniques were combined with L-COSY, one before and another after localizing the volume of interest (VOI). Phantom solutions containing several cerebral metabolites at physiological concentrations were evaluated initially for sequence optimization. Nine healthy volunteers were scanned using a 3 T whole body MRI scanner. The VOI for 2 D L-COSY was placed in the right occipital white/gray matter region. The 2 D cross and diagonal peak volumes were measured for several metabolites such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), free choline (Ch), glutamate/glutamine (Glx), aspartate (Asp), myo-inositol (mI), GABA, glutathione (GSH), phosphocholine (PCh), phosphoethanolamine (PE), tyrosine (Tyr), lactate (Lac), macromolecules (MM) and homocarnosine (Car). Using the pre-water suppression technique with L-COSY, the above mentioned metabolites were clearly identifiable and the relative ratios of metabolites were calculated. In addition to detecting multitude of aliphatic resonances in the high field region, we have demonstrated that the amide and aromatic <b>resonances</b> can also <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> <b>using</b> 2 D L-COSY by pre water suppression more reliably than the post-water suppression...|$|R

In validation experiments, the composition of a known mixture of triolein, tristearin, and trilinolein agreed well with measurements by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Triglycerides in calf subcutaneous tissue and tibial bone marrow were examined in 20 healthy subjects by 1 H spectroscopy. Ten well-resolved proton <b>resonances</b> from triglycerides <b>were</b> <b>detected</b> <b>using</b> stimulated echo acquisition mode sequence and small voxel (∼ 0. 1 ml), and T 1 and T 2 were measured. Triglyceride composition was not different between calf subcutaneous adipose tissue and tibial marrow for a given subject, and its variation among subjects, {{as a result of}} diet and genetic differences, fell in a narrow range. After correction for differential relaxation effects, the marrow fat composition was 29. 1 ± 3. 5 % saturated, 46. 4 ± 4. 8 % monounsaturated, and 24. 5 ± 3. 1 % diunsaturated, compared with adipose fat composition, 27. 1 ± 4. 2 % saturated, 49. 6 ± 5. 7 % monounsaturated, and 23. 4 ± 3. 9 % diunsaturated. Proton spectroscopy at 7 T offers a simple, fast, noninvasive, and painless method for obtaining detailed information about lipid composition in humans, and the sensitivity and resolution of the method may facilitate longitudinal monitoring of changes in lipid composition in response to diet, exercise, and disease...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur results {{demonstrate}} high-frequency electrical resonances {{in outer}} hair cells (OHCs) exhibiting features analogous to classical piezoelectric transducers. The fundamental (first) resonance frequency averaged fn∼ 13 kHz (Q∼ 1. 7). Higher-order <b>resonances</b> <b>were</b> also observed. To obtain these results, OHCs were positioned in a custom microchamber {{and subjected to}} stimulating electric fields along the axis of the cell (1 – 100 kHz, 4 – 16 mV/ 80 μm). Electrodes embedded in the side walls of the microchamber were used in a voltage-divider configuration to estimate the electrical admittance of the top portion of the cell-loaded chamber (containing the electromotile lateral wall) relative to the lower portion (containing the basal plasma membrane). This ratio exhibited resonance-like electrical tuning. <b>Resonance</b> <b>was</b> also <b>detected</b> independently <b>using</b> a secondary 1 -MHz radio-frequency interrogation signal applied transversely across the cell diameter. The radio-frequency interrogation revealed changes in the transverse electric impedance modulated by the axial stimulus. Modulation of the transverse electric impedance was particularly pronounced near the resonant frequencies. OHCs used in our study were isolated from the apical region of the guinea pig cochlea, a region that responds exclusively to low-frequency acoustic stimuli. In this sense, electrical resonances we observed in vitro were at least {{an order of magnitude}} higher (ultrasonic) than the best physiological frequency of the same OHCs under acoustic stimuli in vivo. These resonance data further support the piezoelectric theory of OHC function, and implicate piezoelectricity in the broad-band electromechanical behavior of OHCs underlying mammalian cochlear function...|$|R

40|$|The {{conformation}} of the head-to-tail cyclic analogue of bradykinin in DMSO {{was investigated}} by nmr.
