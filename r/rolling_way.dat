Her only ballast consisted of some six hundred conical shot, or twelve tons for a ship of eight hundred.

40|$|The {{addition}} of microalloying {{elements such as}} Ti and Nb to increase the strength of deep drawing quality steels for automotive sheet products might affect the microstructure formed during the annealing after warm <b>rolling</b> in several <b>ways.</b> Firstly, the precipitates can exert a Zener's pinning on growing recrystallized grain, {{which leads to a}} sluggish recrystallization kinetics. Secondly, the amount of microalloying elements control the amount of C, N, S, and P in solid solution, which indirectly affects the recrystallization texture obtained after annealing. In this sense, the work carried out with three different interstitial free (IF) and interstitial free high-strength (IFHS) steel grades allows us to conclude that the increase of microalloying additions delays recrystallization kinetics. Moreover, the abrupt texture change observed between as-rolled and annealed material indicates that the nucleation mechanism for recrystallization is more related to classical nucleation at deformed grain boundaries than subgrain rotation (continuous nucleation). © 2010 The Japan Institute of Metals.

40|$|Addressing {{the dearth}} of studies on rolling budgets, we {{investigate}} how the importance of rolling budgets for various planning, control and evaluation reasons relate to a business unit's strategy and uncertainty, and report on the variation in these responses when partitioned into quarterly and monthly rolling budget types. We use a survey instrument with responses from 182 rolling budget firms in our investigation. Our findings reveal consistencies as well as deviations between our sub-samples (quarterly and monthly rolling budgets), and the total rolling budget sample. We report that the <b>way</b> <b>rolling</b> budgets relate to uncertainty and strategy in organisations are substantively different for monthly and quarterly rolling budget types, and vary across planning, control and evaluation budget reasons. Our findings show a greater sensitivity between monthly rolling budgets and uncertainty/strategy, and virtually nil relations between quarterly rolling budgets and uncertainty/strategy. We posit that monthly rolling budgets are used in a manner more traditionally associated to rolling budgets in prior studies, while quarterly rolling budgets might be used relatively more symbolically or in response to external pressures such as earnings forecast requirements, and are less sensitive to establish organisational antecedents such as uncertainty/strategy...|$|R

40|$|Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) {{systems have}} gained {{popularity}} worldwide {{as a cost}} effective alternative to far more expensive urban rail investments. High quality bus based systems also better serve the low density settlement patterns of many suburban markets and small to medium size cities due to the inherent flexibility advantages of rubber tire systems – the same vehicle that provides speedy line haul services on a dedicated bus lane or busway can morph into a feeder vehicle, collecting and distributing customers on local streets. This report reviews experiences with designing and implementing BRT systems worldwide. BRT is first defined across a spectrum of service qualitiesand costs. Global trends are next reviewed, highlighting cities and {{regions of the world}} with the most extensive and advanced systems. Relationships between urban densities and BRT cost effectiveness are noted. System designs and operations – in terms of running <b>ways,</b> <b>rolling</b> stock, route configurations, stations, fare collections, and the like – are then reviewed. This is followed by a comparison of BRT’s cost and performance relative to urban rail transit systems. Information on the cost effectiveness of heavyrail, light rail, and BRT systems relative to urban densities are also compared. The report then turns to efforts among a handful to cities to proactively promote transit oriented development (TOD) near BRT stations and along corridors. This is followed by discussions on the institutional arrangements that have been introduced to effectively manage BRT services. The report closes with discussions on BRT’s likely future given global growth projections and other pressing policy agendas in the foreseeable future...|$|R
