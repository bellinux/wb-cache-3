50|$|The HF Adcock {{stations}} {{consisted of}} four 10m vertical antennas surrounding {{a small wooden}} operators hut containing a receiver and a radio-goniometer which was adjusted to obtain the bearing. MF stations were also used which used four guyed 30m lattice tower antennas. In 1941 RSS began experimenting with Spaced <b>Loop</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finders,</b> developed by the Marconi company and the UK National Physical Laboratories. These consisted of two parallel loops 1 to 2m square {{on the ends of}} a rotatable 3 to 8m beam. The angle of the beam was combined with results from a radiogoniometer to provide a bearing. The bearing obtained was considerably sharper than that obtained with the U Adcock system, but there were ambiguities which prevented the installation of 7 proposed S.L DF systems. The operator of an SL system was in a metal underground tank below the antennas. Seven underground tanks were installed, but only two SL systems were installed at Wymondham, Norfolk and Weaverthorp in Yorkshire. Problems were encountered resulting in the remaining five underground tanks being fitted with Adcock systems. The rotating SL antenna was turned by hand which meant successive measurements were a lot slower than turning the dial of a goniometer.|$|R
25|$|A Bellini–Tosi <b>{{direction}}</b> <b>finder</b> (B–T or BTDF) {{is a type}} {{of radio}} <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (RDF), which determines the direction to, or bearing of, a radio transmitter. Earlier RDF systems used very large <b>rotating</b> <b>loop</b> antennae, which the B–T system replaced with two fixed antennae and a small <b>rotating</b> <b>loop,</b> known as a radiogoniometer. This made RDF much more practical, especially on large vehicles like ships or when using very long wavelengths that demand large antennae.|$|R
25|$|B–T, and <b>rotating</b> <b>loops</b> {{of various}} sorts, {{continued}} {{to be used in}} the post-war era by civilians. Improvements {{continued to be}} made to both systems throughout this period, especially the introduction of solenoids in place of conventional loops in some roles. However, the introduction of the doppler <b>direction</b> <b>finder,</b> and especially the low-cost electronics to implement it, led to the disappearance of the traditional loop systems by the mid-1990s. Doppler systems use fixed antennae, like BTDF, but handle the direction finding purely in signal processing.|$|R
25|$|The {{replacement}} of ground-based BTDF {{systems in the}} aviation role was due primarily to two factors. One was the move to ever-shorter wavelengths, which so shortened the required antennae that RDF could be carried out on a small aircraft receiver a few centimetres in length. <b>Rotating</b> <b>loops</b> were practical at these frequencies, and most aircraft used one. The second advance was {{the introduction of the}} automatic <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF), which completely automated the RDF procedure. Once an ADF system was tuned to a station, either an airway beacon or an AM radio station, they continually moved a pointer to indicate the relative bearing with no further operator involvement.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of microwave <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> which operate under a variety of conditions and signal environments, but they can be divided into two major classes: (a) scanning, and (b) non-scanning. This paper discusses non-scanning multichannel amplitude-comparison systems, and in particular, systems using wide band antennas with crystal-video receivers to indicate the bearing of pulsed signals instantaneously. The accuracy of this type of <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> can be improved by increasing the number of channels. The characteristics of <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> in which there are more channels in the radio-frequency portion of the system than in the video portion were studied with an analogue of a <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The results of the analogue studies were applied in the development of an improved microwave antenna system for a tactical <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The construction and performance of this antenna system are discussed.
