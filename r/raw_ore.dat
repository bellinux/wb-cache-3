5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} <b>raw</b> <b>ore</b> and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then {{added in a}} liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This {{became known as the}} Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the <b>raw</b> <b>ore</b> can be smelted to produce their {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones {{are used to}} make pig iron bars and smelt it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|E

However, non-environmental motives have also been imputed to China's rare-earth policy. According to The Economist, [...] "Slashing their exports of rare-earth metals… is all about moving Chinese manufacturers up the supply chain, so they can sell valuable finished goods to the world rather than lowly raw materials." [...] Furthermore, China currently has an effective monopoly on the world's REE Value Chain.

40|$|Abstract. Rapid {{reduction}} roasting of {{low grade}} manganese carbonate ore by coal and biomass fuels from Hunan, China was investigated. Magnetic separation behaviors and magnetic properties of <b>raw</b> manganese <b>ore</b> and roasted manganese ores were analyzed. After reduction by coal and biomass fuels, the manganese ores demonstrate a new Mn-Fe oxide phase, showing obvious mixed magnetic behaviors of ferromagnet and paramagnet, and the magnetic susceptibilities of roasting ores rapidly increase to almost two {{orders of magnitude}} in comparison of the <b>raw</b> <b>ores.</b> The results show that magnetizing roasting technology could enhanced the magnetic properties of the manganese ores about two orders of magnitude higher than <b>raw</b> manganese <b>ore</b> at low roasting temperature. Thereby, we deduce that the weak magnetic separation combined with high magnetic separation could be adequate for roasted manganese ore to satisfy the requirement of electrolytic manganese industry. Application of biomass in manganese ore roasting process is promising to the effective use of biomass and for decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels in the manganese industry...|$|R
40|$|Flotation {{technology}} of the recovery and utilization of ilmenite from tailings of iron beneficiated in Panzhihua was investigated based on mineralogical study. The results of mineralogical study show that the main occurrence of the valuable mineral are liberated grains of ilmenite. Experimental results of flotation conditions show that attrition-scrubbing <b>raw</b> <b>ores</b> exhibit good flotability with higher recoveries and a slight decrease in grade compared to ores without attrition-scrubbing. Further, open-circuit experiments also prove the superiority of attrition-scrubbing <b>raw</b> <b>ores.</b> The results of closed-circuit experiments show that qualified ilmenite concentrate can be obtained and the yield, grade, and recovery are 22. 26 %, 47. 06 %, and 60. 73 %, respectively. Theoretical study and analysis show {{that there are two}} contributions to superior flotability for attrition-scrubbing samples. The first is that the attrition-scrubbing samples can uncover more ferrous ions on the newly-produced fresh ilmenite surface, resulting in the increase in active sites. The other is that in the process of attrition-scrubbing, the transformation of ferrous ions to ferric ions can be promoted...|$|R
