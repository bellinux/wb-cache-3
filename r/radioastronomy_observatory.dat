40|$|We {{provide a}} brief {{biography}} of seven French astronomers and physicists {{and of a}} Russian astronomer from the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Roger Bouigue (1920 -) {{was the director of}} Toulouse Observatory in the 1960 s. Claude-Louis Mathieu (1783 - 1875), a member of Bureau des Longitudes, worked in geodetics and celestial mechanics. Claude Pouillet (1790 - 1868), a physics professor, was the first to measure the solar constant. Yves Rocard (1903 - 1992) conducted research in many fields of physics, and founded the <b>radioastronomy</b> <b>Observatory</b> of Nancay. Jean Rosch (1915 - 1999) was the director of Pic du Midi Observatory for over thirty years, and in this capacity lead it to the forefront of research in high-resolution solar and planetary astronomy. Cyrille Souillart (1828 - 1898) had a lifelong interest in the theory of Jupiter's satellites. Jules Violle (1841 - 1923) was a physics professor who determined the temperature of the solar photosphere. The Russian astronomer Kirill Ogorodnikov (1900 - 1985) wrote a well-known manual on stellar dynamics.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the magnetic fields of stars is nearly monopolized by knowledge of our own sun. Very-long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) provides a means of directly imaging the radio coronae of other stars at a high enough resolution to discern discrete features, something not possible with other observational methods. It also allows the highest positional accuracy of any observational method available. This thesis details the VLBI study of two nearby radio-loud stars in close binary systems. Both systems were observed at numerous epochs spaced over a range of several months with the global-scale radio interferometer array the VLBA-HSA. These observations were combined with archival data from the National <b>Radioastronomy</b> <b>Observatory</b> (NRAO) Archive. The resulting positions, as well as previously published positions, were used to calculate a least-squares solution for all the orbital and astrometric parameters of both systems. This {{made it possible to}} determine the position of the physical star with respect to the radio emission in each image. The images of both stars were found to conform to theoretical emission produced by a model dipolar magnetosphere with a filled or partially-filled coronal loop...|$|E

40|$|The {{european}} {{radio telescope}} LOFAR {{is in its}} commissioning phase. It is a huge interferometer operating at low frequencies (30 to 240 MHz), composed of ~ 50 phased arrays (or stations) which are themselves gathering 864 to 1632 antennas. ~ 40 stations {{are located in the}} Netherlands along with the central correlator, and the other stations are spread over surrounding countries. In France, one of these arrays (1632 elements and their 96 associated receptors) has been built at the Nançay <b>radioastronomy</b> <b>observatory.</b> LOFAR will operate as an interferometer (for spectro-imagery) and as a global coherent phased array (for dynamic spectrometry). Its planetary objectives, that will be addressed by the Planets Working Group of LOFAR’s ”Transients” Key Science Project, include the fast imaging of the Jovian magnetosphere through its auroral radio emissions, and the detection and study of lightning on every planet of our solar system. Jupiter is the most intense low-frequency point source in the sky (> 106 Jy), allowing extensive commissioning tests, which will be briefly described (including early interferometric observations between Nan¸cay and the Netherlands). In the case of Saturn’s lightning, the large instantaneous bandwidth (up to 48 MHz) and the high time resolution of LOFAR (down to 5 µs per spectrum) allow us to measure the discharge spectrum and energy(see Grießmeier et al., this issue, 145 - 154). Moreover, one of the major objectives of LOFAR is the detection and study of exoplanetary radio emissions, which will be an unique source of information about the magnetic field, rotation and inclination of these objects, and about planet-star plasma interactions in general. In our solar system, each planetary magnetosphere has common as well as singular characteristics, which make it differ from the others. Radio detection of exoplanetary magnetospheres with allow us to explore parameter space of magnetospheric physics and enhance comparative studies (see Zarka, this issue, 287 - 301) ...|$|E
