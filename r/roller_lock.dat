50|$|In 1944, the {{material}} shortages of the Third Reich {{led to the}} development of a newer version, the MG 45 (or MG 42V), which had a different operation mechanism that used delayed blowback as opposed to <b>roller</b> <b>locking.</b> For this reason, the MG 45 is considered a different type of firearm, as the mechanisms of these two guns are different. It used steel of lesser quality, which reduced weight to 9 kg, while retaining the horizontal cocking handle.

50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a <b>roller</b> <b>locked</b> bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the <b>rollers</b> outward, <b>locking</b> the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} address these issues, a contest was held for a true MG 34 replacement. Three {{companies}} were asked to submit designs: Metall und Lackierwarenfabrik Johannes Großfuß AG of Döbeln, Rheinmetall-Borsig of Sömmerda, and Stübgen of Erfurt. Of the number of proposals submitted, Großfuß AG's {{proved to be the}} best design by far, employing a unique recoil-operated <b>roller</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism whereas the two competing designs used a gas-actuated system. Interestingly, the company had no earlier experience in weapons manufacture, specializing in pressed and stamped steel components (the company's staple product was sheet metal lanterns). Dr.-Ing. Werner Gruner, one of the leading design engineers with Großfuß, knew nothing about machine guns when he was given the task of being involved with the project, although he specialized in the technology of mass production. Gruner would attend an army machine gunner's course to familiarize himself with the utility and characteristics of such a weapon, also seeking input from soldiers. He then recycled an existing Mauser-developed operating system and incorporated features from his experiences with army machine gunners and lessons learned during {{the early stages of the}} war. Being made largely out of stamped metal, the new design required considerably less machining and was much simpler to build than other machine guns—it took 75 man hours to complete the new gun as opposed to 150 man hours for the MG 34 (a 50% reduction), and cost 250 RM as opposed to 327 RM (a 24% reduction).|$|R

50|$|Commonly {{pin tumbler}} locks {{are found in}} a {{cylinder}} {{that can be easily}} unscrewed by a locksmith to facilitate rekeying. The first main advantage to a cylinder lock, also known as a profile cylinder lock or euro, is that the cylinder can be changed without altering the boltwork hardware. Removing the cylinder typically requires only loosening a set screw, then sliding the cylinder from the boltwork. The second is that it is usually possible to obtain, from various lock manufacturers, cylinders in different formats that can all be used with the same type of key. This allows the user to have keyed-alike, and master-keyed systems that incorporate a wide variety of different types of lock, such as nightlatches, deadbolts and <b>roller</b> door <b>locks.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Servicing Missions have {{demonstrated}} that extravehicular activity (EVA) power tools need a hand (non-powered) ratcheting capability to accomplish delicate and unforeseen tasks. Depending on the pitch, or spacing of the teeth on a conventional ratcheting hand socket wrench, sometimes more then 1 / 8 th of a turn in the backward direction can be required to engage the next tooth. This minimum motion requirement of the ratcheting device causes the wrench to work inefficiently in confined spaces. Furthermore, the bulkiness of an astronaut’s space suit and gloves causes additional range-of-motion problems when ratcheting wrench tools are used for EVA tasks. Therefore, removing the ratchet from the design can increase the usability of future EVA tools. No successful ratchet-less wrench has been developed to date. However, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has developed and patented a special three dimensional (3 -D) <b>roller</b> <b>locking</b> Sprag technology that, when used {{in place of the}} traditional ratcheting mechanism, results in a device with infinite indexibility and infinitely small range-of-motion. This unique geometry permits construction of compact locking mechanisms that can withstand large loads because the Sprags are very small but have large contact radii and therefore, low contact stress. During the summer of 1997, GSFC developed and tested the use of this 3 -D sprag technology in commercial hand “ratcheting ” tools to create a commercial “ratchetless ” Sprag wrench. The Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) at the University of Maryland is extending this commercial Sprag wrench development to EVA tools. In order for the Sprag mechanism to become an EVA tool it must first be tested in a weightless environment to evaluate performance when used for certain tasks.

50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, {{air-cooled}} belt-fed weapon {{operated by}} roller-delayed blowback and fires {{from an open}} bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the short recoil method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two <b>locking</b> <b>rollers,</b> a striker sleeve and the bolt carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and carrier assembly forward; simultaneously both rollers engage camming surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt carrier and striker assembly recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming surfaces drives the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing {{the speed at which}} the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt).|$|R
50|$|The delay {{results from}} {{the amount of time}} it takes for enough recoil energy to be {{transferred}} through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber {{for a short period of}} time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4 mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the <b>locking</b> <b>rollers</b> are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.|$|R
50|$|The G3A3 (A4) is a selective-fire {{automatic}} weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. The two-piece bolt assembly {{consists of a}} breech (bolt head) and bolt carrier. The bolt is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical <b>rollers</b> that engage <b>locking</b> recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon the bolt head. As the rollers move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and bolt carrier which begin to withdraw while the bolt head slowly moves rearward {{in relation to the}} bolt carrier. As the bolt carrier clears the rollers, pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, the bolt head is caught by the bolt carrier and moves to the rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle. The bolt also features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt).|$|R
50|$|In around 1942 the Swiss army {{initiated}} a competition {{for a new}} service machine gun to replace both the “heavy” MG 11 and the “light” Lmg25, adopted in 1911 and 1925 respectively. Three participants joined the competition-government-owned Waffenfabrik Bern, and privately owned factories SIG and Hispano-Suiza. Waffenfabrik Bern based its development on the hugely successful German MG 42. The first prototypes emerged in around 1944, and looked much like MG42, although the shape of receiver and butt was somewhat different. The final design, which appeared in 1950, was in most respects similar to the MG 42, although many parts were produced by machining instead of stamping, and the locking system was changed from <b>roller</b> to flap <b>locking.</b> The resulting weapon was heavier than the German original, and much more finely made and finished. In certain respects it was a “Rolex” of machine guns. Until very recently MG 51 served as a primary infantry and vehicle machine gun for Swiss army, although it is now being gradually replaced in service with lighter and less expensive, but also less powerful 5.56mm FN Minimi machine gun of Belgian origin and manufacture. The MG 51 is a short-recoil-operated, locked breech, air-cooled and automatic only, belt-fed weapon. It uses a modified MG 42 type locking system with a two-piece bolt and dual locking flaps located in the front part of the bolt. These flaps engage the cuts made in the short barrel extension to provide rigid locking. Upon recoil, the flaps are retracted {{toward the center of}} the bolt, to unlock it. An additional lever-type bolt accelerator is provided; it is located in receiver, next to the barrel breech and below the bolt. The gun housing also somewhat resembles the German MG 42, although it is made from two separate parts - the barrel jacket (made from stamped steel) and receiver (a solid machined body). The barrel jacket is permanently welded to the front of the receiver. The barrel can be changed rapidly if required; the barrel change procedure is similar to that of the MG 42, with the locking latch located at the right side of the jacket, which is opened to provide a barrel replacement window.|$|R
