25|$|When the Sun is active, strong solar flares {{can occur}} that {{will hit the}} sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will {{penetrate}} to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30nbsp&MHz) <b>radio</b> <b>blackout.</b> During this time very low frequency (3–30nbsp&kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.|$|E

50|$|On January 27, at 18:37 UT, sunspot region 1402 {{unleashed}} a X1.7-class flare, prompting NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center {{to issue a}} R3 (strong) <b>Radio</b> <b>Blackout</b> warning and a S2 (moderate) Solar Radiation Storm warning.

50|$|Sunspot 1283 erupted with an M5.3-class {{solar flare}} on September 6 at 01:50 UT. A R2 (moderate) {{blackout}} radio alert was issued. The burst was Earth-directed.

50|$|Four solar flares {{occurred}} within 5 days from sunspot AR 12192, {{which is both}} the largest sunspot of solar cycle 24 and the largest since 1990.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of the plasma flow and electromagnetic wave around a membrane-aeroshell type reentry vehicle were performed using various physical model combinations, {{and the possibility}} of <b>radio</b> frequency <b>blackout</b> of transceiver antenna embedded {{at the rear of the}} vehicle was investigated. The flowfield was assumed to be in thermochemical nonequilibrium, and it was described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a multitemperature model and the equation of state. The simulations were performed for several altitudes, including the highest heat flux point according to reentry orbit data. Through these computations, the detailed distributions of the flowfield properties in the shock layer and wake region were successfully obtained. To evaluate the possibility of <b>radio</b> frequency <b>blackout</b> during atmospheric reentry, the distribution of the electron number density around the inflatable vehicle was clarified. A frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain method was used for {{simulations of}} electromagnetic waves, and the physical properties were obtained from the computational results of the plasma flow calculation. Electromagnetic wave behaviors in an ionized gas region behind the inflatable vehicle were investigated. It was found that the number density of electrons was sufficiently small and that the electromagnetic waves can propagate with no reflection and less attenuation. These results suggest that <b>radio</b> frequency <b>blackout</b> may not occur during the atmospheric reentry of the inflatable vehicle...|$|R
5000|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field dominates the terrestrial magnetosphere and prevents {{the solar wind}} from hitting us head on. Lacking a large protective magnetosphere, Mars {{is thought to have}} lost much of its former oceans and atmosphere to space in part due to the direct impact of the solar wind. Venus with its thick atmosphere is thought to have lost most of its water to space in large part owing to solar wind ablation.Understanding the magnetosphere increased in importance with the realization of the detrimental impact of geomagnetic storms, caused by solar coronal mass ejections, particularly in years of high solar activity. In addition to long known effects on Earth's cable communication systems, communications, broadcasting, navigation and security applications are increasingly dependent on satellites. Most of these satellites are well within the protective magnetosphere but are vulnerable to space weather systems that affect them adversely.

Two days later, an X1.9-class flare followed in the next 31 hours by a spectacular string of 14 M-class flares, being the biggest two M7 flares, were mostly unleashed {{out of the same}} sunspot. The first two explosions, X1.9 and M7.1, propelled a pair of closely spaced CMEs. A G4 (severe) geomagnetic storm was reported on September 26.|$|E
50|$|On August 9 at 0805 UT, sunspot 1263 {{produced}} a massive X6.9-class solar flare, the third X-flare of Solar Cycle 24 {{and the most}} powerful so far (as of May 2013). There was also a CME associated with this burst. Although the flare was not Earth-directed, radiation created waves of ionization in Earth's upper atmosphere, briefly disrupting communications at some VLF and HF radio frequencies. A R3-level (strong) <b>radio</b> <b>blackout</b> alert was issued. A proton event greater than 10 MeV (=million electron volts) ions and exceeding 10 pfu (=proton flux units) was also reported, so a S1-level solar radiation storm was also issued.|$|E

NOAA issued a R3 (strong) <b>radio</b> <b>blackout</b> alert pertaining this prominent x-ray flux event.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{model of}} plasma flow and electromagnetic waves around a reentry vehicle for <b>radio</b> frequency <b>blackout</b> prediction during aerodynamic heating {{was developed in}} this study. The model was validated based on experimental results from the radio attenuation measurement program. The plasma flow properties, such as electron number density, in the shock layer and wake region were obtained using a newly developed unstructured grid solver that incorporated real gas effect models and could treat thermochemically non-equilibrium flow. To predict the electromagnetic waves in plasma, a frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain method was used. Moreover, the complicated behaviour of electromagnetic waves in the plasma layer during atmospheric reentry was clarified at several altitudes. The prediction performance of the combined model was evaluated with profiles and peak values of the electron number density in the plasma layer. In addition, to validate the models, the signal losses measured during communication with the reentry vehicle were directly compared with the predicted results. Based on the study, {{it was suggested that}} the present analysis model accurately predicts the <b>radio</b> frequency <b>blackout</b> and plasma attenuation of electromagnetic waves in plasma in communication...|$|R
