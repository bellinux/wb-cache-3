2500|$|Most modern demand valves use a {{downstream}} {{rather than}} an upstream valve mechanism. In a downstream valve, the moving part of the valve opens {{in the same direction}} as the flow of gas and is kept closed by a spring. The usual form of downstream valve is a spring-loaded poppet with a hard elastomer seat sealing against an adjustable metal [...] "crown" [...] around the inlet orifice. The poppet is lifted away from the crown by a lever operated by the diaphragm. Two patterns are commonly used. One is the classic push-pull arrangement, where the actuating lever goes onto the end of the valve shaft and is held on by a nut. Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow. The other is the barrel poppet arrangement, where the poppet is enclosed in a tube which crosses the <b>regulator</b> <b>body</b> and the lever operates through slots in the sides of the tube. The far end of the tube is accessible from the side of the casing and a spring tension adjustment screw may be fitted for limited diver control of the cracking pressure. This arrangement also allows relatively simple pressure balancing of the second stage.|$|E

50|$|In October 1982, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, led by Felipe González, swept {{both the}} Congress of Deputies and Senate, winning an {{absolute}} majority in both chambers of the Cortes Generales. González headed the prime ministership of Spain {{for the next}} 13 years, during which period Spain joined the NATO and the European Community. The government also created new social laws and large scale infrastructural buildings, expanding the educational system and establishing a welfare state. While traditionally affiliated with one of Spain's major trade unions, the General Union of Workers (UGT), {{in an effort to}} improve Spain's competitiveness in preparation for admission to the EC as well as for further economic integration with Europe afterwards, the PSOE distanced itself from trade unions. Following a policy of liberalization, González's government closed state corporations under the state holding company, the National Industry Institute (INI), and down-sized the coal, iron and steel industries. The PSOE implemented the single market policies of the Single European Act and the domestic policies consistent with the Maastricth Treaty EMU criteria. The country was massively modernized and economically developed in this period, closing the gap with other European Community members. There was also a significant cultural shift, into a tolerant contemporary open society. In March 1996, José María Aznar, from the People's Party, obtained a relative majority in Congress. Aznar moved to further liberalize the economy, with a program of complete privatization of state-owned enterprises, labor market reform and other policies designed to increase competition in selected markets. Aznar liberalized the energy sector, national telecommunications and television broadcasting networks. To ensure a successful outcome of such liberalization, the government set up the Competition Defense Court (Tribunal de Defensa de la Competencia), an anti-trust <b>regulator</b> <b>body</b> entrusted with restricting monopolistic practices. During Aznar's government Spain qualified for the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, and adopted the euro, replacing the peseta, in 2002. Spain participated, along with the United States and other NATO allies, in military operations in the former Yugoslavia. Spanish armed forces and police personnel were included in the international peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Having obtained an absolute majority in the 2000 elections, Aznar, headed the prime ministership until 2004. Aznar supported transatlantic relations with the United States, and participated on the War on Terrorism and the invasion of Iraq. In 2004, he decided not to run as a candidate for the Popular Party, and proposed Mariano Rajoy, who had been minister under his government, as his successor as leader of the party. In the aftermath of the terrorist bomb attacks in Madrid, which occurred just three days before the elections, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party won a surprising victory. Its leader, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, headed the prime ministership from 2004 to 2011, winning a second term in 2008. Under a policy of gender equality, his was the first Spanish Government to have the same number of male and female members in the Council of Ministers. During the first four years of his prime ministership the economy continued to expand rapidly, and the government ran budget surpluses. His government brought social liberal changes to Spain, promoting women's rights, changing the abortion law, and legalizing same-sex marriage, and tried to make the State more secular. The economic crisis of 2008 took a heavy toll on Spain's economy, which had been highly dependent on construction since the boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s. When the international financial crisis hit, the construction industry collapsed, along with property values and several banks and cajas (savings banks) were in need of rescuing or consolidation. Economic growth slowed sharply and unemployment soared to over 20%, levels not seen since the late 1990s. In applying counter-cyclical policies during the beginning of the crisis, and the ensuing drop in State revenues, the government financing fell into deficit. During an 18-month period from 2010 to 2011, the government adopted severe austerity measures, cutting spending and laying off workers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The new Act of zakat {{management}} No. 23 Year 2011 {{has changed}} the position of private zakat management (LAZ; Lembaga Amil Zakat) which has no clear relationship with semi-governmental zakat management in the Act of Zakat Management No. 38 year 1999. This paper found that many debates arise especially on the position of private zakat management that has to work under the coordination of semi-governmental zakat management. Many data has shown that private zakat management has reached tremendous achievement compared to the semi-governmental zakat management. Based on this fact, this paper argues that zakat institutions in Indonesia needs to be managed properly without sacrificing the social capital i. e. the participation of private zakat management. This paper proposes that private zakat management needs to be given more spaces in optimizing the collecting and distributing zakat funds in Indonesia. The answer for this problem is building the <b>regulator</b> <b>body</b> for zakat management in Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{perceptions}} of auditors and users of their reports on auditor independence in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach – Auditors and users are requested to stated their confidence in the level of independence in 34 scenarios. Descriptive and ? 2 test are the used to analyse the difference of perceptions amongst groups. The paper then conduct an interview with a senior officer of audit <b>regulator</b> <b>body</b> to better understand the findings. Findings – Both groups have less confidence on auditor independence in 30 situations. Results between auditors and users indicate auditors having lower confidence on auditor independence than users in situations related to crossover from audit firm to client, provision of NAS, auditor litigation and indirect financial interest through shareholdings while users have lower confidence on auditor independence involving personal relationship with a political figure and client imposing strict budget on audit fees. Within the auditor group, non-Big 4 auditors expressed more concerned for situations related to family relationship and restriction on audit fees. Originality/value – Research on auditor independence in Indonesia remains scarce despite the country's eagerness to adopt “international” accounting and auditing standards. In addition, the cultural context of Indonesia also helped in explaining our findings. </br...|$|E

The {{focus is on}} spacecraft carrying multiple science instruments and power systems that will allow extended operations on the lunar surface or other air-less bodies in the solar system. Initial trade studies of launch vehicle options indicate the spacecraft will be significantly mass and volume constrained. Because of the investment by the DOD in low mass, highly volume efficient components, NASA has investigated the potential integration {{of some of these}} technologies in space science applications. A 10, 000 psig helium pressure regulator test activity has been conducted as part of the overall risk reduction testing for the RLL spacecraft. The regulator was subjected to typical NASA acceptance testing to assess the regulator response to the expected RLL mission requirements. The test results show the regulator can supply helium at a stable outlet pressure of 740 psig within a +/- 5 % tolerance band and maintain a lock-up pressure less than the + 5 % above nominal outlet pressure for all tests conducted. Numerous leak tests demonstrated leakage less than 10 - 3 standard cubic centimeters per second (SCCS) for the internal seat leakage at lock-up and less than 10 - 5 SCCS for external leakage through the <b>regulator</b> <b>body.</b> The successful test has shown the potential for 10, 000 psig helium systems in NASA spacecraft and has reduced risk associated with hardware availability and hardware ability to meet RLL mission requirements...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} explores stakeholders’ perceptions on valuing a {{local government}} owned heritage tourist site {{as evidenced by}} Sapta Tirta Pablengan in Karanganyar, Indonesia. The stakeholder is stakeholders of tourism industry caring for the site. Eighteen representatives of stakeholders are chosen as samples of this research called as respondents to be deeply interviewed. The inductive data analysis reveals that stakeholders believe that the heritage tourist site should be valued {{in terms of its}} marketable value as a tourist site. This definition of a marketable value as a tourist site is firstly determined by both physical recovery cost as a required development and improvement of the site, the maintenance cost needed for this site to be much more marketable as a tourist site and non physical of promotion and service improvement costs are termed as a matter of expenditure to sustain the site in the accounting term. In line with the standard, prevision of maintenance costs and major restoration as well as income and expenditure related to their activity should be elaborated in the served information in notes to financial report of the entity holding such heritage asset. Another significant determinant attached to value of a heritage tourist site asset naming as tourist(s) interests. This last term implies of making use of travel cost and contingent valuation methods for valuing a heritage tourist site asset. Finally, since this valuation method is able to capture a total value meaning that it is significant for decision makers and management decisions, in this case the government particularly, for the purpose of its maintenance and preservation interests.

By the time new ICT developments bring more new media channels on a wider spectrum, the states policies are struggling between the implementation of the democratic tools evenly and protecting their own authoritarian state. Turkey has been governed by an authoritarian state for ten years, coming along with the years, the media policies and the regulations have been threatening media freedom and freedom of expression intensively around the country. There emerged a regulation problem, which is a major outcome of treating new media tools the same as traditional media channels. Since the state owes its success mostly to its media propaganda, the stabilization of current state power has been managed by the restrictions over media freedom, which results in a great danger of violating human rights in the country. The media has been imposed by the main dominant political ideology, which is the combination of conservative values, patriarchal mentality and the authoritarian system. The media coming along with many features has protected the ultimate state power in Turkey.
