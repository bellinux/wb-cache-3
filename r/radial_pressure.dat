40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} on combined torsional buckling of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) under combined torque, axial loading and <b>radial</b> <b>pressures</b> based on the continuum mechanics model, which takes into account the effect of the van der Waals interaction between adjacent tubes. A buckling condition is derived for determining the critical buckling torque and associated buckling mode. In particular, for combined torsional buckling of double-walled carbon nanotubes, an explicit expression is obtained and some detailed results are demonstrated. According to the innermost radius-to-thickness ratio, MWNTs are classified into three types: thin, thick, and (almost) solid. Numerical results are worked out for the critical buckling torque and associated buckling mode for all the three types of MWNTs subjected to various axial stresses (axial tensile stresses or axial compressive stresses), internal pressures, and external pressures. It is shown that, the axial tensile stress or the internal pressure will make the MWNTs resist higher critical buckling torque, while the axial compressive stress or external pressure will lead to a lower critical buckling torque. The effect of axial stress (axial tensile stress or axial compressive stress) on the critical buckling torque of MWNTs is very small for all the three types of MWNTs, while the effect of the internal pressure or external pressure is related to the types of MWNTs, which is strong for the thin MWNTs, moderate for the thick MWNTs, and small for the solid MWNTs. Numerical results also indicate that, the associated buckling mode is unique and dependent on the structure of MWNTs. Especially, for combined torsional buckling of MWNTs with very small axial stress and <b>radial</b> <b>pressures,</b> the buckling mode is just the one for the corresponding pure torsional buckling...|$|R

50|$|The first {{creation}} of a Z-pinch in the laboratory may have occurred in 1790 in Holland when Martinus van Marum created an explosion by discharging 100 Leyden jars into a wire. The phenomenon was not understood until 1905, when Pollock and Barraclough investigated a compressed and distorted length of copper tube from a lightning rod after it had been struck by lightning. Their analysis showed that the forces due to {{the interaction of the}} large current flow with its own magnetic field could have caused the compression and distortion. A similar, and apparently independent, theoretical analysis of the pinch effect in liquid metals was published by Northrupp in 1907.

30|$|Thoracic outlet {{syndrome}} (TOS) can interrupt {{blood flow}} to upper limbs by vascular compression. We report {{a case of a}} 52 -year-old man who presented left subclavian artery malperfusion due to TOS during total vertebrectomy (Th 2 – 4) in the prone position for invasive lung cancer. At the time of resection of the vertebral bodies, his left <b>radial</b> systolic blood <b>pressure</b> had begun to drop intermittently and we noticed an interarm pressure difference. Accordingly, we began to monitor the right <b>radial</b> artery <b>pressure</b> and found that only the left <b>radial</b> artery <b>pressure</b> decreased as a result of compressive force from the surgical site. The operation was continued with intermittent malperfusion of the left arm, and when it was prolonged, we asked the surgeons to release the compression. No symptoms of ischemia or nerve injuries in the left arm were observed after the surgery. Retrospective review of his preoperative enhanced computed tomography images suggested a slightly compressed left subclavian artery in the costoclavicular space. Combination of the prone position and a specific upper limb position may be a risk factor for intraoperative TOS. An interarm blood pressure difference is a clue to detect accidental arterial TOS during general anesthesia.|$|R

50|$|F09 {{noted that}} storm with {{stronger}} outer winds tracked {{more to the}} northwest than storms with weak winds. They hypothesize {{that this can be}} explained with an atmosphere in hydrostatic balance. Assuming an atmosphere that is in hydrostatic balance, the average column virtual temperature contributes the most to the surface pressure. The virtual temperatures of the three F09 storms varied with the Kessler storm having temperatures several degrees warmer than the other storms. The winds are determined by the <b>radial</b> <b>pressure</b> gradients, which are related to the temperature gradients. Therefore, storms that have a large radial variation in virtual temperature will have stronger outer winds. The temperature differences between the models {{can be explained by the}} change in radiative heating and cooling. The K microphysics scheme produced particle fall speeds that were slower than the others, thereby increasing the size of its anvil. F09 report that the most important factor that influences the size of the anvil is the terminal velocity, and that the terminal velocity of the particles depends on their geometry, density, and size. Interactions between the anvil and incoming and emitted radiation changes the radial temperature gradient, leading to changes in the track direction.|$|E
50|$|A high average solid to gas ratio may {{be reached}} {{due to the}} loss of gas or by the {{concentration}} of solids. Gas may be selectively lost due to photoevaporation late in the gas disk epoch, causing solids to be concentrated in a ring {{at the edge of a}} cavity that forms in the gas disk. The solid to gas ratio can also increase in the outer disk due to photoevaporation, but in the giant planet region planetesimal formation may be too late to produce giant planets. If the magnetic field of the disc is aligned with its angular momentum the Hall effect increases viscosity which can result in a faster depletion of the inner gas disk. A pile up of solids in the inner disk can occur due to slower rates of radial drift as Stoke's numbers decline with increasing gas densities. The radial pile up is reinforced as the velocity of the gas increases with the surface density of solids and could result in the formation of bands of planetesimals extending from sublimation lines to a sharp outer edges where solid to gas ratios first reach critical values. For some ranges of particle size and gas viscosity outward flow of the gas may occur reducing its density and further increasing the solid to gas ratio. The radial pile ups may be limited due to a reduction in the gas density as the disk evolves however, and shorter growth timescales of solids closer to the star could instead result in the loss of solids from the inside out. Radial pile-ups also occur at locations where rapidly drifting large solids fragment into smaller slower drifting solids, for example, inside the ice line where silicate grains are released as icy bodies sublimate. The enhancement could be muted, however, if the icy bodies are highly porous, which slows their radial drift. Icy solids can be concentrated outside the ice line due to the outward diffusion and recondensation of water vapor. Solids are also concentrated in <b>radial</b> <b>pressure</b> bumps, where the pressure reaches a local maximum. At these locations radial drift converges from both closer and farther from the star. <b>Radial</b> <b>pressure</b> bumps are present at the inner edge of the dead zone, and can form due to the magnetorotational instability. The ice line has also been proposed as the site of a pressure bump, however, this requires a steep viscosity transition. If the back-reaction from the concentration of solids flattens the pressure gradient, the planetesimals formed at a pressure bump may be smaller than predicted at other locations. Local pressure bumps also form in the spiral arms of a massive self-gravitating disk and in anti-cyclonic vortices. The break-up of vortices could also leave a ring of solids from which a streaming instability may form. Solids may also be concentrated locally if disk winds lower the surface density of the inner disc, slowing or reversing their inward drift, or due to thermal diffusion.|$|E
40|$|As a soil dries, the {{earthworms}} in that soil dehydrate {{and become}} less active. Moisture stress may weaken an earthworm, lowering the <b>radial</b> <b>pressure</b> {{that the animal}} can produce. This possibility was investigated for the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny). Pressures were compared for saturated earthworms (worms taken from saturated soil) and stressed earthworms (worms that had been partially dehydrated by leaving them in dry soil). A load cell was used to record the forces that earthworms produced as they moved through artificial burrows (holes that had been drilled through blocks of aluminium or Perspex).
