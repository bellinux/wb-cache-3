40|$|Community-Acquired Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections, {{generally}} {{occurring in}} previously healthy persons without <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors {{for health care}} setting-related MRSA, are emerging as serious clinical and public health concerns. Community-Acquired Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, like all strains of S. aureus, is transmitted by {{direct contact with the}} organism. An overabundance of surface proteins and secreted virulence factors provide S. aureus with great potential to cause disease. Methicillin resistance is conferred by expression of the mecA gene, which encodes a modified penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2 a´) that has low affinity for β-lactam antibiotics and facilitates cell-wall synthesis in the presence of methicillin and other β-lactams. Geographically, {{there are two types of}} Community-Acquired Methicillin-resistant S. aureus: on...|$|E
40|$|Three {{weeks after}} delivery, a 22 -year old woman {{presented}} to urology with fever, abdominal and right-sided flank pain. Hydronephrosis {{was diagnosed with}} iv-pyelography and treated with JJ-stent drainage and antibiotics for suspected pyelonephritis. On the third day oedema of the right leg appeared, which prompted further investigations. CT identified ovarian vein thrombosis {{as a cause of}} hydronephrosis, and further thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, iliacal and deep veins of both upper legs. Anticoagulant treatment with low-molecular-weight-heparin and later warfarin resulted in partial recanalisation of thrombi. The patient is double heterozygous for factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation. Although recent literature negates this as a significant risk factor, presence of other, more obvious and easily <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors (previous spontaneous abortions, smoking, bed rest, obesity, non-O blood group [...] .) should have prompted detailed risk evaluation and consideration of thromboprophylaxis.

Lim-ited sequence {{analysis of}} isolates infecting the mother and child demonstrated 100 % identical sequences in the long terminal repeat (LTR 65 - 297; 236 bp), pOZ 4762 - 4919 (157 bp), and env 5523 - 6003 (480 bp) regions (both isolates were subtype a), suggesting mother-to-child transmission. In contrast, isolates obtained from 2 other prostitutes from the same geographic region had se-quences {{different from those of the}} first woman and her child, and the second and third women were infected with HTLV-II subtype b. Although vertical transmission of HTLV-II in this 8 -year-old child cannot be conclusively ascertained, the probability is overwhelming that infection occurred through breast-feeding for an extended period of time.

40|$|Immunologic tests {{such as the}} {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} (TST) and QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) are designed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, both latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and infection manifesting as active tuberculosis disease (TB). These tests need high specificity to minimize unnecessary treatment and high sensitivity to allow maximum detection and prevention of TB. Estimate QFT-GIT specificity, compare QFT-GIT and TST results, and assess factor associations with test discordance among U. S. Navy recruits. Among 792 subjects with completed TST and QFT-GIT, 42 (5. 3 %) had TST indurations ≥ 10 mm, 23 (2. 9 %) had indurations ≥ 15 mm, 14 (1. 8 %) had positive QFT-GIT results, and 5 (0. 6 %) had indeterminate QFT-GITs. Of 787 subjects with completed TST and determinate QFT-GIT, 510 (64. 8 %) were at low-risk for infection, 277 (35. 2 %) were at increased risk, and none had TB. Among 510 subjects at low-risk (presumed not infected), estimated TST specificity using a 15 mm cutoff, 99. 0 % (95 %CI: 98. 2 - 99. 9 %), and QFT-GIT specificity, 98. 8 % (95 %CI: 97. 9 - 99. 8 %), {{were not significantly different}} (p> 0. 99). Most discordance was among recruits at increased risk of infection, and most was TST-positive but QFT-GIT-negative discordance. Of 18 recruits with TST ≥ 15 mm but QFT-GIT negative discordance, 14 (78 %) were at increased risk. TB prevalence in country of birth was the strongest predictor of positive TST results, positive QFT-GIT results, and TST-positive but QFT-GIT-negative discordance. Reactivity to M. avium purified protein derivative (PPD) was associated with positive TST results and with TST-positive but QFT-GIT-negative discordance using a 10 mm cutoff, but not using a 15 mm cutoff or with QFT-GIT results. M. tuberculosis infection prevalence was low, with the vast majority of infection occurring in recruits with <b>recognizable</b> <b>risks.</b> QFT-GIT and TST specificities were high and not significantly different.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} risk factors for benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence, such as sociodemographic variables, characteristics of BZD use, and psychiatric parameters, which to date have been found to relate inconsistently to indicators of BZD dependence such as chronic BZD use and BZD withdrawal symptoms. The Benzodiazepine Dependence Self-Report Questionnaire (Bendep-SRQ), Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), and Symptom Checklist- 90 (SCL- 90) were administered to 599 outpatients using BZDs. Regression analyses were conducted using BZD dependence diagnoses and severity scales as dependent variables. BZD dependence diagnoses were only predicted by being a self-help patient and long BZD elimination half-life (for only the DSM-III-R). The main predictors of BZD dependence severity, as measured by the ICD- 10, DSM-III-R scales, and Bendep-SRQ Rasch scales, were in decreasing order: (1) being a self-help patient; (2) higher BZD dose, longer duration of BZD use, younger age; and (3) non-native cultural origin, lower level of education, being in outpatient treatment for alcohol and/or drug dependence, and the interaction of BZD dose with duration of BZD use. We conclude that a limited number of <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors appear to predict the severity of BZD dependence.

40|$|Pituitary {{apoplexy}} is rare endocrine emergency {{which can}} occur due to infarction or haemorrhage of pituitary gland. This disorder most often involves a pituitary adenoma. Occasionally {{it may be}} the first manifestation of an underlying adenoma. There is conflicting data regarding which type of pituitary adenoma is prone for apoplexy. Some studies showed predominance of non-functional adenomas while some other studies showed a higher prevalence in functioning adenomas amongst which prolactinoma have the highest risk. Although pituitary apoplexy can occur without any precipitating factor in most cases, there are some well <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors such as hypertension, medications, major surgeries, coagulopathies either primary or following medications or infection, head injury, radiation or dynamic testing of the pituitary. Patients usually present with headache, vomiting, altered sensorium, visual defect and/or endocrine dysfunction. Hemodynamic instability may be result from adrenocorticotrophic hormone deficiency. Imaging with either CT scan or MRI should be performed in suspected cases. Intravenous fluid and hydrocortisone should be administered after collection of sample for baseline hormonal evaluation. Earlier studies used to advocate urgent decompression of the lesion but more recent studies favor conservative approach for most cases with surgery reserved for those with deteriorating level of consciousness or increasing visual defect. The visual and endocrine outcomes are almost similar with either surgery or conservative management. Once the acute phase is over, patient should be re-evaluated for hormonal deficiencies...|$|E
40|$|Thrombophilia or hypercoagulable {{state is}} a {{clinical}} condition characterized by a tendency to develop venous (less frequently arterial) thrombosis. The development of a venous thromboembolic episode (VTE) {{is the result of}} environmental risk factors such as age, male sex, obesity, the exposure to “risk periods” of immobilization, trauma, cancer, pregnancy or the use of exogenous hormones or antineoplastic medications often on a background of a congenital procoagulant state. Table 1 summarizes the most frequently inherited and acquired thrombophilic conditions in a population of patients with a first episode of VTE. In patients with venous thrombosis before the early nineties a biologic cause of thrombophilia was detectable in only 5 % to 15 % of cases and was confined to deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S.

Introduction: Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI) is {{a serious}} {{infection}} associated with 28, 000 deaths and expenses from $ 296 million to $ 2. 3 billion yearly. There is scarcity of data on CLABSI in pediatric cardiac intensive care units (PCICU). The aim {{of the study is}} to describe the risk factors, causative organisms and outcome of CLABSI in a PCICU. Methodology: The study was retrospective cohort in which all charts of patients admitted to the PCICU from January 2012 to September 2012 were reviewed. Patients who had central line were followed to see if they develop CLABSI from the central line insertion date until discharge. Results: Two hundred and sixty-one patients were included in the study. There were 2275 central line days and 19 CLABSI episodes (8. 35 CLABSIs per 1000 central line days). Most common causative pathogens isolated were gram negative bacteria (N =  10, 50 %) with Klebsiella pneumoniae and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were the leading causative organisms (N =  4, 20 % each). Patients who developed the infection had a longer stay at the PCICU with a mean of 27. 1  days compared to 8. 20  days for non CLABSI Patients (P  7  days were independent risk factors.

40|$|Introduction. Keratocnjunctivitis is corneal and conjunctival {{inflammation}} Clinical signs {{involve the}} irritating trio: mixed hyperemia of conjunctival membranes, corneal subepthelial infiltrates and regional lymphadenopathy. The most common causes of epidemic are adenovirus, herpes virus, and rarely cytomegalovirus, {{which are now}} occurring with higher frequency as secondary infections. Objective. The aim {{of the study was}} to present and analyze keratoconjunctival epidemics in the region of Kragujevac from September 2008 to February 2009, as well as to analyze clinical features related to virusological findings and etiology. Methods. In 329 patients we performed clinical examination (biomicroscopy, fluorescent test, corneal sensitivity test), collecting standard specimen of the conjuctiva and cornea, made serological examination, and sent the specimens to the Virusology Institute “Torlak” in Belgrade for the confirmation of epidemic etiology. The patients were treated with local and symptomatological therapy. The epidemic was eradicated in cooperation with a regional referent institution. All outpatients activities were ceased, while hospital hygienic, sanitary, intra-, extra-hospital and therapeutic procedures were undertaken. Results. The distribution of 329 patients by gender was equivalent. Most patients were aged from 27 to 34 years (25 %) of working population. The distribution of patients by clinical features showed the predominance of follicular hyperplasy (93. 62 %). The distribution according to the time of the first symptoms onset showed the frequency of 50 % of corneal infiltrate in the second week. The period elapsed from the diagnosis to cure was three weeks in 50 % of patients. Serological tests confirmed the mixed distribution of the cause. Conclusion. Based on the authors’ experience, in order to eradicate epidemics as fast as possible and achieve efficient treatment, it is recommended that the epidemic should be reported, guidelines of referent institutions be obeyed, all of which diminishes the <b>recognizable</b> professional <b>risk</b> and decreases mistakes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) {{is a high}} incidence disease. Easily measured predictor factors could help to implement preventive policies and early detection tests. Aim: To measure <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors for GDM such as skinfolds and analyze the association between these factors {{and the development of}} GDM in a cohort of pregnant women. Material and Methods: Evaluation of 76 mothers that developed gestational diabetes, aged 32. 2 ± 0. 6 years and 324 control mothers that did not develop the disease, aged 30. 1 ± 0. 3 years. Weight, height, arm circumference, tricipital, bicipital, subscapular, suprailiac, knee, costal and mid-thigh skinfolds were measured in the pre-diseased stage. History of diabetes, fasting glucose and insulin levels were also evaluated. Results: Age, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA), bi-cipital, tricipital, costal, subscapular, suprailiac, and knee skinfolds were associated with GDM development. Age, fasting blood glucose and subscapular skinfolds were independent predictors in the logistic regression model. The odds ratio for a subs-capular skinfold over percentile 90 was 1. 7 (95 % confdence intervals: 1. 07 - 3. 04). Conclusions: Age and fasting blood glucose are independent risk factors for GDM. Subscapular skinfold is also an independent risk factor and could be used to detect high risk pregnant women and implement preventive policies...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Cerebral venous {{thrombosis}} (CVT) {{may be a}} manifestation of underlying autoimmune disease. Antibodies against annexin A 2 (anti-A 2 Ab) coincide with antiphospholipid syndrome, in which antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLA) are associated with thrombosis in any vascular bed. Annexin A 2, a profibrinolytic receptor and binding site for 2 -glycoprotein-I, the main target for aPLA, is highly expressed on cerebral endothelium. Here we evaluate the prevalence of anti-A 2 Ab in CVT. Methods—Forty individuals with objectively documented CVT (33 women and 7 men) and 145 healthy controls were prospectively studied for hereditary and acquired prothrombotic risk factors, classical aPLA, and anti-A 2 Ab. Results—One or more prothrombotic risk factors were found in 85 % of CVT subjects, (pregnancy/puerperium in 57. 5 %, classical aPLA in 22. 5 %, and hereditary procoagulant risk factors in 17. 5 %). Anti-A 2 Ab (titer 3 SD) were significantly more prevalent in patients with CVT (12. 5 %) than in healthy individuals (2. 1 %, P 0. 01, OR, 5. 9). Conclusions—Anti-A 2 Ab are significantly associated with CVT and may define a subset of individuals with immune-mediated cerebral thrombosis. (Stroke. 2011; 42 : 501 - 503.)

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{differences between}} survivors and nonsurvivors and {{factors associated with}} mortality in pediatric intensive care patients with low risk of mortality. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Patients were selected from a national database including all admissions to the PICUs in The Netherlands between 2006 and 2012. PATIENTS: Patients less than 18 years old admitted to the PICU with a predicted mortality risk lower than 1 % according to either the recalibrated Pediatric Risk of Mortality or the Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In total, 16, 874 low-risk admissions were included of which 86 patients (0. 5 %) died. Nonsurvivors had more unplanned admissions (74. 4 % vs 38. 5 %; p < 0. 001), had more complex chronic conditions (76. 7 % vs 58. 8 %; p = 0. 001), were more often mechanically ventilated (88. 1 % vs 34. 9 %; p < 0. 001), and had a longer length of stay (median, 11 [interquartile range, 5 - 32] d vs median, 3 [interquartile range, 2 - 5] d; p < 0. 001) when compared with survivors. Factors significantly associated with mortality were complex chronic conditions (odds ratio, 3. 29; 95 % CI, 1. 97 - 5. 50), unplanned admissions (odds ratio, 5. 78; 95 % CI, 3. 40 - 9. 81), and admissions in spring/summer (odds ratio, 1. 67; 95 % CI, 1. 08 - 2. 58).

Between general principles concerning fault and new protection requirements”. The work is basically divided into three parts: the first part concerning the classical concept of guilt in his profiles philosophical, dogmatic and existential; a second, which concerns {{the introduction of the}} precautionary principle in our legal {{and its impact on the}} classical concept of guilt; a third part, which concerns the reflection of this principle in the specific area of criminal law of work through an excursus both normative jurisprudential. The present work is, therefore, the deepening of the specific theme consists of the importance of the precautionary principle in contexts that involve variously safety and reflections of the same in the specific area of criminal law of the work with reference to the evolution of the classical concept of criminal guilt. The research carried out, therefore, in the first phase was concerned with the study of the classical concept of guilt. Then I analyzed the different conceptions of guilt developed in doctrine and the basic elements of the judgment negligent liability, namely the unwillingness of the fact, the precautionary rules, the c. d. concretization of risk, predictability and avoidance detrimental event and, finally, the enforceability by the party's agent alternative behavior lawful. In a second step was carried out, then, the study of the c. d. precautionary principle as a criterion of risk management in terms of scientific uncertainty. On the theme, on the one hand, sources, assumptions and fields of application of that principle were analyzed, the other the legitimacy of that under criminal law, identifying the differences between the criminal law of prevention and precaution, from 'more deformations that following the entry of this principle in our system are undergoing causation and guilt criminal with particular reference to the evolution of the concept of predictability of the event. On the basis of the deepening made you come to the conclusion that this principle, pending the generic prescriptive that characterizes it, is likely to conflict with the character of certainty of the criminal standard and lends itself to play a role as a potential factor in the expansion of the categories of classical criminal law. It could, in fact, affect two fundamental factors for the configuration of the typical fact: first, on the objective level of causation, exploiting the probabilistic structure and turning it into a "nexus of risk"; secondly on the subjective level of guilt deforming in its more <b>recognizable</b> cognitive <b>risk</b> and predictability of the result. Finally, the third part of the research project has been directed towards the study of reflexes that the precautionary principle has had in the specific field of criminal law of work through an excursus both normative jurisprudential. The matter of safety at work, the expected legal interests protected by primary degree, you are, indeed, characterizing a transition from rule to rule precautionary precautionary: that fact marks the release of preventing the event from the conduct conforms to the rule previously identified by placing, consequently, in the crisis the same function garantistic rule precautionary. In this sector, indeed, one might come to affirm the responsibility culpable of a subject matter a concrete verification about the actual effectiveness of the predictive rule remand in relation to the specific offense to the legal interest protected by the rule, so as to impute the event even where there is only the possibility that the detrimental effects occur, with direct and obvious impact on the subjective level of predictability and avoidance, which are no longer subject to a specific event, but rather a class or kind of events. Emblematic on the subject, and object of study, some judgments regarding the exposure of workers to asbestos or harmful substances such as vinyl chloride monomer. In response, in fact, the protection of victims and the needs of substantial justice, we are witnessing an obvious flexibility of the paradigm of guilt and criminal liability from asbestos, offering a rich case law, constitutes a particular field of reflection for what concerns the evolution of the classical dogmatic categories of criminal law for charging the damaging event. Jurisprudential analysis performed, it seems, indeed, take off a micro-penal system from occupational exposures, where the deconstruction of guilt, through the distortion of the value of the regulatory rule precautionary determines an instance of absolute protection of the victim, with a corresponding load iperdeterrece for the author, called to bear risks criminal gravitating outside its sphere of recognition. ...|$|R
40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} indicates that in chronic inflammatory arthritis (CIA), QTc prolongation is frequent and correlates with systemic inflammatory activation. Notably, basic studies demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines induce profound changes in potassium and calcium channels resulting in a prolonging effect on cardiomyocyte action potential duration (APD), thus on the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that in RA patients the risk of SCD is significantly increased when compared to non-RA subjects. Conversely, to date no data are available about Torsades de Pointes (TdP) prevalence in CIA, and the few case reported considered CIA only an incidental concomitant disease, not contributing factor to TdP development. We report three patients with active CIA developing marked QTc prolongation, in two cases complicated with TdP degenerating to cardiac arrest. In these patients, a blood sample was obtained within 24 h from TdP/marked QTc prolongation occurrence and levels of IL- 6, TNF-alpha and IL- 1 were evaluated. In all three cases, IL- 6 was markedly elevated, ~ 10 to 100 times more than reference values. Moreover, one patient also showed high circulating levels of TNF-alpha and IL- 1. In conclusion, active CIA may represent a currently overlooked QT-prolonging risk factor, potentially contributing {{in the presence of}} other classical risk factors to TdP occurrence. In particular, a relevant role may be played by elevated circulating IL- 6 levels via direct electrophysiological effects on the heart. This observation should be carefully kept in mind, particularly when <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors are already present and/or the addition of QT-prolonging drugs is required...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mesenteric vein {{thrombosis}} (MVT) is uncommon and accounts for 5 - 10 % of all mesenteric ischemic events. In 80 % of cases, an etiologic factor is found. The clinical presentation varies and {{the diagnosis is}} made based on imaging studies. The treatment involves anticoagulation alone or in combination with surgery. Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with MVT. Patients and methods: Retrospective and prospective review of all cases with MVT, treated between 1995 - 2001. The clinical presentation, imaging studies, treatment and outcome were evaluated. Results: 29 cases of MVT were reviewed (14 females, age 56 ± 15 years). Twenty two patients (76 %) had <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors. The main symptoms were abdomianl pain (86 %) and vomiting (55 %). The diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia was suspected on admission only in 6 patients (21 %). Thirteen patients underwent transabdominal color Doppler ultrasonography and the diagnosis was confirmed for 11 of these (85 %). Twenty out of 24 patients (85 %) studied with computed tomography, had positive signs of MVT. Twenty one patients (72 %) recieved anticoagulation, 10 of whom also underwent surgery. Four patients (14 %) received surgical treatment alone. Four patients were not treated. Seven patients (24 %) died. Conclusions: MVT is difficult to identify.

40|$|Background: Candida {{esophagitis}} is {{a common}} abnormality found on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure in patients with <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors. However, the finding is frequently incidental as {{most of them are}} asymptomatic. There has been no study on the characteristics of Candida esophagitis in Indonesia. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the degree of Candida esophagitis and its characteristics in patients who underwent EGD procedure at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Method: A retrospective study was conducted on all EGD procedures at the Gastroenterology Procedure Room, Internal Medicine Department, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, between January 2007 and December 2009 with a total of 2, 311 samples. The study was carried out by visually examining all endoscopic procedures and grading them according to the Kodsi severity grading (1976), and evaluating medical records. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2007. Results: During the study period, Candida esophagitis was found in 2. 6 % patients with predominant male (68. 9 %) and the average age was 49. 8 ± 15 years. The chief complaints found were dyspepsia (34. 4 %), melena (21. 3 %) and dysphagia (4. 9 %) and 32. 8 % patients were asymptomatic. The most frequent risk factors were age ≥ 60 years old (28. 3 %), proton pump inhibitor or H 2 receptor antagonist user (26. 4 %), and antibiotics (17. 0 %). Grade II Kodsi candidiasis was the most prevalent degree in this study (44. 3 %). Conclusion: Candida esophagitis was one frequent finding in endoscopy based on the complaint of dyspepsia in patients with certain risk factors.

40|$|Stroke is {{relatively}} rare {{in children and}} the clinical presentation of paediatric stroke is often subtle. Numerous predisposing risk factors are known, and these can be both inherited and acquired. They include cardiac disease, vascular abnormalities, endothelial damage, infectious diseases, collagen tissue diseases, certain inborn errors of metabolism and anticardiolipin antibody, lupus anticoagulant and deficiencies of protein C, protein S, antithrombin or plasminogen. In addition, abnormal activated protein C resistance (or Factor V Leiden), Factor II G 20219 A variant, and the thermolabile variant of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C 677 T) need to be considered. To explore the prevalence of different predisposing conditions in paediatric stroke patients, we evaluated 48 patients, including subjects with ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke subtypes. Only 7 out of 48 (14. 5 %) had no <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors: the majority of paediatric stroke patients had pre-existing risk factors that predisposed to the condition. The major genetic risk factor in our series of patients was homozygosity for the MTHFR C 677 T mutation (7 out of 48 patients); three more patients {{were found to be}} heterozygous for the Factor V Leiden mutation. Acquired predisposing conditions were present in 23 out of 48 patients and included pulmunar stenosis, head trauma, hyperlipidaemia and varicella infection. A total of 17 patients had both genetic and acquired predisposing factors. Our results emphasize that multiple predisposing risk factors commonly predispose to paediatric stroke.

Materials and MethodsA total of 2, 416 women, who were consecutive referrals for antenatal care to five university teaching hospitals in Tehran, were recruited. Patients with known diabetes were excluded. All 2, 416 women were screened with a 50 -g 1 -hour glucose challenge test, and any {{woman with a}} plasma glucose concentration more {{than or equal to}} 130 mg/dL was given a 100 -g 3 -hour glucose tolerance test. Diagnosis of GDM was according to Carpenter and Coustan's criteria. The remainder served as controls for the study. ResultsThere were 114 women (4. 7 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 9 – 5. 6 %) who had GDM. Women with GDM had a significantly higher parity and body mass index than non-diabetic women. Women with GDM {{were also more likely to}} have a family history of diabetes and a history of poor obstetric outcome.

The odds ratio (OR) for cesarean section (OR, 2. 28; p = 0. 0002), macrosomia (OR, 1. 93; p = 0. 0374), neonatal hypoglycemia (OR, 3. 2; p = 0. 011) and hypocalcemia (OR, 3. 045; p = 0. 0195), and still birth (OR, 4. 8; p = 0. 003) were all significantly higher in women with GDM than non-GDM controls. ConclusionOne out of every 20 pregnant Iranian women will develop GDM, with significantly increased odds of adverse maternal and fetal outcome. The significant proportion of young and/or risk factor-free women in our sample means that there seems to be a case for universal GDM screening in pregnant Iranian women...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Specific {{prevention}} of {{sudden cardiac death}} (SCD) caused by an acute coronary event {{in the general population}} has remained a challenge for clinicians since the <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors for this fatal outcome of an underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) may be partly the same as those of a non-fatal coronary event. This case-control study was designed to compare genetic and several other factors between consecutive series of survivors (n =  644) and victims of SCD (n =  425) from an acute coronary event. Only subjects with an acute coronary event verified at medico-legal autopsy were included in the SCD group. As controls, 809 subjects without any history of CAD, acute myocardial infarction or aborted cardiac arrest were examined. Subjects to the sub-studies were drawn from these study populations. The increased risk for SCD in the general population was associated with family history of SCD, male gender, smoking, cardiac hypertrophy and the severity of CAD. In the present study, 100 % mortality was observed when all these risk factors were present at the time of an acute coronary event. In the subjects with a family history of SCD, the increased risk of SCD was correlated with the severity of CAD without any clustering of coronary risk factors, suggesting that genetic factors affecting the accelerated progression of CAD may have an important role in familial SCD. However, polymorphisms of genes affecting thrombosis, which are believed to have effects on plaque progression and the consequences of plaque complications, were not associated with an increased risk for SCD. The present results show that the risk of SCD at the time of an acute coronary event can be assessed by generally available methods. If a subject is a male smoker and has a family history of SCD, the risk of SCD is substantially increased. In our study sample the currently known polymorphisms affecting thrombosis did not have a major impact in risk stratification of genetic susceptibility for SCD. Simple association studies have clear shortcomings when they attempt to reveal genetic associations with complex outcomes and thus new research strategies are needed to elucidate the genetic background of SCD...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{osteoporosis}} {{was defined}} in the year 1993 as a systemic squeleton disease caraterized by a reduced bonemass and a bone tissue microarquitecture deterioration. The reduced bone mass is a typical anomaly of osteoporosis. The other anomaly observed is the derangement of normal microarchitecture petter. There is a less number of bone trabeculae in the osteoporotic bone and the trabecules are thiner than regular ones; there are as well horizontal backups that are not linked with other structures and therefore they do not give any structural support. The doble source energy radiologic densitometry (DEXA) is {{the gold standard for}} the bone mass measurement. The transdermic hormonal replacement therapy prevents bonemass loss. Objectives: Main: Estimation of the needed interval between two densitometries so real differences show up between two consecutive densitometries. Secondary: Evaluation of <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors for bone mass loss between two consecutive densitometries, stablish differences when progesterone is added and economic cost assesement. Pacients and Methods: Prospective cohort study in which 3826 postmenopausal patients where included and entered the inclusion criteria, to whom a densitometry was made within the period of January 1994 and December 1995. A control group of 2393 patients, a group which received transdermical strogens of 807 patients and a group which received Strogens and progesterone of 626 patients. All where folowed up for a maximun period of 5 years being made an annul DEXA. Results: Lumbar bone L 1 -L 4.

40|$|Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{has been}} an {{important}} nosocomial pathogen worldwide for more than four decades. Community-acquired MRSA infections, generally occurring in previously healthy persons without <b>recognizable</b> <b>risk</b> factors for health care setting-related MRSA, are emerging as serious clinical and public health concerns. The most frequent of these community-based infections include skin and soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonias. A majority of causative community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are associated with genes that encode the virulence factor, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin. Aims & Objectives: To describe six cases of CA-MRSA pneumonia recently admitted to our community hospital in Florida, and discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of these expanding infections. Methods/Study Design: The medical records of six patients with radiographically-confirmed pneumonia and positive sputum cultures for MRSA at the time of hospitalization at the Lawnwood Regional Medical Center and Heart Institute, Fort Pierce, Florida, from December 2006 through January 2007, were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were seen by one of the authors (DO), an infectious diseases consultant. Lawnwood Regional Medical Center is a 341 -bed, acute care institution and regional referral center for four counties of Treasure Coast, FL. The hospital institution review board gave permission for this study. Results/Findings: Six patients (5 men, 1 woman) with CA-MRSA pneumonia were identified. The mean patient age was 57 years (range, 32 - 79 years). Three patients had no history of previous hospital admission, while two patients had been last hospitalized two years prior to the study admission. Three elderly patients had known co-morbidities predisposing to pneumonia including carcinoma of the lung (2 patients), and cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, COPD, and cardiomyopathy (1 patient each). Sputum samples were collected at the time of admission and all grew MRSA. Two isolates were resistant only to oxacillin, while four were also resistant to levofloxacin (3 isolates), erythromycin (2 isolates), ciprofloxacin (1 isolate), and/or clindamycin (1 isolate). One patient had concurrent Pseudomonas bacteremia, and another had Pseudomonas isolated from sputum culture in addition to MRSA. All patients had abnormal chest radiographs; three had focal unilateral pneumonia, two had bilateral pneumonia, and one had a lung abscess. The latter patient also had evidence of metastatic infection with sternoclavicular osteomyelitis. Three patients required ventilatory support; two of these subjects died and one was discharged to hospice care. None of the six patients had any epidemiologic connection to one another. Conclusion: CA-MRSA is becoming an increasingly important cause of community-acquired pneumonia {{in many parts of the}} world, and in these regions empiric antibiotic treatment guidelines should be reconsidered...|$|E
