40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} the design process, implementation and experimental verification of an SMS based Flood Monitoring and Early Warning system. With {{tools such as}} credit top-up and storing contact numbers will be done via SMS. Updates on {{the height of the}} water level would be texted upon users’ request. The system provides timely information and alerts at-risk or threatened populace and <b>relevant</b> <b>authorities</b> by <b>means</b> of SMS when the level of water surpasses the user defined threshold value. The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) module is used for sending the mobile text messages while the Arduino Uno microprocessor is used to read in the input from the pressure sensor and then calculate the height of water. This simple yet effective warning system is deemed {{to be one of the}} fastest and cost effective method of alerting the <b>relevant</b> <b>authorities</b> and the vulnerable residence...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} the design process, implementation and experimental verification of a Flood Level Monitoring system. The main {{objective of the}} proposed system {{is to be able}} to read the water level at every second, display it to the supervisor and alert the affected populace and <b>relevant</b> <b>authorities</b> by <b>means</b> of an alarm and short message system (SMS) when the level of water surpasses a user defined threshold. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network has been used for sending the mobile messages. Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) microprocessor is used to read in the input from the sensor and then display the result. The measuring system is based upon the theory of pressure being applied to liquids. Furthermore, the collated data is useful to the meteorologist for investigating and monitoring the cause of flooding with respect to time and weather patterns. This warning system is deemed to be a faster method of alerting the <b>relevant</b> <b>authorities</b> and the vulnerable residence...|$|R
