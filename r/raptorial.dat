5|$|Because of {{the similar}} <b>raptorial</b> forelegs, mantidflies may be {{confused}} with mantises. This similarity {{is an example of}} convergent evolution; mantidflies do not have the leathery forewings of mantises.|$|E
5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to ground hornbills or some storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole. Two major {{exceptions to this}} are Hatzegopteryx, which was a robustly built <b>raptorial</b> predator of relatively large prey, including medium-sized dinosaurs; and Alanqa, {{which may have been}} a specialist molluscivore.|$|E
5|$|Most mantises chase tempting prey if it strays close enough, {{and will}} go further {{when they are}} {{especially}} hungry. Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked <b>raptorial</b> forelegs. Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey, much as tiger beetles do.|$|E

50|$|Beyond this {{there is}} a lack of {{knowledge}} about even basic thylacocephalan anatomy, including the number of posterior segments, origin of the <b>raptorials,</b> number of cephalic appendages, shape and attachment of gills, character of mouth, stomach and gut. This results from the class's all-encompassing carapace, which prevents the study of their internal anatomy in fossils.|$|R
40|$|Zooplankton is {{studied in}} the ancient, tectonic, oligomictic and {{oligotrophic}} Lake Ohrid (Macedonia, South Eastern Europe). The main {{aim of this study}} was to assess the seasonal and spatial patterns of the zooplankton functional feeding guilds in relation to the environmental conditions. Metalimnion of the lake was detected as the most productive environment, where biomass of the phytoplankton and abundance of the zooplankton reached their maxima. Pelagial zooplankton of low abundance (25 ± 22 ind. L− 1) consisted of 16 species including two endemic copepods, Arctodiaptomus steindachneri (Richard, 1897) and Cyclops ochridanus (Kiefer, 1932). Copepods obtained remarkable share (60 %) in the zooplankton assemblage. Microphagous zooplankton was mainly comprised of the most abundant rotifer Kellicottia longispina (Kellicott, 1879) in summer, and copepod nauplii during the spring Eudiaptomus gracilis (Sars, 1862) and C. ochridanus, and autumn C. ochridanus. Due to their requirements for the bacterio-detritus suspension, this microphagous zooplankton occupied aphotic hypolimnion during the entire study period. <b>Raptorials</b> were typically represented by copepodites and adult copepods in the metalimnion, and were significantly and positively affected by temperature (r = 0. 417, p = 0. 001), dissolved oxygen (r = 0. 463, p = 0. 0001) and, particularly, phytoplankton biomass (r = 0. 708, p < 0. 00001). This is the first study in which the link between the lower and higher trophic levels is investigated in Lake Ohrid...|$|R
5|$|From the Permian, {{numerous}} stem group {{representatives of}} mayflies are known, {{which are often}} lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including Protereisma permianum in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, {{even though they had}} very peculiar adaptations such as <b>raptorial</b> forelegs.|$|E
5|$|In most media appearances, pterosaurs {{are most}} often {{depicted}} as piscivores, a behaviour only a few groups actually had in reality. They are also often shown as aerial predators similar to birds of prey, grasping human victims with their taloned feet. No pterosaur species known so far possesses prehensile feet; all known pterosaurs have flat, plantigrade feet with no opposable toes, often poorly muscled and, {{in the case of}} pteranodontians, generally proportionally small. However, some pterosaurs might have had <b>raptorial</b> tendencies; Thalassodromeus possesses powerful jaws akin to those of phorusrhacids, and Hatzegopteryxs short neck and more powerful jaws have been interpreted as a speciation on larger prey.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), {{which are all}} within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other insects with <b>raptorial</b> forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile robins {{and eggs}} are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds, such as blue jays, Steller's jay, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. Adults are {{primarily}} taken by Accipiter hawks, cats, dogs, and larger snakes (especially rat snakes). They {{may be taken}} by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid, from the smallest, the sharp-shinned hawk, {{to one of the}} two largest, the golden eagle, most every North American falcon from the smallest, the American kestrel, to the largest, the gyrfalcon, and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls. Overall, 28 <b>raptorial</b> bird species are known to hunt robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight. However, when feeding in flocks, the American robin is able to remain vigilant and watch other flock members for reactions to predators.|$|E
5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played the role of an apex predator in the Haţeg Island ecosystem. The robust anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the jabiru) are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up to the size of a human), including hatchling or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, has similarly been suggested to be <b>raptorial.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied <b>raptorial</b> birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E
5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many mantis species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem {{larger and more}} threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their <b>raptorial</b> legs.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the <b>raptorial</b> legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E
5|$|Owing to its size, gregariousness and its {{defensive}} abilities, {{the common}} raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs include owls, martens, and sometimes eagles. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young {{and are usually}} successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by large birds of prey. Their attackers in America have reportedly included great horned owls, northern goshawks, bald eagles, golden eagles and red-tailed hawks, {{it is possible that}} the two hawks only have attacked young ravens, as had a peregrine falcon who in one instance swooped at a newly fledged raven but was successfully chased off by the parent ravens. In Eurasia, their reported predators include, in addition to golden eagles, Eurasian eagle-owls, white-tailed eagles, Steller's sea-eagles, eastern imperial eagles and gyrfalcons. Because they are potentially hazardous prey for <b>raptorial</b> birds, raptors must usually take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens. More rarely still, large mammalian predators such as lynxes, coyotes and cougars have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce. Ravens are highly wary around novel carrion sites and, in North America, have been recorded waiting for the presence of American crows and blue jays before approaching to eat.|$|E
25|$|The scapulocoracoid, a bone {{that makes}} up the {{pectoral}} girdle, is large and broad. While abelisaurids have arms that are extremely reduced in size, Masiakasaurus and other noasaurids had longer forelimbs. The humerus is slender and {{the bones of the}} hand are relatively short. The related genus Noasaurus has a <b>raptorial</b> ungual which was originally interpreted as a sickle-like claw on the foot, but has more recently been considered a claw of the hand. The penultimate phalanx, a finger bone that immediately precedes the <b>raptorial</b> ungual in Noasaurus, is also known in Masiakasaurus and has a similar appearance. The enlarged ungual, however, is unknown in Masiakasaurus. The hand bore three large fingers with stout - but not particularly sharp - claws, and a highly reduced fourth finger.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{potential}} danger to themselves and their offspring, almost every other type of <b>raptorial</b> bird readily mobs golden eagles. Gyrfalcons, skuas, and Buteos like rough-legged buzzards, which are normally fierce competitors with each other, have worked together to group-mob golden eagles that have passed their adjacent nesting areas. Occasionally smaller raptors, especially large falcons, will drive eagles to the ground. The eagle typically ignores attacks from smaller species or at least leaves their home ranges, but will occasionally roll and extend talons toward chasing individual often without displaying active predatory behavior. If physical contact occurs, it sometimes ends in injury, death and/or consumption of the attacking species. Remarkably, the nest defense by golden eagles themselves is often rather passive towards other <b>raptorial</b> birds, perhaps since other species may fear predation on themselves if they approach a golden eagle territory. There are exceptions to this, however, when particularly bold, large <b>raptorial</b> birds seemingly range too far into a pair's home range. One pair of golden eagles killed but did not eat three great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), implying that they were killed in nest defense and not in predation. In {{one of the few}} cases of a golden eagle killing but not eating another large raptor, an adult golden eagle was observed killing a ferruginous hawk which apparently came too close to its nest.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{have had}} {{millions}} of years to evolve a variety of mechanical defenses. Perhaps the most obvious is the cuticle. Although its main role lies in support and muscle attachment, when extensively hardened by the cross-linking of proteins and chitin, or sclerotized, the cuticle acts as a first line of defense. Additional physical defenses include modified mandibles, horns, and spines on the tibia and femur. When these spines take on a main predatory role, they are termed <b>raptorial.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to its slow flying speeds, {{this species}} makes easy prey for hawks and owls when flying in open areas. Virtually all the <b>raptorial</b> birds {{sympatric}} in distribution {{with the blue}} jay may prey upon it, especially swift bird-hunting specialists such as the Accipiter hawks. Diverse predators may prey on jay eggs and young up to their fledging stage, including tree squirrels, snakes, cats, crows, raccoons, opossums, other jays and possibly {{many of the same}} birds of prey who attack adults.|$|E
25|$|Scops owls hunt from perches in semi-open landscapes. They prefer areas {{which contain}} old trees with hollows; these {{are home to}} their prey which {{includes}} insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice and other small birds. The owls will also eat earthworms, amphibians and aquatic invertebrates. Scops owls have {{a good sense of}} hearing which helps them locate their prey in any habitat. They also possess well-developed <b>raptorial</b> claws and a curved bill, both of which are used for tearing their prey into pieces small enough to swallow easily.|$|E
25|$|Screech owls hunt from perches in semi-open landscapes. They prefer areas {{which contain}} old trees with hollows; these {{are home to}} their prey which {{includes}} insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice and other small birds. Screech-owls have {{a good sense of}} hearing which helps them locate their prey in any habitat. They also possess well-developed <b>raptorial</b> claws and a curved bill, both of which are used for tearing their prey into pieces small enough to swallow easily. They usually carry their prey back to their nests, presumably to guard against the chance of losing their meal to a larger raptor.|$|E
25|$|While {{adults have}} few predators, baby {{saltwater}} crocodiles may {{fall prey to}} monitor lizards (occasionally, but not commonly, the numerous goanna in Australia, and the Asian water monitor (Varanus salvator) further north), predatory fish (especially the barramundi (Lates calcarifer)), wild boars, rats, various aquatic and <b>raptorial</b> birds (e.g. black-necked storks (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) and white-bellied sea eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster)), pythons, larger crocodiles, and many other predators. Pigs and cattle also occasionally inadvertently trample eggs and nests on occasion and degrade habitat quality where found in numbers. Juveniles may also fall prey to tigers and leopards (Panthera pardus) {{in certain parts of}} their range, although encounters between these predators are rare, and cats are likely to avoid areas with saltwater crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to other}} owls, the screech owl females {{are larger than}} the males of their species. They have a compact size and shape. The screech owls are small and agile. They are about 7 to 10 inches tall and have a {{wingspan}} of about 18 to 24 inches. They have prominent, wide-set feather tufts with bright yellow/green eyes. They have different brownish hues with whitish, patterned underside. This coloration helps them get camouflage against the tree bark. They have well-developed <b>raptorial</b> claws and curved bill. They use them {{as a tool to}} tear their prey into pieces that are small enough for them to swallow. They tend to carry their prey to the nest and then eat it.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{found in}} {{temperate}} countries like France or tropical ones like Ivory Coast, aquatic bugs exhibit {{the same way}} of life, preying, according to their size, on mollusks, snails, young fish, and the adults and larvae of other insects that they capture with their <b>raptorial</b> front legs and bite with their rostrum. These insects can inflict painful bites on humans as well. In the Ivory Coast, where Buruli ulcer is endemic, the water bugs are present in swamps and rivers, where human activities such as farming, fishing, and bathing take place. Present findings describing the experimental transmission of M. ulcerans from water bugs to mice are in good agreement {{with the possibility of}} this mode of transmission to humans by bites.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{more than}} half of all nests manage to hatch at least one young, and around three-quarters of all eggs laid hatch, {{suggesting}} that if eggs are lost before hatching, it usually is the entire clutch. Half to three-quarters of the hatched young successfully fledge under most circumstances. They will become sexually mature in their first spring and often attempt to breed right away. On average, great grey shrikes get a chance at four breeding attempts during their life, with most birds in the wild getting eaten by a bird of prey or carnivorous mammal or dying of other causes before the end of their fifth winter. <b>Raptorial</b> birds are the main threat to shrikes after fledging, with regular predators including species as small as little owls (which are close to the same size as the shrike). The maximum documented lifespan, however, is 12 years.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part the femur and tibia are the longest leg {{segments}} but variations in the lengths and robustness of each segment relate to their functions. For example, gressorial and cursorial, or walking and running type insects respectively, usually have well-developed femora and tibiae on all legs, whereas jumping (saltatorial) insects such as grasshoppers have disproportionately developed metafemora and metatibiae. In aquatic beetles (Coleoptera) and bugs (Hemiptera), the tibiae and/or tarsi of one or more pairs of legs usually are modified for swimming (natatorial) with fringes of long, slender hairs. Many ground-dwelling insects, such as mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae), nymphal cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae), and scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae), have the tibiae of the forelegs (protibiae) enlarged and modified for digging (fossorial), whereas the forelegs of some predatory insects, such as mantispid lacewings (Neuroptera) and mantids (Mantodea), are specialized for seizing prey, or <b>raptorial.</b> The tibia and basal tarsomere of each hindleg of honey bees are modified for the collection and carriage of pollen.|$|E
25|$|Golden eagles {{are fairly}} long-living birds in natural conditions. The {{survival}} rate of <b>raptorial</b> birds tends to increase with larger body size, with a 30–50% annual loss of population rate in small falcons/accipiters, a 15–25% loss of population rate in medium-sized hawks (e.g., Buteos or kites) and a 5% or less rate of loss in eagles and vultures. The oldest known wild golden eagle was a bird banded in Sweden which was recovered 32 years later. The longest-lived known wild golden eagle in North America was 23 years and 10 months. The long-lived known captive golden eagle, a specimen in Europe, survived to 46 years of age. The estimated adult annual survival rate on the Isle of Skye in Scotland is around 97.5%. When this extrapolated into an estimated lifespan {{this results in}} 39 and half years as the average for adult golden eagles in this area, which is probably far too high an estimate. Survival rates are usually much lower in juvenile eagles than in adult eagles. In the western Rocky Mountains, 50% of golden eagles banded in the nest died {{by the time they}} were 2 and a half years and an estimated 75% died {{by the time they were}} 5 years old. Near a wind turbine facility in west-central California, estimated survival rates, based on conventional telemetry of 257 individuals, were 84% for first-year eagles, 79% for 1- to 3-year-olds and adult floaters and 91% for breeders; with no difference in survival rates between sexes. Survival rates may be lower for migrating populations of golden eagles. A 19–34% survival rate was estimated for juvenile eagles from Denali National Park in their first 11 months. The average life expectancy of golden eagles in Germany is 13 years, extrapolated from a reported mere 92.5% survival rate.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>raptorial</b> birds {{can become}} regular prey, such as all other hawks which are {{recorded}} especially in North America at locations such as Oregon (8.8% of prey remains) and Arizona. Owls may be hunted regularly {{across the entire}} range (maximum being 2.9% in Oregon) and, more rarely, so may the falcons. Rock pigeons may be hunted regularly {{in some parts of}} the golden eagle's range (other pigeons and doves have been recorded as prey but are typically rare in the diet). The common feral pigeon was the second most prevalent prey species in Sierra Espuña Regional Park in Spain, making up 18.8% of a sampling of 99 from 5 nests. The species was also prevalent in Slovakia, making up 7.4% of remains at nests there. Non-corvid passerines are usually ignored as prey but large thrushes such as song thrush (Turdus philomelos), mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus) and common blackbird (Turdus merula), are semi-regularly recorded prey in Europe. This family is most prevalent in Sicily, making up 8.1% of a sampling of 74 from 10 nests there, 7.7% in Central Spain and 7.2% in the French Alps. The smallest-bodied bird family recorded as semi-regular prey are pipits. Meadow pipits (Anthus pratensis) are the most represented species of small birds and are taken mainly in Scotland, making up to 3.5% of prey in the Inner Hebrides. Other bird families rarely recorded as golden eagle prey (making up less than 1% of prey in all studied nests) include starlings (maximum being 4.8% in the French Alps, negligible elsewhere), larks (maximum is 2.3% in the West-Central Highlands of Scotland), emberizid sparrows (up to 1.7% in central Alaska), woodpeckers (up to 1.5% in Alberta), cuckoos, bustards, icterids, shrikes, skuas, and finches.|$|E
25|$|Size readily distinguishes {{this species}} from most other raptors {{when it is}} seen well. Most other raptors are {{considerably}} smaller. Buteo hawks, which are perhaps most similar to the golden eagle in structure among the species outside of the “booted eagle” group, are often amongst the larger very common raptors. However, a mid-sized Buteo is dwarfed by a golden eagle, as an adult female eagle has a wingspan of about twice the width and weighs around five times more. Buteos are also usually distinctly paler below, although some species occur in “dark morphs” which can be even darker than a golden eagle. Only some Old World vultures and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) (among the other <b>raptorial</b> birds this eagle co-exists with) are distinctly larger than the golden eagle, with longer, broader wings, typically held more evenly in a slower, less forceful flight and often have dramatically different color patterns. The turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) is a potential confusion species in North America from a great distance, {{as it is a}} large species that (like the golden eagle) often flies with a pronounced dihedral but is easily separated by its less controlled, forceful flying style and its smaller, thinner body, much smaller head and, at closer range, its slaty black-brown color and silvery wing secondaries. Compared to Haliaeetus eagles, the golden eagle has wings that are only somewhat more slender but are more hawk-like and lack the flat, plank-like wing positioning seen in the other genus. Large northern Haliaeetus usually have a larger bill and larger head which more distinctly protrudes than that of a golden eagle’s in flight. The tail of the golden eagle is longer on average than those of Haliaeetus eagles, appearing to be two or three times the length of the head in soaring flight as opposed to the other eagles where the head is often more than twice the length of the tail. Confusion is most likely between juvenile Haliaeetus and golden eagles since the adult golden has a more solidly golden-brown coloration and all Haliaeetus eagles have obvious distinctive plumages as adults. Haliaeetus eagles are often heavily streaked in their juvenile phase. Juvenile golden eagles can show large patches of white to the wings and tail that are quite different than the random, sometimes large and splotchy-looking distribution of white typical of juvenile Haliaeetus.|$|E
25|$|Golden eagles, being {{habitual}} scavengers at carrion, {{come into}} conflict with scavenging birds as well. They may encounter corvids at carrion sites and the large passerines are often highly cautious, either feeding {{some distance from the}} eagle or waiting until the eagle is done eating, lest they be predaceously grabbed. Occasionally, however, corvids may behave more boldly around golden eagles. In one case, a group of three black-billed magpies were observed to rob a golden eagle of its prey. Golden eagles also usually dominate both New World and Old World vultures. Smaller species like black vulture (Coragyps atratus) in North America and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in Eurasia are known to be occasionally hunted by golden eagles. Besides the Steller's sea eagle, the larger species of Old World vulture and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) are the only noticeably larger <b>raptorial</b> birds that a golden eagle may encounter. The relationship between these large vultures and golden eagles can be highly contentious, with most sources favoring victory for the eagle due to its more aggressive disposition, much stronger feet and sharp talons. In one case, a colony of griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) was exceptionally able to displace a pair golden eagles from a cliff where they were trying nest so they could nest there themselves. On the other hand, a 5-year-old griffon vulture reintroduced into the wild in Bulgaria was thought to have been killed by a golden eagle. The golden eagle is a potential predator of the lammergeier which is often attracted to much the same habitat and prey as the eagle but often feeds largely on bone marrow from carcasses. It has been observed that both golden eagles and lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. In the Southwestern United States, several conflicts between huge California condors and golden eagles have been observed. At carrion, victory during conflicts can go either way apparently. Recent observation have suggested that the critically endangered condors do not seem to actively defend their nesting territories from golden eagles but have been recorded gaining incidental protection from prairie falcons and common ravens, which both aggressively displaced the eagles from their own adjacent territories. The golden eagle is considered an occasional predator of California condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be {{little in the way of}} eyewitness accounts to confirm this. It is possible that (as in the Bulgarian griffon vultures) the California condors have lost their natural cautiousness around eagles due to having been reintroduced from captivity.|$|E

500|$|During an American Museum of Natural History {{expedition}} to the Outer Mongolian Gobi Desert, on 11 August 1923 Peter Kaisen recovered the first Velociraptor fossil known to science: a crushed but complete skull, associated {{with one of the}} <b>raptorial</b> second toe claws (AMNH 6515).
