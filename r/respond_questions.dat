In June 2011 the magazine Interviú published that the train driver, {{who died in the}} accident and who received all the blame, was ill with epilepsy, which disqualified him for his work.

40|$|The Test of Written English (TWE), {{administered}} {{with certain}} Jesignated examinations of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), {{consists of a}} single essay prompt to which examinees have 30 minutes to <b>respond.</b> <b>Questions</b> have been raised about the comparability of different TWE prompts. This {{study was designed to}} elicit essays for prompts that differed both in subject matter (topic) and in level of explicitness with which the essay task was presented (topic type). Eight different prompts were spiraled worldwide at the October 1989 TOEFL administration, with each prompt eliciting approximately 10, 000 essays. Results of the analyses indicated that there were small differences among the prompts. The most notable differences were obtained among the scores for topics using-he most explicit comparison. Across all the prompts, the chart-graph topic with the explicit comparison statement produced the highest mean scores. Because it was the first study to focus on the comparability of prompts in a major testing program, the authors had difficulty making definitive statements about the meaningfulness of the obtained differences. Such differences may warrant further consideration by the TOEFL program. Two appendixes present prompts and scoring guidelines. Fifteen tables present analysis results. (Contains 17 references.)

40|$|The report {{describes}} the assumptions, equations {{and a few}} examples of preliminary applications of a global spatial steady-state box model entitled Multimedia Assessment of Pollutant Pathways in the Environment (MAPPE-Global). The model grounds on the concept of already developed European version of MAPPE chemical fate model. MAPPE-Global computes the removal rates of a substance with given physical-chemical properties in an evaluative environment for the Globe with a resolution of 1 x 1 degree considering atmosphere, land (natural and agriculture soils, forests, impervious surfaces, frozen territories), surface water (including lakes, inland wetlands and reservoirs) and oceans and seas. MAPPE-Global is able to consider chemical emissions in {{one or more of the}} environmental compartments and estimates chemical concentrations and fluxes accounting chemical partitioning (gas, liquid or solid), degradation, advective and diffusive transport. At this stage, MAPPE Global does not explicitly compute chemical transport in space, but only the fate of a substance at each location in space. However, the model estimates for each grid cell the mass fluxes of chemical that are available for transport inside or outside of the cell, in addition to concentrations from local emissions. Thus, MAPPE Global is developed specifically to <b>respond</b> <b>questions</b> as: •	How will a chemical spread across different media in the different climatic and landscape settings? •	How important is the variability of environmental processes in determining the fate of chemicals across the globe? In addition, the model enables estimating, for virtually any location in the world, representative parameters of the environmental removal rates that determine the fate of a contaminant. These rates may be used to feed a zero-dimensional time-dependent model that allows computing the main receptors of the chemical emissions. Besides, in order to evaluate the performance of the MAPPE-Global model a comparison with established models, such as Impact World and USEtox was made by crosschecking of the intermedia removal rate coefficients. Finally, MAPPE-Global was used to quantify for a set of 34 representative pollutants at global scale the range of variability of chemical removal rates for the different environmental compartments and to identify the fate patterns of flyers, swimmers, soil-bound and multimedia chemical substances.

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the ability of {{mathematical}} communication at students with a high, medium, and low IQ in grade XI MIA of State Senior High School 6 Surakarta in answering math questions. The subjects were 6 students that two students with high IQ, 2 students with medium IQ, and 2 students with low IQ. Techniques of data collection used documents and archives, a written test and an interview. Data analysis techniques used are data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion. The results of research showed that: (1) students with high IQ: in the mathematical written communication skills, {{students were able to}} create situations and proper solutions using the diagram, the students were also able to translate the ideas contained in the diagram with their own words in the form of detailed and structured information, and able to express ideas and opinions with good reason. In the mathematical verbal communication skills, the students were able to provide some information and the situation in the form of their own language, students were also able to express the right opinions to answer and <b>respond</b> <b>questions</b> {{in the form of a}} convincing argument and be able to make correct conclusions with emphatic pronunciation; (2) students with medium IQ: in the mathematical written communication skills, students were able to create situations and proper solutions to depict diagrams and adding several full details, students were also able to translate the ideas contained in the diagram with their own words which arranged in structured by providing some information, ideas and information, but students gave a brief opinion in giving reasons about diagram. In the mathematical verbal communication skills, the students were able to provide some information and situation into their own language forms in detail, complete, and structured, students were also able to give an opinion clearly and convincingly, in addition the student also gave some suggestions, and able to respond to questions in the form convincing argument and students were able to make the right conclusions but short explicitly; (3) students with medium IQ: in the mathematical written communication skills, students were able to create situations and appropriate solutions to describe the diagram and added some description, students were also able to translate the information contained in the diagram with their own sentences with ideas and information relating to the matter. In the mathematical verbal communication skills, students were able to give some brief information in the form of their own language, students were able to express opinions and suggestions but there is still less precise answer, the student was not able to properly respond to questions when giving an answer, but the students were able to make some conclusions short with a convincing argument...|$|E
