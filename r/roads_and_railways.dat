5|$|In Mexico, Isis {{destroyed}} over 700houses {{and killed}} 14people; this is {{primarily due to}} its heavy rainfall which peaked at over 20inches (500mm) in southern Baja California Sur. The rainfall caused widespread damage to <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways,</b> stranding thousands of people. Moisture from the remnants of Isis extended into the southwestern United States, resulting in light rainfall, dozens of traffic accidents, and power outages to thousands of residents in San Diego County, California.|$|E
5|$|This {{history of}} Ditton has, in part, {{been shaped by}} the {{availability}} of natural resources in the area, especially water, soil and rocks. Its position in relation to transport links with London, notably the main <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways</b> which tend towards the capital city, has {{also contributed to the}} village's development. Nowadays the parish is characterised by industrial units to the north, the middle by residential estates, and the south by fields and woodland.|$|E

Although it was Grade II listed - as a rare example of a surviving 19th-century wooden <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>railway</b> viaduct, the structure was demolished in 2014 during a joint project between the Welsh government and Network Rail to upgrade the route.|$|R

5|$|After {{entering}} the Caribbean Sea, the hurricane maintained a northwest trajectory. It passed south of Jamaica on July 1, where heavy rainfall flooded <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways.</b> The hurricane crossed western Cuba on July 3. High winds {{on the island}} destroyed hundreds of houses, and the storm's rainfall damaged the tobacco crop. Upon {{entering the}} Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane turned {{to the west and}} attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) on July 5. It struck northeastern Mexico on July 8 and quickly dissipated. Upon its final landfall, the storm caused heavy damage in Mexico, and in southern Texas the storm ended a prolonged drought.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 21January 1947, the UK {{experienced}} several cold spells {{that brought}} large drifts of snow to the country, blocking <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways,</b> which caused problems transporting coal {{to the electric}} power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to 19 hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, {{on top of the}} low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears of a food shortage as supplies were cut off and vegetables were frozen into the ground.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 36 {{hours of the}} Battle of Megiddo, between 04:30 on 19 September and 17:00 on 20 September, the German and Ottoman front line had been cut by {{infantry}} of the EEF's XXI Corps. This allowed the cavalry of the Desert Mounted Corps {{to pass through the}} gap and begin their ride towards their objectives at Afulah, Nazareth, and Beisan. The two Ottoman armies were left without effective communications, and so could not organize any combined action against the continuing onslaught by the British Empire infantry in the Judean Hills. The Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies were forced to withdraw northwards along the main <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways</b> from Tulkarm and Nablus, which converged to run through the Dothan Pass to Jenin on the Esdrealon Plain. There, retreating columns from these two Ottoman armies would be captured during the evening of 20 September by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, who already occupied the town.|$|E

5|$|High rains {{in eastern}} Texas, totaling over , flooded roads in Shelby and Panola {{counties}}; {{damage in the}} two counties collectively totaled $1.5 million. Storm-related flooding washed out a bridge in Henderson and portions of the Santa Fe Railway line between Carthage and Longview. Five people required rescue after being trapped in a fast-moving river. The rains in the region were considered the heaviest in 17 years, and leaving severe damage to corn, cotton, and watermelon crops. Similarly, the floods damaged cotton and other crops in northern Louisiana, totaling several million dollars in losses. The rains caused many streams to exceed their banks, including one creek near Converse that flooded <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways.</b> The floods forced families to evacuate in low-lying areas of northern Louisiana. The rainfall in Shreveport caused the worst floods related to a tropical cyclone on record. While the storm was dropping heavy rainfall, it produced thunderstorms and gusty winds along the Texas and Louisiana coastlines. A severe thunderstorm related to the storm damaged roofs and windows in Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|In North America, A. altissima {{is present}} from Massachusetts in the east, west to {{southern}} Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and {{east to the}} north of Florida. On the west coast it is found from New Mexico west to California and north to Washington. In the east of its range it grows most extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a planted street tree. It also grows along <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways.</b> For example, a 2003 study in North Carolina found the tree of heaven was present on 1.7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its range at the rate of 4.76% counties per year. Similarly, another study conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that the tree of heaven is thriving along approximately 30% of the state's interstate highway system length or mileage. It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and competes with native plants. In western North America it is most common in mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{islands that}} came to {{constitute}} Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were {{under the control of}} successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways,</b> the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.|$|E

5|$|Under an 1898 {{agreement}} between the Estates Company and the Ship Canal Company, the latter committed to carry freight on their dock railway between the docks and the park and {{to the construction of}} a permanent connection between the two railway networks. The West Manchester Light Railway Company was set up the following year to take over the operations of the tramway and to lay additional track. In 1904 responsibility for all of the parks <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>railways</b> passed to the Trafford Park Company, {{as a result of the}} Trafford Park Act of that year. The railway network could subsequently be extended as required, without the need to seek additional permissions from Parliament. The network was also connected to the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway near Cornbrook. At its peak, the estate's railway network covered 26route miles (42km), handling about 2.5 million tons of cargo in 1940. Like the rest of the park, it fell into decline during the 1960s, exacerbated by the increasing use of road transport, and it was closed in 1998.|$|E
