25|$|Aid has advantages. Mostly {{short-term}} or {{emergency aid}} {{help people in}} LEDCs to survive a natural (earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption etc.) or human (civil war etc.) disaster. Aid helps make the <b>recipient</b> <b>country</b> (the country that receives aid) get more developed.|$|E
25|$|However, aid {{also has}} disadvantages. Often aid {{does not even}} reach the poorest people. Often money gained from aid is used up to make {{infrastructures}} (bridges, roads etc.), which only the rich can use. Also, the <b>recipient</b> <b>country</b> becomes more dependent on aid from a donor country (the country giving aid).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} optimal {{allocation}} of a pre-determined amount of international transfer between two <b>recipient</b> <b>countries.</b> The donor country suffers from cross border pollution resulting from production activities in the <b>recipient</b> <b>countries.</b> Pollution abatement in the <b>recipient</b> <b>countries</b> is undertaken by private producers and public sector. It is shown that {{the country with the}} higher fraction of the international transfer allocated in public abatement activities and with the lower emission tax, would receive a higher share of the aid when the donor country maximizes its own welfare in allocating aid. Also, we examine how competition for aid affects the optimal environmental policies of the <b>recipient</b> <b>countries.</b> It is shown that competition for aid, when it gives the right incentives, is an efficiency tool to induce the <b>recipient</b> <b>countries</b> to implement stricter environmental policies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal allocation by a donor country {{of a given}} amount of foreign aid between two <b>recipient</b> <b>countries.</b> It is shown that, ceteris paribus, a country following a more restrictive trade policy would receive a smaller share of the aid if the donor country maximises its own welfare. If, on the other hand, the donor country maximises {{the sum of the}} welfare of the two <b>recipient</b> <b>countries,</b> the result is just the opposite. We also analyse the situation where the <b>recipient</b> <b>countries</b> compete with each other for aid taking into account the behaviour of the donor. It is shown that this competition tend to lower the level of optimal tariffs in the <b>recipient</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

25|$|Aid {{may serve}} {{one or more}} functions: it may be given as a signal of {{diplomatic}} approval, or to strengthen a military ally, to reward a government for behaviour desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to provide infrastructure needed by the donor for resource extraction from the <b>recipient</b> <b>country,</b> or to gain other kinds of commercial access. Humanitarian and altruistic purposes are at least {{partly responsible for the}} giving of aid.|$|E
25|$|Aid {{can also}} be {{classified}} according to the terms agreed upon by the donor and receiving countries. In this classification, aid can be a gift, a grant, a low or no interest loan, {{or a combination of}} these. The terms of foreign aid are oftentimes influenced by the motives of the giver: a sign of diplomatic approval, to reward a government for behaviour desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to enhance infrastructure needed by the donor for the extraction of resources from the <b>recipient</b> <b>country,</b> or to gain other kinds of commercial access.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} whether democratic aid flows, which are directed towards {{the democratization of}} recipients by covering democracy-related programs and government and civil society activities, affect the future political regime of <b>recipient</b> <b>countries.</b> We introduce a multinomial multivariate logit model and we use 5 -year averaged data covering the period 1972 - 2004 for 59 democracy-aid <b>recipient</b> <b>countries</b> categorized into three broad classes according to the prevalent political regime. We find strong evidence that democratic aid flows are positively associated with the likelihood of observing a partly-democratic or a fully-democratic political regime in democratic-aid <b>recipient</b> <b>countries</b> and that this result is robust to the potential endogeneity of democratic assistance...|$|R

According to George H.

The question of Taiwan would be taken into the United Nations (which the ROC was still part), if these four parties could not reach into an agreement within one year.|$|E

50|$|Currently, donor {{institutions}} make {{proposals for}} aid packages to <b>recipient</b> <b>countries.</b> The <b>recipient</b> <b>countries</b> {{then make a}} plan for {{how to use the}} aid based on how much money has been given to them. Alternatively, NGO's receive funding from private sources or the government and then implement plans to address their specific issues. According to Sachs, in the view of some scholars, this system is inherently ineffective.|$|R
50|$|Many {{scholars}} have debated whether foreign aid {{can result in}} regime change, either democratizing autocracies or turning democratic states into autocracies. Some of these scholars argue that when western donors condition aid so that <b>recipient</b> <b>countries</b> have to make democratic changes that these changes then lead to economic growth.
