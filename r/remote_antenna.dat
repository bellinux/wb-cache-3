50|$|A bias tee is used {{to insert}} DC power into an AC signal to power <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> {{amplifiers}} or other devices. It is usually positioned at {{the receiving end of}} the coaxial cable to pass DC power from an external source to the coaxial cable running to powered device. A bias “T” consists of a feed inductor to deliver DC to a connector on the device side and a blocking capacitor to keep DC from passing through to the receiver. The RF signal is connected directly from one connector to the other with only the blocking capacitor in series. The internal blocking diode prevents damage to the bias “T” if reverse supply voltage is applied.|$|E

5000|$|If {{there is}} still a high SWR (multiple reflections) in the feedline beyond the ATU, any loss in the feedline is multiplied several times by the {{transmitted}} waves reflecting {{back and forth between the}} tuner and the antenna, heating the wire instead of sending out a signal. Even with a matching unit at both ends of the feedline [...] - [...] the near ATU matching the transmitter to the feedline and the remote ATU matching the feedline to the antenna [...] - [...] losses in the circuitry of the two ATUs will reduce power delivered to the antenna. Therefore, operating an antenna far from its design frequency and compensating with a transmatch between the transmitter and the feedline is not as efficient as using a resonant antenna with a matched-impedance feedline, nor as efficient as a matched feedline from the transmitter to a <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> tuner attached directly to the antenna.|$|E

We consider a high-speed backhaul network where the <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> units are transparently linked by optical fiber to a central unit. In the considered architecture we can assume {{the knowledge of the}} data and channel state information of all users, at the central unit. The precoder design is divided in two phases: first a solution based on minimization of bit-error-rate is computed by assuming that all <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> units can jointly pool their power, i. e., a total power constraint is imposed instead of a per <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> unit power constraint; the second phase consists in scaling the obtained transmit signal by a factor to satisfy the individual per <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> unit power constraint. Numerical results show that the algorithm achieves significant gains over the linear zero-forcing and minimum mean square error based approaches, with a slight increase in complexity, and that its performance is close to the optimum.

40|$|A {{distributed}} antenna system, where the antennas of a base station are spatially {{distributed throughout the}} cell, can achieve better throughput at the cell edge than a centralized antenna system. On the other hand, the peak throughput degrades in general because each <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> unit has only a few antennas. To achieve both high peak and cell-edge throughputs, we need to increase {{the total number of}} antennas. However, this is not easy due to the pilot resource limitation when we use frequency division duplexing. In this paper, we propose using more antennas than pilot resources. The number mismatch between antennas and signals is solved by using a connection matrix. Here, we test two types of connection matrix: signal-distributing and signal-switching. Simulation results show that the sum throughput is improved by increasing the number of antenna elements per <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> unit under a constraint on the same number of pilot resources...|$|E

30|$|In {{the next}} {{generation}} of wireless communication systems [12], it is expected {{that a large number of}} users with different configurations and requirements are connected to the network. Therefore, it is necessary to design heterogeneous networks capable of interconnecting the different user types with each other [13]. The received signals from this large number of connected devices such as metering equipment, sensors, environmental monitoring devices, health care gadgets, security management products, smart grid components, smart phones, and tablets need to be separated in order to detect the transmitted information according to their different data requirements. In this context, distributed antenna systems (DAS) with massive MIMO are a promising alternative for the 5 G cellular architecture [14], where the BS will be equipped with a large number of antennas and some <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays or radio heads will be distributed around the cell and connected to the BS via optical fiber. The signals associated with different <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays are processed at the BS. DAS have low path loss effects and improve the coverage and the spectral efficiency [15, 16]. The energy consumption of users is reduced and the transmission quality is improved due to the shorter distances between users and some <b>remote</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays. For this vision of 5 G wireless networks, which includes a combination of massive MIMO, heterogeneous networks, and distributed antenna systems, efficient signal processing techniques at the BS are necessary.|$|E

40|$|A low-complexity {{cooperative}} wireless and optical-fiber {{communication scheme}} is proposed for uplink communication in a Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) based multicell, multiuser system. The FFR principle is invoked {{for improving the}} cell-edge performance without reducing the throughput of the cell-center. Each cell is illuminated {{with the aid of}} six <b>Remote</b> <b>Antennas</b> (RAs), which are connected to the central base-station with the aid of realistically modelled imperfect optical-fiber links. When a Mobile Station (MS) is located at the cell-edge, the two nearest RAs can be invoked to detect and forward the user’s signal to the base-station, based on the Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) principle. Furthermore, we design a Turbo Coded (TC) 16 -level Star-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (StQAM) scheme for supporting optical-fiber-aided cooperative wireless transmission, where the receiver does not have to estimate the channel state information. Hence, a lower detection complexity can be achieved when compared to coherently detected schemes, albeit naturally, at a 3 dB power-loss.

40|$|The {{impetus for}} this feature topic was {{spurred by the}} {{technical}} trend in wireless communications: the need for high bit rates (~ 1 Gb/s) in future wireless systems. However, due to the limited transmit power, the transmission distance cannot be long if the desired transmission rate is very high.

Moreover, reception of one signal at different locations provides spatial diversity against fading. Such network architecture is called a distributed antenna system (DAS). In order to reduce the transmission distance and provide diversity gain, the distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) concept is introduced to achieve broadband wireless transmission.
