5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment,</b> and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, {{the division of labor}} increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>railroad's</b> <b>equipment</b> roster was {{significantly}} reduced over the years, as well, {{because of a}} lack of traffic and a need to conserve expenses. [...] The majority of the line's passenger and freight cars, and all but two of the locomotives, were gone by the early 1930s.|$|R
25|$|Westinghouse Air Brake Company (known {{throughout}} the 19th and 20th Century as WABCO) {{was the first}} to offer air horns specifically for use with <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment,</b> as early as the 1910s. Their model E2 was recognized by many for the deep, commanding tone it produced.|$|E
25|$|Swanson's first {{color film}} {{was one of}} very few to be shot entirely aboard actual <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment.</b> Santa Fe transported actual {{passenger}} cars from the Super Chief to the production company's studio lot for filming.

25|$|Swanson {{sought to}} develop an air horn which would mimic {{the sound of a}} classic steam whistle. Using ancient Chinese musical theory, Swanson {{produced}} the six-note model 'H6'. This was impractical for railroad use, due to its relatively large size. <b>Railroad</b> <b>equipment</b> operates over routes restricted by loading gauge, a difference of only a few inches may prohibit that equipment from operating on the line in question.|$|E

25|$|Even {{after the}} United States forces in Europe and the Pacific began to reach full {{strength}} in 1943–1944, Lend-Lease continued. Most remaining allies were largely self-sufficient in front line equipment (such as tanks and fighter aircraft) by this stage, but Lend-Lease provided a useful supplement {{in this category}} even so, and Lend-Lease logistical supplies (including motor vehicles and <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment)</b> were of enormous assistance.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, in {{cooperation}} with Oregon State Parks Trust and the Friends of Collier Memorial State Park, financed a major renovation of the museum. The project carefully restored logging machinery, <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment,</b> historic buildings, and other museum artifacts. Interpretive displays, signs, and other materials were also updated. As a result, Collier Memorial State Park has an excellent museum with a world-class collection of logging equipment and artifacts.|$|E
25|$|The B Railroad Museum is {{a museum}} exhibiting {{historic}} <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment</b> in Baltimore, Maryland, originally named the Baltimore & Ohio Transportation Museum {{when it opened}} on July 4, 1953.

25|$|The first federal safety {{legislation}} was enacted in the Progressive period. In 1893, Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act, {{the first federal}} statute to require safety equipment in the workplace (the law applied only to <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment,</b> however). In 1910, {{in response to a}} series of highly publicized and deadly mine explosions and collapses, Congress established the United States Bureau of Mines to conduct research into mine safety (although the Bureau had no authority to regulate mine safety). Backed by trade unions, many states also enacted workers' compensation laws which discouraged employers from permitting unsafe workplaces. These laws, as well as the growing power of labor unions and public anger toward poor workplace safety, led to significant reductions in worker accidents for a time.|$|E
25|$|The Niles Canyon Railway (NCRy) is a {{heritage}} railway running through Niles Canyon, between Sunol and the Niles district of Fremont in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area, in California, United States. The railway is {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places as the Niles Canyon Transcontinental Railroad Historic District. The railroad is operated and maintained by the Pacific Locomotive Association which preserves, restores and operates historic <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment.</b> The NCRy features public excursions with both steam and diesel locomotives along a well-preserved portion of the First Transcontinental Railroad. The Golden Gate Railroad Museum moved its collection from San Francisco to the NCRy in 2007 for storage and limited operations after their home at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard was shut down for redevelopment.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of the aid}} can {{be better}} {{understood}} when considering the economic distortions caused by the war. Most belligerent powers cut back severely on production of non-essentials, concentrating on producing weapons. This inevitably produced shortages of related products needed by the military {{or as part of}} the military-industrial complex. For example, the USSR was highly dependent on rail transportation, but the war practically shut down rail equipment production. Just 446 locomotives were produced during the war, with only 92 of those being built between 1942 and 1945. In total, 92.7% of the wartime production of <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment</b> by the Soviet Union was supplied under Lend-Lease, including 1,911 locomotives and 11,225 railcars which augmented the existing prewar stocks of at least 20,000 locomotives and half a million railcars.|$|E

25|$|When the Terminal's train shed {{was torn}} down in 1968, it was dismantled, not demolished. The {{structural}} steel girder sections were numbered and removed {{to the site}} of the Indiana Museum of Transport and Communication (known today as the Indiana Transportation Museum) in Forest Park, located in Noblesville, Indiana. The $10,500 cost for that portion of the project was almost entirely financed (all but $500) by a donation from Ruth Lilly, and the original goal was to eventually reassemble the shed and use it to shelter the museum's existing and future <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment</b> collection. An adjoining two-story office and waiting room was envisioned, which was to include a scaled down replica of the terminal's original waiting room. However, the plan languished due to the prohibitive projected cost of its reconstruction. The stacked girders remained untouched until the early 1980s, when they were finally hauled away as scrap.|$|E
25|$|Sellers {{then moved}} to Cincinnati with his brother Charles and {{established}} a factory for making lead pipe from hot fluid lead. He patented his invention of the machinery that was capable of doing this. This business was eventually sold out and merged into a company that was a major producer of lead pipe in the United States. Sellers then partnered with Josiah Lawrence, a Cincinnati businessman, and organized a wire manufacturing company called Globe Rolling Mills. Here he introduced machinery of his own design that was more efficient in producing lead pipe and wire. Eventually he sold {{his interest in the}} company by 1850. In 1851 he undertook the manufacture of railroad locomotives for the Panama Railway. He invented a railroad engine for climbing mountains of heavy inclined planes. Sellers was engaged in the manufacture and sale of <b>railroad</b> <b>equipment</b> for several years in the 1850s. Sellers became interested in mining operations in southern Illinois in the 1860s. He spent the remainder of his career pursuing mechanical engineering and design.|$|E
