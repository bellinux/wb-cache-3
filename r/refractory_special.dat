40|$|Abstract: It {{is known}} that the tars of heavy oils of naphthene-aromatic base with high {{concentrations}} of resin-asphaltene substances (RAS) and insufficient content of high-molecular paraffins are the most suitable raw material for production {{of a wide range}} of bituminous products in general and bituminous insulating material (BIM). Naphtha crude residues (NCR) of paraffin and high-paraffin crude oils are usually used due to limited oil production. It is notable that the production of <b>refractory</b> <b>special</b> bitumens at high-temperature oxidation of residual materials results in production of non-hydrocarbon compounds- carbenes and carboides that are insoluble in hot benzene, as well as the compounds of paraffin-naphthenic base containing in extracted oil. Considering the NCR as a thermodynamic system of phases A, B and C, it should be noted that the structure of carbon links of phases can be assumed by evaluation of molecular mobility and structural-dynamic parameters. Structural-dynamic states of NCR at different temperatures were studied using relaxometer NMR 08 BK/RS and used as raw material for oxidation.

40|$|To gauge {{consensus}} {{regarding a}} proposed definition for refractory migraine proposed by <b>Refractory</b> Headache <b>Special</b> Interest Section, and where its use {{would be most}} appropriate. Background. — Headache experts have long recognized that a subgroup of headache sufferers remains refractory to treatment. Although different groups have proposed criteria to define refractory migraine, the definition remains controversial. The <b>Refractory</b> Headache <b>Special</b> Interest Section of the American Headache Society developed a definition through a consensus process, assisted by a literature review and initial membership survey. Design. — A 12 -item questionnaire was distributed at the American Headache Society meeting in 2007 during a platform session and at the <b>Refractory</b> Headache <b>Special</b> Interest Section symposium. The same questionnaire was subsequently sent to all American Headache Society members via e-mail. A total of 151 responses from AHS members {{form the basis of}} this report. The survey instrument was designed using Survey Monkey. Frequencies and percentages of the survey were used to describe survey responses. Results. — American Headache Society members agreed that a definition for refractory migraine is needed (91 %) that it should be added to the International Classification of Headache Disorders- 2 (86 %), and that refractory forms of non-migraine headache disorders should be defined (87 %). Responders believed a refractory migraine definition would be of greatest value in selecting patients for clinical drug trials. The current refractory migraine definition requires a diagnosis of migraine, interference with function or quality of life despite modification of lifestyle factors, and adequate trials of acute and preventive medicines with established efficacy. The proposed criteria for the refractory migraine definition require failing 2 preventive medications to meet the threshold for failure. Although 42 % of respondents agreed with the working definition of refractory migraine, 43 % favored increasing the number to 3 (50 %) or 4 (26 %) preventive treatment failures. When respondents were asked if they felt that the proposed definition was appropriate to select patients for invasive procedures (patent foramen ovale repair or stimulators) only 44 % agreed. Conclusions. — There is a consensus for a need for a definition for refractory migraine and that it should be added to the International Classification of Headache Disorder- 2. There was also general agreement by the responders that refractory forms of non-migraine headache disorders should be defined...|$|R

Due to its optimal physical and mechanical properties, aluminum-copper composites have been widely applied in automobile and aerospace industries. However, making products with insufficient information on the effect of various processing conditions on ductile fracture leads to an extensive surface and edge cracking. Therefore, it is essential to study the fracture behavior of P/M aluminum-copper preforms under various processing conditions, namely, material composition, geometry, initial relative density, and friction, and hence, engineers and technicians can make an early modification of the production processes to avoid the risk of failure of material.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{investigation}} of the development of refractory materials for the fabrication of ceramic filters for the filtration of steel. Ceramic filters are used for increasing the cleanliness of steel and they must meet several strict requirements, such as the ability to remove impurities, a resistance to sudden changes in temperature, a resistance to corrosion and erosion by metal. The use of filters must not lead to an excessive reduction of the steel’s temperature, as this may lead to solidification of steel and thus to filter clogging. That is why a <b>special</b> <b>refractory</b> material has been developed with reduced thermal capacity caused by increased porosity. Tests were made in a laboratory of the Department of Metallurgy at V[B-TUO in order to simulate the industrial conditions of the filtration of steel with a focus on the evaluation of the erosion and corrosion effects and also on a determination of the resistance and service life of ceramic filters.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} was to develop and compare two {{formulations}} of melarsoprol (nanosuspension and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex). The arsenic concentrations in the organs have been assessed on a mouse model. Since this organoarsenical drug has been proposed {{for the treatment of}} cerebral trypanosomiasis and <b>refractory</b> leukaemias, <b>special</b> emphasis has been put on the bone marrow and on the brain. The organic solution of melarsoprol (Mel B, 0. 039 mmol/kg), injected intravenously as control formulation, was found to concentrate significantly in the bone marrow (C(max) = 1. 64 mmol/g), though, not surprisingly, the brain concentration was quite high (C(max) = 0. 093 mmol/g) and the LD(50) was 0. 12 mmol/kg. The hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex was found to concentrate much more in the brain (C(max) = 0. 25 mmol/g) leading to a higher acute toxicity (i. e., lower LD(50); 0. 056 mmol/kg). Nevertheless, even if the encephalopathy risk has to be taken in to account, this could be considered as a positive point for the treatment of the cerebral trypanosomiasis, which is the main indication for this drug. On the contrary, the use of nanosuspensions allowed us to reduce the cerebral concentration (C(max) = 0. 02 micromol/g) and the acute toxicity (LD(50) = 0. 25 mmol/kg). Moreover, nanosuspensions, especially those prepared with polxamer 407, preserved a good in vitro antileukemic activity (IC(50) = 3. 34 +/- 0. 33 after 48 h on K 562) with high bone marrow concentrations (C(max) = 1. 85 micromol/g).

The purpose of research was to develop a wide range of special materials suitable for repairs of any linings of thermal units. In accordance with the purpose, this paper solved the following tasks: Selecting reactive binders used in the compositions of refractory concrete capable of structural modification of any refractory lining materials; Developing impregnating-coating compositions based on reactive binders capable of forming a protective coating with high adhesive strengthen linings; Developing compositions of refractory ramming mixtures, used for the repair of large fragments of linings and having high adhesion to any refractory lining materials; Checking the effectiveness of the technology in production environment. In this paper, we used not only standard techniques but also specially designed ones, in particular, to determine the adhesion of refractory coating to the refractory lining materials.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the need of {{metallurgical}} industry in the world, a new MgAlON-BN composite which can be used for example in <b>special</b> <b>refractory</b> nozzles, tubes and break rings for the continuous casting of steel was studied in the present thesis. The aim was to understand the mechanism of synthesis and their physicochemical properties during the application. Thus, the thermodynamic properties, synthesis process, mechanical properties, thermal shock behaviour, thermal diffusivity/conductivity as well as corrosion resistance to molten iron containing oxygen and molten slag of MgAlON and MgAlON-BN composites have been investigated. The Gibbs energy of formation of MgAlON was estimated using the method proposed by Kaufman. The phase stability diagram of Mg-Al-O-N-B was investigated, and consequently the synthesis parameters were determined. MgAlON and MgAlON-BN composites were fabricated by hot-pressing method. The composites obtained this way were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and HREM analyses. A Matrix-flushing method was employed in the quantitative XRD analysis for the multi-component samples to understand the mechanism of synthesis. The relationship between mechanical properties and microstructure of the composites was investigated. The experimental results indicated that BN addition has significant influence on the mechanical properties of the composites. These {{can be explained by the}} fact that BN has low Young’s modulus, density and non-reactive nature as well as considerable anisotropy of many properties such as thermal expansion, thermal diffusivity/conductivity. Thus, the addition of BN in MgAlON is likely to lead to the presence of microcracks caused by the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient. The microcracks result in the enhancement of the strength at elevated temperature and thermal shock durability of the composites. Effective thermal conductivities were evaluated from the present experimental results of thermal diffusivities, heat capacity and density. A model suitable for present composites has been derived based on Luo’s model. The predicted lines calculated by the model were in good agreement with experimental results. The reactions between the composites and molten iron as well as the slag were investigated by ‘‘finger’’ experiments and sessile drop experiments. Both experimental results indicated that the BN addition has positive influence on the corrosion resistance. These are attributed to the excellent corrosion resistance of BN to molten iron and slag, such as the higher contact angle between BN substrate and liquid iron and molten slag compared with that obtained for pure MgAlON.
