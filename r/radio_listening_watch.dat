40|$|Obtaining the <b>listening</b> {{rates of}} <b>radio</b> {{stations}} in function {{of time is}} an important instrument for determining the impact of publicity. Since many radio stations are financed by publicity, the exact determination of <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> rates is vital to their existence and to further development. Existing methods of determining <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> rates are based on face to face interviews or telephonic interviews made with a sample population. These traditional methods however require the cooperation and compliance of the participants. In order to significantly improve the determination of <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> rates, special <b>watches</b> were created which incorporate a custom integrated circuit sampling the ambient sound during a few seconds every minutes. Each watch accumulates these compressed sound samples during one full week. Watches are then sent to an evaluation center, where the sound samples are matched with the sound samples recorded from candidate radio stations. The present paper describes the processing steps necessary for computing the <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> rates, and shows how this application was parallelized on a cluster of PCs using the CAP Computer-aided parallelization framework. Since the application must run in a production environment, the paper describes also the support provided for graceful degradation in case of transient or permanent failure {{of one of the}} system's components. The parallel sound matching server offers a linear speedup up to a large number of processing nodes thanks to the fact that disk access operations across the network are done in pipeline with computations...|$|R

40|$|Study on {{auditory}} communication disturbances due to {{road transportation}} noise in Calabar Urban City, Nigeria was carried out. Both subjective (psycho-social) and objective (acoustical) measurements {{were made for}} a period of twelve months. Questionnaire/interview schedules containing pertinent questions were administered randomly to 500 respondents of age 15 year and above, who were also with a good level of literacy skills (reading writing) and leaving in houses sited along or parallel to busy road, with heavy traffic volume for at least three (3) years. The questionnaires provided the psycho-social responses of respondents used in this study, their reactions to road traffic noise effect on communication activities (<b>listening</b> to <b>radio,</b> <b>listening</b> and <b>watching</b> television, verbal communication between individuals, speech communication and telephone/GSM communication). Acoustical measurements were made at the facades of respondents' houses facing the road using precision digital sound level meter, Bruel and Kjaer (B & K) type 732 following ISO standards 1996. The meter read the road traffic noise levels at measurement sites (facades of respondents' houses). From the results obtained in this study residents of Calabar City suffer serious communication interferences as a result of excessive road traffic noise levels. The noise indices used for this study were LAeq and Ldn. Noise levels obtained were over 93 dB(A) (daytime) and 60 dB(A), (nighttime) for LAeq and 80 dB(A) for Ldn. These far exceeded the recommended theoretical values of 45 - 55 and 70 dB(A), for LAeqand Ldn respectively. A-weighted sound pressure level (SPLS) range between 87. 0 and 100. 0 dB(A). In this study it was also observed that over 98 % of the respondents reported their television watching/radio listening disturbed, 99 % recorded telephone/GSM disturbed, and 98 % reported face-to-face verbal conversation disturbed, and 98 % reported speech communication disturbed. The background noise levels (BNLs) of measurement sites range from 54. 5 to 63. 4 dB(A). It appears residents suffered from communication disturbances in the day time more than in the night time as the study revealed. The correlation coefficients between social responses and acoustical responses for television watching/radio listening, telephone/GSM conversation, face-to-face verbal conversation and speech communication disturbances were respectively + 0. 73, + 0. 67, + 0. 66, and + 0. 69. In all, Calabar residents are seriously suffering from intense auditory communication interferences daily due to intense road transportation noise pollutio...|$|R

40|$|The authors report {{findings}} from a comprehensive analysis of radio audience data captured by Arbitron’s Portable People Meter (PPM). The paper compares the diary and PPM results {{for a common}} area and time period and list of stations. Comparisons, not unexpectedly, show differences in overall amount of radio use, the distribution of radio use by time periods, {{the relative importance of}} <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> for different subgroups of the population, the reach of radio, and shares and reach of the different stations. There are also indications that the structure of <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> (e. g., relative weight of heavy-light listening, demographic profiles, etc.) is different. The reasons for these substantive differences are explored. It becomes evident that the tasks of writing a daily diary and carrying a PPM attract different populations, as measured by standard demographics, socio-economic and lifestyle variables, but account for relatively small differences between the methodologies. The paper also examines differences in the definition and measurement of <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> as the reason for differences between diary and PPM measurement. This analysis points to the definition of <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> as the predominant reason for the different radio audiences observed...|$|R
50|$|DSC {{distress}} alerts, which {{consist of}} a preformatted distress message, are used to initiate emergency communications with ships and rescue coordination centers.

A <b>listening</b> <b>watch</b> aboard GMDSS-equipped ships on 2182 kHz ended on February 1, 1999. In May 2002, IMO decided to postpone cessation of a VHF <b>listening</b> <b>watch</b> aboard ships.

50|$|During the 1980s, the Arbitron Company was {{developing}} the Portable People Meter, or PPM, technology to replace its self-administered, seven-day radio diary method to collect <b>radio</b> <b>listening</b> data from Arbitron survey participants.

Rantel became an early evangelist for the new PPM method, because Rantel researchers had performed many audits of Arbitron radio diaries during its early years and were keenly aware of the weaknesses of the seven-day radio diary method.|$|R
