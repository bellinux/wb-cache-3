40|$|The aortic root remodelling procedure, {{introduced}} by Yacoub {{in the early}} 1980 s, is the valve-sparing aortic root replacement procedure that better reproduces the anatomical and functional properties of the native aortic root. Long-term durability of the repair, in terms of freedom from recurrent aortic regurgitation, has been questioned and can probably be improved by appropriate patient selection. Reproducibility of the operation, however, depends on subjective evaluations and surgical skill. We report a simplification of the technique designed to possibly increase the reproducibility of the aortic root <b>remodelling</b> <b>operation</b> while retaining its functional advantages...|$|R

25|$|After the {{division}} headquarters moved, the depot still carried out railroad functions; the building still {{served as a}} crew change location {{as well as the}} depot for the village of Amboy. The second floor was mostly abandoned after 1894 while the first floor handled the bulk of the day-to-day operations.

40|$|Nowadays, one of {{the main}} {{concerns}} in the urban agenda of the European Union and Member States is how to adopt an integrated approach to urban challenges and needs of the consolidated city, in particular, to address the complex condition of multi-deprived neighbourhoods. Beyond the strategic integrated approaches based on economic interests perceived within the European Union, the disadvantage condition of multi-deprived areas requires an active and consistent implication of the diversity of urban players, including the affected communities themselves. This paper pursues to contribute to this urban challenge with a reflection about the social implications of massive <b>remodelling</b> or re-development <b>operations</b> of deprived localities in comparison with rehabilitation projects eluding the whole demolition-reconstruction processes. For this purpose, the social housing estates A, B and C of Fuencarral in Madrid are taken as reference case studies that represent an important lesson of the recent history of the City and the <b>Remodelling</b> <b>Operation</b> of neighbourhoods in Madrid. Fuencarral A and B units, built as temporal settlements in the late 60 s, have undergone a massive remodelling intervention that has lasted more than expected; in fact, some residents complain that it is not yet concluded after more than two decades.

40|$|Patients {{with acute}} {{dissection}} of the ascending aorta often have aortic insufficiency. However, in such patients the aortic valve almost have normal leaflets, {{and the cause}} of valvular dysfunction is dilatation of the sinotubular junction. Remodeling of the aortic annulus is the form of valveconserving operation for aortic insufficiency with normal aortic leaflets. We describe our choice of graft size for this operation, short- and long-term aortic valve function results. This operation was performed in five patients. All patients had acute aortic dissection. All were female, {{with a mean age of}} 58. 2 years. A collagen-impregnated Dacron graft was used. Graft size was determined by adding 1 or 2 mm to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s aortic annular diameter. Doppler echocardiography and aortography were performed two weeks after operation and at follow-up. There were no operative deaths and valverelated complications. All patients were NYHA class I. Echocardiography revealed normal valve function in three patients and trivial insufficiency in two. Aortography, which was performed in three patients, revealed sinus space formation in all and trivial insufficiency in one patient. During a mean follow-up period of 20 months, there was no development of aortic insufficiency and no dilatation of grafts. <b>Remodeling</b> <b>operation</b> with our method of selection of graft size is an effective for treating acute aortic dissection with aortic insufficiency.

40|$|Nowadays, the construction, <b>remodelling</b> and {{demolition}} <b>operations</b> {{can cause}} serious environment impacts. These activities produce materials defined as construction and demolition wastes (CDW). The CDW generated in Europe represents around 25 - 30 % of total waste. In EU 28 CDW production is about 821, 160, 000 t, {{but there is}} a significant difference among the European countries, mainly because of the variation of construction and demolition activity. In 2011, the total production of CDW in Portugal was around 930, 000 t, but regional production is not homogeneous. The substantial inert fraction from the CDW makes them suitable for reuse. The present study aims to quantify and characterize CDW from residential recuperation of small constructions in Portugal and then propose mitigating measures to improve CDW management. The results obtained by bibliographic research revealed that the construction and demolition activity has decreased significantly in the last years and consequently CDW production. In addition, it was observed a big number of entities were involved in CDW management. Therefore, it was necessary to select a specific area from Portugal (Setubal region) which has thirteen City Halls. The surveys had scarce response. This {{can be explained by the}} lack of obligation of enterprises with less than ten employees to register CDW production and because in some regions the CDW are mixed with municipal solid waste. Most of the CDW collected from Setubal region was disposed in landfill. In order to reduce CDW production it is necessary to promote and make available recycled materials for small works at low cost. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Forteza et al {{from the}} Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre {{described}} {{in this issue of}} the Revista Española de Cardiología their initial experience with aortic valve sparing operations for aortic root aneurysm in 18 patients with Marfan syndrome. 1 The authors indicated that they have done 40 such operations for aortic root aneurysm. The early results reported are excellent and I commend them for introducing this type of conservative valve surgery in their cardiac unit. I have no doubt that in selected patients valve repair provides better clinical outcomes than valve replacement. Aortic valve sparing operations are complicated procedures because they require exceptional knowledge of the functional anatomy of the aortic valve as well as technical expertise. They are not easily reproducible. There are basically two types of aortic valve sparing operations to treat aortic root aneurysm: reimplantation of the aortic valve and remodeling of the aortic root. 2 Figures 1, 2, and 3 show sketches of these <b>operations.</b> <b>Remodeling</b> of the aortic root is a physiologically sounder procedure than reimplantion of the aortic valve 3 but we have shown in patients with Marfan syndrome that the aorto-ventricular junction continues to dilate after remodeling of the aortic root and eventually aortic insufficiency ensues. 4 For this reason, we believe that reimplantation of the aortic valve is more appropriate to treat young patients with aortic root aneurysm whether they have the Marfan syndrome or not. 5 Since the introduction of reimplantation of the aortic valve to treat aortic root aneurysms, several technical modifications have been proposed. 6 - 8 Most of these changes have focused on creating neo-aortic sinuses to reduce the velocity of closure of the aortic cusps t...|$|R

Results: Vildagliptin inhibited the DPP- 4 enzymatic activity by almost 70 % and increased active GLP- 1 levels by about 3 -fold in plasma in both treated groups (p < 0. 05 vs. non-treated groups). Cardiac function (ejection fraction) was decreased in all 3 MI groups compared with Sham group (p < 0. 05); treatment with vildagliptin, either early or late, did not reverse cardiac remodeling. ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) mRNA levels were significantly increased in all 3 MI groups, but no significant reductions were observed in both vildagliptin groups. Vildagliptin also did not change cardiomyocyte size or capillary density after MI. No effects were detected on glucose level and body weight in the post-MI remodeling model.

40|$|Craniosynostosis is a {{developmental}} abnormality in skull growth, {{due to the}} fusion {{of one or more}} suturespatho. To accommodate the growing brain. the skull needs to grow quickly in {{the first few months of}} life, and most of the growth of the skull at that time occurs at the sutures. Craniosynostosis occurs when one or more sutures are fused in utero, resulting in an abnormal skull shape. Surgical intervention is usually required at a young age, and remodeling of the skull is done for cosmetic reasons as well as to avoid raised intracranial pressure. In order to study how the bone <b>remodels</b> after an <b>operation,</b> an accurate corregistration needs to be done. However, because of the rapid growth of the skull, in a non-symmetrical manner, a non-rigid registration is necessary; taking multiple point. The work done here looks at the best method to corregister images, the best fit mathematical model for a skull and the the overall skull shape transformations during development, on young rats CT data from a previous study was used. This project has four purposes. 1) segmenting the Rat skull to have a better view of the skull, with an analysis of the sutures and bones. 2) A 3 D non-rigid affine registration based on landmarks identified overtime in each skull dataset was calculated. The registration accuracy is a function of the number of landmarks identified for tracking by a trained user. 3) Have a mathematical model using an ellipsoid to fit the points identified on the skull. This best-fit ellipsoid can then be tracked overtime to analyze the development of several rat skulls. We then compared the ellipsoid parameters to model the growth of the skull. The results show that the landmarks chosen for registration need to be chosen carefully, in a way that establishes a good ?Condition Number? for the transformation fitting stage. The proposed analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for skull growth modeling and to quantify the proposed treatments. 3) The fitted model can also be used to estimate the growth rate in living rats. 4) Another purpose of this study is to measure craniometrics of the rats skull and compare it to the previous studies...|$|R
