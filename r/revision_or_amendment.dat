40|$|The {{document}} is organized {{to meet the}} broad subjects categorized in Condition 26 of the Planning Commission's Geothermal Resource Permit No. 2. Thus, we believe the breadth of coverage meets this requirement. With regard to the depth of discussion, there were several discrepancies between {{the body of the}} document and its appendixes. More specifically, these dealt with air, noise and pentane descriptions and were largely referenced to the attached permits, which we believe have since been revised. The inclusion of "obsolete" permits in the appendix has caused great confusion. The Emergency Notification Contact List on page 3 - 2 should include after hour numbers for the Health Department's Big Island personnel. We believe these numbers are currently being used. The review of the Emergency Response Plan Version 6. 0 does not include the review of Geothermal Resource Permit No. 2.

40|$|Background: The ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) version 1. 0 (v 1. 0) was {{published}} in May 2015 {{and was the first}} version of a validated and reproducible tool to assess the magnitude of clinical benefit from new cancer therapies. The ESMO-MCBS was designed to be a dynamic tool with planned revisions and updates based upon recognition of expanding needs and shortcomings identified since the last review. Methods: The revision process for the ESMO-MCBS incorporates a nine-step process: Careful review of critiques and suggestions, and identification of problems in the application of v 1. 0; Identification of shortcomings for revision in the upcoming version; Proposal and evaluation of solutions to address identified shortcomings; Field testing of solutions; Preparation of a near-final revised version for peer review for reasonableness by members of the ESMO Faculty and Guidelines Committee; Amendments based on peer review for reasonableness; Near-final review by members of the ESMO-MCBS Working Group and the ESMO Executive Board; Final amendments; Final review and approval by members of the ESMO-MCBS Working Group and the ESMO Executive Board. Results: Twelve issues for <b>revision</b> <b>or</b> <b>amendment</b> were proposed for consideration; proposed amendments were formulated for eight identified shortcomings. The proposed amendments are classified as either structural, technical, immunotherapy triggered or nuanced. All amendments were field tested {{in a wide range of}} studies comparing scores generated with ESMO-MCBS v 1. 0 and version 1. 1 (v 1. 1). Conclusions: ESMO-MCBS v 1. 1 incorporates 10 revisions and will allow for scoring of single-arm studies. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The City of Reading has, {{over the}} years, {{passed through a}} process of {{legislative}} change common to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were necessary {{at the time of the}} establishment of the City Council, subsequent growth of the community, together with the com-plexity of modern life, has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the City Council. The recording of local law is an aspect of munici-pal history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that the City ordered the following codification of the City Council's legislation. Contents of Code The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation of a general and per-manent nature enacted by the City of the City of Reading, including <b>revisions</b> <b>or</b> <b>amendments</b> t...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the content and applicability of BS 8800 : 1996 Guide to occupational health and safety management systems. The research is presented chronologically, with literature review and content analysis of SMS related guides and standards interwoven with two elements of qualitative empirical work. The first of these was carried out shortly after publication of BS 8800 in 1996, a 'before-the-event' investigation of how organisations were intending to approach SMS implementation. The challenges faced by these organisations are reviewed against standard management theory, suggesting that the initial motivation for SMS implementation governs the approach organisations will adopt to guidance such as BS 8800. The second phase of empirical work was undertaken in the context of OHSAS 18001, an auditable protocol based on BS 8800, which allows organisations to certify their safety management systems. A discussion of the evolution of certifiable safety management system is presented, highlighting the similarities and differences between this, BS 8800, SMS and wider management system standards. A case study then reviews the experiences of a catering company that implemented 18001, motivated by the opportunity for certification as a business benefit. The empirical work is used to comment on the guidance provided by BS 8800, within its evolved role as guidance organisations may use for implementation of a SMS to be certified according to the specifications of OHSAS 18001. It is suggested that optimal implementation is facilitated by initial status review, continual improvement and the use of annexes, where there are used to make changes to the existing safety management system. This thesis concludes with a discussion of these elements, highlighting pertinent areas within BS 8800 where <b>revision</b> <b>or</b> <b>amendment</b> may be appropriate...|$|E
