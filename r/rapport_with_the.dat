Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had shown him a lack of respect.

Anne and Henry attended a meeting with the French king at Calais in winter 1532, in which Henry hoped to enlist the support of Francis I of France for his intended marriage. On 1 September 1532, Henry granted her suo jure the Marquessate of Pembroke, an appropriate peerage for a future queen; as such she became a rich and important woman: the three dukes and two marquesses who existed in 1532 were the King's brother-in-law, the King's illegitimate son, and other descendants of royalty; she ranked above all other peeresses. The Pembroke lands and the title of Earl of Pembroke had been held by Henry's great-uncle, and Henry performed the investiture himself.|$|E

The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take.

BSkyB {{chief executive}} Sam Chisholm attempted to make a joint offer with ITV which did not come into fruition, so he formed an alliance with the BBC, aware the corporation wanted a highlights package.

For Pontormo, the sole indications concerning the contents of his private library - supposing him to have possessed sufficient books to merit speaking of a library as such - are contained in his diary. This chapter aims to hypothetically retrace Jacopo Pontormo's literary education: how he learnt to write and read and how he acquired his knowledge of Latin.
