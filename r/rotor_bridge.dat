40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) powered {{submersible}} electric {{water pumps}} are becoming popular in remote rural areas, {{due to the}} nonavailability of grid connectivity. However, the initial cost of a PV system is high. Permanent magnet (PM) brushless dc (BLDC) motors are efficient compared to existing induction motors, which {{reduce the cost of}} PV array. However, steep increase in the cost of rare-earth magnets like NdFeB and SmCo makes the use of PM motor uneconomical for PV systems. Thus, the design of PM motors with ferrite magnets is gaining interest. These magnets have low remanence flux density and are brittle. Thus, flux concentration rotor topologies are desirable. The conventional spoke-type (ST) rotor is one such topology. However, flux leakage is one of its prime concerns. To negotiate this, a novel "semi-modular dual-stack" ST BLDC motor along with its parametric aided three-dimensional finite element method analysis is proposed for a PV-based 100 mm deep bore-well submersible water pump. The motor features minimum flux leakage irrespective of <b>rotor</b> <b>bridge</b> width. In addition, a lumped parameter thermal network is modeled for quick estimation of the winding temperature rise. A prototype motor is fabricated to ascertain the results obtained from simulations, and the experimental results are presented...|$|E
40|$|Copyright 2007 IEEEA new {{magnetic}} circuit model is presented for an interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machine, using a machine with three-phase distributed stator windings and three layers of flux barriers in the rotor {{as an example}} topology. The model accounts for: i) the effects of cross-coupled magnetic saturation caused by the salient rotor; ii) variation of magnetic saturation levels in the iron <b>rotor</b> <b>bridges</b> that are key elements of the unitary rotor laminations; iii) the effects of stator lamination slots on the airgap mmf distribution; and iv) the local variation of airgap permeance due to the stator slotting and the relative position of the rotor {{with respect to the}} stator. As a result of these features, the new model is capable of significantly improving the accuracy of electromagnetic performance predictions for aggressively-designed IPM machines compared to previously-available {{magnetic circuit}} models. Comparisons with finite-element analysis and measurement results are provided showing that the new model is much faster while delivering appealing accuracy compared to the FE method...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} PM motor for zero-speed sensorless rotor {{position}} detection, by means of injection of a high frequency signal. Various aspects are investigated: influence of the rotor structure, stator and rotor saturation, reliability of finite element analysis to predict the motor performance, influence of <b>rotor</b> iron <b>bridges</b> and of <b>rotor</b> eddy currents induced. The results presented here give the key rules to design a PM motor suitable for sensorless rotor position detection...|$|R
50|$|Early designs using LEDs and {{rechargeable}} batteries used dynamos much like small DC motors, but suffered from very short brush life. Small alternators with multipole permanent-magnet external cup <b>rotors,</b> combined with <b>bridge</b> rectifiers, offered long lives. Both single-phase and three-phase alternators are in use. Overcharge is possible, {{and to be}} avoided.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rotor</b> must <b>bridge</b> {{the path}} between {{opposing}} pole pieces, but must never bridge all four simultaneously. It must thus {{have an even}} number of poles, but this must not be divisible by four. Practical rotors use six poles. As the rotation of one tooth pitch is sufficient to generate one AC cycle, the output frequency is thus {{the product of the}} rotation speed (in revs. per second) and the number of rotor teeth. Early AC systems used the standard frequency of 400 Hz, which limited alternators to two pole rotors and a maximum rotation speed of 24,000 rpm. The use of higher frequencies, from multi-pole rotors, was already recognised as a future means to achieve greater power for the same weight. The Sea Slug missile alternator used a speed of 24,000 rpm to produce 1.5 kVA of electricity at 2,400 Hz.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the wind power conversions systems can be greatly improved using an appropriate control algorithm. In this work, a sliding mode control for variable speed wind turbine that incorporates a doubly fed induction generator is described. The electrical system incorporates a wound rotor induction machine with back-to-back three phase power converter <b>bridges</b> between its <b>rotor</b> and the grid. In the presented design the so-called vector control theory is applied, {{in order to simplify}} the electrical equations. The proposed control scheme uses stator flux-oriented vector control for the <b>rotor</b> side converter <b>bridge</b> control and grid voltage vector control for the grid side converter bridge control. The stability analysis of the proposed sliding mode controller under disturbances and parameter uncertainties is provided using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally simulated results show, on the one hand, that the proposed controller provides high-performance dynamic characteristics, and on the other hand, that this scheme is robust with respect to the uncertainties that usually appear in the real systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{periodically}} driven rotor is a prototypical {{model that}} exhibits {{a transition to}} chaos in the classical regime and dynamical localization (related to Anderson localization) in the quantum regime. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. B 94, 085120 (2016) ], A. C. Keser et al. considered a many-body generalization of coupled quantum kicked rotors, and showed that in the special integrable linear case, dynamical localization survives interactions. By analogy with many-body localization, the phenomenon was dubbed dynamical many-body localization. In the present work, we study nonintegrable models of single and coupled quantum relativistic kicked <b>rotors</b> (QRKRs) that <b>bridge</b> {{the gap between the}} conventional quadratic rotors and the integrable linear models. For a single QRKR, we supplement the recent analysis of the angular-momentum-space dynamics with a study of the spin dynamics. Our analysis of two and three coupled QRKRs along with the proved localization in the many-body linear model indicate that dynamical localization exists in few-body systems. Moreover, the relation between QRKR and linear rotor models implies that dynamical many-body localization can exist in generic, nonintegrable many-body systems. And localization can generally result from a complicated interplay between Anderson mechanism and limiting integrability, since the many-body linear model is a high-angular-momentum limit of many-body QRKRs. We also analyze the dynamics of two coupled QRKRs in the highly unusual superballistic regime and find that the resonance conditions are relaxed due to interactions. Finally, we propose experimental realizations of the QRKR model in cold atoms in optical lattices. Comment: 12 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. B, Vol. 95 (2017...|$|R
