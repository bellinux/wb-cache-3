2500|$|In the 2010s, small PA {{systems for}} venues such as bars and clubs are now {{available}} with features that were formerly only available on professional-level equipment, such as digital reverb effects, graphic equalizers, and, in some models, feedback prevention circuits which electronically sense and prevent feedback [...] "howls" [...] before they become a problem. Digital effects units may offer multiple pre-set and variable reverb, echo and related effects. Digital loudspeaker management systems offer sound engineers digital delay (to ensure speakers are in sync with each other), limiting, crossover functions, EQ filters, compression and other functions in a single <b>rack-mountable</b> unit. In previous decades, sound engineers typically had to transport {{a substantial number of}} rack-mounted analog effects unit devices to accomplish these tasks.|$|E

5000|$|Each shelf slot is 30.48 mm wide. This {{allows for}} 14-board chassis to be {{installed}} in a [...] 19-inch <b>rack-mountable</b> system and 16 boards in an [...] ETSI <b>rack-mountable</b> system. A typical 14-slot system is 12 or 13 rack units high. The large AdvancedTCA shelves are targeted to the telecommunication market so the airflow goes {{in the front of}} the shelf, across the boards from bottom to top, and out the rear of the shelf. Smaller shelves that are used in enterprise applications typically have horizontal air flow.|$|E

50|$|Racks {{are divided}} into regions, 44.50 mm in height, within which there are three {{complete}} hole pairs in a vertically symmetric pattern, the holes being centered 6.35 mm, 22.25 mm, and 38.15 mm from the top or bottom of the region. Such a region {{is commonly known as}} a U, for unit, or, in German, HE, for Höheneinheit, and heights within racks are measured by this unit. <b>Rack-mountable</b> equipment is usually designed to occupy some integer number of U. For example, an oscilloscope might be 4U high, and <b>rack-mountable</b> computers are mostly between 1U and 4U high. A blade server enclosure might require 10U.|$|E

50|$|Once a {{television}} signal is received, {{it must be}} processed. For digital satellite TV signals, a dedicated commercial satellite receiver is needed for each channel {{that is to be}} distributed by the cable system; these are usually <b>rack-mountable</b> receivers that are designed to take up less space than consumer receivers. They output video and stereo audio signals as well as a digital signal for digital plants.|$|E
50|$|The Ultra 80 {{is similar}} to the lower-cost Sun Ultra 60, but is {{somewhat}} larger and supports more CPUs and memory.

50|$|Xserve RAID was a mass-storage {{device that}} was offered by Apple Inc. Xserve RAID {{held up to}} 14 hot-swappable Ultra-ATA hard drives, and had a {{capacity}} of 10.5 TB when filled with 750 GB modules. Xserve RAID supported RAID levels of 0, 0+1, 1, 3 and 5 in hardware, hybrid RAID levels such as 10 and 50 could be created in software. It was <b>rack-mountable</b> and was 3U high.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of development in the 1950s, atomic clocks {{have been based on}} the hyperfine transitions in hydrogen-1, caesium-133, and rubidium-87. The first commercial atomic clock was the Atomichron, manufactured by the National Company. More than 50 were sold between 1956 and 1960. This bulky and expensive instrument was subsequently replaced by much smaller <b>rack-mountable</b> devices, such as the Hewlett-Packard model 5060 caesium frequency standard, released in 1964.|$|E
5000|$|The Voyetra-8 is a 19" [...] <b>rack-mountable</b> device, 3 rack units high at the face. Most {{units are}} bowed {{at the top}} and so cannot be placed below other rack mounted {{equipment}} more than a few inches deep. It is approximately 16 inches deep in the rack, and weighs around 78 lbs. Rear mounted plugs and a large heat sink make at least 4" [...] rear clearance advisable.|$|E
