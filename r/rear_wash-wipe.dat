50|$|The {{original}} dashboard {{was of a}} multi-piece construction, {{and gained}} {{a reputation for being}} flimsy and prone to squeaks and rattles, so in February 1986, this was replaced with the more conventional dashboard from the Montego and in the change the voice synthesis unit (prone to reliability issues) was dropped. At the same time more minor equipment upgrades were made across the range. The City X gained door bins and <b>rear</b> <b>wash-wipe.</b> The L and LE gained tweed trim. The HL and automatic gained velour trim and additional brightwork. The Vanden Plas gained leather trim and uprated electronic stereo system.|$|E
50|$|The last Mk I variant to be {{produced}} using the supercharged Tritec engine was the Mini Cooper S with John Cooper Works GP Kit, a light-weight, quasi-race-prepped John Cooper Works model. Hand-finished by Bertone in Italy, it was offered as a limited-production run of 2000 cars during the 2006 model year, with 444 of those originally intended for the UK market, although ultimately, 459 were sold. The GP has more bolstered Recaro front seats but had no rear seats, which along with reduced sound-deadening, removal of the <b>rear</b> <b>wash-wipe</b> system, optional air-conditioning and radio, and other weight-reduction steps, resulted in a weight saving of around 40 kg compared to a Cooper S.|$|E
50|$|In April 1975 a 3-door {{estate car}} version {{was added to}} the range. Allegros were now coming off the {{production}} line with the same conventional steering wheel as the Morris Marina, although the company waited till early June 1975 to announce, rather quietly, the demise of the Allegro's quartic steering wheel, presumably to give time for older cars to emerge from the sales and distribution network. Similar to the 2-door saloon, the Allegro estate had a coachline and also featured a <b>rear</b> <b>wash-wipe.</b> The spare wheel was housed under the rear load floor area. It was only in production for about 100 days before the arrival of the Series 2 model, making Series I Allegro estate rarer than most other models in the range.|$|E
