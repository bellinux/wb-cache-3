Theoretical and experimental results for waveguide geometries with stacked waveguide layers and with waveguide circuits prepared on topological structures are reported as well. Within waveguide geometries including individual guides {{in a sequence}} of stacked layers directional coupler arrays allow for short length passive signal distribution, and various schemes of single and multipath switching can be identified.

To realize waveguides with smooth height variation gray scale lithography was used to produce topological surfaces. Upon those surfaces waveguide paths and devices can be defined subsequently, which are useful e. g. for non-planar to planar fan out structures or interferometer configurations for sensing applications.

A simple mass-transfer coefficient approach for expressing growth rate of bubbles is used, although various growth laws can be accommodated without affecting the solution procedure. Determining factors for the bubble size and its distribution are the foaming period and the growth law. With increase in initial blowing agent concentration, the foaming period increases and bigger bubbles are obtained. The bubble-size distribution becomes broader as the foaming period increases...|$|R

The worn surface of PDCPD/MMT nanocomposites was exami-ned with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the wear mechanism was discussed. It was found that when the content of MMT is 0. 25 %, the erosion rate of nanocompositesreach the minimum; the erosion rate of nanocomposites increases with the increase of MMT content compared with neat PDCPD. The important wear mechanism of neat PDCPD was tearing and ploughing-cutting, And the results showed that wear mechanism of PDCPD/MMT nanocomposites was dominated by ploughing-cutting, with the increase of MMT the severe mechanical cutting, fatigue wear and slight brittle rupture appear.
