In 2013 JSC “NIIEFA” delivered 95 high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks to the IO ITER, i. e. 65 breaks with spiral channels and 30 breaks with uniflow channels. These high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks were designed, manufactured and tested {{in accordance with the}} ITER Technical Specifications: «Axial Insulating Breaks for the Qualification Phase of ITER Coils and Feeders». The high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks consist of the glass-reinforced plastic cylinder equipped with channels for cryoagent and stainless steel end fittings. The operating voltage is 30 kV for the breaks with spiral channels (30 kV HV IBs) and 4 kV for the breaks with uniflow channels (4  kV HV IBs). The main design feature of the 30  kV HV IBs is the spiral channels instead of a linear one. This approach has enabled us to increase the breakdown voltage and decrease the overall dimensions of the high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks. In 2013 the manufacturing technique was developed to produce the high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks with the spiral and uniflow channels that made it possible to proceed to serial production. To provide the acceptance tests of the breaks a special test facility was prepared. The helium tightness test at 10 - 11 m 3 Pa/s under the pressure up to 10 MPa, the high voltage test up to 135  kV and different types of mechanical tests were carried out at the room and liquid nitrogen temperatures...|$|R

The use of a special ferrite material with a Curie temperature far above the maximum ambient temperature and a consistent renunciation of temperature critical devices like electrolytic capacitors ensures a reliable operation up to ambient temperatures of 125 °C.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{a signal}} impulse {{transmission}} function is investigated which provides high <b>insulation</b> <b>voltage</b> capabilities for IGBT drivers devices. This electrical insulation is achieved with {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB) and classical copper windings. Two ferrite cores are added to improve the magnetic coupling effect and thus decrease the impulse current maximum value in the primary side. The electronic circuit involves a series resonant topology in the primary side and a parallel one in the secondary side. The classical electronic components lead potentially to cost-effective solutions. However, so as to optimise the proposed system, a design methodology based on virtual prototyping tools is carried out. The simulation results presented on a Pareto front are analysed with the help of propagation delay and average power consumption. Moreover, measurement results with a 1. 6 mm PCB are compared with simulation ones. Finally, the proposed solution and the methodology design are clearly accurate and suitable for power electronic designers and especially for IGBT driver devices designers...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} used cable-in-conduit {{conductor}} (CICC) coils {{in trying to}} develop an AC superconducting magnet because of its enormous potential if AC losses were low and <b>insulation</b> <b>voltage</b> was high. The strands {{in the most recent}} CICC magnets are coated with chromium or another metal with high electrical resistance to order to induce current re-distribution among the strands and to avoid a quench caused by a current imbalance. Current re-distribution is highly complex and very difficult to analyze because the conditions of the strand surfaces and the contact areas vary greatly with the operation of the conductor. If, however, the cable currents were well-balanced, insulating the strands would {{be the best way to}} reduce AC losses. We propose a new CICC magnet structure featuring a current lead that balances the strand currents via its resistance. Having calculated current balances, we find that strand currents are well within the present parameters for nuclear fusion experiments and superconducting magnet energy storages. ...|$|R

In this paper the breakdown field strength and resistivity of such sputter deposited Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 films are investigated in the temperature range between room temperature and 400 °C. All investigated films show excellent insulation properties at room temperature. At high temperatures films remain insulating at slightly reduced breakdown voltage.

Depending on the performance level of the drive circuit either HV IC´s with different kinds of level shifters, opto-couplers or transformers are employed for signal interchange. HV IC´s with level shifters are comparably inexpensive, but they can not on principle grant galvanic isolation. Opto-couplers on the other hand do provide safe isolation, but they degrade over time.

40|$|Abstract- As {{the power}} density {{requirement}} for new compul-sator (CPA) designs increases, designers are driven {{to use more}} composites to reduce mass, spin the rotors faster to store more energy, and operate the machine at higher voltages to increase machine power output. In any particular compulsator design, the rotor windings are subjected to high strain levels as the rotor is spun and experiences radial growth. A critical component in the rotor winding design is the high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation.</b> As the rotor is spun, the induced strains are applied to the insulation system on the coil conductors. This implies that over the operat-ing life of a compulsator, the coil structure and the high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> must remain structurally intact, while undergoing repeated cyclic loading. This paper presents the design and testing of a compulsator rotor winding that has been recently fabricated at the Center for Electromechanics at The University of Texas at Austin.

However, this transition from normally conducting systems to superconducting systems significantly increases the equipment complexity necessary to manage the electrical power systems. Due to the low technology readiness level (TRL) nature of all components and systems, current Turboelectric Distributed Propulsion (TeDP) technology developments are driven by an ambiguous set of system-level electrical integration standards for an airborne microgrid system (Figure 1). While multiple decades' worth of advancements are still required for concept realization, current system-level studies are necessary to focus the technology development, target specific technological shortcomings, and enable accurate prediction of concept feasibility and viability.
