May be turned to finished thickness, {{in which case}} the differential shrinkage of the wood will result in a finished piece that is not perfectly round. Alternatively, it may be [...] "rough turned". <b>Rough</b> <b>turning</b> involves turning the piece only to its general shape, leaving enough thickness so that after turning it can be allowed to dry to equilibrium moisture content and distort. The advantage over first drying the wood then turning is that a <b>rough</b> <b>turned</b> piece dries faster, will probably distort instead of split as solid wood tends to, and that wet wood turns better, since it creates less dust. <b>Rough</b> <b>turning</b> is inexact science: turning wood too thick will lead to splits, turning wood too thin will lead to distortion that cannot be removed, because not enough thickness is left. Once dry, it is mounted on the lathe a second time and turned to its final form. <b>Rough</b> <b>turning</b> is typically used on most functional work and some artistic pieces.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMachining {{large-scale}} {{parts in}} several industries (nuclear, naval, energy…) {{is a challenge}} for machine tools operators. Various problems are encountered, like respecting specified dimensions, deformation of the workpiece during machining, limit of the cutting speed, excessive tool wear, etc. All these difficulties {{are related to the}} large size of the machined part, which may have several meters and weigh several hundred kilograms. This study focuses on analysis of the <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> process of a shell component, having few meters, as a part of steam generators of nuclear power plants. During the <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> step, a high material removal rate (moderate cutting speed, but high depth-of-cut and feed rate) is necessary to achieve the workpiece in reasonable time. Experimental and theoretical analyses are conducted to highlight the intense thermomechanical loading at the tool–workmaterial interface. Revealed physical phenomena at the tool rake face, like adhesion and abrasive wear types, using various characterization techniques, are reproduced by a numerical model developed to simulate the cutting process. As an interest result, contact discontinuities at the tool–chip interface as well as where the wear is highly localized are well predicted as observed on scanning electron microscope. These contact discontinuities are attributed to the grooved rake face of the insert, designed with a chip breaker to reduce the tool–chip contact area and to promote the chip fragmentation. This study can be helpful for the design of <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> inserts, by analysing the effectiveness of the rake face geometry (contact area, chip breaker…) ...|$|R

The tool wear has been characterised experimentally at microscopic scale using observations of different zones of the engaged cutting part at the tool rake face. A model has been developed to predict the tool wear as observed on images. The major finding of the paper concerns the prediction of contact discontinuities at the microscopic scale on the tool rake face and where the wear process is highly localized. These discontinuities are attributed to the complex geometry of the rake face of the grooved cutting insert, designed especially to reduce the tool–chip contact area and to promote the chip breakage. The cutting force, specific cutting force and chip morphology parameters are also predicted and compared to experimental trends.

40|$|Due {{to their}} poor machinability, {{titanium}} alloys {{need to be}} worked at low cutting speeds to prevent a fast tool failure caused by the very high temperatures that are reached at the tool-chip interface. As demonstrated by previous works by the authors, an improvement of productivity for Titanium alloys {{can be obtained by}} adopting cryogenic cooling during the machining operations. The present work shows the features of a toolholder specifically designed for cryogenic adduction in turning operations, following Hong’s design guidelines. The paper compares tool life results between traditional and cryogenic <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> by adopting Grade 5 titanium as the working material. <b>Rough</b> <b>turning</b> is economically more relevant to the machining industry, especially in the aerospace field where generally a large quantity of rough material has to be removed due to the very high buy-to-fly ratio of aerospace components. A full factorial experimental plan was performed basing on typical <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> parameters. Machining outputs such as forces, roughness, temperatures, friction coefficients were calculated in order to define statistical differences between cryogenic cooling method using the special toolholder and traditional oil water emulsion cooling system. Furthermore, thanks to tool life results the Taylor’s law for cryogenic and traditional cases was calculated and an hypothetical production scenario for Ti 6 Al 4 V parts was analysed. An analytical model to calculate production costs and time was built for both cooling methods. A 4 -turrets turning centre was considered and cooling methods and costs per hour of machine tool were taken into account in a cost model. The results show that the benefits in terms of tool life offered by liquid nitrogen cooling allows to improve productivity by adopting higher optimal cutting parameters. This improvement, coupled to an increase of tool life, is very significant and allows not only to reduce time of production but also to cover the major costs of liquid nitrogen and have a slight reduction of machining total costs...|$|R

In this paper, the {{influence}} of different machining methods (including <b>rough</b> <b>turning,</b> finish turning, and longitudinal polishing after finish turning) on rotating bending fatigue properties of TC 21 which belonged to a new ultra high strength titanium alloy was studied. The influence of machining methods on surface integrity of TC 21 titanium alloy was measured by using surface profile measurement, scanning electron microscopy, metallography microscope, micro-hardness instrument and X-ray diffraction residual stress analyzer. And fatigue fractography of specimens was further investigated. Then the mechanism of fatigue resistance which was affected by machining surface integrity was discussed.

40|$|<b>Rough</b> <b>turning</b> is an {{important}} form of manufacturing cylinder-symmetric parts. Thus far, increasing the level of automation in <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> has included process monitoring methods or adaptive turning control methods that aim to keep the process conditions constant.

In this study, primary and secondary chatter and chip formation are studied to understand how to measure the effect of these phenomena to the process conditions and how to avoid undesired cutting conditions. The concept of cutting state is used to address the combination of these phenomena and the current use of the power capacity of the lathe. The measures to the phenomena are not developed based on physical measures, but instead, the severity of the measures is modelled against expert opinion. Based on the concept of cutting state, an expert system style fuzzy control system capable of optimizing the cutting process was created. Important aspects of the system include the capability to adapt to several cutting phenomena appearing at once, even if the said phenomena would potentially require conflicting control action...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to study the {{behavior}} of the acoustic emission (AE) signal as the cutting tool wears up to the end of its life, aiming the automatic definition of the moment to change the tool. Several turning experiments were carried out in both, finish and rough conditions, using coated carbide tools. The AE signal was acquired during the experiments and, after suitable conditioning, was stored in the computer. A discussion about the use of the mean RMS acoustic emission signal as a parameter in the evaluation of the tool condition was also done. The results were graphically plotted and analyzed. It was concluded that the AE signal is strongly influenced by the tool wear and that the cutting conditions are very important, since the signal shows a very different behavior between finish and <b>rough</b> <b>turning.</b> The main conclusion of this work is that AE monitoring is a very good way to establish the moment to change the tool, since the mean RMS of the signal shows a sharp increase close to the end of tool life in finish turning and a decrease, also close to the end of tool life, in <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> operations.
