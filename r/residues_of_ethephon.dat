40|$|International audienceAn {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} for the determination of <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> (2 -chloroethyl phosphonic acid) in drinking and surface water. The procedure is based on de-ionisation with an anion/cation-exchange resin, solid phase extraction by means of anion-exchange polystyrene-divinylbenzene extraction disks, elution {{with a mixture of}} methanol and 10 M hydrochloric acid (98 / 2, v/v), redisolution into acetonitrile after evaporation and silylation with N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl) -N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA). Quantification is performed by gas chromatography with ion-trap cubic mass spectrometric detection in the electron impact mode (GC-EI-MS 3). Method validation was conducted using samples of mineral, tap, and river water that were fortified with ethephon at concentration levels ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 0 microg/L. The mean recovery from all the fortified samples (n = 36) amounted to 88 % with a relative standard deviation of 17 %. The method, therefore, was shown to allow accurate determination of ethephon residues in drinking and surface water with a limit of quantification of 0. 1 microg/L...|$|E
40|$|<b>Residues</b> <b>of</b> the {{pesticide}} <b>ethephon</b> {{were found at}} a concentration of 1. 65 mg/kg on bell pep-pers during in-house controls of a retail chain. Analyses by the global environmental organi-sation Greenpeace also revealed the active substance in peppers at concentrations up to 4 mg/kg. Through the release <b>of</b> ethylene, <b>ethephon</b> accelerates the ripening process. In the EU, <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> the active substance may not exceed the maximum <b>residue</b> level <b>of</b> 0. 05 mg/kg. Samples that exceed this level may not be distributed on the market. Since children consume relatively high amounts of peppers relative to their body weight, the Federal Insti-tute for Risk Assessment (BfR) finds ethephon residues at a concentration of 1. 65 mg/kg to constitute a possible health hazard for children. At these concentrations, a health hazard for adults is unlikely. In contrast, ethephon residues at a concentration of 4 mg/kg constitute an acute health hazard for the whole population. Thus, BfR estimates an overall slight to mild potential of adverse health effects. Temporary symptoms may include increased urination and diarrhoea...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Nut {{drop in the}} filbert is a {{consequence}} of the senescence of the husk. It is possible to accelerate this process by the application <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> (2 -chloroethyl) phosphonic acid after the nut has abscised {{from the base of the}} husk. This study is an investigation on the physiological effects of the use of this chemical to accelerate husk senescence. By measuring the amount of ethylene evolution following husk treatments <b>of</b> <b>ethephon,</b> it was found that a tremendous increase in the rate of ethylene evolution, which is dependent on the log of the concentration <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> used, occurred during the first day. The rate of ethylene evolution from the husks remained high for over 7 days. Translocation studies <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> from the leaves to the husk were attempted by using both radioactive tracer and biological methods. Ra- dioautographs of filbert stems following foliar applications of ¹⁴C-ethephon showed accumulations of radioactivity in stem tips, lateral buds and husks. In the biological method, rates of ethylene evolution were compared from (1) husks receiving direct ethephon treatments, (2) husks from branches where both the husks and leaves were treated, (3) husks from branches where only the leaves were treated, and (4) husks from untreated control branches. Results from this study revealed a significantly higher rate of ethylene evolution from husks receiving only a foliar ethephon treatment as compared to untreated controls. This indicated that either ethephon or its active derivative was translocated from the leaves to the husks. Such an increase in ethylene evolution occurred in less than a day following ethephon treatments. From these experiments, it is concluded that rapid translocation <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> could be achieved in a source-to-sink manner. The applied ethephon breaks down in the plant, leading to an increase in ethylene evolution, and brings about the acceleration of husk senescence. This conclusion is supported by simple laboratory tests using beans and peas. In both plant species, uptake <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> was found to occur via the roots and leaves. Biological effects following ethephon applications were those typical of ethylene treatments. These responses were observed mainly in fast-growing locations which would serve as strong metabolic sinks...|$|R

Ethephon is a chemical that diffuses into the underlying plant tissues following application then generates the potent plant hormone ethylene in slightly acid or basic conditions in the cytoplasm (Lieberman [1979]) where the effect <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> on endogenous ethylene biosynthesis is transient. This effect occurred in less than 6 days {{in the case of}} apple cuttings (Sun and Bassuk [1993]) although the effect <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> on P. radiata after 1 week was minimal. Once formed, however, ethylene triggered gene expression from each type of tissue at 8 WAT, and these were different in composition (Figure 2) and function (Table 2). Some (25 - 50 %) of the genes expressed at 1 WAT were found to be differentially expressed at 8 WAT, indicating that these genes may form the core response of these tissues to ethephon. Amongst these were at least 8 gene ontology classes that showed bidirectional responses (both up- and down-regulated) to ethephon in the xylem (Table 2). Overall, ethephon acted as a suppressor rather than as a promoter of gene transcription.|$|R

30|$|In {{response}} to biotic stress, conifers secrete an oleoresin that is composed mainly of mono- and diterpenes (Schmidt et al. [2010]).

The traumatic xylem that developed in stems treated with ethephon showed poorly lignified parenchymatous cells suffused with extractives (Figure 5). The lack of change in the size and number of the resin canals indicates that the effect <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> did not extend to the type of resin-duct formation that is associated with terpene synthesis over the time course of this experiment. By contrast, a similar treatment (1 % ethephon in lanolin) had been found previously to induce significant resinification as well as terpene-duct formation in P. halepensis (Yamamoto and Kozlowski [1987 a]).

Moreover, ethephon did not affect gum yield of provenances from drier areas (Sudan). This showed that the water-stress hypothesis has to be refined. The development of ethephon-based tapping systems is promising, but requires further studies with a wider range of environmental conditions and A. senegal provenances. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} aimed to study whether the {{application}} <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> as an abscission agent and mechanical harvest using a trunk shaker {{have any effect}} on plant water status, leaf gas exchange, and yield of mandarin and orange trees cultivated under Mediterranean conditions. The experiment was performed from 2008 to 2011 in five commercial orchards where parameters related to the plant water status and leaf gas exchange were measured before the application <b>of</b> <b>ethephon,</b> at harvest time and at different occasions after harvest. In addition, the effects <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> dose on yield in the current and subsequent seasons were also evaluated. Results showed that ethephon applications and mechanical harvest did not detrimentally affect plant water status in any of the cultivars studied. Furthermore, either had no effect or had a short temporal decrease effect on leaf gas exchange depending on the cultivar studied although with no consequences for the fruit yield obtained during the current season. Increasing ethephon doses led to fruit yield reductions in the mandarin ‘Orogrande’ trees in subsequent seasons. When trunk-shaker and ethephon applications were combined, however, yields from the late-maturing orange significantly decline in subsequent seasons. Overall, results show that using a trunk shaker is a viable technique to mechanically harvest citrus trees destined to both fresh and industry market and can be considered {{as an alternative to the}} traditional manual harvest usually performed under Mediterranean conditions. However, its use cannot be recommended for late-maturing oranges, such as the ‘Navel Lane Late’ in which mature fruit and fruitlets coexist in the tree at the time of harvest...|$|R
40|$|Spain {{ranks as}} the world’s leading {{exporter}} of citrus for fresh consumption. Manual harvest accounts for 50 % of the total production costs. Mechanical harvest would increase labor productivity and benefits of growers. Efficiency of these machines depends on the varieties and operating conditions. Use of abscission chemicals has been promoted to increase the detachment rate of fruit without affecting its quality. This work is aimed at studying whether the mechanical harvest and/or the application of an abscission agent affect {{the quality and quantity}} of harvested fruit and tree defoliation under the conditions of citrus cultivation in Spain. Trials were made in a completely randomized experimental design. From 2008 to 2011, different orchards of mandarin and orange trees were sprayed with different doses <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> as abscission agent and harvested with a trunk shaker. Harvest related variables (detachment percentage, defoliation and fruit without calyx) were measured. The percentage of fruit detached by the trunk shaker ranged between 70 and 85 % and it did not depend on the orchard. The shaker produced minimal damage to the bark when gripped incorrectly. Increased doses <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> increased fruit detachment except in ‘Clemenules’ orchard, but also increased the fruit without calyx in 1 - 9 %. Moreover, ethephon promoted significant defoliation. Neither gummosis nor death of branches was observed. This work demonstrates that mechanical harvesting with trunk shakers may be a feasible solution for citrus cultivated in Spain for fresh market. Use <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> could only be recommended for citrus destined to industry and only for certain varieties...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to study the growth, yield and yield components of maize (Zea mays L.) single cross 704 under different levels of irrigation, plant density and ethephon levels. There were two field experiments during 2003 - 4 and 2004 - 5 growing seasons at the experimental farm of the College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, located at Badjgah. The experimental design was a randomized complete-blocks with four replicates and the treatments in a split-split plot arrangement. Irrigation levels (low and high) were the main plots, the plant densities (53, 333 and 80, 000 plants ha - 1) in the subplots and ethephon levels (0, 0. 56, 0. 84 kg ha - 1 a. i., applied at the 6 -leaf stage) in the sub-subplots. The {{results showed that the}} rates <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> foliar application could {{play an important role in}} the maize growth indices and attributed grain yield components. Application <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> was associated with a decrease in LAI, LAID and CGR. Furthermore, ethephon reduced plant and ear height. Increasing application rates <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> showed a significant reduction in early season plant height and LAI, LAID. The control plants had lower grain yield than those treated with different ethephon levels. Indeed, this research showed that under conditions of water stress, a maize plant is able to make better use of available water if vegetative growth is restricted early in the season. The results also indicated that yield response <b>of</b> maize to <b>ethephon</b> application would vary with the plant density and available water conditions. Ethephon treatment was found to be more beneficial to the grain yield at higher plant densities and water stress conditions and it is worthy of further investigations...|$|R

Under these conditions, protopectins reached low levels precociously compared to the control and even a lower level than that recorded at the total maturity of the control.|$|R
40|$|Although {{ethephon}} ([2 -chloroethyl]phosphonic acid) {{is often}} used {{as a form of}} liquid ethylene in studies of seed germination, it is not known if ethylene evolved from ethephon in the seed is sufficient to elicit the desired response and/or if ethephon has a regulatory action that alone accounts for the response. For these reasons we studied the uptake and fate of [1, 2 - 14 C]ethephon in dormant seeds of Avena fatua, Sinapis arvensis, Thlaspi arvense, and Chenopodium album. The radioactivity within the seeds was separated into a labile carbon-labeled ethephon/ethylene fraction (64 - 87 %) and, following extraction in methanol-chloroform-water (12 : 5 : 3), into fractions associated with insoluble (12 - 29 %) and soluble (3 - 8 %) seed constituents. The radioactivity associated with seed constituents was reduced 5 to 75 % by hot alkaline hydrolysis (2. 5 n KOH, 70 ° C for 1 hour). Although a small portion <b>of</b> the <b>ethephon</b> (or metabolite <b>of</b> ethephon/ethylene) taken up by the seeds is tightly bound to the tissues, our results indicate that, at the appropriate external concentrations <b>of</b> <b>ethephon,</b> the amount <b>of</b> ethylene evolved from ethephon within the seeds is sufficient to produce the desired ethylene mediated responses. However, factors affecting the decomposition <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> must be considered in the decision as to whether to use ethephon as a liquid supply of ethylene...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> application (Agrostym 480 SL) on the yield and yield structure of five processing tomato cultivars (Rumba, Hubal, Sokal F 1, Mieszko F 1 and Polset F 1). The experiment was carried out in the open field in the years 2009 - 2011 in Mydlniki near Kraków, Poland. Two weeks before harvesting, half of the plants of each cultivar were treated with Agrostym 480 SL (3 dm 3 ha- 1) and the other half were left as a control without spraying. Marketable yield included properly shaped and welldeveloped light red and red fruits. Non-marketable yield included pink and turning fruits, mature green and breaker fruits, and diseased fruits. A generalized linear model (GLM) for Poisson distribution with the log link function was used to determine the relationship between the years of the study and cultivar and selected values of the yield structure. The yield structure of tomato depended significantly on the weather conditions during the growing period in different years of the study, on the cultivar, and on the use <b>of</b> <b>ethephon.</b> Ethephon had a particularly beneficial effect on yield structure in the years with an unfavourable distribution <b>of</b> precipitation. <b>Ethephon</b> application in the years 2009 and 2010 had a beneficial effect on the health of tomato plants...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{index for}} the ethanol industry is the sucrose yield in sugarcane, which {{is affected by}} plant ability to accumulate sucrose during ripening. Despite the known efficiency of treatments such as water restriction {{and the application of}} regulators to stimulate the sucrose storage in culms, {{little is known about the}} physiological responses of the plant that lead to ripening. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses of sugarcane to different ripening treatments. Two varieties, IACSP 95 - 5000, with high yield, and IACSP 94 - 2094, with moderate yield were subjected to water deficit or application <b>of</b> chemical regulator (<b>ethephon</b> 480 g ha(- 1)) and both treatments associated. Growth, accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves and culms were measured. It can be concluded that the effects <b>of</b> <b>ethephon</b> on sugarcane are genotype-dependent. Ethephon stimulates sucrose accumulation in the culm and the photosynthate supply by the source in the responsive variety (IACSP 95 - 5000). Such effects are not associated with growth restriction. In relation to the drought combined with the application <b>of</b> <b>ethephon,</b> the responsive variety shows increased sucrose content in culm at the same level as when ethephon is applied alone, hence treatments have no additive effects on sugarcane ripening...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the alleviative effects of calcium acetate on defoliation and fruit drop induced by the spray <b>of</b> <b>Ethephon</b> (2 -chloro-ethylphosphonic acid) solution {{which is used to}} accelerate the degreening of ponkan, Citrus reticulata Blanco, fruit. The effect of Figaron (Ethyl 5 -chloro- 1 H- 3 -indazolyl acetate) on degreening was also investigated. In experiment 1, a split-plot design was employed where the main plots consisted of three levels <b>of</b> <b>Ethephon</b> concentration (0, 200, 400, ppm) and six replicates, while the sub-plots consisted of four limbs designated to four levels of calcium acetate added (0, 0. 2, 1. 5 %). The spray treatment was done on November 1, and Ethephon and calcium acetate were mixed just before the spray application. Ethephon substantially increased defoliation and fruit drop, however, this was almost completely prevented by the addition <b>of</b> calcium acetate. <b>Ethephon</b> markedly increased the coloration of ponkan fruit. The addition of calcium acetate slightly decreased the color acceleration, but the color was still considerably increased when compared with the unsprayed control group. In experiment 2, 200 ppm Ethephon with 1 % calcium acetate and 200 ppm Figaron treatments were compared as a factorial combination consisting of four treatments. Figaron was sprayed on September 9, and Ethephon on November 4. No defoliation and fruit drop were observed in any treatment plots. Ethephon with calcium acetate remarkably accelerated degreening and coloration of ponkan fruit. Figaron also appreciably improved fruit color but no additive effects <b>of</b> <b>Ethephon</b> and Figaron treatments were observed over Ethephon treatment alone. It is suggested that spraying 200 ppm Ethephon mixed with 1 % calcium acetate in early November accelerates degreening and coloration without defoliation and fruit drop, and the method is commercially feasible. ポンカン(Citrus reticulata Blanco) 果実の着色促進にエスレル(2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid) を散布する際の,酢酸カルシウム混用による落葉・落果防止効果を検討した。またフィガロン(Ethyl 5 -chloro- 1 H- 3 -indazolylacetate) の着色促進効果も試験した。実験 1 では分割区法でエスレル濃度(0, 200, 400 ppm) と酢酸カルシウム濃度(0, 0. 2, 1, 5 %) を組みあわせ, 11 月 1 日に散布した。高濃度のエスレルで落葉・落果が増加したが,酢酸カルシウムの混用により,落葉・落果が抑制された。エスレルによる着色は著しく促進されたが,酢酸カルシウムの混用はいく分その効果を弱めた。実験 2 では要因配置法で 1 %酢酸カルシウム混用 200 ppmエスレル散布,無散布と, 200 ppmフィガロン散布,無散布をくみあわせ, 4 処理の試験を行なった。フィガロンは 9 月 9 日,エスレルは 11 月 4 日に散布した。どの区でも落葉・落果はほとんど認められなかった。エスレルは着色を著しく促進した。フィガロンも着色を促進したがエスレルには劣った。エスレル,フィガロンともに果実中の糖やクエン酸含量に影響を及ぼさなかった。 1 %酢酸カルシウム混用 200 ppmエスレルの 11 月上旬散布がポンカンの着色促進のため実用化できると考えられる...|$|R
