5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E

While fighting against this, Periyar advocated to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States.

5|$|Internal {{conflicts}} {{characterized the}} last decades of the 13th century in the Kingdom of Hungary. For instance, a feud between King BÃ©la and his son, Stephen caused a civil war which lasted from 1261 to 1266.

5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Not only {{is there}} no reason to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain {{remained}} unsubdued, the Spaniards in America ought {{to take it back}} and resume command over it.

If even a single member of the Central Junta of Seville were to land on our shores, we should receive him as the Sovereign.|$|E

5|$|The prisoners {{believed}} {{that they would be}} rewarded by the Empress Anna for getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hated Apokaukos,.

As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who {{were glad to}} be <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of}} the equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by any actual power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern ÅanlÄ±urfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E

5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail {{to tell the story}} and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

Rambabu then takes his family out on a trip to Vizianagaram, where they attend a religious meeting, watch a movie and dine at a restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Haig's {{solution}} to this diplomatic crisis was a compromise. Alderson {{was transferred to the}} nominal post of Inspector-General of Canadian Forces and the highly effective Sir Julian Byng replaced him in command of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, supported by Sir Arthur Currie, who had succeeded Alderson in command of the 1st Canadian Division. In exchange, Haig finally got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ross rifle, all Canadian troops being reissued LeeâEnfields in preparation for the upcoming Battle of the Somme. Alderson was not made aware of the purely nominal nature of his position until later, when he requested a staff car and was informed that he was no longer entitled to one. In September 1916, Alderson became Inspector of Infantry in the British Army, a position he retained until 1920, when he retired from active service at the age of 61.|$|E
