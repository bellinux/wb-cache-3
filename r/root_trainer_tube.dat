40|$|Spruce (Picea Smithiana) is an {{evergreen}} {{tree and}} distributed through the temperate Himalaya at {{the elevation of}} 2000 - 3500 m. Natural regeneration of spruce (Picea smithiana) is generally slow and almost negligible due {{to a number of}} factors e. g. presence of un decomposed raw humus on forest floor low germinative capacity of seed and infrequent good seed years. In order to supple-ment natural regeneration through artificial means, nursery raising assumes significance. The present study aimed at optimizing the <b>root</b> <b>trainer</b> container size and the potting mixture ingre-dients and their proportion for the production of quality nursery stock of Picea smithiana. Nine combinations of potting mixture ingredients (Forest Soil, Garden Soil, Sand, FYM and Lake weed) were tested in various ratios for the optimization of potty mixture in different <b>root</b> <b>trainer</b> sizes. Simultaneously, three different volumes (150 cc, 250 cc and 300 cc) of <b>root</b> <b>trainers</b> were tested for suitability of container size. Chemical and physical analysis of potting mixture ingredients was carried out for better understanding of nutrient status. The best seedling growth at seven mont...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the production of cedar seedlings according to the size of containers and nutrient sources. It was tested three types of containers (<b>Root</b> <b>trainers,</b> plastic bag and plastic vase), three sources of fertilization (Conventional, Kimcoat® and Osmocote®) in seven evaluations. The cedar seedlings in <b>root</b> <b>trainers,</b> fertilized with source Osmocote® presented the greatest increments in height and stem diameter when compared to another sources of fertilization.

Vertical ribs inside the trainer are positioned to train the roots to grow downwards and so prevent root spiralling.|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the effects of various container designs on growth and root deformation of Eucalyptus viminalis. Eucalyptus was selected for the study because of its ability to produce deep roots and its acceptability in landscaping industry of all Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The experiment was carried out over two years. In the first year, three-month-old bare root seedlings of E. viminalis were transplanted into three different containers, namely, <b>Root</b> <b>trainers,</b> spring rings and conventional containers. After a period of one-year growth, a subset of plants from each treatment lot was destructively harvested to determine the growth parameters, shoot, and dry mass weight and root deformation. At the beginning of the second year, the remaining plants in the containers were transplanted into open field to study the landscape performance of container-grown plants. For the plants grown in containers, {{there were no significant differences}} noticed on shoot characteristics among the containers. The poorest root architecture was observed in conventional pots; whereas, spring rings and <b>root</b> <b>trainers</b> reduced the percentage of deformed root mass. When the plants were transplanted to an arid landscape, plant height, and dry biomass did not significantly differ between the treatments. However, the plants grown in <b>root</b> <b>trainers</b> produced largest <b>roots,</b> well-distributed in the soil and detected less deformed roots than the other containers. The effect of the spring rings on plants grown in the landscape was obvious visually during research period in the short-term, but was not apparent from growth quantification. To obtain quality tree seedlings to support the horticultural industry, it is recommended to continue the application of R&D on container and plant relation.

5000|$|What this {{achieves}} is {{to encourage}} the roots the grow a denser system of root hairs. How it does this {{is to have the}} pots designed so as to air prune the roots.The advantage is when the plant is planted into its home environment it has a stronger root base to start with. When polythene bags are used instead, this root tends to go through the bag into the ground and is then broken off when the tree is moved for planting. The other roots are insufficiently developed to cope with the shock caused by this and so the tree's chances of survival are reduced. The <b>root</b> <b>trainer</b> is mounted in a stand above ground so that, when the tap root emerges, it is dried by the air. This air pruning causes the root inside the pot to thicken with stored carbohydrates that support vigorous root growth when the plant is put in the ground. [...] The other lateral roots of the plant grow to compensate for this—so a stronger root ball forms, which improves the sapling's chances.|$|R
40|$|To {{optimize}} nursery {{practices for}} efficient plant production procedures {{and to keep}} up to the ever growing demand of seedlings, identification of the most suitable species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), specific for a given tree species, is clearly a necessary task. Sixty days old seedlings of Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) raised in <b>root</b> <b>trainers</b> were inoculated with six species of AMF and a mixed inoculum (consortia) and kept in green house. Performances of the treatments on this tree species were evaluated in terms of growth parameters like plant height shoot collar diameter, biomass and phosphorous uptake capabilities. Significant and varied increase in the growth parameters and phosphorous uptake was observed {{for most of the}} AMF species against control. Consortia culture was found to be the best suited AMF treatment for A. indica, while Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae were the best performing single species cultures. It {{is the first time in}} the state of Gujarat that a wide variety of AMF species, isolated from the typical semi-arid region of western India, were tested for the best growth performance with one of the most important tree species for the concerned region...|$|R
40|$|Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are invasive, {{non-native}} {{animals and}} their populations have increased {{dramatically in the}} United States over the past 20 years. Now found in more than 45 states, wild pigs cause over $ 1. 5 billion/year in crop damage nationally and over $ 30 million/ year of agriculture and forestry damage in Alabama. As such, private landowners, agricultural producers, and {{state and federal agencies}} have allocated significantly greater resources toward managing wild pig damage. Lethal removal, through the use of cage, corral, or box traps, remains the most cost-effective, efficient, and practical means for managing local wild pig populations. Whereas the specific dimensions of these traps may vary, trap doors typically fall into two designs: continuous-catch and single-catch. Continuous-catch doors are onedirectional doors that allow additional animals to enter the trap after the door is initially triggered closed. This is achieved by door panels that swing open in one direction only, allowing animals to enter the trap but not exit. Continuous-catch doors have been advocated as the preferred door design based solely on intuitive reasoning that these doors will allow additional pigs to enter the trap after the door closes and result in a greater number of individuals being captured. However, anecdotal evidence from several professional wild pig trappers suggests continuous-catch doors rarely result in additional captures once the trap door closes. In this project, we examined the relative effectiveness of three continuous-catch door designs (<b>root,</b> saloon, <b>trainer)</b> to allow additional wild pigs to enter closed traps. This study was conducted on four sites in central and southwest Alabama during the summer of 2011. Results from data collected over only one season of one year indicate the overall entrance through closed continuous-catch doors was minimal (4. 9 %), refuting commonly held beliefs that these doors substantially increase capture rates of wild pigs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Securing {{the airway}} using a tube {{exchanger}} catheter {{is an important}} and useful technique in anesthesia. Its success is mainly hampered by tube tip impingement of laryngeal structures. Advancing the tracheal tube along its normal curvature via a tube exchanger catheter has {{a high risk of}} tube tip impingement mainly of right laryngeal structures. The authors achieved successful clinical experience by rotating the tracheal tube 90 ° anticlockwise (ventral tube tip position) before railroading the tube via a tube exchanger catheter or a fiber optic bronchoscope through the larynx. AIM The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the influence of the tracheal tube tip position while intubating an airway <b>trainer</b> over a <b>tube</b> exchange catheter. MATERIAL AND METHODS Volunteer anesthetists with varying years of professional experience were asked to intubate an intubation mannequin (Laerdal Airway Management Trainer) using the orotracheal route with an established tube exchange catheter (Cook Airway Exchange Catheter, 11 F). Two different brands of tracheal tubes (Rüsch and Covidien, ID 7. 0 mm) were used in a randomized order, each with the tracheal tube tip at first positioned right (90 °), then ventrally (0 °), left (270 °) and finally dorsally (180 °), resulting in eight intubation attempts for each participant. To ensure the correct tube tip position the tube was withdrawn before every intubation attempt until the tube tip position was visualized. The oropharnyx, larynx, trachea and tube were sufficiently lubricated with silicon spray (Rüsch Silikospray). The tube and airway exchange catheter size selection were made according to the clinical trial of Loudermilk et al. Successful endotracheal intubation without resistance was recorded for each tube tip position and tracheal tube brand. RESULTS In total 20 anesthetists (13 consultants and 7 residents) with a median of 9. 5 years (range 3 - 37 years) of professional experience participated in the study. Overall 160 intubation attempts were performed, 2 participants showed no successful intubation attempts at all and 38 out of 160 intubation attempts (23. 8 [*]%) were successful. Intubation success with the tracheal tube tip placed ventrally (0 °) was 60 [*]% followed by the left (270 °) and right (90 °) tracheal tube tip positions with 27. 5 % and 7. 5 [*]% intubation success, respectively. With the tube tip placed dorsally (180 °) none of the 40 intubation attempts were successful. Intubation attempts with the Rüsch tube were more successful (28. 8 [*]%) than those with the Covidien tube (18. 8 [*]%). Placing the tracheal tube tip ventrally, the Rüsch tube was twice as successful as the Covidien tube with 16 (80 [*]%) versus 8 attempts (40 [*]%, p[*]=[*] 0. 011). There was no correlation between professional experience and intubation success (p[*]=[*] 0. 362). CONCLUSION Tube insertion via an airway exchange catheter or a fiberoptic bronchoscope is a basic technique in anesthesia. Knowledge about the difficulties and their prevention are essential for every anesthetist. The gap between the airway exchange catheter, the fiber bronchoscope and the tube diameters is one of the major reasons for tube tip impingement. This investigation showed that intubation success via a tube exchange catheter, as investigated in an intubation mannequin, is considerably influenced by the tracheal tube tip position. A 90 ° anticlockwise rotation, placing the tracheal tube tip ventrally, considerably increased intubation success. This is of particular importance if an anesthesia department has no appropriately sized tube exchange catheters or fiber bronchoscope for every age group of patients...|$|R
