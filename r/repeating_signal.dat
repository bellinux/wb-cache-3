40|$|Received 3 June 2014; {{accepted}} 20 October 2015 /Open {{for discussion}} until 31 October 2016 This paper presents {{the original design}} of a side-discharge valve based transient generator that can produce two types of pseudorandom binary signals: a maximum length binary signal and an inverse <b>repeat</b> <b>signal.</b> These two signals are both wide bandwidth, persistent and periodic, but the inverse <b>repeat</b> <b>signal</b> has the advantageous property that it is antisymmetric within each period. The two signals are used to extract the frequency response function of a single water pipeline in the laboratory. The experimental results demonstrate that the frequency response function extracted by the inverse <b>repeat</b> <b>signal</b> {{is closer to the}} theoretical linear results as obtained from the transfer matrix method due to it being able to cancel the effect of even-order nonlinearities. The customized transient generator is then applied to a pipeline with a leak. The location of the leak is successfully determined using the first three resonant peaks as extracted by the inverse <b>repeat</b> <b>signal.</b> Jinzhe Gong, Martin F. Lambert, Aaron C.

50|$|Project Star Talk {{is based}} at a UK radio {{telescope}} site, its mission is to listen for radio signals from other intelligences. Dr. Joe Burke (Simon Oates) {{is the head of}} the project assisted by his small team consisting of electronics expert Ben Keller (Stanley Meadows) and office manager Sandy Lund (Zena Marshall). Due to the lack of success reported by the Site Manager, Dr. Henry Shore (Max Adrian), Project Star Talk is given 90 days in order to report positive results. During this period an accountant, Mr. Yellowlees (Charles Hawtrey) is sent to look over the project's accounts. As luck would have it, a <b>repeating</b> <b>signal</b> is received by the project, but the signal is only coming from a small asteroid with no atmosphere in the outer Solar System. Despite this, Dr. Burke spends the balance of his grant to equip the telescope with a powerful transmitter to contact the source of the signals. The night of the transmission, Mr. Yellowlees and Mrs. Jones (Patricia Hayes) who runs the tea trolley, stay to witness this historic event. While waiting for a response, Dr. Burke tells of his father's discovery at an archaeological dig in France of a cube that gave him strange dreams as a boy, inspiring him to become an astronomer. The signal is sent and reaches the asteroid. The asteroid has on it a huge installation that receives the radio signal and answers it with a spaceship sent riding down the radio beam to the point of transmission. When the spacecraft arrives at Project Star Talk, it picks up the transmitter shed and carries it, the project staff and the 2 witnesses to the alien installation. The telescope staff's leader believes, despite eyewitnesses that the transmitter shed exploded, killing the Star Talk team.|$|E
5000|$|Karl Jansky {{made the}} {{discovery}} of the first astronomical radio source serendipitously in the early 1930s. As an engineer with Bell Telephone Laboratories, he was investigating static that interfered with short wave transatlantic voice transmissions. Using a large directional antenna, Jansky noticed that his analog pen-and-paper recording system kept recording a <b>repeating</b> <b>signal</b> of unknown origin. Since the signal peaked about every 24 hours, Jansky originally suspected the source of the interference was the Sun crossing the view of his directional antenna. Continued analysis showed that the source was not following the 24-hour daily cycle of the Sun exactly, but instead repeating on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes. Jansky discussed the puzzling phenomena with his friend, astrophysicist and teacher Albert Melvin Skellett, who pointed out that the time between the signal peaks was the exact length of a sidereal day, the time it took for [...] "fixed" [...] astronomical objects, such as a star, to passed in front of the antenna every time the Earth rotated. By comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps, Jansky eventually concluded that the radiation source peaked when his antenna was aimed at the densest part of the Milky Way in the constellation of Sagittarius. He concluded that since the Sun (and therefore other stars) were not large emitters of radio noise, the strange radio interference may be generated by interstellar gas and dust in the galaxy. (Jansky's peak radio source, one of the brightest in the sky, was designated Sagittarius A in the 1950s and, instead of being galactic [...] "gas and dust", was later hypothesized to be emitted by electrons in a strong magnetic field. Current thinking is that these are ions in orbit around a massive Black hole {{at the center of the}} galaxy at a point now designated as Sagitarius A*. The asterisk indicates that the particles at Sagitarius A are ionized.)Jansky announced his discovery in 1933. He wanted to investigate the radio waves from the Milky Way in further detail, but Bell Labs reassigned him to another project, so he did no further work in the field of astronomy. His pioneering efforts in the field of radio astronomy have been recognized by the naming of the fundamental unit of flux density, the jansky (Jy), after him.|$|E

In this paper, we extend shift-ACF to analyze the spectral structure of <b>repeating</b> <b>signal</b> components by using a subband decomposition. Subsequently, an algorithm for repeated event detection and extraction is proposed. An evaluation shows that the proposed subband shift-ACF outperforms detection based on classical cepstrum.

40|$|In {{the last}} years we have {{developed}} several features for robustly representing <b>repeating</b> <b>signal</b> components [1]. A main focus in this was the robust detection of such signal components in real-world audio recordings. Applications included bioacoustical monitoring [2] (e. g., detection of repeating bird calls or sounds of marine mammals) and speech detection [3]. In the latter, the harmonic structure of voiced signal parts constitute the repeating components. One of my interests during the Dagstuhl seminar was to discuss possible applications of such features in music structure analysis. Generally speaking, repetitions {{can be seen as}} building blocks for more complex structure elements of audio signals, which is particularly obvious for music. Thus, another interesting thing discussed at the seminar was that of possible generalizations of the repetition-based features proposed in [2] to represent such complex structures. As a third possible application, the usability of such features to the extraction and separation of mixtures of repeating components (e. g, for multipitch extraction [3] or the detection of overlapping rhythmic components) was discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{different}} manufacturing applications {{the assessment}} of the health conditions of a machine tool, together with the quality and stability of the process, requires the capability of dealing with response variables described in terms of profile data. In the frame of in-process monitoring of sensor signals this is the case, for instance, of monitoring either series production of large lots of parts or machining processes characterized by cyclic signals, where both the condition of the machine components and the final quality of the worked piece may be correlated with the stability of <b>repeating</b> <b>signal</b> profiles in time. However, as far as real time data acquisition is concerned, and when measurements are performed with high sampling frequency, data are likely to be auto-correlated, and hence it is of fundamental importance to develop adaptive monitoring tools robust with respect to non-steady state conditions. The paper deals with the utilization of profile monitoring approaches for in-process monitoring of manufacturing operations and investigates their applicability to the problem of monitoring auto-correlated signals. In particular Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied in combination with an adaptive approach based on a moving time window for continuously revise the reference model is evaluated and discussed. A real case study is used to test the performances of the method: the task is to detect tool chipping and breakage in end milling operations by means of real-time monitoring of cutting force signals. The evolution of tool wear imposes a trend in observed signals which leads to the need for an adaptive approach to properly isolate the breakage event from the slow pattern change due to wear mechanism...|$|E
