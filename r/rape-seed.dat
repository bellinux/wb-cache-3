Thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and <b>rape-seed,</b> &c., in our fields, because the seeds are in great excess compared {{with the number of}} birds which feed on them; nor can the birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season, increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their numbers are checked during winter: but any one who has tried, knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden: I have in this case lost every single seed. This view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation, explains, I believe, some singular facts in nature, such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots where they do occur; and that of some social plants being social, that is, abounding in individuals, even on the extreme confines of their range. For in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist together, and thus save the species from utter destruction. I should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing, and {71} the ill effects of close interbreeding, probably come into play in some of these cases; but on this intricate subject I will not here enlarge.|$|E

40|$|Many {{antipodal}} distinctions may {{be described}} between paddy field and upland field which {{are two of}} the principal forms of cultivated land in Japanese agriculture. In comparison with paddy field, upland field is the form of cultivated land which is utilized for growing crops other than rice without the flooding use of water. It usually meant that upland farming was less profitable than rice farming on paddy field. As the result, every effort had been spent through generations in Japan to turn farm land into paddy field with irrigation facilities. However, the social and technological progress has increased in the possibility of artificial irrigation in upland field, {{and as a matter of}} fact, irrigated farming has been developed gradually in Japan, especially since the Second World War. Farming in upland farming areas became more intensive by irrigation. But the increase in intensity was usually brought about with the changes in the kind of crops, i. e., from less intensive to more intensive one, and also with the increase in the intensity level of multiple cropping, so that the effects of irrigation on upland farming was not so simple to be determined. If a new crop has been introduced to farm organization or if its intensity level has been shifted as the result of water use, it would necessarily bring about a great influence on the types of farming as well as the size of farm business. The authors intended to study the effects of irrigation upon changes in both the intensity and the type of farm organization in upland farming. Ayagawa Irrigation District, Miyazaki Prefecture, was the area from where the present data were acquired. Four types of farms including 22 farms all together with various vegetables in the open field were selected and enumerated for this study. They were (1) medium-sized farms with ordinary vegetables in the open field (4 farms), (2) large-sized farms with vegetables in the open field (7 farms), (3) farms with vegetables grown in both the open field and the vinylhouse (6 farms), and (4) farms with vegetables in the open field and tobacco (5 farms). The results of the present study may be summarized as follows. 1. A remarkable change had been occurred in the traditional structure of upland farming particularly during the period of years of the 1960 ’s. One of the most significant changes observed in upland farming areas in southern Kyushu was the transfer of crops from ordinary crops such as sweet potato, wheat and barley, <b>rape-seeds,</b> soybean and azuki-bean to vegetables of various kinds, forage crops and industrial crops. The factors which affected the changes seemed to be attributable to (1) changes in consumption and demand of foods, (2) international trade and price level in domestic market, (3) technological development including the development in farm mechanization, in technique of growing crops in vinylhouse, chemical control of pests and disease, and so forth. The changes of upland farming was much more striking in the irrigation areas. 2. The ratio of water use has been gradually increased in Ayagawa Irrigation District. At that time, the main purposes of water use were (1) crop protection from drought, (2) preparation of seed-bed, (3) crop protection from pests and disease, (4) dust-cleaning, (5) washing products before shipping and (6) cooling of cowshed. A great diversity in the purposes was one of the characteristic features of water use in the case of irrigated areas in southern Kyushu. 3. The ratio of water use was relatively high on farms with vegetables in the open field, especially on medium-sized one. In spite of high intensity of water use as well as land use on medium-sized farms, the amount of farm earnings was the smallest on this group of farms probably due to small size in the total volume of farm business. 4. Large-sized farms with vegetables in the open field seemed to have a larger possibility in adopting crop rotation system on irrigated upland field. However, reasonable crop rotation system has not been established yet on this type of farms. 5. Farms with both types of vegetables grown in the open field and vinylhouse were more intensive than farms with vegetables only in the open field. The amount of farm earnings was remarkably larger, but the ratio of land use was low. It was because that the vinylhouse were usually fixed for many years on the particular field and most of the family labor had to be put into crops in the vinylhouse. The conflicts as for land utilization seemed to be severe on this type of farms. 6. Farms with vegetables in the open field and tobacco also had conflicts to a considerable extent as for land use, since tobacco was the main crop on this type of farms. Vegetables in the open field had been grown less intensively and the ratio of water use relatively low. on farms belonging to this type. 7. Water use on upland field affected to increase in the acreage of vegetables in the open field and in the degree of intensity of land use, but tended at the same time to accelerate the diversification of crops and differentiation of types of farming in the case of Ayagawa Irrigation District. Larger-sized farms with various kinds of vegetables grown in the open field seemed to be the type of farms which ought to be encouraged in increase in number from the viewpoint of land and water use. Then, new crop rotation systems which will utilize water resource more effectively and irrigation system including flooding use of water seems desirable to be developed for the future development of upland farming. 我が国の畑作農業を水田稲作農業を対比する場合の二重の格差-地目差と作目差-は,近年,一定の変化をみせている. まず,作目差についてみると,我が国農業の戦後段階を画した昭和 30 年代の後半以降の開放経済体制下において,開放体系に組み入れられ,国際貿易の波にさらされた作目と,保護体系にのり,価格政策や補助金政策の対象になった作目との大きな格差がつくられた. 開放体系の作目は麦を筆頭に,甘藷,大豆等の普通畑作物が多かったため,畑作地帯の土地利用と農業経営の衰退と転換が進行したのは周知のとおりである. 麦の生産縮小が起ったため水田裏作が後退し,水田利用も停滞したが,米は保護されていたから相対的には水田農業は安定していたといえよう. しかし,この格差要因は二つの点で崩れかかっている. 第 1 は,保護されてきた作目では,それへの作付集中のため 2 ̆ 2 生産過剰 2 ̆ 2 が発現したこと. 果樹(ミカン),酪農(牛乳),稲作(米) などがそうである. 旧来の 2 ̆ 2 保護作目 2 ̆ 2 の有利性は損なわれてきたのである. 第 2 に, 2 ̆ 2 保護作目 2 ̆ 2 が保護対象からはずされ,自由化されてきたことである. 今日ほとんどすべての農産物が国際競争市場に巻き込まれつつあるという意味で作目間の格差は縮少してきた. もちろん今日の時点でも水田=稲作を技術,価格,流通,制度等の点で他の作目と比較した相対的有利性が失なわれたわけではないが,かつてのような隔絶の格差は無くなってきている. 地目差についてみると,畑作物の収益性が相対的に高い地域では水田との地価格差が縮小してきているという事実があるが,技術的側面からみても,水田転作が行われるようになって以来,水田の汎用化が課題となっている点に注目しなければならない. 水田の汎用化とは水田においても夏期に畑作物の生育が可能なように基盤整備を行うことであるが,これが政策的一時的対応ではなく,水田二毛作農業の発展形態としての田畑輪換にまで至るものであれば,地目差の縮少･解消への一歩として評価されるであろう. 一方,畑地潅漑も畑地における灌漑農業の成立を通して,経営追加投資に充分リスポンスする土地条件を創出し,地目格差の縮少を目指す技術である. このような条件によって相対的には畑地と水田の格差は変化しつつあるといえよう. ただ,現実には種々の形態と方法でこのような方向が追求されてきているとはいえ,その実現は生産力の正常な展開条件が損なわれている状況下では,様々な困難をもっている. 本稿では,畑地灌漑による灌漑農業の成立を地目格差の縮少と自由な作目選択を保証する条件として考察した. 具体的には南九州における畑地灌漑事業の実施に伴う畑作経営の再編成を産地野菜作を調査対象にして分析した. そこではまず,畑灌の前史としての南九州における畑作土地利用と畑作生産力の変貌を顧みた. 概ね南九州では昭和 40 年代の入り口で大きな転換を迎えたが,そこでは普通畑作の生産条件が崩壊し,低位均衡の生産力構造にも変革が迫られた. 種々の摸索の結果,新たな作目として飼料作物,工芸作,野菜作が登場するとともに,それらの主産地化が進んだ. この過程においては,旧来の作付体系にとって代わって新たな基幹作物を柱にした土地利用体系が形成された. このような場合,しばしば経営方式の専一化･専作化がもたらされるのであるが,南九州においては他の地域と異なり,地力維持や堆厩肥の確保に比較的配慮した経営方式がとられた(中島, 1984). とはいえ,畑作農業における機械化･化学化や畑地灌漑による水利用はこの地域においても土地利用の分化･固定化を招き,連作障害の発生や地力の低下を生じるまでになっている. 今日,以上述べたような土地利用の集約化とともに,他方では耕作放棄や土地利用の粗放化がみられ,それに対する経営的対応が迫られることになったのである. 綾川土地改良事業は昭和 46 年に完工して以来,取水量が着実に増加し,畑灌としての利用も高まっている. しかし,それには地域的偏差が大きく,地目構成の相違が大きな要因であるが,作目の差もしだいに水利用の多寡の大きな要因になりつつある. すなわち,圃場で水利用が行なわれているのは施設および露地の野菜作や茶園であって,普通畑作や飼料作物へは,ほとんど利用されていないのである. そのため畑灌は,農業経営方式にとっては経営部門結合の分化力として作用しているのが現状である. ここには,畑灌が未だ充分に土地利用体系の中に組み込まれ,確立された技術になっていないことが示されている. 我々は,露地野菜作を調査対象に選んだ. 畑地灌漑に伴う経営方式と経営規模の再編成が最も典型的にみられると考えたからである. 露地野菜作は,この地域では中位の集約度をもった作目である. したがって畑灌による水を利用して露地野菜作を,経営部門として導入することは一種の内延的規模拡大であるが,露地野菜作で専業的自立を図るには一定の耕作規模を確保する必要がある. このことを勘案して調査では次の四類型を抽出した. ①露地野菜中規模経常(4 戸) ②露地野菜大規模経営(7 戸) ③露地+施設野菜経営(6 戸) ④タバコ+露地野菜経営(5 戸). 調査結果の概要は表- 7 に示してある. 調査結果によると, 1. 露地野菜作での専業限界はこの地域では 160 aの前後であった. 露地野菜中経営では灌水率は高く,土地利用は極めて集約に行なわれているが,規模が類型の中では最小であるため所得形成力は弱い. また,土地利用方式は連作的になっており,経営面積の小ささが制約になっているとみられる. 2. 露地野菜大経営は,露地中経営に比べると経営面積に余裕があるため,露地野菜と普通畑作を組み合わせた輪作体系によって土地利用の適正化を図ることが可能なのであるが,実態はそうなっていない. 露地野菜作の収益性が低いということが一つの原因であるが,灌水率が低いことにもみられるように水利用が充分でなく,畑灌を利用した土地利用技術の形成が未展開であることが大きな原因である. 3. 露地中経営の規模の限界を内包的に克服したのが露地+施設経営である. 労働の集約的な投下がその成立条件である. 集約度が高く収益水準も高いが,土地利用上は施設圃場の固定化とそれ以外の圃場の粗放化がみられる. それと同時に,施設規模に労働力,土地利用の両面から限界があることが問題点である. 4. タバコ+露地野菜経営はタバコ作に補完的に結合した野菜作である. したがって他の形態の露地野菜作に比べて土地利用上の矛盾は小さい. しかし,タバコ作が基幹的であるだけに,野菜作は付随的であり,粗放にならざるを得ないのである. 5. 畑灌は露地野菜作でかんばつ防止的に使われているほか,大根の洗浄水としての利用や防除用水としての利用が進んでおり,畑灌が露地野菜の導入,拡大の基礎条件であったことが確認できる. 6. しかし,水利用は現在の段階では経営部門の結合関係には分化力として作用している. それは例えば,露地野菜作の導入,拡大が畜産部門の縮小,放棄になっており,堆厩肥を外給化せざるを得なくなっていることにも示される. 7. 畑灌が新たな土地利用方式を実現するための統合力として機能するためには,普通畑作物(禾本科作物) や飼料作物への水利用技術の開発とそれによる輪作体系の確立,湛水的利用や田畑輪換技術の開発が必要である. 最後に,南九州の社会経済条件,自然条件を考慮に入れ,畑作経営の展開を展望する時,一定の耕作規模をもった輪作的土地利用方式および家畜飼養による地力維持方式の確立とそれを担う経営主体の形成とは不可欠であるように思われる. これが個別の経営主体の下で行われるべきか,一定の地域の中で地域複合的に行われるべきかは問わないとして,畑地灌漑は輪作体系に組み込まれる集約作物栽培の前提条件となるばかりでなく,土地管理,地力維持の面でも効果を発揮できるはずである. まずは輪作的土地利用の実現可能性をもった露地野菜規模経営において露地野菜を組み込んだ輪作体系の確立と水を利用した土壌管理,地力維持方式の確立が求められている...|$|R

The accumulation of lipid was preceded by a marked rise in acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, which declined rapidly, correlating with the decline in rate of lipid formation. Incubation of <b>rape-seed</b> extracts with avidin-agarose resulted in a decrease in acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in the extract.

40|$|Dairy {{farming in}} Finland is {{historically}} {{a mode of}} family farming, although modes like dairy farm companies and collaborative farms are increasing. Organic farmers are relatively young, well educated and their farms are modern and in the average, rather large. The use of automated milking systems (AMS) allows larger cattle sizes and makes work easier compared with previous methods. The organic cows’ feed is mainly grown on the farm, which makes organic milk production truly local business. The feeding is based on clover-grass silage, barley, oats, pea and <b>rape-seed,</b> the latter being often commercial. The organic cows produce about 8 000 kg milk yearly featuring a fairly reasonable level of intensity. The relatively small cattle sizes support disease control, and salmonella prevalence is extremely low...|$|E

This approach is based on micro-eco-nomic theory principles and is put into practice by means of mathematical programming. The arable farm sector which cultivates dedicated energy crops, is represented by a large number of farms, and the biofuel industry is divided into two main chains; namely, ETBE and bio-diesel, each of which has an intermediate stage (ethanol and seed-oil production, respectively) and a final transformation stage integrated into the petroleum refinery system. The variables, in the model, are the energy crops (wheat, sugarbeet and <b>rape-seed)</b> and the biofuel (ether and ester) activity levels. Goverment allo-cates an earmarked budget for biofuels through tax exemptions per unit. The model enables th...|$|E

40|$|Linseed, corn, peanut, soybean and <b>rape-seed</b> oils, heated at 275 C were {{incorporated}} in the basal diets of rats at levels of 10, 20 or 36 % by weight. Linseed oil was rendered toxic to young rats by treatment for 12 hours, but 30 hours heating was required to reduce the nutritive value of the other oils. Toxicity symptoms were non-specific but in severe cases included darkened adrenals, weight losses, diarrhea and death within 14 days. Acetone segregation partially concentrated the toxic factor in the soluble fraction of the oil, suggesting a specific polymer might be responsible. Of the various supplements tested, only rat feces and liver extract were effective in preventing toxicosis, therefore {{it was concluded that}} heated oils caused a deficiency of some essential nutrient. It is not clear how the toxic factor exerted its effect, but evidence suggests that bacterial synthesis might in some way be involved...|$|E

40|$|Rape {{methyl ester}} (RME) is a {{suitable}} substitute for mineral diesel in existing compression-ignition engines. Its {{use as an}} alternative transport fuel will result in decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants (particularly SO 2, hydrocarbons and smoke) from this source. However, to encourage such a trend in the UK, the Government needs to adopt the European Union's recommendation of a reduction of excise duties on biofuels to 10 % of the rate applied to lead-free petrol to ensure its economic short-term competitiveness in the UK market. Such a subsidy will not be required by the year 2004. The available resource base for <b>rape-seed</b> oil in the UK limits the production of RME, so it could satisfy only up to 4 % of demand on fuel by road vehicles powered by diesel engines in the UK. This suggests {{that it should be}} used preferentially in urban areas and waterways where its environmental benefits would be maximised. ...|$|E

The study was carried out with a randomized, crossover study design with each diet lasting 3 wk and a 2 -wk washout period between the experimental diets. Glucose area un-der the curve during the intravenous glucose tolerance test (glu-cose dose 300 mg/kg. plasma samples before glucose dose and at 10 -mm intervals for 90 mm) was significantly lower and the glucose disappearance rate after a glucose injection tended to be steeper after the MUFA-diet than after the SAFA-diet. After the MUFA-diet serum total cholesterol was 21. 6 % lower and serum low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol 29. 5 % lower than after the SAFA-diet, but high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol did not dif-fer between the diets.

40|$|Abstract:- Biofuels {{represent}} an attractive substitute for classical, fossil fuels with some important advantages such as renewable sources and environmental friendliness. However, the physicochemical characteristics of biofuels {{are different from}} fossil fuels, therefore new technologies have to be developed. One of the most prospective fields {{for the use of}} biofuels is Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production, where new industrial gas turbines provide the needed new technologies. To justify the development of these new technologies and to assess the effects of use of different liquid and gaseous biofuels in CHP production, we have performed a preliminary socio-economic analysis. In this analysis we included liquid biofuels available in EU (<b>rape-seed</b> oil, biodiesel, flash pyrolysis oil) and processes such as gasification from wood, waste methanization and slow pyrolysis for gaseous biofuels. The analysis covers the whole production chain starting from crop production, oil extraction, and biodiesel production to CHP production using various liquid and gaseous biofuels. The most important, preliminary qualitative and quantitative results of the performed socio-economic analysis have been presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the life cycle operation phase of forest cableways Larix 550 and Larix 3 T with respect to energy requirements and environmental pollution caused by emissions. Energy audit quantifies energy use based on the consumption of fuels and lubricants. Energy balance includes both the energy content and the energy needed for the production of fuels and lubricants. Fuel consumption measured for one year ranged from 1. 2 – 1. 4 l/m^ 3. Based on the consumption of fuels and lubricants the paper quantifies the amount of emissions in two scenarios (minimum consumption and maximum consumption) with a special focus on GHG emissions. Calculations are made of emissions for diesel fuel and for the alternatively applicable <b>rape-seed</b> methyl ester (RME), and a calculation is also made of emissions originating from fossil sources. By using RME as a fuel, the amount of CO 2 emissions from fossil sources discharged into the environment can be reduced by 3. 4 kg per a cubic meter over the bark of timber extracted by cableway...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, {{the use of}} {{biological}} air pollution control has become a popular treatment alternative for contaminated gas streams. The objective of this licentiate thesis {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of a compact rockwool biofilter to treat emissions from a restaurant, to identify an appropriate microbial population for the inoculation of the biofilter, and suitable environmental conditions for this culture. Rockwool mats with pre-set structures were shown to have a good structural stability, developed low pressure drop, did not compact, and seemed to be a appropriate habitat for microorganisms. Bacteria from different environments were enriched in batch cultures; it was found that all cultures were able to oxidize <b>rape-seed</b> oil. Nutrients, mainly phosphorus and nitrogen, must be added occasionally to the bacterial culture. Clogging due to high depositions of grease could be prevented by using a mechanical collector installed upstream of the biofilter. The off-gas from the fryer consisted of a complex mixture of partially oxidized hydrocarbons and the short residence times (< 10 s) provided in the filter were not sufficient to achieve a significant reduction of aldehydes or fatty acids.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cottonseed {{typically}} {{contains about}} 15 % oleic acid. Here we report {{the development of}} transgenic cotton plants with higher seed oleic acid levels. Plants were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A binary vector was designed to suppress expression of the endogenous cottonseed ∆- 12 desaturase (fad 2) by subcloning a mutant allele of a <b>rape-seed</b> fad 2 gene downstream from a heterologous, seed-specific promoter (phaseolin). Fatty acid profiles of total seed lipids from 43 independent transgenic lines were analyzed by gas chromatography. Increased seed oleic acid content ranged from 21 to 30 % (by weight) of total fatty acid content in 22 of the primary transformants. The increase in oleic acid content was {{at the expense of}} linoleic acid, consistent with reduced activity of cottonseed FAD 2. Progeny of some lines yielded oleic acid content as high as 47 % (three times that of standard cottonseed oil). Molecular analyses of nuclear DNA from transgenics con-firmed the integration of the canola transgene into the cotton genome. Collectively, our results extend the metabolic engineer-ing of vegetable oils to cottonseed and should provide the basis {{for the development of a}} family of novel cottonseed oils...|$|E
