50|$|Levopimaric acid is an abietane-type of {{diterpene}} <b>resin</b> <b>acid.</b> It is a {{major constituent}} of pine oleoresin with the chemical formula of C20H30O2. In general, the abietene types of diterpene <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> have various biological activities, such as antibacterial, cardiovascular and antioxidant. About 18 to 25% of levopimaric acid is found in pine oleoresin. The production of oleoresin by conifer species {{is an important component}} of the defense response against insect attack and fungal pathogen infection.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{the tall}} oil {{produced}} in coastal {{areas of the}} southeastern United States contains over 40% resin acids and sometimes as much as 50% or more. The fatty acids fraction is usually lower than the resin acids, and unsaponifiables amount to 6-8%. Farther north in Virginia, where Pitch Pine (Pinus rigida)and Shortleaf Pine (Pinus echinata) are more dominant, the <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> content decreases to as low as 30-35% with a corresponding increase in the fatty acids present. In Canada, where mills process Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta) in interior British Columbia and Alberta, Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana), Alberta to Quebec and Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus) and Red Pine (Pinus resinosa), Ontario to New Brunswick, <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> levels of 25% are common with unsaponifiable contents of 12-25%. Similar variations {{may be found in}} other parts of the United States and in other countries. For example, in Finland, Sweden and Russia, <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> values from Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) may vary from 20 to 50%, fatty acids from 35 to 70%, and unsaponifiables from 6 to 30%.|$|E

50|$|Rosin {{consists}} of a complex mixture of different substances including organic <b>acids</b> named the <b>resin</b> <b>acids.</b> These {{are closely related to}} the terpenes, and derive from them through partial oxidation. <b>Resin</b> <b>acids</b> can be dissolved in alkalis to form resin soaps, from which the purified <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> are regenerated by treatment with <b>acids.</b> Examples of <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> are abietic acid (sylvic acid), C20H30O2, plicatic acid contained in cedar, and pimaric acid, C20H30O2, a constituent of galipot <b>resin.</b> Abietic <b>acid</b> can also be extracted from rosin by means of hot alcohol; it crystallizes in leaflets, and on oxidation yields trimellitic acid, isophthalic acid and terebic acid. Pimaric acid closely resembles abietic acid into which it passes when distilled in a vacuum; it has been supposed to consist of three isomers.|$|R

50|$|Oleoresin in pines {{is defined}} as pine gum, which is the nonaqueous {{secretion}} of <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> dissolved in a terpene hydrocarbon oil, which is produced in or exuded from the intercellular resin ducts of a living tree. The viscous oleoresin secretion is composed of a complex mixture of terpenoids, consisting of roughly equal parts of volatile turpentine and rosin (also known as diterpene <b>resin</b> <b>acids).</b> Accumulated <b>resin</b> is released upon tissue injury and/or produced locally {{at the site of}} infestation, with the consequence that the beetle and associated fungal pathogens are killed, encased in resin, and expelled from the bore hole point of entry. This process is called pitching out, and it results in not only killing the attackers and ﬂushing the wound site but also moving the oleoresin to the trunk surface where the turpentine evaporates to permit the <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> to form a formidable physical barrier that seals the wound. Diterpene <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> (DRA) play important roles in confer defense against insects and microbial pathogens.

50|$|<b>Resin</b> <b>acids</b> are protectants {{and wood}} {{preservatives}} that {{are produced by}} parenchymatous epithelial cells that surround the resin ducts in trees from temperate coniferous forests.

50|$|<b>Resin</b> <b>acid</b> is {{the general}} name {{for all kinds of}} acids that share the same basic skeleton, a three-fused ring and the {{empirical}} formula C20H30O2.

The structure of these compounds differ only in the position of the conjugated double bond system. This feature influences their chemical reactivity. The pimaric-type acids are dextropimaric and isodextropimaric.|$|E

None of the substances, in the amounts tested, except for extremely high concentration, exerted an inhibitory effect on natural or IAA-induced elongation of pine hypocotyl sections. Neither was an inhibitory effect discovered in the microbiological test with the Aspergillus niger van Tiegh.

50|$|Induced (traumatic) resin {{in white}} spruce leaders {{resistant}} or {{susceptible to the}} white pine weevil was analyzed for volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids after simulated white pine weevil damage (Tomlin et al. 2000). Leaders from 331 trees were wounded just below the apical bud with a 1-mm diameter drill, coinciding with the natural time of weevil oviposition in the spring. Leaders were removed in the autumn, and the bark and xylem from {{the upper and lower}} regions of the leader extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. Unwounded trees had low amounts of resin in xylem compared with bark. In response to wounding, volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids increased in the upper xylem (area of wounding), with resistant trees showing a greater increase than susceptible trees. Wounding caused monoterpenes in particular to decrease in the lower region of the leader (away from the drilled area) in greater amounts in susceptible trees than in resistant trees. In response to wounding, the proportion of monoterpene to <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> increased in the upper and lower xylem of resistant trees, and slightly increased in the upper xylem of susceptible trees. Monoterpene-enriched resin is more fluid than constitutive resin, and probably flows more readily into oviposition cavities and larval mines, where it may kill immature weevils. Loss of resin components in the lower xylem suggested catabolism and transport of these materials to the site of wounding; however, energetic and regulatory data are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. This study provides a basis for measuring the ability of a tree to undergo traumatic resinosis, which could be used to screen for resistance to white pine weevil.|$|E
40|$|Resin acids are {{tricyclic}} terpenoids occurring {{naturally in}} trees. We investigated {{the occurrence of}} resin acid-degrading bacteria on the Arctic tundra near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island (82 °N, 62 °W). According to most-probable-number assays, <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> degraders were abundant (103 to 104 propagules/g of soil) in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, but they were undetectable (< 3 propagules/g of soil) in pristine soils from the nearby tundra. Plate counts indicated that the contaminated and the pristine soils had similar populations of heterotrophs (106 to 107 propagules/g of soil). Eleven resin acid-degrading bacteria belonging to four phylogenetically distinct groups were enriched and isolated from the contaminated soils, and representative isolates of each group were further characterized.

All four strains are psychrotolerant, with growth temperature ranges of 4 °C to 30 °C (DhA- 91 and DhA- 95) or 4 °C to 22 °C (IpA- 92 and IpA- 93) and with optimum temperatures of 15 to 22 °C. Strains DhA- 91 and DhA- 95 grew on the abietanes, dehydroabietic and abietic acids, but not on the pimaranes, isopimaric and pimaric acids. Strains IpA- 92 and IpA- 93 grew on the pimaranes but not the abietanes. All four strains grew on either aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, which is unusual for described <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> degraders. Eleven mesophilic <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> degraders did not use hydrocarbons, with the exception of two Mycobacterium sp. strains that used aliphatic hydrocarbons. We conclude that hydrocarbon contamination in Arctic tundra soil indirectly selected for <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> degraders, selecting for hydrocarbon degraders that coincidentally use resin acids. Psychrotolerant <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> degraders are likely important in the global carbon cycle and may have applications in biotreatment of pulp and paper mill effluents...|$|E
