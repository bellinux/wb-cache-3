The trot is generally the best gait to localize the lameness to a particular leg, {{because it is a}} symmetrical gait where the front half of the horse and the back half move in unison. The canter may also be used for lameness evaluation. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> up the canter or to engage the hind end can suggest pain in the sacro-iliac joint, pelvis, or hind leg.|$|E

40|$|One million pet rabbits {{are kept}} in The Netherlands, {{but there are no}} data {{available}} on their behaviour and welfare. This study seeks to assess the welfare of pet rabbits in Dutch households and is a first step {{in the development of a}} welfare assessment system. In an internet survey, housing systems, general up-keep and behaviour of pet rabbits were reported by their owners. The answers of 912 respondents were analysed with behavioural observations carried out on 66 rabbits in as many households. The rabbits were observed in their home cage and during three fear-related tests: a contact test, a handling test and an open-field test. The survey revealed that the average lifespan of the rabbits is approximately 4. 2 years (the maximum potential lifespan is 13 years) and solitary housing appears to reduce lifespan. Close to half of respondents subjected their rabbit(s) to solitary housing and the majority housed them in relatively small cages (< 5, 000 cm 2). Health risks may arise from a failure to inoculate rabbits and via inappropriate diet. During the contact test, solitary-housed rabbits made more contacts with a human than group-housed rabbits and rabbits in a small housing system made more contacts than those in a large system. Observations in the home cage differed greatly compared with the natural time budget of rabbits, ie displaying increased stereotypic behaviour and decreased foraging and, in solitary-housed rabbits, a complete lack of social behaviour. Nearly 25 % of rabbits displayed strong <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> being <b>picked</b> up, indicating socialisation problems. During the open-field test, solitary-housed rabbits sat up more than social-housed rabbits suggesting increased fearfulness. These findings indicate that the conditions in which pet rabbits are kept often have a negative impact on their welfare, further underlining the need to study this in greater detai...|$|R
