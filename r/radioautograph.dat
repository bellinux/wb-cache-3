40|$|A {{method for}} {{studying}} the melanogenetic activity of pigment cells is described. Tissue is incubated in a medium containing tyrosine labelled with I 4 carbon. Tyrosine, being a precursor of melanin, is incorporated into the insoluble pigment. This can be detected in histological selections by radioautography. A measure of tyrosine uptake and, provided precautions are taken, of tyrosinase activity, can be gained {{by the use of}} this technique. There are advantages in using labelled, rather than 'cold ' substrate. This technique, developed by other workers, has been used with success; but difficulties arise in situations where intense pigmentation obscures the image of the superimposed <b>radioautograph.</b> Here consideration is given to the possible methods for circumventing this difficulty, and a satisfactory method for partially bleaching the pigment, without upsetting the <b>radioautograph,</b> is described in detail. IT is now generally accepted that the pigment melanin is derived fromtyrosine by a process involving oxidation, both enzymic and spontaneous, and polymerization. It is notable that the precursor, tyrosine, is water-soluble while the pigmented product is totally insoluble, a fact that has been made use of by Kukita and Fitzpatrick (1955) in developing a method for investi...|$|E
40|$|Work on radioautographic {{localization}} of RNA synthesis {{has been}} reviewed by Prescott (1). The findings with this method show good correspondence with biochemical evidence by indicating the nucleus as the presumptive site of RNA synthesis, and {{the probability of}} transport of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has been established. The method has been applied by Nossal et al. (2) in semiquantitative studies related to RNA synthesis. The effect of the hormone aldosterone on RNA synthesis has been studied radioautographically in toad bladder tissue (3). An increase of uridine incorporation {{as a result of}} the hormone action was observed. Biochemical evidence has indicated a selective alteration of hepatic messenger RNA synthesis resulting from the action of several hormones, among them hydrocortisone (4). It seemed desirable to use radioautography to look for a morphological expression of the events described by Kidson and Kirby (4). Thus, the events of RNA synthesis could be studied in situ with the light microscope, and <b>radioautograph...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the antigen-binding activities of specific immunoglobulins in serum is described. Samples of sera were applied to commercial immunodiffusion plates and unprecipitated proteins eluted. The precipitate circles were challenged with specific radio-labelled antigen and exposed to X-ray film. Blackened circles on the <b>radioautograph</b> {{were found to be}} good indices of the antigen-binding activity of each immunoglobulin and could be monitored using a Beckman Model R Analytrol. The height of each analytrol peak provided an objective estimate of the intensity of darkening. Variation in the amount of added radio-antigen had a direct effect upon the intensity of the darkened circle at low concentrations. At a given concentration of antigen, however, all antigen-binding sites became saturated and additional increases in antigen concentration did not further increase the density of blackening. The quantity of antigen required to just saturate the combining sites of a particular immunoglobulin {{is a measure of the}} antigen-binding activity of that immunoglobulin. The employment and some of the applications of this relatively simple radio-isotopic technique are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Young rats were {{injected}} with 3 H-fucose and sacrificed after various times. In electron microscopic <b>radioautographs</b> of duodenal villus columnar cells and hepatocyes, at 2 minutes after injection the label was localized mostly over the Golgi apparatus. By 20 minutes, label appeared at all cell surfaces and in lysosomes. It is interpreted that the fucose label was incorporated by the Golgi apparatus into glycoproteins which migrated to lysosomes {{and to all}} cell surfaces {{to be added to}} the cell coat. A method developed to stain <b>radioautographs</b> of duodenal cells with phosphotungstic acid revealed glycoprotein in all labelled structures, including cytoplasmic vesicles which may transport the labelled glycoprotein to the cell surfaces. In light microscopic <b>radioautographs</b> of many other cell types, label appeared first over the Golgi region and later over cell secretions or over cell surfaces.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of specifically labeled neurotensin (NT) binding sites was examined by light and electron microscopic radioautography in the {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) and nucleus interfascicularis of the rat following incubation of lightly prefixed midbrain slices with the monoiodinated ligand, 125 i-(Tyr,) -NT. Film radioautograms of whole 1251 -NTincubated slices exhibited intense NT displaceable binding throughout the VTA and interfascicular nucleus. In light microscopic <b>radioautographs</b> from 1 -pm-thick sections taken {{from the surface of}} the slices, the label was found to be present both inside and outside neuronal perikarya.

40|$|Both {{galactose}} accumulation and phlorizin binding by columnar {{epithelial cells}} {{have been investigated}} in vitro with a recently developed technique for high-resolution, plastic-section radioautography which is particularly suited to small quantities of biopsy tissue. Grain density analysis of the <b>radioautographs</b> provides definitive support for {{the view that the}} cellular mechanisms underlying glucose-galactose absorption in laboratory animals are fully applicable to the small intestine of man. Even the number of sugar carriers at the microvillar membrane appears similar and the major quantitative difference, lower affinity for phlorizin in man, correlates with the finding that phlorizin is also a less potent inhibitor of uphill, galactose transport at the microvilli. In addition, <b>radioautographs</b> of biopsies taken 2 yr apart from a patient with glucose-galactose malabsorption provide evidence that the cellular defect in this inborn error of transport is a persistent {{reduction in the number of}} functioning sugar carriers at the microvillar membrane...|$|R
40|$|A squash {{technique}} {{was developed for}} log phase Tetrahymena pyriformis which permitted the resolution of over 100 individual mitochondria from a single cell. Mitochondria incorporated thymidine at all stages of the cell cycle, even when nuclear DNA synthesis was not occurring. During the stage of macronuclear DNA synthesis, however, {{there was a significant}} increase in the extent of mitochondrial labeling. Low <b>radioautograph</b> background suggests that mitochondrial DNA is synthesized at the mitochondria themselves. All mitochondria incorporated thymidine- 3 H within one population-doubling time. Grain counts also showed that the amount of mitochondrial label was retained for four generations and that this label remained randomly distributed among all mitochondria during this time. The results are not consistent with any theory of de-novo or "microbody" origin of mitochondria, but do support the hypothesis that mitochondria are produced by the growth and division of preexisting mitochondria. The stability of the mitochondrial DNA and its distribution among daughter mitochondria satisfy two prerequisites for a genetic material. The possibility is discussed that some of the genetic information for the mitochondrion is contained in the DNA associated with this organelle...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) and autism are {{prevalent}} {{diseases in}} two disparate age groups. The neuropathology underlying these diseases involves the major neurotransmitters, dopamine and GABA, and/ or their receptors. The current study investigated mRNA gene {{expressions of the}} GAD 67 in autistic striatum and the DRD 1 in the Parkinsonian dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In situ hybridization histochemistry for GAD 67 mRNA levels in postmortem striatal specimens from autistic individuals was compared to those of normal controls. Similarly, a nonradioactive in situ hybridization newly emerging method, RNAscope, {{was used to assess}} the D 1 receptor mRNA gene expression in postmortem specimens of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of PD and control brains. The GAD 67 mRNA labeling intensity that was measured on X-ray films and on emulsion <b>radioautograph</b> sections did not vary significantly between the autistic samples and the normal control samples. On the other hand, DRD 1 mRNA levels showed {{a significant increase in the}} Parkinsonian dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specimens as compared to their normal counterparts. The GAD 65 mRNA labeling results corresponded with the GAD 67 mRNA levels. The similar GAD 67 and GAD 65 mRNA patterns in the autism group and the control group may suggest that the hyper-excitability hypothesis can be accounted for by an increase in the glutamatergic activity rather than a decrease in the GABAergic system. The increase in the DRD 1 mRNA in the Parkinson’s disease dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be interpreted in light of the expected upregulation of the D 1 receptor in cases of dopamine depletion as the treatment-status was unknown. In conclusion, research investigating the neurotransmitters’ gene expression in Parkinson’s disease and in autism spectrum disorder needs more neurobiological studies in order to establish some knowledge regarding the temporality, and the genetic profile mapping of the diseases. Likewise, more research is encouraged to relate the symptoms and behaviors associated with disease to their anatomical origins...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid vesicles {{formed from}} {{exogenous}} neutral lipids and membrane, {{which are so}} small and dilute that they contain either one or no protein molecules or molecular assemblages, should be separable {{on the basis of}} the proteins or molecular assemblages they contain. ^ Vesicles were formed by sonicating a mixture of neutral lipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol) and membrane. These vesicles retained functions of the original membrane including vesicle sealing, anion transport and ATP dependent calcium transport. These vesicles had properties consistent with the formation of hybrids. Very dilute hybrids were then made with a membrane:exogenous lipid ratio such that the calculated ratios of vesicles with no proteins to those with one protein or molecular assemblage was 6. 7. Freeze fracture electron microscopy showed 200 - 400 Angstrom vesicles with at most one intramembrane particle per vesicle. ^ Density gradient centrifugation and density gradient stabilized isoelectric focusing were used to fractionate hybrids. These techniques produced distinct band patterns in the gradients. Examination of individual bands by isoelectric focusing, SDS gel electrophoresis or 2 -D gel electrophoresis showed very few protein differences between these fractions. Despite numerous changes in the fractionation procedures it was not possible to show that individual fractions contained a minority of the total components of the membrane, the result necessary for a useable procedure. ^ To do the experiments outlined above, procedures were developed for labeling membrane proteins by low-level reductive methylation. Membrane proteins were labeled with 83 nmoles formaldehyde and 28 nmoles tritiated sodium borohydride/mg protein in borate or phosphate buffer, pH 8. 3. This gave a labeling level of 28 uCi/mg protein. The isoelectric focusing patterns of labeled and unlabeled membrane proteins were indistinguishable. This, plus the correspondence between the <b>radioautograph</b> and stain patterns obtained from two dimensional electrophoretograms indicates that the labeled proteins are good tracers for unlabeled ones. Membrane labeled in phosphate buffer (but not borate buffer) retained full capacities for vesicle sealing, ATP dependent calcium transport and sodium dependent glycine transport. ^ A procedure was also developed for isoelectric focusing at 0. 154 u ionic strength. ...|$|E

40|$|After {{injection}} of 125 I into animals, discovery in <b>radioautographs</b> of some silver grains over cells of thyroid follicles continues to provoke {{the controversy that}} binding of iodine to protein might occur in cells {{rather than in the}} colloid of follicle lumens (Croft and Pitt-Rivers, 1970; Takano and Honjin, 1968). To analyze the significance of grains over cells, 10 µCi per gram body weight of Na 125 I was given intravenously into adult male rats which were sacrificed in 30 - 45 seconds by perfusing with glutaraldehyde; over 700 photographs of EM <b>radioautographs</b> were examined. Quantitative studies (by drawing appropriate boundary circles about each grain to locate the probable source of radioactivity) showed that of 7736 silver grains surveyed, 85 - 87 % were over follicie lumens (the peak being adjacent to the apical cell membrane) and 13 - 15 % were over follicular cell cytoplasm (again, the peak being adjacent to the apical cell membrane) ...|$|R

A similar pattern was observed using 3 H-fucose or 3 H-glucosamine. In contrast, 3 H-glucose and 3 H-mannose produced a diffuse cytoplasmic reaction. By 20 minutes, all labels had migrated to the apical process-enamel matrix zone. Electron microscope <b>radioautographs</b> showed 3 H-galactose label in Golgi saccules at early intervals.

By 20 - 30 minutes, grains were over granules in the apical process and over matrix. These observations suggest that glucose and mannose incorporation occurs in the rER.

An attempt at estimating turnover times indicated that two classes of proteins are synthesized in the ergastoplasm: "sedentary" with a slow turnover (62. 5 hours) and "exportable" with rapid turnover (4. 7 minutes). It is estimated that the exportable proteins spend approximately 11. 7 minutes in the Golgi zone where they are built up into zymogen granules, and thereafter 36. 0 minutes as fully formed zymogen granules, before they are released outside the acinar cell as pancreatic secretion.

40|$|These {{studies have}} {{examined}} the ability of smooth muscle cells from developing aorta of the prepubertal rat to utilize amino acids in the synthesis and secretion of connective tissue proteins. Prepubertal rats, previously given either an alcohol carrier or estradiol- 17 -beta, were each given an intravenous injection of proline- 3 H. The animals were sacrificed after 15 and 30 min, and 4 hr. Light and electron microscope <b>radioautographs</b> of the aortic smooth muscle and of the myometrial cells demonstrated that the aortic cells, in both groups of animals, and the myometrial cells, in the estrogen-stimulated animals, took up the proline and rapidly secreted it in both collagen and elastic fibers within 4 hr.

40|$|<b>Radioautographs</b> of 45 Ca-labeled frog {{skeletal}} muscles {{have been}} prepared using freeze-dry and vapor fixation techniques to avoid displacement of the isotope during {{the preparation of the}} <b>radioautographs.</b> 45 Ca has been localized in resting muscles exposed to 45 Ca Ringer's for 5 min or 5 hr and in isotopically labeled muscles recovering from tetanic stimulation at room temperature or at 4 °C. In muscles soaked at rest for 5 min 45 Ca was present almost exclusively in the terminal cisternae. In all other muscles there were three sites at which the isotope was concentrated: (a) the terminal cisternae, (b) the intermediate cisternae and the longitudinal tubules, and (c) the A band portion of the myofibrils. The terminal cisternae were labeled more rapidly than the myofibrils, but both exchanges were accelerated by electrical stimulation. The amount of 45 Ca in the longitudinal tubules and the intermediate cisternae decreased with time after a tetanus as the amount in the terminal cisternae increased. It is proposed that electrical stimulation releases calcium from the terminal cisternae and that relaxation occurs from the binding of the released calcium by the longitudinal tubules and the intermediate cisternae. Complete recovery from mechanical activity involves the transport of this bound calcium into the reticulum and its subsequent binding by the terminal cisternae. Resting exchange of calcium occurs primarily between the terminal cisternae and the transverse tubules...|$|R

The two modes of RNA synthesis were thus investigated during the migration of columnar cells from crypt base to villus top, {{and the rate of}} synthesis was assessed by counting silver grains over the nucleolus and nucleoplasm at six levels along the duodenal epithelium-that is, in the base, mid, and top regions of the crypts and in the base, mid, and top regions of the villi. Concomitant biochemical analyses established that, after injection of either [5 - 3 H]uridine or [5 - 3 H]orotic acid: (a) buffered glutaraldehyde fixative was as effective as perchloric acid or trichloroacetic acid in insolubilizing the nucleic acids of rat small intestine; (b) a major fraction of the nucleic acid label was in RNA, that is, 91 % after [3 H]uridine and 72 % after [3 Hjorotic acid, with the rest in DNA; and (c) a substantial fraction of the RNA label was in poly A+ RNA (presumed to be messenger RNA).

Taking into account the differing molar proportions of thymidine in E. coli and T 4 chromosomes, it was seen that {{the two types of}} chromosomes have approximately equal numbers of nucleotides per unit length, indicating that their structures are the same. Using molecular weight estimates in the literature for the T 4 and related T 2 chromosomes, and the lengths obtained in the <b>radioautographs,</b> the T 4 chromosome was estimated to have between 1. 9 and 3. 6 nucleotides/ 3. 4 A. On the basis of these values alone, the E. coli and T 4 chromosomes could be either one Watson-Crick helix in a form about equal to or more condensed than the B form, or two helices more stretched out than the B form. The length of the T 4 chromosome was 48. 7 ± 4. 1 μ when dried on the dull side of Millipore membranes and 42. 3 ± 4. 8 μ on the shiny side, under the conditions used.

40|$|A {{new concept}} termed "radioautographology" is advocated. This term was {{synthesized}} from "radioautography" and "ology", expressing a new science derived from radioautography. The concept of radioautographology (RAGology) {{is that of}} a science whose objective is to localize radioactive substances in the biological structure of objects and to analyze and study the significance of these substances in the biological structure. On the other hand, the old term radioautography (RAG) is the technique used to demonstrate the pattern of localization of various radiolabeled compounds in specimens. The specimens used in biology and medicine are cells and tissues. They are fixed, sectioned and placed in contact with the radioautographic emulsions, which are exposed and developed to produce metallic silver grains. Such specimens are designated as <b>radioautographs</b> and the patterns of pictures made of silver grains are named radioautograms. The technicians who produce <b>radioautographs</b> are named radioautographers, while those who study RAGology are scientists and should be called radioautographologists. The science of RAGology can be divided into two parts, general RAGology and special RAGology, as most natural sciences usually can.

The sites of protein synthesis in nucleoli were investi-gated by means of light and electron-microscope radioautography after a 5 -min immersion of the roots in a solution of [3 H]arginine. The <b>radioautographs</b> of interphase nucleoli showed many silver grains over both the fibrillar and the granular regions. Occasional silver grains were also recorded over, or close to, the lacunar regions, but none were over the vacuolar regions. A 15 -min chase period did not change the radioautographic pattern. It is concluded that the three permanent regions of the interphase nucleoli, namely the fibrillar, the granular and the DNA-containing lacunar regions, are sites of protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{technique}} of radioautography, {{it has been shown}} that a probable maximum of only 25 – 50 molecules iodine- 125 -labeled toxin per cell is bound by human HeLa cells treated with approximately 107 molecules of toxin per cell, or just under one saturating dose. <b>Radioautographs</b> of sections from labeled cells locate most if not all of the toxin molecules fixed to the outer cell membrane. Under identical conditions far less label is taken up by mouse L cells. It is probable that the resistance of this species to diphtheria toxin can be accounted for in terms of the failure of mouse cells to bind the toxin protein. The irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis in a living cell culture by a few molecules of toxin located at the cell surface is discussed in relation to the known interaction between toxin, NAD, and transferase II in mammalian cell extracts...|$|R
