5000|$|In {{the sport}} of baseball, a baserunner {{is said to be}} in scoring {{position}} when he is on second or third base. The distinction between being on first base and second or third base is that a runner on first can usually only score if the batter hits an extra-base hit, while a runner on second or third can score on a single. This is also known as [...] "ducks on the pond". <b>Runners</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> refers to the number of runners on second or third base {{at the end of an}} inning and is an inverse measure of a team's offensive efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Beau was the 12/1 mount of two-time winning jockey Carl Llewellyn and {{had won the}} Whitbread Gold Cup, a {{respected}} Aintree trial, by a distance in 1999. His form in 2000 had been less impressive and his heavy weight handicap was also considered a tough ask, but the horse was coping well with it during the race and was leading the only four <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the race when an awkward jump at the 19th fence put his reins over his head. Jockey Llewellyn fought {{to try to save}} the situation but, without steering, was unsurpisingly unseated at the next fence. The rider desperately chased his mount to the next fence in a bid to remount and possibly claim third place, but was unable to do so.|$|R
50|$|The {{initial entry}} for the 2016 Epsom Derby, {{announced}} in December 2014, consisted of 475 yearlings. Amongst the entries was a brother to the unbeaten Frankel, {{and a son}} of Midday. The number of entries was an increase of 66 on the initial entry for the 2015 race, and included 53 horses from the Godolphin Racing organisation and 77 from the Coolmore Stud. The number of potential runners was reduced to 136 at the first scratching date in March 2016 with Foundation (trained by John Gosden) and Midterm, the son of Midday, (Michael Stoute) heading the betting market at odds of 12 to 1. Aidan O'Brien trained 36 of the <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the race. A further 9 horses were added at the second entry stage in April 2016 {{at a cost of}} £8,000 per entry. The second entries included Carntop, bred and owned by Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.|$|R
50|$|The {{qualifying}} round {{ended with}} Glenbrien Champ and the Grace Peppercorn trained Ebony Tim winning {{well and the}} Irish won eight of the sixteen heats. One {{of the first round}} heats resulted in a one-two for McKenna as Lauragh Six beat Count Five with Game Ball scraping through in third. Best heat winner was another Irish entry Dipmac trained by Seamus Graham. Matt O’Donnell’s Powersville Jet became the new favourite after recording a second round time of 29.24 just one length ahead of Proud Dodger, Game Ball tumbled out after failing to take third place from Lauragh Six. The Irish made up half of the 24 <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the quarter-finals but Dipmac failed to progress from heat one and picked up a wrist injury. Heat two went to Whisper Wishes in 29.32 and the Irish had another bad result in the third heat when Powersville Jet and Count Five both went out after trouble along with Amazing Man a finalist from the previous year. The fourth and final heat was an Irish clean sweep, Proud Dodger won from Back Garden and Morans Beef.|$|R

50|$|The {{initial entry}} for the 2014 Epsom Derby, {{announced}} in December 2012, consisted of 406 yearlings. The number of entries was 32 fewer {{than for the}} 2013 race and included 68 from Godolphin Racing and 56 from the partners of the Coolmore Stud. The number of potential runners was reduced to 118 at the first scratching date in March 2014, and subsequently increased to 133 when a further 15 horses were entered at the second entry stage in April 2014. The field for the Derby began to take its final shape at the May scratching deadline when 27 <b>runners</b> were <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the race, and the final confirmation stage on 2 June saw the final field settled at 17 runners with 11 further withdrawals and the additional entry of Romsdal {{at a cost of}} £75,000.

50|$|A {{variation}} to this statistic {{is called}} Batting Average {{with two outs}} and Runners <b>in</b> <b>Scoring</b> Position, which is also calculated by dividing a players' hits with runners on second or third by his at bats in this situation. A hit {{is more likely to}} score at least one or two runs-depending on the speed of the runner, the strength of the outfielder's arm, the number of runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position, etc.-because the runners will be going on contact—that is, they run once the batter hits the ball. But if the batter records an out, then the inning ends with those <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> on base.|$|R

By contrast the second subject is [...] "sublimely wistful". There is an exposition repeat indicated by Elgar, and a calm new theme for strings introduces the development section, which later has a lively {{theme for the}} horns. A march section in B flat minor follows. After the recapitulation, the coda brings together the main themes and the movement ends with a majestic C major conclusion based on the opening theme. The movement, taking about sixteen minutes in performance, though on a large scale, is shorter than the equivalent movements of Elgar's first and second symphonies.|$|R

With two outs, Billy Gilbert singled to left, bringing Mertes home for the only run of the game, McGinnity outdueling Plank 1-0 and giving the Giants a three-games-to-one lead.|$|R
5000|$|Game 4 {{was another}} {{marathon}} affair. Joe Saunders and Phil Hughes matched zeroes for four innings, before Nate McLouth led off the fifth for Baltimore {{with a home}} run. The Yankees responded in the sixth when Robinson Canó had an RBI groundout, but they <b>left</b> a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position <b>in</b> that inning when Alex Rodriguez struck out. Rodriguez also left men on second and third with one out {{in the bottom of}} the eighth, dropping his batting average for the series down to [...]125 and continuing to draw the scorn of Yankees fans.|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} similar incidents, coaches are often accused of {{running up the}} score and taking the {{opportunity}} to humiliate and embarrass a weak opponent. At times, large margins of victory occur in games where the winning school's reserves (second-string and junior varsity players) played a good share of the contest and simply were able to score at will against the weaker opposition. However, when the star players are <b>left</b> <b>in</b> to set <b>scoring</b> records, as happened with Epiphanny Prince's 113-point basketball game in 2006, criticism usually follows.|$|R

He finished the game with 34 points, including 23 points in the 4th quarter, just one point shy of Michael Jordan's franchise playoff record.

5000|$|... 7:30 p.m. (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, MissouriGame 5 saw {{a battle}} of the aces with Adam Wainwright on the short end as Lester pitched another gem of 7 2/3 innings. Boston struck first on {{back-to-back}} one out doubles by Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz, who continued his monstrous tear, hitting [...]733 in the series. Wainwright ended up striking out the side {{in the first two}} innings before Jon Lester broke the streak with a groundout. St. Louis had back-to-back leadoff singles {{in the second and third}} by Carlos Beltrán and David Freese, latter advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Pete Kozma but was <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. <b>In</b> the fourth Ortiz tied a World Series record by Billy Hatcher on a hit, reaching base in nine consecutive plate appearances, but failed to set a new record by flying out to center field in the sixth. With one out in the bottom of the fourth, Matt Holliday hit a solo shot to center field to tie the game. Boston threatened in the fifth after a leadoff hit by Xander Bogaerts and a one out single by David Ross but Wainwright struck out Lester and Ellsbury to strand both runners. After a leadoff single by Bogaerts, Stephen Drew walked and Ross drove in one run on a ground rule double to left field. With two runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position Ellsbury's single scored Drew but Ross was tagged out at home plate on the throw by Shane Robinson. In the bottom of the eighth Lester allowed a one out double against Freese and Koji Uehara took over the mound for a four out save after Kozma hit a fly ball to left field for the second out of the inning. Uehara struck out pinch hitter Matt Adams on three pitches for the third out. The Red Sox closer struck out Matt Carpenter, grounded out pinch hinter John Jay and Holliday flew out to right field to earn the save in back-to-back games. This was the first game of this series neither team committed an error.|$|R
