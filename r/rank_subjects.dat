40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the validity and}} reproducibility of the FFQ used in the Dutch European Investigation of Cancer and Nutrition cohort, in order to <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> according to intakes of fatty acid classes and individual fatty acids. In total, 121 men and women (23 - 72 years) filled out three FFQ at 6 -month intervals between 1991 and 1992. As a reference method, they filled out twelve monthly 24 -h dietary recalls (24 HDR) during the same year. Intra-class correlation coefficients for the FFQ showed moderate to good reproducibility across all fatty acids (classes and individual) in men (0 · 56 - 0 · 81) and women (0 · 57 - 0 · 83). In men, Spearman's correlation coefficients (r s) for the FFQ compared with the 24 HDR indicated moderate to good relative validity (r s= 0 · 45 - 0 · 71) for all fatty acids, except for arachidonic acid and marine PUFA (r s< 0 · 40). In women, relative validity was moderate to good for MUFA and trans-fatty acids (TFA) {{and the majority of}} SFA (r s= 0 · 40 - 0 · 66), was fair for the short-chain SFA and lauric acid (r s= 0 · 30 - 0 · 33) and was fair to moderate for PUFA (r s= 0 · 22 - 0 · 47). Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement between the FFQ and 24 HDR, and proportional bias for fatty acids with very low intakes. In conclusion, the FFQ showed good reproducibility for subject ranking based on intakes of fatty acids (classes and individual). The relative validity measures indicated that the FFQ is an adequate tool to <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> according to intakes of high-abundant fatty acids, but less for low-abundant fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|The {{comparison}} of alternative rankings {{of a set}} of items is a general and prominent task in applied statistics. Predictor variables are ranked according to magnitude of association with an outcome, prediction models <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> according to the personalized risk of an event, and genetic studies rank genes according to their difference in gene expression levels. This article constructs measures of the agreement of two or more ordered lists. We use the standard deviation of the ranks to define a measure of agreement that both provides an intuitive interpretation and can be applied to any number of lists even if some or all are incomplete or censored. The approach can identify change-points in the agreement of the lists and the sequential changes of agreement {{as a function of the}} depth of the lists can be compared graphically to a permutation based reference set.

40|$|A brief {{questionnaire}} {{has been}} developed to measure behaviour related to dietary fat intake. It is self-administered and self-coded. Mean completion time is about three minutes. Criterion validity was assessed by comparison with a well-established food frequency questionnaire using 124 adults from Newcastle and Sydney. The correlations with the questionnaire scores were: ?= 0. 55 for total fat {{as a percentage of}} total energy, ?= 0. 67 for saturated fat as a percentage of total energy, and ?= 0. 44 for polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio. Reproducibility was assessed by re-use by 25 subjects after seven to nine months (?= 0. 85). When used in a community survey of over 300 randomly chosen people in the Hunter Region, the mean scores for men and for women and among different age groups were significantly different. The questionnaire was strongly associated with other scales measuring attitudes, behaviour and knowledge related to low-fat diets. The questionnaire appears suitable for rapid self-assessment by subjects, and as it directs their attention to aspects of their diet which might need improvement, it could be used for health education. it might also be used for epidemiological studies to <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> broadly according to their fat-intake behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the validity, reliability and ranking ability of an interviewer-administered physical activity questionnaire (PAQ), measuring physical activity (PA) and inactivity history over a 1 -week and 1 -year period in South African primary school-aged children. Methods: Criterion validity of the PAQ was tested against PA movement counts as measured with an Actical accelerometer in 30 children. Agreement between the two instruments was measured with a weighted Kappa statistic. Test-retest reliability of the past week and past year PAQ was also tested. Results: A positive, significant (r= 0. 53, p= 0. 004) relationship was found between total time spent being physically active {{as measured by the}} Actical and PAQ. A similar relationship was found for time spent doing sedentary (r= 0. 63, p< 0. 001) and vigorous activities (r= 0. 47, p< 0. 001), but not for activities of a moderate intensity (r= 0. 001, p= 0. 88). The ability of the PAQ to correctly categorise children into activity levels was moderate (κ= 0. 41, p< 0. 001). The PAQ was found to be reliable and reproducible with significant (p< 0. 001) intraclass correlation coefficients for both the past week and past year administrations. Conclusion: The interviewer-administered PAQ is a useful assessment tool in this population of children, as evidenced by its good correlation with Actical measurements. The best application of the questionnaire lies in its ability to qualitatively <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> according to activity level...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine current {{approaches}} to interpretation of student evaluation data and present an innovative approach to developing benchmark targets for the effective and efficient use of these data. Design/methodology/approach: This article discusses traditional approaches to gathering and using student feedback across the tertiary sector. The limitations of the customary use of the statistical mean as a quality measure of performance are presented and examined. An alternative method of interpreting student evaluation data is proposed and examples given. Findings: The traditional use of the statistical mean to interpret student evaluation data has limitations. Focusing on data at the macro level provides subject teaching staff and managers with a clearer indication of student satisfaction. The use of a percentage satisfied and percentage dissatisfied metric to classify and <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> is presented as an efficient alternative to the traditional approach, while recognising the value of the statistical mean to interpret data at the micro level. Originality/value: In light of the important role student feedback plays in determining university ranking, prioritising staff development and its potential function as an academic performance indicator, the effective interpretation of student evaluation data is critical. As economic factors become increasingly important to higher education providers, the role of evaluation data obtained from students will continue to gain traction. The identification of methods to fully capitalise on the value of these data, such as the one proposed in this article, is therefore crucial...|$|E

The performance of the FFQ was evaluated using the mean of three 24 -hour recalls as the reference method. Evaluation in estimating dietary intake at the group level was done by paired t-tests. The relative validity of the individual energy adjusted level of intake was assessed with correlation analyses (Pearson’s), with correction for measurement error. Results: On group level, the FFQ overestimated as well as underestimated absolute intake of various nutrients and foods. The Bland and Altman plot for total energy intake showed that the agreement between the FFQ and the 24 -hour recalls was dependent of intake level.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{concurrent}} validity of the Personal Activity Monitor (PAM) accelerometer relative to the Actigraph accelerometer using oxygen consumption as a reference, and to assess the test-retest reliability of the PAM. Thirty-two fit, normal weight adults (aged 21 - 54) performed two activities, treadmill walking and stair walking, while wearing the PAM, the Actigraph and the Cosmed K 4 b 2. Correlation coefficients and agreement in absolute energy expenditure (EE) levels between PAM, Actigraph and Cosmed were calculated. The test-retest reliability was examined among 296 PAM's using a laboratory shaker. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were determined. Correlations for treadmill walking and stair walking, respectively, were r 2 = 0. 95 and r 2 = 0. 65 for PAM with Actigraph, r 2 = 0. 82 and r 2 = 0. 93 for PAM with VO 2 and r 2 = 0. 64 and 0. 74 for Actigraph with VO 2. Both the PAM and Actigraph underestimated EE during treadmill and stair walking by a substantial amount. The test-retest reliability of the PAM was high [ICC= 0. 80; 95 % confidence interval (CI) (0. 28; 0. 92) and intra-CV= 1. 5 %].

In the present study, food and nutrient intake assessment among European adolescents using 24 h recalls (mean of two recalls) and a FFQ (separately and the combination of both) were evaluated using concentration biomarkers. Biomarkers included were vitamin C, ß-carotene, DHA+EPA, vitamin B 12 (cobalamin and holo-transcobalamin) and folate (erythrocyte folate and plasma folate). For {{the evaluation of the}} food intake assessment 390 adolescents were included, while 697 were included for the nutrient intake assessment evaluation. Spearman rank and Pearson correlations, and validity coefficients, which are correlations between intake estimated and habitual true intake, were calculated. Correlations were higher between frequency of food consumption (from the FFQ) and concentration biomarkers than between mean food intake (from the recalls) and concentration biomarkers, especially for DHA+EPA (r 0 · 35 v. r 0 · 27). Most correlations were higher among girls than boys. For boys, the highest validity coefficients were found for frequency of fruit consumption (0 · 88) and for DHA+EPA biomarker (0 · 71).

40|$|Folate is {{required}} for 1 -carbon metabolism and deficiency in folate leads to megaloblastic anemia. Low levels of folate {{have been associated with}} increased risk of vascular disease. To investigate whether RDA of folate are met, habitual folate intake needs to be assessed reliably. We developed a FFQ to specifically measure folate intake over the previous 3 months in elderly people in the Netherlands. Major sources of folate intake, i. e. foods contributing to at least 80 % of the average folate intake, were identified through an analysis of the second Dutch Food Consumption Survey for the sub-population of men and women aged 50 ¿ 70. In 2000 and 2001, folate intake was estimated with this questionnaire in 1286 individuals aged 50 - 75 years. Concentrations of serum and erythrocyte folate served as biomarkers with which relative validity of the questionnaire was assessed. The same FFQ was repeated after 3 years in 803 subjects in order to assess long-term reproducibility. Mean folate intake was estimated to be 196 (sd 69) ¿g/d. Spearman correlation coefficients between folate intake and serum and erythrocyte concentrations were 0 · 14 (P < 0 · 01) and 0 · 05 (P = 0 · 06) respectively.

Subjects/Methods: In a cross-sectional study among 63 men and 58 women, the FFQ was completed three times over a 1 -year period and the reproducibility was calculated over these measurements. Twelve-monthly 24 HDR were collected to estimate relative validity. In addition, the relative validity of the FFQ, compared with plasma phylloquinone and desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dpucMGP), was assessed cross-sectionally among 507 postmenopausal women. Results: Intraclass correlations showed a good reproducibility, with correlations ranging from 0. 65 to 0. 83. The relative validity for phylloquinone intake compared with 24 HDR was lower for women (rs= 0. 28) than men (rs= 0. 40). The relative validity, compared with 24 HDR, for intake of short-chain menaquinones were ranging between 0. 30 and 0. 34. Long-chain menaquinones showed good relative validity (rs= 0. 60 – 0. 69). Plasma phylloquinone concentrations were weakly correlated with phylloquinone intake (rs= 0. 16 (0. 07 - 0. 24).

DESIGN: Retrospective food intake of 56 - 72 -year-old subjects was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire designed for the AGES-Reykjavik Study (AGES-FFQ), an epidemiological study of older individuals. Results were compared with detailed dietary data gathered from the same individuals 18 - 19 years previously, i. e., in midlife, {{as part of a}} national cohort.

40|$|Abstract Background Worldwide, {{herbs and}} spices are much used food flavourings. However, little data exist {{regarding}} actual dietary intake of culinary {{herbs and spices}}. We developed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) {{for the assessment of}} habitual diet the preceding year, with focus on phytochemical rich food, including herbs and spices. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the intakes of herbs and spices from the FFQ with estimates of intake from another dietary assessment method. Thus we compared the intake estimates from the FFQ with 28 days of estimated records of herb and spice consumption as a reference method. Methods The evaluation study was conducted among 146 free living adults, who filled in the FFQ and 2 - 4 weeks later carried out 28 days recording of herb and spice consumption. The FFQ included a section with questions about 27 individual culinary herbs and spices, while the records were open ended records for recording of herbs and spice consumption exclusively. Results Our study showed that the FFQ obtained slightly higher estimates of total intake of herbs and spices than the total intake assessed by the Herbs and Spice Records (HSR). The correlation between the two assessment methods with regard to total intake was good (r = 0. 5), and the cross-classification suggests that the FFQ may be used to classify subjects according to total herb and spice intake. For the 8 most frequently consumed individual herbs and spices, the FFQ obtained good estimates of median frequency of intake for 2 herbs/spices, while good estimates of portion sizes were obtained for 4 out of 8 herbs/spices. Conclusions Our results suggested that the FFQ was able to give good estimates of frequency of intake and portion sizes on group level for several of the most frequently used herbs and spices. The FFQ was only able to fairly <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> according to frequency of intake of the 8 most frequently consumed herbs and spices. Other studies are warranted to further explore the intakes of culinary spices and herbs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: In {{studies on}} diet and cancer, diet {{assessment}} should address long-term intake. Therefore, the authors determined the 5 -year reproducibility of a self-adminstered 150 -item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) {{used to assess}} dietary habits in the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer. Since the FFQ was repeated more than once, the pure test-retest reliability of the FFQ could be distinguished from the intra-individual change in nutrient intake over time. These results were furthermore used to investigate the measurement error structure of the FFQ. Design: After baseline administration in 1986, the FFQ was annually repeated from 1987 to 1991 in independent random samples of the cohort (n = 400). Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between baseline and repeated measurements of nutrient intake, calculated for each time interval, were regressed on time interval to provide separate estimates of the test-retest correlation (intercept of regression line) and {{of the decline in}} correlation over time (slope). The proportion of correlated measurement error was derived from combining the test-retest results with those from a validation study, in which the FFQ was validated against three 3 -day diet records. Results and conclusion: Response was stable at 82 %. The test-retest r ranged from 0. 42 for selenium intake to 0. 90 for alcohol intake. The slopes of the regression lines were relatively flat, but negative for most nutrients; on average, the decline in r amounted to 0. 07 after 5 years, indicating that the potential of a single FFQ measurement to <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> according to nutrient intake dropped only slightly over time. This is important for studies on cancer since a long induction period may be involved. It was furthermore shown that the proportion of within-subject (error) variance of the FFQ method that could be attributed to correlated error ranged from 0 to 50 %. This finding confirms that a reliability study may underestimate the measurement error of a method. Sponsorship: Dutch Cancer Society (grants CIVO 86 - 1 and CIVO 90 - 3).

40|$|Background Worldwide, {{herbs and}} spices are much used food flavourings. However, little data exist {{regarding}} actual dietary intake of culinary {{herbs and spices}}. We developed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) {{for the assessment of}} habitual diet the preceding year, with focus on phytochemical rich food, including herbs and spices. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the intakes of herbs and spices from the FFQ with estimates of intake from another dietary assessment method. Thus we compared the intake estimates from the FFQ with 28 days of estimated records of herb and spice consumption as a reference method. Methods The evaluation study was conducted among 146 free living adults, who filled in the FFQ and 2 - 4 weeks later carried out 28 days recording of herb and spice consumption. The FFQ included a section with questions about 27 individual culinary herbs and spices, while the records were open ended records for recording of herbs and spice consumption exclusively. Results Our study showed that the FFQ obtained slightly higher estimates of total intake of herbs and spices than the total intake assessed by the Herbs and Spice Records (HSR). The correlation between the two assessment methods with regard to total intake was good (r = 0. 5), and the cross-classification suggests that the FFQ may be used to classify subjects according to total herb and spice intake. For the 8 most frequently consumed individual herbs and spices, the FFQ obtained good estimates of median frequency of intake for 2 herbs/spices, while good estimates of portion sizes were obtained for 4 out of 8 herbs/spices. Conclusions Our results suggested that the FFQ was able to give good estimates of frequency of intake and portion sizes on group level for several of the most frequently used herbs and spices. The FFQ was only able to fairly <b>rank</b> <b>subjects</b> according to frequency of intake of the 8 most frequently consumed herbs and spices. Other studies are warranted to further explore the intakes of culinary spices and herbs...|$|E
