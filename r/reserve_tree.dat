40|$|A <b>reserve</b> <b>tree</b> method (RTM) of {{harvesting}} {{was installed}} in six 70 to 75 year old aspen dominated stands to determine if retaining 10 to 15 dominant aspen per acre would decrease sucker density to facilitate restoration of a conifer component. A reserve shelterwood cut was applied to three additional stands to evaluate performance of white pine planted under 50 % crown cover. After the first full growing season following harvest, 96 % of the RTM harvested areas were stocked; sucker density averaged 27000 per acre versus 38. 2 k per acre on a clearcut control, 41 % greater. Basal diameter of dominant suckers averaged 0. 45 inch, 28 % greater than the control, and mean height was 60 inches, 33 % greater. The control site had 3. 1 k stems per acre of associated commercial species versus 5. 8 k on the RTM sites, an 87 % difference. Four of the nine stands have been planted; first-year survival ranged from 75 % to near 100 %. The RTM shows promise for reducing sucker density, increasing their early growth, maintaining species diversity, and providing abundant regeneration of commercial species on {{a high proportion of}} the areas harvested. Early results indicate that both the RTM and shelterwood methods can facilitate restoring a component of native conifer species in these ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|In the West, {{thinning}} {{and partial}} cuttings are {{being considered for}} treating millions of forested acres that are overstocked and prone to wildfire. The objectives of these treatments include tree growth redistribution, tree species regulation, timber harvest, wildlife habitat improvement, and wildfire-hazard reduction. Depending on the forest type and its structure, thinning has {{both positive and negative}} impacts on crown fire potential. Crown bulk density, surface fuel, and crown base height are primary stand characteristics that determine crown fire potential. Thinning from below, free thinning, and <b>reserve</b> <b>tree</b> shelterwoods have the greatest opportunity for reducing the risk of crown fire behavior. Selection thinning and crown thinning that maintain multiple crown layers, along with individual tree selection systems, will not reduce the risk of crown fires except in the driest ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests. Moreover, unless the surface fuels created by using these treatments are themselves treated, intense surface wildfire may result, likely negating positive effects of reducing crown fire potential. No single thinning approach can be applied {{to reduce the risk of}} wildfires in the multiple forest types of the West. The best general approach for managing wildfire damage seems to be managing tree density and species composition with well-designed silvicultural systems at a landscape scale that includes a mix of thinning, surface fuel treatments, and prescribed fire with proactive treatment in areas with high risk to wildfire...|$|E
40|$|Ecological {{forestry}} {{methods that}} include growing trees to very large diameter, retention of permanent legacy trees, {{and maintenance of}} large coarse woody debris (CWD) can have significant beneficial effects on biological diversity and ecosystem processes, but {{little is known about}} the potential impacts on timber production rates. To address this need, we used the CANOPY model, a crown-based individual-tree model calibrated with data from mature and old-growth stands, to simulate 7 treatments over a span of 150 years in a second-growth northern hardwood stand. Treatments included an untreated control, standard single-tree selection cutting with maximum retained dbh of 60, 70, or 80 cm, and retention of permanent legacy trees at densities of 7, 15, or 22 per ha. Raising the maximum dbh to 70 or 80 cm reduced net harvestable production by 15 - 24 % but resulted in higher residual stand volumes. Retention of permanent legacy trees in the 60 cm maximum dbh trial reduced production by 9 - 33 % depending on <b>reserve</b> <b>tree</b> density. Reserve trees generally did not increase CWD levels above those obtainable under a no-reserve treatment with a 70 or 80 cm maximum dbh. The different treatments had highly variable effects on the degree to which the size distribution of live trees approached old-growth conditions. Some treatments merely maintained mature forest structure, and two of the reserve-tree treatments had structures that vacillated between mature and borderline old-growth conditions. The 80 cm maximum diameter treatment was the only one that promoted negative exponential size distributions with large trees similar to those in the later stages of old-growth development...|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{forest biomass}} {{harvesting}}, or {{the removal of}} harvesting slash (woody debris from tree branches and tops) for use as biofuel, {{has the potential to}} negatively affect the soil microbial community (SMC) due to loss of carbon and nutrient inputs from the slash, alteration of the soil microclimate, and increased nutrient leaching. These effects could result in lowered forest productivity and threaten the long-term sustainability of forest management. Retaining organic material post-harvest, including greater amounts of harvesting slash and live trees, within harvested areas may ameliorate some negative effects of biomass harvesting on soil processes. We evaluated the effects of biomass harvests with <b>reserve</b> <b>tree</b> and slash retention on the SMC and soil nutrient bioavailability (assessed using plant-root simulator probes) in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests in northern Minnesota during the spring and summer, 1 – 3 years after harvest. Variable biomass removal levels tested include complete removal (whole tree harvest of boles and branches), complete slash retention (bole only harvest), and 20 % slash retention (amount suggested by regional biomass harvesting guidelines). Compared to the unharvested control, biomass harvests had no effect on the multivariate SMC composition or microbial biomass, but did result in a 1 – 4 % increase in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance and reduced bacterial stress two and three years after harvest. Additionally, biomass harvesting increased NH 4 bioavailability during year one, and reduced NO 3 bioavailability during year two when compared to unharvested controls. Among the three biomass harvests with differing levels of slash removal there were few differences in overall SMC composition, microbial biomass, and soil nutrients; however, the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, gram positive and actinomycete bacteria were significantly higher in harvested treatments with more slash retained. These results are specific to single rotation biomass harvesting in aspen stands due to the unique relationships between plants and their associated SMCs, and may not be directly applicable to forest biomass harvesting of other commercial forest tree species, or multiple rotations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} several {{components of}} a multi-disciplinary project de-signed to evaluate the ecological and biological effects of two innovative silvicultural treatments coupled with prescribed fi re {{in an attempt to}} both manage fuel profi les and create two-aged stand structures in lodgepole pine. Two shelterwood silvicultural treatments were designed to replicate as well as enhance the existing multi-aged stand structure on the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest in central Montana: the fi rst, with <b>reserve</b> <b>trees</b> evenly distributed; the second, with reserves contained within small (1 / 10 - 1 / 4 acre) groups. Retention of <b>reserve</b> <b>trees</b> was targeted at 50 %, without regard to diameter or species. Eight even distribution and eight group-retention treatments were applied on 16 units totaling 649 acres. Half of the units were broadcast burned following harvest using a common burn prescription on all units. Allowable overstory mortality specifi ed in the prescribed fi re plan was 50 %. Plot-based fuel inventories and fi re effects observations were performed at permanent plot locations prior to and following harvest, and after burning. Fuel moisture samples were acquired immediately prior to ignition. Data from four prescribed-burned treatment units were evaluated for this paper: two even-retention units and two grouped retention units. Harvest activities resulted in signifi cant increases in fi ne-fuel loading (1 -, 10 -, and 100 -hour fuel), which was subsequently reduced by prescribed fi re to near pre-harvest levels. Consumption of large woody fuel was similar for both treatment types. The fi re-induced mortality of overstory trees was greater in the even distribution than in the grouped distribu-tion. Despite careful execution of a relatively conservative burn plan, mortality in the even treatments exceeded the prescription threshold of 50 % by an additional 28 %. Additional data collected at the plots include trees per acre, residual tree mortality, residual tree growth, regeneration, windthrow, hydrologic responses, soil impacts, and beetle activity. A comprehensive summary of the treatments will follow subsequent monitoring scheduled to occur fi ve and ten years after burning...|$|R
