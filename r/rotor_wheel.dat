40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{detailed study of}} the performance of a nozzled, double entry turbine. This configuration is primarily found in the turbocharger application and encompasses two different entries, each feeding 180 ° of a single turbine wheel. The primary motives for this research are to enhance the knowledge and understanding of the behaviour of such a device under steady and pulsating flows including the effect of three different nozzle vane geometries. The work incorporates both experimental and computational analyses. Experimental results show that with unequal admission between the two volute entries the performance of the turbine is greatly affected compared to when both entries are flowing equally. A methodology was developed which successfully linked the unequal admission performance of the turbine to the full admission maps which are more readily available. Pulsating flow was found to affect the average performance of the turbine compared to the steady state characteristics. Examination of the instantaneous mass flow showed a large degree of mass storage in the turbine domain for all conditions of pulsating flow. A new parameter was developed based upon the conservation of mass in order to quantify unsteadiness taking into account both pulse amplitude and frequency. Steady and unsteady computational simulations were undertaken for one of the different nozzle configurations. Entropy generation rate was used to establish the distribution of loss within the turbine. In partial admission the loss distribution within the <b>rotor</b> <b>wheel</b> was found to be different to any case during full admission operation. Under pulsed flow conditions the computational analysis showed that the loss distribution changes throughout a pulse cycle showing that the flow regime will also undergo a large change. The loss distribution within the <b>rotor</b> <b>wheel</b> at one point within the pulse cycle was found to be very similar the equivalent steady state condition. Open Acces...|$|E

The oscillator signal is modulated by a change in electrical capacitance between the probe electrode and a passing blade tip surface while an automatic feedback correction circuit corrects oscillator signal drift.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{detailed}} understanding of the flow interaction within the complex geometry of turbine stage coupled with reflection and superposition of the imposed unsteady pressure waves. The defining performance characteristic of a turbomachines is the inlet flow angle at its leading edge, which in most cases limit its optimum operational range. Pulsating flow field, typical to turbocharger turbine due to opening and closing of the exhaust valves, further deteriorates the flow angle distribution around its circumference, hence performance. To investigate this phenomena and how it differs from the steady state equivalent, a fully validated 'cold flow' Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was carried out. For this purpose, 4 unsteady CFD simulations of 20 Hz, 40 Hz, 60 Hz and 80 Hz together with the steady state simulations have been conducted at 30, 000 rpm turbine speed. Discussions in this paper aim {{to provide a}} better insight on the flow angle behaviour in pulsating flow field. Evidences are shown where flow angle swings {{over a wide range}} (300 % more than the steady state condition) in pulsating flow field as it propagates through the guide vanes. It was also found that the flow angle fluctuations during pressure drop period is significantly lower as compared to that during pressure increment period by (19 °). This work also leads to a recommendation of correction factor in applying quasi-steady assumption of the <b>rotor</b> <b>wheel.</b> Without this correction, the prediction results could lead to underestimation of mass flow parameter up to 8 % at high pressure rati...|$|E

First, a bibliographic search {{was carried out}} on current methods of noise prediction. The main input parameters of the selected methods were varied systematically {{in the sense of}} a sensitivity analysis in order to check the plausibility of the results and assess the accuracy required of the input parameters. The selected methods were implemented in a user-friendly PC program ('SIBNOISE-AX'). The methods and the {{computer program}} were tested using the example of two blowers, i. e. a low-pressure and a high-pressure axial blower. Both blowers were calculated without guide wheels as the research project focused on <b>rotor</b> <b>wheel</b> noise only. Aerodynamic and acoustic data were obtained in a standard test stand in order to provide a data base. Time-averaged flow fields in the rotor wheels were calculated using a commercial CFD code, and parameters like boundary layer thickness and relevant velocities in the blade region were derived which - in addition to simple estimates - were used as input parameters in the noise prediction methods. The results provided by the calculations differed depending on the method employed, but some methods provided results that were in good agreement with the measurements. Their accuracy was sufficient even when the input parameters were only estimated and could be improved further by using the numerically calculated flow field parameters. The research project was thus completed successfully.

40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{the sources of}} loss inside a mixed flow, double entry {{turbocharger}} turbine under steady inlet conditions in both full and partial admission. Under normal on-engine operation, {{it is likely that}} both limbs in adouble entry device will be fed by exhaust pulsations which are out of phase meaning that the turbine will spend most or all of the time with unbalanced flow through each limb. In the extreme case one limb will be flowing whilst the other is stagnant, this is the partial admission condition. Even under steady state inlet conditions, unequal admission is an important effect to study on the way to fully understanding pulsed operation of adouble entry device. This paper presents 3 D computational analyses of the flow inside adouble entry turbine under both full and partial admission. The computational results are compared to experimental results of Copeland (2009) and Copeland et al. (2010). The distribution of loss within the turbine is evaluated for each computational condition by means of entropy production. In the full admission case the most significant area of loss was found to be in the tip region. Under the partial admission condition the flow regime is very different. In this case the <b>rotor</b> <b>wheel</b> was found to be acting in a fully unsteady manner, with the flow being unable to reach a fully developed state throughout the flowing section of the volute.

40|$|Thesis: A liquid-cooled, direct-drive, permanent-magnet, {{synchronous}} generator with helical, double-layer, non-overlapping windings formed from a copper conductor with a coaxial internal coolant conduit offers an excellent combination of attributes to reliably provide economic wind {{power for the}} coming generation of wind turbines with power ratings between 5 and 20 MW. A generator based on the liquid-cooled architecture proposed here will be reliable and cost effective. Its smaller size and mass will reduce build, transport, and installation costs. Summary: Converting wind energy into electricity and transmitting it to an electrical power grid to supply consumers {{is a relatively new}} and rapidly developing method of electricity generation. In the most recent decade, the increase in wind energy’s share of overall energy production has been remarkable. Thousands of land-based and offshore wind turbines have been commissioned around the globe, and thousands more are being planned. The technologies have evolved rapidly and are continuing to evolve, and wind turbine sizes and power ratings are continually increasing. Many of the newer wind turbine designs feature drivetrains based on Direct-Drive, Permanent-Magnet, Synchronous Generators (DD-PMSGs). Being low-speed high-torque machines, the diameters of air-cooled DD-PMSGs become very large to generate higher levels of power. The largest direct-drive wind turbine generator in operation today, rated just below 8 MW, is 12 m in diameter and approximately 220 tonne. To generate higher powers, traditional DD-PMSGs would need to become extraordinarily large. A 15 MW air-cooled direct-drive generator would be of colossal size and tremendous mass and no longer economically viable. One alternative to increasing diameter is instead to increase torque density. In a permanent magnet machine, this is best done by increasing the linear current density of the stator windings. However, greater linear current density results in more Joule heating, and the additional heat cannot be removed practically using a traditional air-cooling approach. Direct liquid cooling is more effective, and when applied directly to the stator windings, higher linear current densities can be sustained leading to substantial increases in torque density. The higher torque density, in turn, makes possible significant reductions in DD-PMSG size. Over the past five years, a multidisciplinary team of researchers has applied a holistic approach to explore the application of liquid cooling to permanent-magnet wind turbine generator design. The approach has considered wind energy markets and the economics of wind power, system reliability, electromagnetic behaviors and design, thermal design and performance, mechanical architecture and behaviors, and the performance modeling of installed wind turbines. This dissertation is based on seven publications that chronicle the work. The primary outcomes are the proposal of a novel generator architecture, a multidisciplinary set of analyses to predict the behaviors, and experimentation to demonstrate some of the key principles and validate the analyses. The proposed generator concept is a direct-drive, surface-magnet, {{synchronous generator}} with fractional-slot, duplex-helical, double-layer, non-overlapping windings formed from a copper conductor with a coaxial internal coolant conduit to accommodate liquid coolant flow. The novel liquid-cooling architecture is referred to as LC DD-PMSG. The first of the seven publications summarized in this dissertation discusses the technological and economic benefits and limitations of DD-PMSGs as applied to wind energy. The second publication addresses the long-term reliability of the proposed LC DD-PMSG design. Publication 3 examines the machine’s electromagnetic design, and Publication 4 introduces an optimization tool developed to quickly define basic machine parameters. The static and harmonic behaviors of the stator and <b>rotor</b> <b>wheel</b> structures are the subject of Publication 5. And finally, Publications 6 and 7 examine steady-state and transient thermal behaviors. There {{have been a number of}} ancillary concrete outcomes associated with the work including the following. X Intellectual Property (IP) for direct liquid cooling of stator windings via an embedded coaxial coolant conduit, IP for a lightweight wheel structure for lowspeed, high-torque electrical machinery, and IP for numerous other details of the LC DD-PMSG design X Analytical demonstrations of the equivalent reliability of the LC DD-PMSG; validated electromagnetic, thermal, structural, and dynamic prediction models; and an analytical demonstration of the superior partial load efficiency and annual energy output of an LC DD-PMSG design X A set of LC DD-PMSG design guidelines and an analytical tool to establish optimal geometries quickly and early on X Proposed 8 MW LC DD-PMSG concepts for both inner and outer rotor configurations Furthermore, three technologies introduced could be relevant across a broader spectrum of applications. 1) The cost optimization methodology developed as part of this work could be further improved to produce a simple tool to establish base geometries for various electromagnetic machine types. 2) The layered sheet-steel element construction technology used for the LC DD-PMSG stator and <b>rotor</b> <b>wheel</b> structures has potential for a wide range of applications. And finally, 3) the direct liquid-cooling technology could be beneficial in higher speed electromotive applications such as vehicular electric drives...|$|E
40|$|HTML {{clipboard}} Numerical {{analysis of}} partial admission in axial turbines is performed in this work. Geometrical details {{of an existing}} two stage turbine facility with low reaction blades is used for this purpose. For validation of the numerical results, experimental measurements of one partial admission configuration at design point was used. The partial admission turbine with single blockage had unsymmetrical shape; therefore the full annulus of the turbine had to be modeled numerically. The numerical grid included the full annulus geometry together with the disc gaps and rotor shrouds. Importance of various parameters in accurate modeling of the unsteady flow field of partial admission turbines was assessed. Two simpler models were selected to study the effect of accurate modeling of radial distribution of flow parameters. In the first numerical model, the computational grid was two dimensional and the radial distribution of flow parameters was neglected. The second case was three-dimensional and full blades’ span height was modeled but the leakage flows at disc cavity and rotor shroud were neglected. Detailed validation of the results from various computational models with the experimental data showed that modeling of the leakage flow at disc cavities and rotor shroud of partial admission turbines has substantial importance in accuracy of numerical computations. Comparison of the results from two computational models with varying inlet extension showed that modeling of the inlet cone has considerable importance in accuracy of results but with increased computational cost. Partial admission turbine with admission degree of  ε = 0. 524 in one blocked arc and two opposing blocked arcs were tested. Results showed that blocking the inlet annulus in one single arc produce better overall efficiency compared to the two blocked arc model. Effect of varying axial gap distance between the first stage stator and rotor rows was also tested numerically for the partial admission turbine with admission degree of  ε = 0. 726. Results showed higher efficiency for the reduced axial gap model. Computations showed that the main flow leave the blade path down to the disc cavity and re-enter into the flow channel downstream the blockage, this flow would pass the rotor with very low efficiency. First stage rotor blades are subject to large unsteady forces due to the non-uniform inlet flow. Plotting the unsteady forces of first stage rotor blades for partial admission turbine with single blockage showed that the blades experience large changes in magnitude and direction while traveling along the circumference. Unsteady forces of first stage rotor blades were plotted in frequency domain using Fourier transform. The largest amplitudes caused by partial admission were at first and second multiples of rotational frequency due {{to the existence of}} single blockage and change in the force direction. Results obtained from the numerical computations showed that the discs have nonuniform pressure distribution especially in the first stage of partial admission turbines. The axial force of the first <b>rotor</b> <b>wheel</b> was considerably higher when the axial gap distance was reduced between the first stage stator and rotor rows.
