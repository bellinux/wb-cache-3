Both classical procedures and Bayesian posterior predictive checks are presented. For a fixed examinee, responses and response times are independent; checks based on response times offer thus information independent of the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> on response patterns. Empirical examples {{of the use of}} classical and Bayesian checks for detecting two different types of aberrances in response times are presented. The detection rates for the Bayesian checks outperformed those for the classical checks, but at the cost of higher false-alarm rates. A guideline for the choice between the two types of checks is offered...|$|E

Besides the sources of petition signatures, we also study the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> performed by county officials on these signatures to determine whether there are sufficient valid signatures (i. e., from registered voters) in order to qualify the petition for the ballot. We then conduct regression analysis of validity rates by county.

Finally, we demonstrate that signature gathering campaigns have consequences for outcomes by relating the intensity of the signature campaign within a county to ballot roll-off...|$|E

40|$|Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an {{attractive}} extension of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics which solves the SM hierarchy problem. Motivated by the theoretical μ-term problem of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM), the Next-to MSSM (NMSSM) can also account for experimental deviations from the SM like the anomalous muon magnetic moment and the dark matter relic density. Natural SUSY, motivated by naturalness considerations, exhibits small fine tuning and a characteristic phenomenology with light higgsinos, stops and gluinos. We describe a scan in NMSSM parameter space motivated by Natural SUSY and guided by the phenomenology of an NMSSM with a slightly broken Peccei-Quinn symmetry and a lightly coupled singlet. We identify a scenario which survives experimental constraints with a light singlet Higgs and a singlino lightest SUSY particle. We then discuss how the scenario is not presently excluded by searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and which channels are promising for discovery at the LHC and International Linear Collider.

30|$|This paper employs Event-B and its refinement-based {{modeling}} {{approach for}} specification and verification of both safety and eventuality properties when the requirements {{are represented by}} the Fuzzy If–Then rules. In particular, we apply the proof methods proposed in Hoang and Abrial (2011) to verify the eventuality properties.

The contributions of the paper are as follows: (1) providing a presentation of fuzzy terms in classical set theory, (2) providing a set of translation rules from Fuzzy If–Then rules to Event-B language constructs, which makes use of the refinement modeling approach that Event-B supports, and (3) demonstrating how both safety and eventuality properties {{of a set of}} the Fuzzy If–Then rules can be verified using RODIN (Abrial et al. 2010), a supporting tool for Event-B.|$|R

A check constraint placed on a column operates under a slightly different set of rules than those for the DML WHERE clause.

This means that a check constraint will succeed if the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the <b>check</b> is either True or Unknown.

As the existing conformance checking techniques heavily rely on the total ordering of events, their diagnostics are unreliable and often even misleading when the timestamps of events are coarse or incorrect.

40|$|We {{present an}} arc-consistency {{algorithm}} NAC 4 to handle {{some types of}} non-binary constraints. It differs from the generalized algorithm GAC 4 in that the constraints are not modeled as explicit relations but are retained as implicit n-ary relations. We believe that when the <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> constraints is expensive, NAC 4 will perform better than GAC 4. In NAC 4 constraints are ordered according to their cost and cheaper constraints are applied first. It is reasonable to expect that the cost <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> the expensive constraints is lowered because of {{the reduction in the}} domains of some of the nodes as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> the cheaper constraints first.

In order to ensure the normal operation of the pump, it is necessary to monitor its running state and diagnose fault.
