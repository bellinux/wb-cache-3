50|$|Artesunate is {{synthesized}} from dihydroartemisinin (DHA) using succinic acid. It is exceptionally chemically stable, and hence, is {{the only}} drug among artemisins produced in oral tablets, <b>rectal</b> <b>capsule</b> and intravenous injection. Clinical trials have shown {{that it is the}} most potent drug for severe malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum. The World Health Organization has specifically adopted it in 2006 as the only drug for first line treatment of complicated malaria (but in combination with other antimalarials to prevent drug resistance), and is included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Artesunate combination drugs (such as artesunate/amodiaquine and artesunate/mefloquine) are more effective than artemether-based drugs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effects of Xuesetong <b>Soft</b> <b>Capsules</b> (, Notoginseng total saponin) on {{angiogenesis}} and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression in ischemic myocardium of rats with myocardial infarction. MethodsThe left coronary artery of rats was ligated to establish the animal model of acute myocardial infarction. Rats were randomly divided into Xuesetong <b>Soft</b> <b>Capsule,</b> Shexiangbaoxin Pill (positive control), model (negative control) and sham operation groups. After 6 weeks, microvessel count (MVC), microvessel density (MVD) and VEGF mRNA expression in ischemic myocardium were evaluated. ResultsMVC and MVD in the myocardial infarct border area in model, Shexiangbaoxin Pill and Xuesetong <b>Soft</b> <b>Capsule</b> groups significantly increased {{compared with those of}} the sham operation group (P 0. 05). The model group showed significantly higher VEGF mRNA expression than that in the sham operation group (P< 0. 05).

No significant difference between Xuesetong <b>Soft</b> <b>Capsule</b> and the Shexiangbaoxin Pill groups was observed (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Artesunate drug substance, {{for which}} a <b>rectal</b> <b>capsule</b> {{formulation}} is under development {{for the treatment of}} severe malaria, when heated at 100 degrees C for 39 h gives P-artesunate, artesunate dimers, 9, 10 -anhydrodihydroartemisinin (glycal), a DHA beta-formate ester, and smaller amounts of other products that arise via intermediate formation of dihydroartemisinin DHA) and subsequent thermal degradation. Solid DHA at 100 degrees C provides an epimeric mixture of a known peroxyhemiacetal, arising via ring opening to a hydroperoxide and re-closure, smaller amounts of a 3 : 1 mixture of epimers of a known tricarbonyl compound, and a single epimer of a new dicarbonyl compound. The latter arises via homolysis of the peroxide and an ensuing cascade of a-cleavage reactions which leads to loss of formic acid incorporating the C 10 carbon group of DHA exposed by this `unzipping' casyl code. The tricarbonyl compound that arises via peroxide homolysis and extrusion of formic acid from a penultimate hydroxyformate ester incorporating C 12 of the original DHA, is epimeric at the exocyclic 1 ''-aldehyde, and not in the cyclohexanone moiety. It is converted into the dicarbonyl compound by peroxide-induced deformylation. The dicarbonyl compound is not formed during anhydrous ferrous bromide mediated decomposition of, DHA at room temperature, which provides the 1 ''-R epimer of the tricarbonyl compound as the dominant product; this equilibrates at room temperature to the 3 : 7 mixture of epimers of the tricarbonyl compound obtained from thermolysis. Each of artesunate and DHA decomposes readily under aqueous acidic conditions to provide significant amounts of the peroxyhemiacetal, which, like DHA, decomposes to the inert end product 2 -deoxyartemisinin under acidic or basic conditions. DHA and the peroxyhemiacetal are the principal degradants in aged <b>rectal</b> <b>capsule</b> formulations of artesunate. TGA analysis and thermal degradation of DHA reveals a thermal lability which would pose a problem not only in relation to ICH stability testing guidelines, but in the use of DHA in fixed formulations currently under development. This thermolability coupled with the poor physicochemical properties and relative oral bioavailability of DHA suggests that it is inferior to artesunate in application as an antimalarial drug...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the motion of <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> in microchannels is useful for a number applications. This knowledge {{can be used to}} develop devices to sort biological cells based on their size and stiffness. For example, cancer cells have a different stiffness from healthy cells and thus can be readily identified. Additionally, devices can be developed to detect flaws in synthetic particles. Using a 3 D hybrid lattice Boltzmann and lattice spring method, the motion of rigid and <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> in a pressure-driven microfluidic flow was probed. The effect of inertial drift is evaluated in channels different Reynolds numbers. Other system parameters such as capsule elasticity and channel size are also varied to determine their effect. The equilibrium position of capsules in the channel is also obtained. The equilibrium position of rigid and <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> depends on the relative particle size. If the capsule is small, the equilibrium position is found to be closer to the channel wall. Conversely, for larger capsules, the equilibrium position is closer to the channel centerline.

40|$|Objective: To {{obtain a}} {{formulation}} with high bioavailability through {{evaluation of the}} stability of three types of Xuesaitong capsules in the stomachs and intestines of rats. We compared {{the stability of the}} Panax notoginsenoside R 1 as well as the ginsenosides Rg 1, Rb 1, Re, and Rd in different formulations. Methods: Artificial stomach fluid (ASF) and artificial intestinal fluid (AIF) were prepared. Stability of three types of Xuesaitong capsules was examined for 4  h in stomachs and 24  h in intestines. Samples were analyzed at different times by high-performance liquid chromatography. Percent content of NGR 1, GRg 1, GRb 1, GRe, and GRd at different times was calculated. Results: Hard capsules incubated in ASF disintegrated within 2 – 3  min, whereas <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> disintegrated within 7 – 8  min. Components in hard capsules were dissolved rapidly in water, with content of each compound reaching 90 % in 5  min, and degradation of each compound reaching 30 – 50 % after incubation for 240  min. Dissolution and degradation of each component in <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> with a water-soluble base tended to balance at 30 – 90  min. Contents in <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> with a lipid-soluble base showed slow dissolution after ASF incubation for 120  min.

40|$|Background: Darunavir, a second-generation {{protease}} inihibitor, is {{used with}} a low boosting dose of ritonavir to improve its clinical efficacy. The boosting dose of ritonavir acts as an inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4, thereby increasing darunavir bioavailability. Recently, ritonavir tablet has been on sale in place of <b>soft</b> <b>capsule.</b> However, pharmacokinetic study of darunavir by changing ritonavir form is still not clear. In this study, we aimed to compare with plasma darunavir concentrations by switching ritinavir <b>soft</b> <b>capsule</b> to tablet in Japanese HIV- 1 infected patients. Methods: We analyzed 34 Japanese HIV- 1 infected patients (32 males: 2 females) recruited at the National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center. All patients had been administered with 800 / 100 mg darunavir/ritonavir once daily {{in combination with other}} antiretrovirals. Plasma darunavir concentrations were determined by an HPLC method. A pared t-test was used to compare with their concentrations by switching from ritonavir <b>soft</b> <b>capsule</b> to tablet. Results: The mean of age, body weight, and duration of antiretroviral therapy for 34 patients were 41. 9 (range: 24 &#x 2013; 62) years, 66. 3 (range: 51. 4 &#x 2013; 90. 0) kg, and 436 (range: 182 &#x 2013; 739) days, respectively.
