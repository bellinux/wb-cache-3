50|$|Moving {{images were}} {{produced}} on <b>revolving</b> <b>drums</b> and disks in the 1830s with independent invention by Simon von Stampfer (Stroboscope) in Austria, Joseph Plateau (Phenakistoscope) in Belgium and William Horner (zoetrope) in Britain. The Zoetrope, a.k.a., the Daedalum was a revolving cylinder {{which gave the}} illusion of motion to the pictures inside. Charles-Émile Reynaud developed an early animation device in 1877, which he called the Praxinoscope.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} Gestetner further {{developed}} his invention, with the stencil eventually {{being placed on}} a screen wrapped around a pair of <b>revolving</b> <b>drums,</b> onto which ink was placed. The drums were revolved and ink, spread evenly {{across the surface of}} the screen by a pair of cloth-covered rollers, was forced through the cuts made in the stencil and transferred onto a sheet of paper which was fed through the duplicator and pressed by pressure rollers against the lower drum. Each complete rotation of the screen fed and printed one sheet.|$|E
5000|$|The Series 1 {{vehicles}} (1974-85) were characterised by {{stainless steel}} {{front and rear}} bumpers, hydropneumatic suspension as compliant and soft as the DS, a [...] "spaceship" [...] style dashboard featuring a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> speedometer and similar tachometer. A similar version of the <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> speedometer was used earlier in the 1958 Edsel for only one year.|$|R

50|$|A typical {{portable}} {{concrete mixer}} uses a small <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> {{to mix the}} components. For smaller jobs the concrete made at the construction site has no time lost in transport, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, the {{impregnation}} of spruce, {{the most}} important structural timber in large areas in Europe, has shown that unsatisfactory treatment depths have been achieved with impregnation. The maximum penetration of 2 mm {{is not sufficient to}} protect wood in weathered positions. The present-day incising machines consist essentially of four <b>revolving</b> <b>drums</b> fitted with teeth or needles or with lasers that burn the incisions into the wood. Preservatives can be spread along the grain up to 20 mm in radial and up to 2 mm in tangential and radial direction.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{operation}} of machines {{of this type}} was accomplished by means of pulling levers or knobs {{to set up the}} desired number. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division were accomplished by means of <b>revolving</b> <b>drums.</b> For addition they revolved in one direction, and for subtraction the direction was reversed. For multiplication the revolutions were repeated {{in the same direction as}} for addition, and for division they were repeated in the same direction as for subtraction. Two sets of dials provided a means of reading totals. In one the accumulation of totals appeared; in the other, there appeared the figure which was added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided."

Each complete rotation of the screen fed and printed one sheet. After the first typewriter was invented, a stencil was created which could be typed on, thus creating copies similar to printed newspapers and books, instead of handwritten material.|$|E
50|$|A {{key element}} of the ShKAS' high rate of fire is the <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> (feed cage) that holds ten rounds and {{provides}} a very smooth, progressive removal of the cartridges from their disintegrating link belt. Another element is the lightweight recoiling portion of the gun, weighing only 921 grams (2.07 lb).|$|R
50|$|Each episode {{featured}} three guests. Originally, {{the first}} two guests were civilians and the third was a celebrity who played for a home viewer that was chosen by pulling a postcard from a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum.</b> This was later changed to having celebrities playing for home viewers throughout the whole show.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interest}} {{in the history of}} this complex renewed in 1913, thanks to the work of the Fine Arts Superintendent Antonio Muñoz. Once the building became an orphanage, the Augustinian nuns put a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> by its entrance which was used as a deposit [...] "box" [...] for unwanted babies.|$|R
50|$|Baron Gruda informs Consuelo {{that she}} will now marry Herman (Eliot Makeham), the {{governor}} of Cobra, or he will execute the island's population. Consuelo is compelled to accept, and Gruda announces the wedding date and mandatory attendance by everyone. In the meantime Vallo, Ojo, and the clever professor escape their dilemma by capsizing their skiff, trapping a large air pocket for them to breath; walking along the sea bottom toward Cobra, they come ashore, where they quickly {{find out about the}} wedding. Vallo intends to rescue Consuelo, but the professor convinces him to first enlist the island's cooperation. Vallo agrees, and along with the professor's advanced knowledge, the people of Cobra build his advanced weapons for their coming revolt. Nitroglycerin grenades, multiple cannon tanks, flamethrowers, rapid-fire rifles on <b>revolving</b> <b>drums,</b> and a large inflatable balloon with gondola are constructed in secret.|$|E
50|$|The only {{stipulation}} of {{the draw}} was that no group could feature two South American teams. As a result, Pot B - which contained two South American teams - was initially drawn containing only the four Europeans, which were then to be immediately allocated to Groups 3 and 6 which contained the two South American seeds Argentina and Brazil. Once these two groups had been filled with the entrants from Pot B, then Chile and Peru would {{be added to the}} pot and the draw continue as normal. In the event, FIFA executives Sepp Blatter and Hermann Neuberger conducting the draw initially forgot this stipulation and immediately placed the first team drawn from this pot (Belgium) into Group 1, rather than Group 3 before then placing the second team drawn out (Scotland) into Group 3; they then had to correct this by moving Belgium to Group 3 and Scotland into Group 6. The ceremony suffered further embarrassment when one of the <b>revolving</b> <b>drums</b> containing the teams broke down.|$|E
50|$|For live purposes, {{the band}} {{features}} Gary Lindsey on vocals, Hank Williams III on guitar and vocals, and Joe Buck {{who used to}} be on bass but is now focused on his solo career. Assjack has had a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> slot and background vocalist slot throughout the years. On recent tours, Chris Arp has played lead guitar.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMolecular {{dynamics}} simulation is used {{in studying}} the appearance of axial and radial segregation in a horizontal <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> containing a mixture of two different kinds of granular particles. As with real granular matter, {{the nature of the}} segregation is parameter dependent; for example, radial segregation can be transient or long-lasting, and axial bands can merge. Simulations displaying the different kinds of behavior are described...|$|R
5000|$|A {{kymograph}} (a Greek-derived name {{which means}} 'wave writer') is {{a device that}} draws a graphical representation of spatial position over time in which a spatial axis represents time. It basically consists of a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> wrapped with {{a sheet of paper}} on which a stylus moves back and forth recording perceived changes of phenomena such as motion or pressure.The kymograph was initially a mechanical and hydraulic device, invented by German physiologist Carl Ludwig in the 1840s, and found its first use as a means to intrusively monitor blood pressure. The blood pressure was conveyed by hydraulics and levers to move a stylus that scratched a white trace into soot-covered paper on the <b>revolving</b> <b>drum.</b> Time is represented by the drum's rotation rate, and was recorded by a further stylus driven by a clock or tuning fork. The kymograph almost immediately became the central instrument in physiology and physiology education. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, researchers and technicians devised many improvements to the device, plus numerous new sensory components, to measure a wide range of physiological phenomena such as breathing, muscle movement, speech. New detection and registration systems included electrical and electronic methods, and plotted in ink.|$|R
50|$|Developed by Carl Ludwig in the 19th century, the {{kymograph}} is a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> {{on which}} a moving stylus tracks the size of some measurement {{as a function of}} time. The kymograph is similar to the polygraph, which has a strip of paper moving under one or more pens. The kymograph was originally used to measure blood pressure and it later was used to measure muscle contractions and speech sounds. In psychology, it was often used to record response times.|$|R
50|$|Flux Information Sciences were a three-piece noise {{rock band}} based in Brooklyn, New York City. The band {{was formed in}} 1996 by vocalist/guitarist Tristan Bechet (born in Portugal in 1973, raised in Brazil) and keyboardist Sebastian Brault (born in Madagascar, raised in France) who met in art school in Marseilles. A <b>revolving</b> <b>drummer</b> policy saw Derek Ethridge replace Phil Hernandez in 1999, who was in turn {{replaced}} by Siobhan Duffy. Eventually the band settled on the line-up of Bechet and Brault, with Christopher Pravdica on electronics.|$|R
5000|$|William Dickson left Edison's {{company and}} formed his own company, that {{produced}} the mutoscope, a form of hand cranked peep show movie machine. These machines produced moving images, {{by means of a}} <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> of card illustrations, similar in concept to flip-books, taken from an actual piece of film. They were often featured, at seaside locations, showing (usually) sequences of women undressing or acting as an artist's model. In Britain, they became known as [...] "What the butler saw" [...] machines, taking the name from one of the first and most famous softcore reels.|$|R
2500|$|After taking {{notice of}} Joseph Plateau's {{invention}} of the phénakisticope (published in London as [...] "phantasmascope") British mathematician William George Horner thought up a cylindrical variation and published details about its mathematical principles in January 1834. He called his device the [...] "dædaleum", as {{a reference to the}} Greek myth of Daedalus. Horner's <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> had viewing slits between the pictures instead of above as most later zoetrope variations would have. Horner planned to publish the dædaleum with optician King, Jr in Bristol but it [...] "met with some impediment probably in the sketching of the figures".|$|R
50|$|A {{concrete}} mixer (often mistakenly called a cement mixer) is {{a device that}} homogeneously combines cement, aggregate such as sand or gravel, and water to form concrete. A typical {{concrete mixer}} uses a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> to mix the components. For smaller volume works portable concrete mixers are often used so that the concrete can be made at the construction site, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. An alternative to a machine is mixing concrete by hand. This is usually done in a wheelbarrow; however, several companies have recently begun to sell modified tarps for this purpose.|$|R
6000|$|The {{rick was}} unhaled by full daylight; the men then took their places, the women mounted, {{and the work}} began. Farmer Groby--or, as they called him, [...] "he"--had arrived ere this, and by his orders Tess {{was placed on the}} {{platform}} of the machine, close to the man who fed it, her business being to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her by Izz Huett, who stood next, but on the rick; so that the feeder could seize it and spread it over the <b>revolving</b> <b>drum,</b> which whisked out every grain in one moment.|$|R
50|$|Professor C. G. A. Rossby, {{who led the}} Institute's {{division}} of Meteorology, collaborated in studies to develop improved methods of recording weather data for comprehensive studies of cloud formations and their connection with the vertical structure of the atmosphere. Specially designed photographic equipment was installed in the plane. The readings are automatically and continuously recorded throughout the flight on a thin sheet of smoked aluminum foil on a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum.</b> The research plane has places for three passengers {{in addition to the}} pilot, and was fitted with various scientific instruments for special weather studies, including a meteorograph used for registering temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity.|$|R

50|$|In June 1954 IBM patent {{attorney}} A.J. Etienne sought Atanasoff's help in breaking an Eckert-Mauchly patent on a <b>revolving</b> magnetic memory <b>drum,</b> having been alerted by Clifford Berry that the ABC's <b>revolving</b> capacitor memory <b>drum</b> may have constituted prior art. Atanasoff agreed {{to assist the}} attorney, but IBM ultimately entered a patent-sharing agreement with Sperry Rand, {{the owners of the}} Eckert-Mauchly memory patent, and the case was dropped.|$|R
50|$|On stage, Emerson, Lake & Palmer mixed {{the complex}} musicianship of their {{material}} with theatrics which attracted criticism. These included Emerson playing a grand piano while it revolved in mid-air, and abusing the Hammond organ by sticking knives in the manuals, throwing it around stage and letting it feedback, while Palmer {{played on a}} <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> kit. The group carried almost 40 tons of equipment, which took five hours to unpack and set up, including a driven by a 30-channel board discrete quadraphonic public address sound system, provided by International Entertainers Service, and a state-of-the-art lighting system, designed by Judy Rasmussen, which consisted of large ladders at each corner of the stage and two arches installed above the performance area.|$|R
50|$|The <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> is {{an unusual}} FP shutter {{that has been used}} in several {{specialized}} panoramic cameras such as the Panon Widelux (1959, Japan) and KMZ Horizont (1968, Soviet Union). Instead of using an extremely short focal length (wide-angle) lens to achieve an extra wide field of view, these cameras have a medium-wide lens encapsulated in a drum with a rear vertical slit. As the entire drum is horizontally pivoted on the lens's nodal point, the slit wipes an extra wide aspect image onto film held against a curved focal plane. The Widelux produced a 140° wide image in a 24×59 mm frame on 135 film with a Lux 26mm f/2.8 lens and controlled shutter speed by varying rotation speed on a fixed slit width.|$|R
5000|$|... 7,5/57 is an {{air-cooled}} semi-automatic {{gun with}} a vertically sliding breech block and a monoblock barrel {{fitted with a}} fume extractor. It uses fixed ammunition which is fed from a magazine below the gun {{by means of an}} elevator. Loading of the elevator as well as the gun is by hand, but the elevator bottom features a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> which acts as a buffer. Spent cartridges are ejected into a pipe arrangement and slide downwards to a room opposite to the magazine.Normally, each gun is served by 7 men with 3 in the turret itself (gun captain, traverse operator and elevation operator) and 4 ammunition handlers in the magazine. Additional crew is needed for the ranging stations, command center, galley and for close-in protection.|$|R

40|$|The {{preparation}} {{and testing of}} potential sorbents for removing H{sub 2 }S and COS from hot coal gas continued. Two preparation methods received the most consideration. Both methods involve pelletizing powders in a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> under moist conditions followed either by heat treatment or steam curing to harden the pellets, depending on the particle bonding mechanism. One method was used to pelletize mixtures of calcium carbonate and either alumina or a calcium aluminate cement in a single step. Another method was used to pelletize powdered limestone in an initial step followed by {{the application of a}} coating consisting of both limestone and a hydraulic cement in a second step. By employing this method, an especially promising material was produced consisting of a limestone core surrounded by a shell consisting initially of 80 wt. % limestone and 20 % wt. % calcium aluminate cement. The best material exhibited both an acceptable crushing strength and adsorption capacity for H{sub 2 }S...|$|R
40|$|Oscillator {{strengths}} of lead atom spectral {{lines have been}} measured by observing the radiation emanating from gas samples heated to 10 000 °K in a pressure‐driven shock tube. Shocks were produced by allowing hydrogen at high pressure to rapidly expand into dilute mixtures of tetraethyllead and neon. The thermodynamic state of the spectroscopically interesting gas behind the reflected shock was computed by using the measured shock velocity to estimate the state of an ideal gas, then using the state variables so derived to estimate the energy consumed in real gas effects, and completing the cycle by recalculating the state variables. Spectroscopic observations were made with a double prism spectrograph coupled with a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> camera. The Stark broadening of Hβ {{was used to measure}} the electron density of the gas behind the first reflected shock. Quantitative spectroscopic analysis of lead atom emission lines led to the following absorption f‐values: λ = 3639, f = 0. 04; λ = 3683, f = 0. 07; λ = 4057, f = 0. 15...|$|R
40|$|This unique {{piece of}} {{apparatus}} uses Lissajous figures {{to show that}} the ratio of the frequency ratios in a diatonic scale are ratios of small numbers. On the side is an air-driven vibrating reed with a small mirror attached to its free end. The octagonal, <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> contains eight reeds, ranging up the scale from the same frequency as the fixed reed to its octave. In use, the box holding the fixed reed would be rotated 90 degrees, making it oscillate at right angles to the other reeds. A beam of light reflecting from the two reeds in succession undergoes simple harmonic motion in two perpendicular directions, thus producing a Lissajous figure when the beam strikes a screen. The shape of the figures produced by two frequencies which bear small number ratios to each other is well-known.
