50|$|For <b>reverse</b> <b>compatibility,</b> Linux can use GPT disks in BIOS-based {{systems for}} both data storage and booting, as both GRUB 2 and Linux are GPT-aware. Such a setup is usually {{referred}} to as BIOS-GPT. As GPT incorporates the protective MBR, a BIOS-based computer can boot from a GPT disk using GPT-aware boot loader stored in the protective MBR's bootstrap code area. In case of GRUB, such a configuration requires a BIOS Boot partition for GRUB to embed its second-stage code due to absence of the post-MBR gap in GPT partitioned disks (which is {{taken over by the}} GPT's Primary Header and Primary Partition Table). Commonly 1 MiB in size, this partition's Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) in GPT scheme is 21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-656564454649 and is used by GRUB only in BIOS-GPT setups. From the GRUB's perspective, no such partition type exists in case of MBR partitioning. This partition is not required if the system is UEFI-based because no embedding of the second-stage code is needed in that case.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether the recurrent difficulty to replicate results obtained with paradigms measuring distractor processing {{as a function}} of perceptual load is due to individual differences. We first reanalyzed, at the individual level, the data of eight previously reported experiments. These reanalyses revealed substantial inter-individual differences, with particularly low percentage of participants whose performance matched the load theory's predictions (i. e., larger distractor interference with low than high levels of load). Moreover, frequently the results were opposite to the theory's predictions-larger interference in the high than low load condition; and often a <b>reversed</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect emerged-better performance in the incompatible than neutral condition. Subsequently, seven observers participated in five identical experimental sessions. If the observed inter-individual differences are due to some stable trait or perceptual capacity, similar results should have emerged in all sessions of a given participant. However, all seven participants showed large between-sessions variations with similar patterns to those found between participants. These findings question the theoretical foundation implemented with these paradigms, as none of the theories suggested thus far can account for such inter- and intra-individual differences. Thus, these paradigms should be used with caution until further research will provide better understanding of what they actually measure...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} {{holds that}} a decision between two unattractive alternatives {{is more difficult}} than one between two attractive alternatives. We argue that this conclusion may rest on the the task of "choosing" adopted in the past research. A task of choosing requires an attractiveness judgment that is compatible with attractive alternatives but incompatible with unattractive alternatives. We test this thesis by <b>reversing</b> the <b>compatibility</b> using a reject task that requires judgment of unattractiveness. Two studies find that compatibility between alternative valence and task influences decision time, decision difficulty, attribute recall, and effort, underscoring {{the role of the}} task in the study of attribute conflict.

40|$|Inhibitory control {{functions}} {{in old age}} were investigated with the "masked prime" paradigm in which participants executed speeded manual choice responses to simple visual targets. These were preceded-either immediately or at some earlier time-by a backward-masked prime. Young adults produced positive compatibility effects (PCEs) -faster and more accurate responses for matching than for nonmatching prime-target pairs-when prime and target immediately followed each other, and the <b>reverse</b> effect (negative <b>compatibility</b> effect, NCE) for targets that followed the prime after a short interval. Older adults produced similar PCEs to young adults, indicating intact low-level motor activation, but failed to produce normal NCEs even with longer delays (Experiment 1), increased opportunity for prime processing (Experiment 2), and prolonged learning (Experiment 3). However, a fine-grained analysis of each individual's time course of masked priming effects revealed NCEs {{in the majority of}} older adults, of the same magnitude as those of young adults. These were significantly delayed (even more than expected on the basis of general slowing), indicating a disproportionate impairment of low-level inhibitory motor control in old age.

40|$|We {{explored}} possible between-language influences when bilinguals processed two-digit numbers. Spanish/English bilinguals and German/English bilinguals {{performed a}} number comparison task with Arabic digits and verbal numbers {{in their first}} language (L 1) and second language (L 2) while the unit-decade compatibility was manipulated. The two bilingual groups showed regular compatibility effect with Arabic digits. In L 1, Spanish/English bilinguals showed <b>reverse</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect, while German/English bilinguals showed regular compatibility effect. However, both groups of bilinguals presented <b>reverse</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect in English (L 2), which suggested that the bilinguals’ L 1 did not determine the processing of number words in their L 2. The results indicated that bilinguals processed two-digit number words selectively in their L 1 and L 2 and {{that they did not}} transcode L 2 numbers into Arabic format...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{evaluated}} whether {{learning a}} second language (L 2) influences the processing of numerical information. A group of German/English bilinguals with high/low L 2 fluency performed two-digit number comparison tasks while the unit-decade compatibility was evaluated. All participants presented compatibility effect with Arabic digits regardless of their L 2 learning stage. However, low fluency bilinguals performed verbal number comparison as monolinguals (regular compatibility effect in German, <b>reverse</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect in English) while fluent bilinguals with intensive experience in L 2 learning did not show compatibility effects in either German or English. These results suggest that L 2 learning determines the processing of two-digit number words. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} whether {{proficiency in}} a second language (L 2) influenced the processing of numerical information. In Experiment 1, two groups of German/English bilinguals, one less proficient in English (L 2) and the other more proficient in L 2, performed two-digit number comparison tasks while the unit–decade compatibility was evaluated. All participants presented compatibility effect with Arabic digits regardless of their L 2 proficiency. However, when bilinguals with less proficiency in L 2 performed verbal number comparison tasks they showed regular compatibility effect in German and <b>reverse</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect in English, whereas more proficient bilinguals did not show compatibility effects in either German or English. In Experiment 2, {{the same pattern of}} results was obtained with highly proficient bilinguals after controlling their working memory span. These results indicate that L 2 proficiency influences the processing of two-digit number words...|$|E
40|$|The role of body {{orientation}} in the orienting and allocation of social attention was examined using an adapted Simon paradigm. Participants categorized the facial expression of forward facing, computer-generated human figures by pressing {{one of two}} response keys, each located left or right of the observers' body midline, while {{the orientation of the}} stimulus figure's body (trunk, arms, and legs), which was the task-irrelevant feature of interest, was manipulated (oriented toward the left or right visual hemifield) with respect to the spatial location of the required response. We found that when the orientation of the body was compatible with the required response location, responses were slower relative to when body orientation was incompatible with the response location. In line with a model put forward by Hietanen (1999), this <b>reverse</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect suggests that body orientation is automatically processed into a directional spatial code, but that this code is based on an integration of head and body orientation within an allocentric-based frame of reference. Moreover, we argue that this code may be derived from the motion information implied in the image of a figure when head and body orientation are incongruent. Our results have implications for understanding the nature of the information that affects the allocation of attention for social orienting...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{research}} on automatic imitation has received considerable attention because it represents an experimental platform for investigating {{a number of}} inter-related theories suggesting that the perception of action automatically activates corresponding motor programs. A key debate within this research centers on whether automatic imitation is any different than other long-term S-R associations, such as spatial stimulus-response compatibility. One approach to resolving this issue is to examine whether automatic imitation shows similar response characteristics as other classes of stimulus-response compatibility. This hypothesis was tested by comparing imitative and spatial compatibility effects with a two alternative forced-choice stimulus-response compatibility paradigm and two tasks: one that involved selecting {{a response to the}} stimulus (S-R) and one that involved selecting a response to the opposite stimulus (OS-R), i. e., the one not presented. The stimulus for both tasks was a left or right hand with either the index or middle finger tapping down. Speeded responses were performed with the index or middle finger of the right hand in response to the finger identity or the left-right spatial position of the fingers. Based on previous research and a connectionist model, we predicted standard compatibility effects for both spatial and imitative compatibility in the S-R task, and a <b>reverse</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect for spatial compatibility but not for imitative compatibility in the OS-R task. The results from the mean response times, mean percentage of errors, and response time distributions all converged to support these predictions. A second noteworthy result was that the recoding of the finger identity in the OS-R task required significantly more time than the recoding of the left-right spatial position, but the encoding time for the two stimuli in the S-R task was equivalent. In sum, this evidence suggests that the processing of spatial and imitative compatibility is dissociable with regard to two different processes in dual processing models of stimulus-response compatibility...|$|E
