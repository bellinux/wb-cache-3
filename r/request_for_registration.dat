The registrant, Bayer CropScience, is submitting a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> of clothianidin {{to be used}} as a seed treatment on cotton and mustard (oilseed and condiment). The major risk concerns are with aquatic free-swimming and benthic invertebrates, terrestrial invertebrates, birds, and mammals. The proposed use on cotton poses an acute and chronic risk to freshwater and estuarine/marine free-swimming invertebrates, but the risk in some cases depends on the incorporation method and the region of the U. S. where the crops are grown. The proposed use on mustard only shows a risk concern on a chronic basis to estuarine/marine free-swimming invertebrates with a low efficiency incorporation method. The proposed uses result in acute risk to freshwater and estuarine/marine benthic invertebrates, but incorporation and region have minimal impact on the risk conclusions. Chronic risk was only present for estuarine/marine benthic invertebrates but was independent of incorporation efficiency and region. 2 Clothianidin’s major risk concern is to nontarget insects (that is, honey bees).

Methods 48 selected journals {{were divided into two}} groups: impact-factor (n= 24), and no-impact-factor (n= 24). The number of ethical requirements was compared between both groups based on a specific research protocol, ranging from zero to six points, analyzing the presence of an approval by a research ethics committee; reference {{to the fact that the}} research follows the precepts of the Declaration of Helsinki and the rules of Resolution 196 / 96; use of an informed consent; information about the authors’ conflicts of interest; and a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> of clinical trials in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry. ResultsThe average score of the impact-factor group was significantly higher than that of the no-impact-factor group (3. 12 ± 1. 03 vs. 2. 08 ± 1. 64, p= 0. 0121). When each ethical requirement was compared between the groups, there was significant difference only between the requirement of an informed consent and the disclosure of conflicts of interest (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Informatization {{of world}} science {{predetermined}} {{the emergence of}} new tools for measurement and evaluation of the work of a scientist in quantitative aspect and the creation of scientometric databases, respectively. The existence of different approaches to the assessment of knowledge {{with the use of the}} global scientometric databases confirms the relevance of this research. The aim of the research is the systematization of methodological approaches to the assessment of the knowledge accumulated in scientometric databases, and determining prospects for the development of the assessment of knowledge of Ukrainian authors in the world system of scientometric evaluation. We applied general scientific and special research methods: analysis, synthesis, comparative characteristics, theoretical generalization, system approach. In the work a scientometric database is defined as the platform that deposits (accumulates) in electronic format scientific works of scientists of different branches of knowledge and processes lists of cited literature, calculates certain quantitative indicators, based on which it is possible to analyze the influence/credibility of the activity of one or another publication, organization, scientist etc. It is stressed that the main indicator, with the help of which the assessment of knowledge is given, is the knowledge economy index. We carried out a historical review and found that the first and one of the most respected scientometric knowledge databases of the world is Web of Science, part of the platform of the Web of Knowledge. The most widely used quantitative measure that is calculated in this database is the index of efficiency. Another most famous database is Scopus, which Elsevier publishing corporation positions as the largest universal abstract database that allows tracking scientific citation of publications. In accordance with the declared policy of the corporation, this database must become the most complete and exhaustive resource for the search of literature. It was found that the projects concerning the use of the scientometric database Scopus for assessment of the scientific potential of Ukraine in general and individual subjects of scientific activities of the state at the level of the authorities of state governance began to emerge in 2009. It is stressed that only a small proportion of professional publications of Ukraine is integrated into Scopus and the Web of Science, and to analyze objectively the status of science development in the country with their help is impossible. We concluded that despite the inclusion of new publications into these databases, joining them is a complex and lengthy process. Out of several thousand of journals, the Web of Science selects about 10 – 12, Scopus ~ 50 %. The review procedure lasts for almost a year and in case of rejection the renewed <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> can be submitted only in 2 years. The assumption was adopted about the development of the assessment of knowledge by means of the most famous global scientometric databases in Ukraine: much time is yet to pass until most of the periodicals from the post–Soviet territory will be included into scientific repositories–leaders and a possibility will come to provide objective assessment with their assistance. The scientific novelty of the article is in the systematization of methodological approaches to the analysis and evaluation of knowledge in the world system of scientometric evaluation and in determining the prospects for the development of this sphere in Ukraine. The practical significance of the obtained results is the use by domestic scientists of the materials of the paper to determine scientometric databases and indexes that are the most appropriate for submitting publications and collaboration with the leading periodicals of the world by the fields of knowledge. At present, in the world practice they use 4 indexes of scientific citation as the main tool for the quantitative measurement of the efficiency of the work of a scientist. The use of such indexes is the prospect of further research in the development of the knowledge econom...|$|E

In the a risk assessment methodology presented in directive 81 / 852 /EEC the assessment process is described in two phases. The first phase (I) shall assess the potential of exposure of the environment to the product, its ingredients, or relevant metabolites. The first phase is thus limited to product identification and exposure assessment. Several exemptions for further testing are given, such as trigger values for predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). When these exemptions fail to apply and trigger values are exceeded, Phase II is entered. Phase II is also divided in two parts, Tier A and Tier B.

Due to the spreading of drug-resistance there is concern about the persistence of antibiotic residues in the environment. In past times tetracyclines and macrolides were used as feed additives in food producing animals; now their use has been restricted to therapeutic purposes. A high percentage of the drug is often excreted unchanged in manure and its use as top soil dressing can contaminate water via run-off drainage or through leaching. In 1996 a “Note for guidance for the environmental risk assessment of veterinary drugs” [2] was approved and several information on the environmental persistence and safety of drugs are now <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration.</b> In this study the results from an experimental model carried out “in-field” are reported. The environmental fate of tylosin (TYL) and oxytetracycline (OTC) orally administered for five days to 40 calves (20 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, respectively) was monitored for 6 months in manure, in soil and in surface water. TYL showed a rapid degradation, falling below the limit of quantification after 45 days. For OTC drug half-life in manure was calculated (T 1 / 2 el= 30 days); only traces (lower than the limit of detection, 10 ppb) were found in soil and ground water. Ten ppb is the Safety Limit recommended by the EMEA [2] for drug residues in soil. The data were fitted to a simple mathematical model to check its suitability to predict environmental concentration in manure, soil, and ground water. Result indicate that the five months period necessary for manure ripening permits an adequate degradation and appears sufficient to minimize the environmental impact of these drugs...|$|R
