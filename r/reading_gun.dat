50|$|Reading was {{accomplished}} by scanning the <b>reading</b> <b>gun</b> across the storage area. This gun was set to a voltage that would cross the secondary emission threshold for the entire display. If the scanned area held the holding gun potential {{a certain number of}} electrons would be released, if it held the writing gun potential the number would be higher. The electrons were read on a grid of fine wires placed behind the display, making the system entirely self-contained - the Williams tube's read plate was in front of the tube, and required continual mechanical adjustment to work properly. The grid also had the advantage of breaking the display into spots without requiring the tight focus of the Williams system.|$|E

By accepting the common mantra that law-abiding, licensed firearm owners are not the problem, many have chased popular fears such as mental illness and violent video games.

2500|$|A {{boat was}} lowered from Alcantara {{when it was}} about [...] astern to check the ship's particulars, as the voyage of the Rena had been {{notified}} to the Admiralty. Wardle signalled the Andes of developments and Young replied with [...] "This is the [...] suspicious ship".

The Greif opened fire, hitting the boat containing the boarding party and damaged Alcantara's telemotor steering gear before the British ship could reply. Alcantara's gunners opened fire and the ship closed with the raider as it began to move and for about fifteen minutes the ships exchanged fire and Andes began to fire as it arrived and Greif began to disappear in smoke. The German gunners ceased fire and boats full of survivors were seen pulling away from the smoke. Alcantara was badly damaged and also ceased fire, apparently torpedoed and listing to port; Wardle ordered abandon ship and by 11:00 the list had put Alcantara on its beam ends and it sank with 69 members of the crew.|$|R

50|$|For {{baseball}} {{the scoreboard}} will at the minimum show both team scores, {{as well as}} the current inning. In addition the number of balls, strikes and outs is represented by digits or individual lights. Larger scoreboards offer an inning-by-inning breakdown of the scores, hits, errors, pitch count and the time of day. There may also be another display either separate or combined with the scoreboard listing the radar <b>gun</b> <b>reading</b> of the last pitch thrown in miles per hour. Almost all Major League facilities have a video board as a scoreboard or a matrix display. Usually these scoreboards are controlled via programs that keep statistics and not just the score. Usually the official scorer will operate this program. Then all the information the official scorer will enter, will automatically be made output to the scoreboard. Currently, the largest scoreboards are located at Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio, and Kansas City, Missouri's Kauffman Stadium. There is also a very large scoreboard at Citizens Bank Park, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|When {{the player}} pulls the trigger, the {{computer}} (often assisted by the display circuitry) times {{how long it}} takes the electron beam to excite the phosphor at the location at which the gun is pointed. The light gun sends a signal after sensing the sudden small change in brightness of a point on the screen when the electron gun refreshes that spot. The computer then calculates the targeted position based on the monitor's horizontal refresh rate (the fixed amount of time it takes the beam to get from the left to right side of the screen). Either the computer provides a time base for the horizontal refresh rate through the controller's connector (as in the Super Scope), or the <b>gun</b> <b>reads</b> the composite video signal through a T-connector on the A/V cable (as in the GunCon 2). Once the computer knows where the gun is pointed, it can tell through collision detection if it coincides with the target or not.|$|R
5000|$|Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The film holds a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 reviews, {{with an average}} rating of 5.6/10, with the critical consensus <b>reading,</b> [...] "Naked <b>Gun</b> 33⅓: The Final Insult can't help but be sporadically funny thanks to Leslie Nielsen's dependably solid work, but it's still a steep comedown from the original.". Peter Rainer of the Los Angeles Times praised the opening sequence, which parodied The Untouchables, and the climax at the Academy Awards, but felt the middle was uninspired, and that the film overall had too little plotting and relied too much on comedy without the romantic or action elements of the previous films. Others felt that the humor was weak and too {{similar to that of}} the previous films. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, which is the same rating he gave to The Naked Gun 2½.|$|R
5000|$|To {{locate a}} target, {{plotting}} board operators used two radial arms (called {{the primary and}} auxiliary arms), and [...] "locked-in" [...] the ends of these arms along on the notched azimuth scale that ran around the circumference of the board at the azimuths of the sightings that were telephoned in {{to them by the}} two base end stations. These locked arms and the baseline arm (along the base of the arc) then formed a triangle whose vertices were the two observation stations and the target. This located the target on the board, and its position was then marked by punching a hole in the paper placed over the plotting board. Next, another radial arm, called the gun arm, was swung over the plotted position of the target, and the resulting range and azimuth for firing were <b>read</b> off the <b>gun</b> arm and an azimuth scale on the gun arm center. These data were corrected or adjusted for some other variables, and telephoned to the gun/s.|$|R

The University Concert Series regularly includes popular musicians and dancers from various genres, typically in Jesse Hall. Other musical venues in town include the Missouri Theatre, the University's multipurpose Hearnes Center, The Blue Note, and Rose Music Hall. Shelter Gardens, a park {{on the campus of}} Shelter Insurance headquarters, also hosts outdoor performances during the summer. Buskers are {{a significant part of the}} True/False Film Fest, playing before film screenings and at festival kick-off and closing events. Columbia's flourishing and progressive music scene is thanks in large part to many acts that come out of the university. The indie band White Rabbits was formed while the members were students at the University of Missouri before moving to Brooklyn to record and gain a higher profile. Musical artists from Columbia have been compiled by Painfully Midwestern Records with the ComoMusic Anthology series, and the [...] "Das Kompilation" [...] release. Although the hip genre continues to give Columbia some music recognition, it is their progressive psychedelic-heavy metal music scene that has garnered some attention lately. There are also local punk and hip-hop scenes that are gaining momentum locally. Country music singer-songwriter Brett James is also a native of Columbia. The song [...] "Whiskey Bottle," [...] by Uncle Tupelo, is rumored to be about the city of Columbia as it makes specific reference to a sign which used to be displayed on a Columbia tackle shop sign which <b>read,</b> [...] "Liquor, <b>Guns,</b> and Ammo." [...] The sign is now displayed at the downtown location of Shakespeare's Pizza. Blues-rock trio The Hooten Hallers was formed in Columbia in 2007 and continues to gain national recognition.|$|R
40|$|When we {{open the}} paper in the Netherlands, almost all the news we <b>read</b> {{involving}} <b>guns</b> is negative. Guns are not as freely available in the Netherlands {{as they are in}} some parts of the United States and mass shootings are not common in the Netherlands. The sheer scope of guns in the US aroused our interest. Therefore, we wanted to take a look at the other side of gun ownership, the ‘positive’ side sort to speak. The Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, is after all a right ratified in 1791. The research we have conducted in Flagstaff, Arizona focused on gun owning citizens of Flagstaff, Arizona. We wanted to take a look at the ‘gun culture’ and how gun owners perceive their right to carry a firearm in modern day American society. Knowing that the country itself is divided on the topic, we choose Arizona as it one of the milder states involving gun legislative control in the US. Our main question was: how do gun owning citizens in Flagstaff, Arizona give meaning to freedom and security, what does it mean to them and how should the ‘gun-culture’ be interpreted within this context? 	One of the things that was common for our informants was their strong belief in freedom and individualism as foundational principles of the United States. The gun owners we spoke did not want to ban guns, some did express their desire for more gun legislation, but abolishment of guns was out of the question. Whether our informants were for more gun legislation or less, almost all of them shared their doubts about the American government. This doubt, was one of the reasons, that filled the need for owning a gun, because the Second Amendment was founded on the belief that the law-abiding citizens could step in when the government turns out to be corrupt. Our informants feel more independent and thus ultimately more free thanks to the right to keep and bear arms. Taking that right away or talking about taking that right away by the government, goes against everything that the Second Amendment stands for. From an outsiders perspective the free availability of firearms in combination with excessive gun violence gives cause to more legislation, but our informants did not agree. First of all, our informants think that you should not look at the firearm a crime was committed with, but that it is better to pay attention at the person behind that particular firearm. Even when there would be more gun legislation, the persons that commit crimes are still in society, and if they want to commit a crime they will still do it anyway. Most of them emphasize the idea that a lot of gun tragedies and gun violence occur in places where there are strict gun regulations, or even prohibition of firearms. So according to our informants there is no crux between social liberty and social security. They even argue that, because everybody is allowed to carry a (concealed) firearm in Flagstaff, being able to own and carry this gun, protecting yourself and your fellow citizens, contributes to the (social) security in Flagstaff. It is necessary that you act as a responsible citizen and are able to protect your social environment. There is no friction between social liberty and social security according to our informants. Rather, these two complement each other: when law-abiding citizens have social liberty through the use of firearms (thus: are able to keep and bear arms) they think that it improves (social) security. 	What is the case for all of our informants, is that freedom is a highly valued right. For most of them guns are a physical representation of that right and this right is eventually mediated through these guns. It is a tradition that binds our informants and makes them feel proud to be an American citizen, a fundamental characteristic of their identity. There were differences in standpoints towards the availability of guns and 'gun owning citizens' and can therefore not be seen as a unified front, or homogenous group. Finally we can say that even though our informants are connected through their right to keep and bear arms, they have conflicting opinions towards gun legislation. According to us, these differences will be of pivotal importance in the ongoing debate around guns in the United States of America...|$|R
