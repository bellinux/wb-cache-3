There were calculated correlation coefficients between selected parameters <b>of</b> <b>flotation</b> process course and the values of technological indices, along with determination of significance of these coefficient, at accepted probability level 0. 95.

40|$|This Thesis, {{entitled}} Utilization <b>of</b> <b>Flotation</b> tailings in the Construction Business, {{has been}} formulated and {{developed in the}} Darkov and ČSM Coal Mines. All the findings acquired in the abovementioned mines {{will be used as}} basic information for the future utilization of this fine-grained waste, which is a by-product of black coal processing. While developing and writing this Thesis, I was allowed to observe the processing at both the Darkov and ČSM Coal Mines. The theoretical part of this Thesis is dedicated to the description of processing of black coal, from the moment of extraction to the point of expedition or storage appropriate storage areas. Flotation tailings are composed of fine-grained waste created during <b>flotation</b> processing <b>of</b> black coal. The flotation tailings are deposited (floated) into an assigned depository area - the Pilňok tailings pond. The theoretical part of the Thesis also deals with the consequences of coal extraction, which impact the natural environment, and with reparatory actions undertaken to alleviate such consequences. Finally, a chapter within the theoretical part is also dedicated to the possibilities <b>of</b> utilization <b>of</b> <b>flotation</b> tailings, followed by the legislative framework that governs the processing <b>of</b> <b>flotation</b> tailings and an associated certification process.
