40|$|Starting in {{the second}} half of the 19 th century, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was {{affected}} by a new wave of immigrants. [Cudža Roma] Roma groups from the east moved to Hungary, among them Lovara, horse-traders from the Karpato-Ukraine. Along with the increasing appearance of nomadic Vlach-groups- seen from the point of view of the Hungarian people as a real "invasion "- there were growing complaints about "repeated criminal acts" and the lack of an adequate law to fight this "public nuisance". Another reason for complaint was a regulation by the Hungarian law governing local authorities, obliging all municipalities to offer the Roma accommodation and basic supplies. Due to the intense immigration of that time, this regulation led to increasing problems in the various villages. In 1907, 28 provinces demanded a common file against the Roma. However, parliament was unable to present a political solution that would satisfy both parties. Instead, the problem was transferred to an administrative level. The decisions that were taken, such as a prohibition of begging and forceful deportation to the original place of <b>residence,</b> <b>document</b> the continuous repressive character of anti "gypsy-policies". Due to the lack of financial resources and adequate economic structures, Hungarian politics that until 1918 had aimed at making the Roma settle by force, was bound to fail. Unable t...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Survival {{rates are}} widely {{used to compare the}} quality of cancer care. However, the extent to which cancer {{survivors}} regain full physical or cognitive functioning is not captured by this statistic. To address this concern we introduce post-diagnosis employment as a supplemental measure of the quality of cancer care. Methods This study is based on individual level data from the Norwegian Cancer Registry (n = 46, 720) linked with data on labor market outcomes and socioeconomic status from Statistics Norway. We study variation across Norwegian hospital catchment areas (n = 55) with respect to survival and employment five years after cancer diagnosis. To handle the selection problem, we exploit the fact that cancer patients in Norway (until 2001) have been allocated to local hospitals based on their place of <b>residence.</b> Results We <b>document</b> substantial differences across catchment areas with respect to patients' post-diagnosis employment rates. Conventional quality indicators based on survival rates indicate smaller differences. The two sets of indicators are only moderately correlated. Conclusions This analysis shows that indicators based on survival and post-diagnosis employment may capture different parts of the health status distribution, and that using only one of them to capture quality of care may be insufficient. </p...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} gated {{communities}} (GCs) {{as an example}} of residential separation in today's Prague. The GCs are a new specific phenomenon characterising the society in present post-industrial cities. It is a type of residence where high social status population concentrates behind walls and fences. The number of GCs grows more or less globally which results in increased experts' interest in GCs. This type of residence occurs also in Czechia, primarily in Prague. Experts' interest in the subject in our environment is, however, not as high as in other post-communist countries. This thesis follows up with previous studies and assesses in detail if - in context of the post-industrial transformation - the high social status population is separated in Prague GCs and why such type of <b>residence</b> appears. The <b>document</b> also partly focuses on the development and situation of residential separation and the consequences of GCs formation. It is based on several quantitative (data analysis, questionnaire survey) and qualitative (interviews) research methods.
