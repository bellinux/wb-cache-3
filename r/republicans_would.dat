5|$|May 4, 2017, the United States House of Representatives {{voted to}} pass the American Health Care Act (and thereby repeal most of the Affordable Care Act) by a narrow margin of 217 to 213, sending the bill to the Senate for deliberation. The Senate Republican {{leadership}} announced that Senate <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> write {{their own version of}} the bill, instead of voting on the House version.|$|E
5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell later tried to sway Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011-2015 term, the State Senate {{was made}} up of 35 Democrats and 12 Republicans. Republicans gained two seats (District 6 in Baltimore County and District 29 in Calvert and St. Mary's counties) in the {{elections}} held on November 4, 2014. Democrats maintain a super-majority in the chamber despite these changes. Article II, Section 17(a) of the Maryland Constitution specifies it takes a three-fifths vote of both chambers to override a veto, which is 29 votes in the State Senate. The rules of the Senate also permit members to limit debate by a three-fifths majority vote, meaning <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> need to gain five additional seats, for a total of 19, in order to sustain a veto or filibuster legislation.|$|E
50|$|Resultant {{opposition}} to the Democrats allowed Warren Harding {{to win the election}} in Arizona with 55.91 percent of the vote to James Cox’ 43.72 percent. This was the first Republican presidential victory in Arizona as a whole, and in all but three of the state’s fourteen contemporary counties: Pima County, which Charles Evans Hughes had won in 1916, Graham County, where no <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> win until Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, and Greenlee County, which no <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> carry until George W. Bush in 2000.|$|R
50|$|No <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> carry Massachusetts in {{a presidential}} {{election}} again until 1980. Since this election, no Republican has ever carried the counties of Bristol, Hampshire and Middlesex.|$|R

5|$|With Goebel dead, {{tensions}} {{began to}} ease. The idea of Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, as governor was more palatable {{to much of}} the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> also remove the militia from Frankfort. Democrats would, in turn, extend immunity to any Republican official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass a nonpartisan election reform bill. The agreement needed only Taylor's signature to become effective. Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1991 H. John Heinz III, {{one of the}} US Senators from Pennsylvania, {{was killed}} when his {{chartered}} plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear. Under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the legislature of each state {{has the power to}} permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a special election can be held. In Pennsylvania, this power had been delegated, and Governor Robert P. Casey signed a writ on May 13, 1991, declaring November 5 the date for a special election and temporarily appointing Harris Wofford to fill Heinz's now-vacant seat. Under Pennsylvanian law, {{there was no need for}} a primary in such a situation; instead, both the Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> each internally select their candidate, who would run in the special election. John S. Trinsey Jr., a member of the Pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate, challenged the constitutionality of this law, claiming that it violated his rights under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
50|$|Nelson's {{popularity}} fell among Nebraskans in {{the wake}} of his cloture vote. A December 2009 Rasmussen poll indicated that in a hypothetical Nelson-Heineman race, the <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> get 61% of the vote to Nelson's 30%. In the same poll, 64% of the Nebraska voters surveyed were opposed to the health-care bill.|$|R
50|$|Silas Woodson (May 18, 1819October 9, 1896) was the 21st Governor of Missouri, United States, between January 3, 1873 and January 12, 1875. He was {{notable for}} being the first Democrat elected to that {{position}} since the Civil War. No <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> reach the office for over 30 years after Woodson's election.|$|R
5000|$|On November 2, 2010, in a Republican {{sweep of}} statewide offices, Ivey {{defeated}} Democratic incumbent Lieutenant Governor Jim Folsom, Jr., who was seeking an unprecedented fourth term. Ivey won re-election as Lieutenant Governor in November 2014. This would mark {{the first time}} a <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> be re-elected Lieutenant Governor in the state's history ...|$|R
5|$|Trinsey v. Pennsylvania 941 F.2d 224 (1991) {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that {{confirmed}} the validity of special elections held without a primary under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The case came about due {{to the death of}} H. John Heinz III, one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania, in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, state legislatures may give the Governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held, and Pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election. Instead, both the Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> each internally select their candidates. John S. Trinsey Jr., a voter and potential candidate, asked the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the Fourteenth and Seventeenth amendments, because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties.|$|E
25|$|When Sabin's fellow <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> {{not support}} her efforts, {{she went to}} the Democrats, who {{switched}} their support of the dry cause to endorse repeal under the leadership of liberal politicians such as Fiorello La Guardia and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sabin and her supporters emphasized that repeal would generate enormous sums of much-needed tax revenue, and weaken the base of organized crime.|$|E
25|$|After the {{two terms}} of Democrat Grover Cleveland, the {{election}} of William McKinley in 1896 is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican dominance and is sometimes cited as a realigning election. McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the Panic of 1893, and that <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit.|$|E
6000|$|... "It strikes me, Vice-governatore, that {{it would}} be a sin next to heresy to doubt the {{character}} of those who so loyally put their trust in us. No <b>republican</b> <b>would</b> dare to anchor in the bay of Porto Ferrajo a second time. Once it might possibly be done; but twice?--no, never, never." ...|$|R
50|$|A Democratic trend, {{typical of}} Yankee Northern Illinois, saw Michael Dukakis carry LaSalle despite failing {{to win the}} {{election}} in 1988, and no <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> carry the county again until George Bush junior in 2004. The past few elections have seen the county lean Republican due to concern over lack of employment opportunities in the “Rust Belt”.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{assumptions}} {{were that}} this election's outcome was a foregone conclusion: The <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> win overwhelmingly again. However, Democrat nominee Thompson, aided with numerous energetic supporters (particularly former local campaigners for Bernie Sanders, {{who had taken}} the 2016 Kansas Democratic Presidential Caucus by 75%), began {{to show signs of}} the first serious Fourth District challenge to Republicans since Glickman's loss a quarter-century earlier.|$|R
25|$|Many {{opinion leaders}} {{predicted}} that Barr could siphon off conservative votes {{that would have}} otherwise gone to McCain. John Linder, who defeated Barr for the Republican nomination in a 2002 congressional race, said that Barr could cause serious problems for McCain in some states. Barr repeatedly rejected this assertion as scapegoating, responding that small-government <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> not vote for McCain anyway, nor would civil liberties advocates vote for Obama.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the executions in the Civil War, many <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> never accept the Free State as a {{legitimate}} Irish government, but rather saw it as a repressive, British-imposed government. This attitude was partially alleviated after 1932, when Fianna Fáil, the party that represented the bulk of the Republican constituency, entered government peacefully; it introduced a new Constitution in 1937. The Free State officially became the Republic of Ireland in 1949.|$|E
25|$|November 10, 2009: The New York State Senate {{begins a}} special session {{regarding}} {{the economy of the}} state, and take a vote on same-sex marriage. Later that day, the vote was postponed {{until the end of the}} year. Thirty-two Democrats formed the majority in the Senate, but several Democrats refrained from commenting or opposed the bill, meaning several <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> be required for the 32-member support the bill would need if it was to pass into law.|$|E
5000|$|In {{both the}} 2013 Virginia Gubernatorial Election and the 2014 Virginia US Senate Election, Libertarian Robert Sarvis {{received}} {{a number of}} votes greater than {{the difference between the}} Republican and Democratic candidates. Given the similarity in Republican and Libertarian views, {{it is likely that the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> have won each election if not for the inclusion of Sarvis on the ballot.|$|R
5000|$|Republican {{policies}} in the early period of statehood were advanced by the party-connected Seattle Post-Intelligencer and, later, by the Seattle Republican. Founded by ex-slave Horace Cayton, the Seattle <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> grow to become the second-largest newspaper in Seattle before it folded in 1917.

25|$|There {{has existed}} in the Kingdom of Spain a {{persistent}} trend of republican thought, especially throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, that has manifested itself in diverse political parties and movements over the entire course {{of the history of}} Spain. While these movements have shared the objective of establishing a republic in Spain, during these three centuries there have surged distinct schools of thought on the form <b>republicans</b> <b>would</b> want to give to the Spanish State: unitary (centralized) or federal.|$|E
25|$|His {{silence was}} broken in July 1910, when he {{published}} {{an editorial in}} the Franco supported O Correio da Manhã and signed HPC, wherein he appealed for a counter-revolution to save the monarchy. He then was involved in several inconsequential conspiracies, in order to implant a monarchist regime in Parliament, defending most of the ideas anti-democratic <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> adopt. His appeals were not given any debate. Rapidly, the regime fell on October 5, and the First Portuguese Republic was proclaimed.|$|E
25|$|Moses {{had thought}} he had {{convinced}} Nelson Rockefeller {{of the need for}} one last great bridge project, a span crossing Long Island Sound from Rye to Oyster Bay. Rockefeller did not press for the project in the late 1960s through 1970, fearing public backlash among suburban <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> hinder his re-election prospects. Ironically, a 1972 study found the bridge was fiscally prudent and could be environmentally manageable, but the anti-development sentiment was now insurmountable and in 1973 Rockefeller canceled plans for the bridge.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017, this is {{the last}} time Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Hawaii, New York, Oregon, and Washington voted for the Republican candidate. This {{election}} was also the second time that a <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> earn at least 500 electoral votes (with the first occurring during Richard Nixon's landslide victory in 1972), and the most recent time that a candidate from either party would break that amount.|$|R

Feingold attacked back by saying that any <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> be a rubber stamp for President Bush. The incumbent had $2.2 million in the bank, while Michels had already spent $1 million in the primary and had only about $150,000 left.|$|R

25|$|Within a {{month of}} Despot's death, Democratic Governor Charles E. Roemer, III {{switched}} his allegiance to the Republican Party. Roemer's switch did not unite the feuding wings of the GOP. Because he supported abortion, the right-to-life contingent of the party rejected Roemer and coalesced around then U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway of Rapides Parish. But few other <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> support Holloway. Holloway did win a preference poll among Republicans attending statewide endorsement caucuses. Also running for governor was the candidate who was anathema to party leaders: State Representative David Duke of Jefferson Parish. When all the smoke had cleared, Duke eliminated Roemer from a general election berth, and Edwin Edwards staged a fourth-term victory over the unpopular Duke.|$|E
500|$|In federal court, Bradley argued {{on behalf}} of the Republican minor {{officers}} that the Goebel Election Law deprived citizens of their right to vote. The right to vote, he claimed, was inherent in the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of [...] "liberty", and could not be taken from any citizen without due process. Federal judge William Howard Taft ruled that the <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> have to seek remedy in the state courts. After a protracted legal battle, all of the minor officers were unseated except Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt.|$|E
500|$|After Congress adjourned in July, the {{campaigning for}} the fall {{elections}} began. [...] Johnson embarked on a trip by rail, dubbed the [...] "Swing Around the Circle", that won him few supporters; his arguments with hecklers were deemed undignified. [...] He attacked Stevens and other radicals during this tour. Stevens campaigned for firm measures against the South, his hand strengthened by violence in Memphis and New Orleans, where African-Americans and white Unionists had been attacked by mobs, including the police. Stevens was returned to Congress by his constituents; <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> have a two-thirds majority in both houses in the next Congress.|$|E
50|$|Rutherford Hayes became President after {{a highly}} {{controversial}} electoral count, demonstrating that {{the corruption of}} Southern politics threatened {{the legitimacy of the}} presidency itself. After Hayes removed the last federal troops in 1877, the Republican Party in the South sank into oblivion, kept alive only by the crumbs of federal patronage. It would be forty years before a <b>Republican</b> <b>would</b> win a former Confederate state in a presidential election.|$|R
5|$|Clinton said <b>Republican</b> {{amendments}} <b>would</b> {{strip the}} U.S. Treasury {{of its ability}} to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. <b>Republican</b> amendments <b>would</b> have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget.

5000|$|In {{this time}} period, in the 54th United States Congress, two brothers, Truman H. Aldrich (1896-1897) and William F. Aldrich (1896-1897), both served as Republicans. William Aldrich also {{served in the}} 55th Congress (1898-99) and the 56th Congress (1900-01) with the unusual {{distinction}} of having been seated all three times in disputed elections ultimately decided by Congress itself.
