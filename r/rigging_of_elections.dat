50|$|Previously {{election}} results had broadly reflected {{the opinion of}} at least the minority of adult males who had the vote, although the system had always been subject {{to the influence of}} corruption and patronage. However, now that one-party government had been established, those influences could be used systematically to ensure the governing party's victory.

However, Al-Aswany was banned from attending the premiere. The Yacoubian Building {{is one of a}} few movies that addresses social taboos and widespread governmental corruption, such as the <b>rigging</b> <b>of</b> <b>elections.</b> In fact, many intellectuals believe that this work {{played a crucial role in}} triggering revolutionary sentiments among the Egyptian people.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of the AU’s conflict management in Kenya. Even though it has attempted to mediate, its impact on the crisis was not profound, as it has paid less attention to the questions of crisis management and dialog. The paper argues that the AU appears reluctant to intervene in the crisis. It recommends that the AU would be a more effective conflict manager if it were institutionalized, if it had members with homogenous preferences, and if it had more democratic members. Institutionalized and homogenous organizations are better suited for effective conflict management, while democratic organizations support lasting settlements in favor of the issue’s status quo. It concludes that the AU’s reluctance to intervene in Kenya is partly due to mistrust between its member states as most of the African leaders came to power through the <b>rigging</b> <b>of</b> <b>elections...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ideals of {{political}} participation and the values and virtues {{it is supposed to}} propagate in a democratic setting as we approach the threshold of a new political dispensation. It takes a historical review of the electioneering process in Nigeria and how this has been riddled with thuggery, <b>rigging</b> <b>of</b> <b>elections,</b> god fatherism, political praise singing, constitutional manipulations and amendments to favour the party in power. Cases of assassinations, arson and murder have occurred as a way of destabilizing the opposition. Corruption has become {{the order of the day}} while the need for capacity building has been completely neglected. The culture of poverty has eaten deep into the fabric of the Nigerian society and so people sell their votes to the detriment of the political process. It concludes with the assertion that only an independent electoral commission free from governmental interference is desirable for the co 1 mtry. Also is the need for us to change our values towards selflessness, sincerity and integrity so as to enhance the gains of our nascent democracy...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{implications}} of democracy promotion on ensuring {{free and fair elections}} in hybrid regimes. Despite the recent wave of democratization, some countries have plunged back into authoritarianism. These regimes combine both democratic and authoritarian principles. Resultantly, they are referred to as hybrid regimes. The most common democratic feature that these hybrid regimes adapt are multiparty elections. However, elections in hybrid regimes are characterized by <b>rigging</b> <b>of</b> <b>elections</b> and serious human rights violations. Consequently, the international community has renewed its democracy promotion efforts. Similarly, the European Union (EU) has strengthened its democracy promotion in hybrid regimes with a focus on elections. This thesis seeks to answer the research question: What are the implications of the European Union’s democracy promotion on elections in Zimbabwe and Cambodia? The research question shall be answered through a comparative case study on the implications of the EU's democracy promotion on elections held in Zimbabwe and Cambodia from 2000 to 2013. Both case studies shall examine how internal factors (local factors within the countries) and external factors (weaknesses inherent in the EU's democracy promotion) influence the EU's efforts to ensure free and fair elections in hybrid regimes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Since {{the time}} of the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910 (views on when it {{finished}} vary between 1917 and 1940) Mexico had been ruled by the same, single political party, the PRI (the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, meaning the ‘Institutional Revolutionary Party’), until it finally lost a presidential election in 2000 to the right-wing Party of National Action, after seventy-one years in power. The PRI had stayed in power through a mixture of ‘clientelism’, ‘populism’, ‘corruption ’ and the <b>rigging</b> <b>of</b> <b>elections</b> and held a tight control on the whole of Mexican society. In its efforts to bring about social change, from the 1990 s onwards Mexican society began to concentrate its efforts on challenging the dominance held by the PRI at the national, federal level. A debate on the ‘transition to democracy ’ took off in both academic circles and social and civil organizations looking for ways to create a new and different kind of relationship between government and society. It was in that context that, as with many other civil organizations in Mexico, we in IMDEC 1 considered how we might best open up more spaces for the culture and practice of democracy and motivate citizens to actively campaign on those issues impacting on their daily lives. The issue, however, was how to engage this participation differently, in a more festive atmosphere, breaking with formal traditions, {{in such a way that}} people would feel better motivated to become involved in actively addressing the problems that surrounded them. In this article, I want to share an experience, which took place between April and August 1994, before the local elections of that year, based on a Campaign for Education i...|$|E
