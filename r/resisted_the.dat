5|$|By 1336, the Sultan had {{conquered the}} Pandyas of Madurai, the Kakatiyas of Warangal {{and the tiny}} kingdom of Kampili. The Hoysalas were the only {{remaining}} Hindu empire who <b>resisted</b> <b>the</b> invading armies. Veera Ballala III stationed himself at Tiruvannamalai and offered stiff resistance to invasions {{from the north and}} the Madurai Sultanate to the south. Then, after nearly three decades of resistance, Veera Ballala III was killed at the battle of Madurai in 1343, and the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire were merged with the areas administered by Harihara I in the Tungabhadra River region. This new Hindu kingdom <b>resisted</b> <b>the</b> northern invasions and would later prosper and {{come to be known as}} the Vijayanagara Empire.|$|E

5|$|Although Bellone would {{normally}} be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful {{was close enough to}} open fire.

The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of efficiency in British gunnery.|$|E
