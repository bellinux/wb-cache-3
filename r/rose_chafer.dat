50|$|Cetonia aurata, {{called the}} <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> or the green <b>rose</b> <b>chafer,</b> is a beetle, 20 mm (¾ in) long, {{that has a}} {{metallic}} structurally coloured green and a distinct V-shaped scutellum. The scutellum is the small V-shaped area between the wing cases; it may show several small, irregular, white lines and marks. The underside of the beetle has a coppery colour, and its upper side is sometimes bronze, copper, violet, blue/black, or grey.|$|E
50|$|The adult beetle {{feeds on}} the foliage, flowers, and fruit of many plants {{including}} grapes, apples, peaches, roses, and other garden flowers and fruits. On roses it skeletonizes the leaves, {{which can be}} rather bothersome for avid gardeners. <b>Rose</b> <b>chafers</b> are also a problem for vineyards as they eat the grapes at bloom as well as skeletonize the leaves. They also tend to appear suddenly and in swarms, and vines with over 100 <b>rose</b> <b>chafers</b> per plant have been observed. This huge amount of damage can result in almost total loss of photosynthetically active leaf area as well as reducing or prohibiting pollination. The larvae also cause damage as they feed on {{the roots of the}} plants, which can limit growth.|$|R

60|$|In {{other cases}} the {{capacity}} of increase in a species {{is so great that}} however many of the perfect insect may be destroyed, there is always ample means for the continuance of the race. Many of the flesh flies, gnats, ants, palm-tree weevils and locusts are in this category. The whole family of Cetoniadæ or <b>rose</b> <b>chafers,</b> so full of gaily-coloured species, are probably saved from attack by a combination of characters. They fly very rapidly with a zigzag or waving course; they hide themselves the moment they alight, either in the corolla of flowers, or in rotten wood, or in cracks and hollows of trees, and they are generally encased in a very hard and polished coat of mail which may render them unsatisfactory food to such birds as would be able to capture them. The causes which lead to the development of colour have been here able to act unchecked, and we see the result in a large variety of the most gorgeously-coloured insects.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} century, the {{industrialization}} of agriculture {{has led to}} changes in the landscape and many important habitats have disappeared. Habitat loss and fragmentation and an increased use of agrichemicals have led to biodiversity declines in the agricultural landscape. The negative impacts on pollinators, in particular, must be taken serious because they provide an important ecosystem service when they pollinate crops. Monitoring of pollinators is therefore important to examine the factors that affect pollination. The pan trap method is commonly used in the monitoring of pollinating insects, but few studies have evaluated the effect of trap color on the collection of different groups of pollinators. Pollinators were collected using the pan trap method with blue, yellow and white bowls to examine if there were difference in the attraction to traps of different colors among different groups of pollinators. Lepturine beetles (Lepturinae spp.), bee beetles (Trichius spp.) and the bumblebees (Bombus spp.) preferred the blue traps while <b>rose</b> <b>chafers</b> (Cetoniidae spp.) and hoverflies (Syrphidae spp.) preferred the yellow traps. Hence pan traps of different colors may be specific for different groups of pollinators...|$|R

5000|$|Macrodactylus subspinosus is a North American beetle of {{the family}} Scarabaeidae. It is one {{of at least two}} beetles in this family known as the [...] "rose chafer", the other being the European Cetonia aurata. M. subspinosus occurs from Eastern Canada to Colorado [...] and is {{considered}} a pest of many crops and flowers. It is given its common name of <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> because it eats the leaves of roses, although it also feeds on many other plants.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> has a yellowish-tan {{coloured}} {{body that}} is about 8 - 13 mm in length, with wings that do not completely cover the abdomen. The beetle has six long, spiny, reddish-brown legs that gradually become darker {{towards the end of}} the appendage. It has two short lamellate antennae that end in a club of flat plates and it has chewing mouthparts. Rose chafers are covered in dull yellow hairs which give the body its characteristic colour, however with age and with normal activity the hairs are worn off the head and thorax revealing a black colour. It is thus possible to distinguish between older and younger beetles, as older beetles will have fewer hairs and thus be darker in colour. Females tend to lose more hairs, especially on the thorax due to the mating process, and can also appear darker in colour. Females also tend to be more robust than the male. The eggs of the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> are about 1 mm in length and are oval, white and shiny. The larvae are white C-shaped grubs that when mature develop a brown head capsule and three distinct pairs of legs. The pupae are yellowish-brown in colour and are about 15 mm in length.|$|E
50|$|After adult rose chafers {{emerge in}} late May to mid-June, they {{aggregate}} on leaves, buds, flowers, and fruit, {{in order to}} feed and mate. By chewing on plant tissues, the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> induces the release of volatile compounds from the plant. Using their antennae, rose chafers can detect the plant compounds {{in the air and}} orient themselves {{in the direction of the}} feeding conspecific, leading to an aggregation of the beetles. Male rose chafers also orient themselves preferentially toward virgin females as opposed to mated females, though it is unknown whether they are detecting pheromones released by virgin females, or the release of plant volatiles induced by the feeding virgin females.|$|E
50|$|As {{a member}} of the order Coleoptera, the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> {{undergoes}} complete metamorphosis during its development. In late May, white-bodied larvae, about 18 mm long, pupate after having overwintered deep in the soil. Once they have emerged from their pupal case, adults live for 3-6 weeks, during which time they will feed on plant material and mate. Their eggs are laid in sandy soils, 15 cm deep, and hatch in 1-3 weeks. This new generation of larvae will feed on the roots of grasses, weeds, and some ornamental garden plants {{during the rest of the}} summer, before they burrow deep in the soil to overwinter; these larvae will emerge as adults in the following year.|$|E

40|$|Intestinal {{microorganisms}} play {{an important}} role in plant fiber degradation by larvae of the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> Pachnoda marginata. In the hindgut of the larvae 2. 5 to 7. 4 × 108 bacteria per ml of gut content with xylanase or endoglucanase activity were found. Bacteria in the midgut were not (hemi) cellulolytic, but the alkaline environment in this part of the intestinal tract functions as a precellulolytic phase, solubilizing part of the lignocellulosic material. Accordingly, the degradation of lignocellulose-rich material in Pachnoda marginata larvae appeared to be a combination of a physico-chemical and microbiological process. A number of different facultative anaerobic and strictly anaerobic bacteria with (hemi) cellulolytic activity were isolated from the hindgut. A dominant (hemi) cellulolytic species was a Gram positive, irregular shaped, facultative aerobic bacterium. Further physiological identification placed the isolate in the genus Promicromonospora. Comparative 16 S rDNA analysis and phenotypic features revealed that the isolate represented a new species for which the name Promicromonospora pachnodae is proposed. P. pachnodae produced xylanases and endoglucanases on several plant derived polymers, both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} are {{the most}} important insect parasites, therefore they are used in the production of biopreparations. Application of nematode based biopreparations in biological methods of pest control has many positive and negative features, some of them, however, raise some doubts. Particularly doubtful features are the selectivity in colonising and killing potential hosts by nematodes. Apart from pests, the ecosystems to which entomophilous nematodes have been introduced are inhabited by benefi cial insects and those that are legally protected. One of such species is the hermit beetle (Osmoderma eremita), very endangered and strictly protected species according to the Bern Convention, listed in the second and fourth appendix to the Habitat Directive and mentioned in many European Red Books e. g. in Red List of Nearly Extinct and Endangered Animals in Poland and in Polish Red Book of Animals. The marbled <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> Protaetia lugubris, in spite of its rarity it is not the protected species.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of multilayers, photonic crystals, metamaterials and other artificial materials has promoted {{the use of}} spectroscopic, variable angle, generalized and Mueller-matrix ellipsometry. Naturally occurring structures may show even higher complexity than artificial structures but with a more narrow range of constituent materials. Fascinating reflection properties result from intricate photonic structures in, for instance, the wing scales and cuticles of insects. Currently {{there is a large}} interest to explore such functional supramolecular architectures for exploitation in nanotechnology. In this study, Mueller-matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry is applied in the spectral range of 250 to 1000 nm to investigate optical response and structures of the cuticle of Scarab beetles of the Cetoniinae subfamily. The cuticle of Cetonia aurata (the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer,</b> la cétoine dorée) is green with a metallic appearance and reflects left-handed circular/elliptically polarized light. It has been suggested that the polarization of this metallic gloss is caused by a helical structure in the chitinous cuticle. We find that the polarization effect is limited to the narrow spectral range 470 - 550 nm whereas for shorter or longer wavelengths the reflection properties are similar to those from a near-dielectric material. Model calculations and parameterization of the nanostructure employing a heliocoidal structure are discussed. As a comparison the polarization effects from light reflected from two other beetles will be presented. Coptomia laevis has a similar appearance as Cetonia aurata but has very different polarization properties. The golden Plusiotis argentiola has very interesting properties showing both left and right-handed polarization depending on incidence angle and wavelength...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bioassays were {{conducted}} to compare the residual toxicity and leaf protection activity of conventional broad-spectrum and reduced-risk insecticides against the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer,</b> Macrodactylus subspinosus. Insecticides were applied to a Vitis labrusca (F.) vineyard and residues were aged for 1, 3 or 7 days before leaves were collected and exposed to beetles in no-choice tests. Azinphosmethyl caused rapid knockdown and mortality for up to 1 week after application, with 1 -day-old residues providing 95. 6 % protection against feeding, dropping to 51. 6 % when residues were a week old. Fenpropathrin caused mortality and knockdown after beetles {{had been exposed to}} fresh residues for 72 h. Although these effects diminished as residues aged, this compound provided the best protection of leaves against beetle feeding, with 77. 9 % reduction in feeding compared with the control after 7 days of aging in the vineyard. Of the reduced-risk insecticides, imidacloprid caused the greatest initial mortality and knockdown of beetles, providing protection against feeding that was equivalent to azinphosmethyl. Exposure to azadirachtin caused a low level of knockdown and mortality when residues were 1 - and 3 -days old. Protection against feeding was also low, lasting for only 3 days. Beetles were minimally affected by capsaicin and kaolin, with mortality and knockdown seen only when beetles were exposed to 1 -day-old residues for 72 h. Foliage protection from these compounds was minimal, with between 10 and 15 % reduction in feeding injury. Results are discussed in relation to development of semi-field bioassay methods for evaluating reduced-risk insecticides, and the management ofM. subspinosus within grape pest management programs...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 A {{gene cluster}} {{responsible}} for the biosynthesis of the antitumor agent cetoniacytone A was identified in Actinomyces sp. strain Lu 9419, an endosymbiotic bacteria isolated from the intestines of the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> beetle. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the 26 Kb DNA region revealed the presence of 17 complete ORFs, including genes predicted to encode a 2 -epi- 5 -epi-valiolone synthase (CetA), a glyoxalase (CetB), an FAD/FMN-dependent dehydrogenase (CetF), an oxidoreductase (CetG), two aminotransferases (CetH, CetM), and a pyranose oxidase (CetL). BLAST search analysis using the newly isolated cet biosynthetic pathway revealed a homologous biosynthetic pathway in the genome of Frankia alni ACN 14 a, suggesting that this organism is capable of producing a metabolite related to the cetoniacytones. The 2 -epi- 5 -epi-valiolone synthase (CetA) was cloned and expressed in E. coli and biochemical characterization of the gene product revealed that CetA is capable of catalyzing the cyclization of sedoheptulose 7 -phosphate to 2 -epi- 5 -epivaliolone. In addition, three other 2 -epi- 5 -epi-valiolone synthase genes, from different natural product biosynthetic pathways have also been recombinantly expressed and biochemically characterized. These include BE-orf 9 from the BE- 40644 biosynthetic gene cluster, prlA from the pyralomicin biosynthetic gene cluster, and salQ from the salbostatin biosynthetic gene cluster. Comparative analysis of the gene products with other related cyclases {{that are involved in}} natural product biosynthesis revealed that the 2 -epi- 5 -epi-valiolone synthases uniquely represent a class of sugar phosphate cyclases (SPCs) that has a catalytic mechanism similar to that of dehydroquinate synthase in the shikimate pathway. Enzymes that belong to the SPC superfamily catalyze the cyclization of sugar phosphates to produce a variety of cyclitol intermediates that serve as the building blocks of many primary and secondary metabolites. Further phylogenetic analysis of SPC sequences revealed a new clade of SPCs, consisting a group of proteins with unknown function, that may regulate the biosynthesis of a novel set of secondary metabolites. The product of cetB, which has high identity to glyoxalases (members of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily), has also been characterized. Members of the VOC superfamily catalyze a large range of divalent metal ion-dependent reactions. Enzymatic characterization of CetB revealed that this enzyme was able to catalyze the second metabolic step in cetoniacytone biosynthesis, mediating the epimerization of 2 -epi- 5 -epi-valiolone to 5 -epi-valiolone. Therefore, CetB may be designated as a new member of the VOC superfamily. Site directed nutagenesis and metal binding analysis showed that CetB is a Ni²⁺-dependent protein with four metal binding sites. Similar to other members of the VOC superfamily, CetB contains the common structural βαβββ scaffold, as predicted through Phyre program. Native protein gel and size exclusion analyses have shown that CetB exists as a two-module protein dimer. The results provide important insight into the mode of formation of this unique aminocyclitol natural product, and will contribute to future studies that aim to create new aminocyclitol analogs...|$|E
