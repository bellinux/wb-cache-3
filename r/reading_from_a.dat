5|$|The Doctor, Amy, and Rory enjoy {{a picnic}} in New York's Central Park in 2012, with the Doctor <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pulp {{novel about a}} 1930s detective named Melody Malone. Despite Amy's insistence, the Doctor refuses to read ahead to reveal {{spoilers}} and tears out the last page of the book. Meanwhile, Rory goes to get coffee and is {{sent back to the}} 1930s by a cherub Weeping Angel. There, he meets River Song, who is playing the part of Melody Malone. In the present, the Doctor and Amy are shocked to find Rory written into the book. Amy insists on reading ahead, but the Doctor warns her that anything she reads will be destined to happen. Instead, they attempt to take the TARDIS back to the 1930s, finding the time machine struggling to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival Logbook is the series's second guidebook. It {{was first}} {{discovered}} on Amazon on mid 2017. Although {{it has never}} been confirmed by Cawthon himself, several suggestions have stated that the guidebook will explore simple activities for children as they play the video games, or to familiarize new players to the game play of Five Nights at Freddy's. This new title is surmised to have crossword puzzles and word searches, instead of hidden lore or narrative hints about the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Unlike most of the previous book releases, the Survival Logbook has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it will have pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> device. The book is scheduled for release on December 26, 2017.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{there were}} film {{companies}} {{that could not}} afford to make sound films, and would make films with the intention that they would be dubbed at screenings by live performers <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> script.

25|$|UFO-Sweden have {{conducted}} an extensive {{investigation into the}} latest Ghost Rocket sighting at a lake in the far north of Sweden both in 2012 and 2014. During their search they have located a crater using a side scanning sonar and ground penetrating radar as well as unusual <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> magnetometer. UFO-Sweden are currently planning a third trip {{during the winter months}} while the lake is still frozen, this time in an attempt to verify or dispel previous readings.|$|E
25|$|Prefix code: The first byte {{indicates}} {{the number of}} bytes in the sequence. <b>Reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> stream can instantaneously decode each individual fully received sequence, without first having to wait for either the first byte of a next sequence or an end-of-stream indication. The length of multi-byte sequences is easily determined by humans as it is simply the number of high-order 1s in the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream ends mid-sequence.|$|E

25|$|The {{show has}} no on-camera host. A narrator {{provides}} commentary connecting the storylines {{as the show}} shifts from one boat to another. Discovery Channel voice artist Mike Rowe narrates the action for North American airings; UK voice artist Bill Petrie, <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> slightly altered script, offers a regionally familiar accent for a British audience. The show transitions between boats using a mock-up radar screen that shows {{the positions of the}} boats relative to one another and to the two ends of the fishing grounds, St. Paul Island to the north and Dutch Harbor to the south.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{broadcasts}} include {{popular music}} programmes presented by John Peel and classical music programmes presented by Edward Greenfield. There {{have also been}} religious programmes, of mostly Anglican celebration and often from the Church of St. Martin in the Fields, weekly drama, English-language lessons, and comedy including Just A Minute. Other notable previous programmes include Letter from America by Alistair Cooke, which was broadcast for over fifty years; Off the Shelf with its daily <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> novel, biography or history book; A Jolly Good Show, a music request programme presented by Dave Lee Travis; Waveguide, a radio reception guide; and The Merchant Navy Programme, a show for seafarers presented by Malcolm Billings.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{engagement}} Graham commissioned William Hogarth to paint as a conversation picture a cabin portrait {{to celebrate his}} victory, probably using the cabin of the Nottingham as a setting. Hogarth painted Graham smoking his pipe in his cabin before dinner, while listening to pipe and tabor music played by his black servant, while his chaplain and clerk sing. Two dogs are visible, one is Graham's own, which joins in the singing. The other is Trump, Hogarth's dog, which is shown wearing Graham's wig, holding a scroll, and <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> sheet of music propped against a wine glass. A steward, holding a plate of fowl, looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, and drops gravy {{down the back of}} the chaplain's neck. The painting has several political and social allusions in Hogarth's satirical style. Cabin scenes in oil are rare, and Hogarth's is considered by the current owner, the National Maritime Museum, to be the most famous in British art.|$|E

500|$|Aided by Gilmer's findings, Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A {{press conference}} with Stan at the lectern {{featured}} an unexpected appearance from Brian. While <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> piece of paper, Brian {{was given a}} microphone and said: [...] "I {{have heard of the}} charges made by Stan Love, and I think they are outrageous, which means they are out of the ballpark... I feel great." [...] Audree, Carl, Carnie, and Wendy Wilson then contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991. The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.|$|E
