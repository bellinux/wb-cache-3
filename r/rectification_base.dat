The only sensor of the robot is a digital camera oriented to {{the ceiling of the}} map, which is used to approximate the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for on-line nonlinear filtering based on wavelet thresholding. Online multiscale (OLMS) rectification applies wavelet thresholding to {{data in a}} moving window of dyadic length to remove random errors. Gross errors are removed by combining wavelet thresholding with multiscale median filtering. Theoretical analysis shows that OLMS rectification using Haar wavelets subsumes mean filters of dyadic length, while rectification with smoother boundary corrected wavelets is analogous to adaptive exponential smoothing. If the rectified measurements are not needed on-line, the quality of rectification can be further improved by averaging the rectified signals in each window. The resulting approach overcomes the boundary effects encountered in translation invariant (TI) rectification of Coifman and Donoho (1995), and is called boundary corrected translation invariant (BCTI) <b>rectification.</b> Examples <b>based</b> on synthetic and industrial data demonstrate {{the benefits of the}} on-line multiscale and boundary corrected translation invariant rectification methods. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Correspondence to {{this article should be addressed}} to Bhavik R.
