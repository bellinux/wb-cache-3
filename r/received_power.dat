30|$|As our {{measurement}} setup {{does not allow}} us evaluating the data throughput, {{we have to use}} a different requirement for the upper limit of DR than 3 GPP uses for its in-channel selectivity definition. We decide to consider the signal of UE 0 to be drowned out by the signal of UE 1 if the BER of UE 0 is ≥ 10 − 1 since we assume such BER’s as a significant performance reduction. We would {{like to point out that}} the prior work ([3] and [2]) does not provide a strict measure and/or value to be used for defining the DR threshold. Furthermore, we can observe that the choice of the BER threshold has only a small impact on the resulting DR threshold, as the BER increases rapidly for small <b>receive</b> <b>power</b> densities of UE 0 (see Fig. 4). For example, considering the results for 30 PRBs bandwidth of UE 1, the resulting DR thresholds for critical BERs of 0.05 and 0.2 would be 31.1 and 31.5 dB, respectively. We will see shortly, that this deviation is small compared to the estimated error of the measurement. We compute the DR threshold as follows. For each series of measurement, we obtain the <b>receive</b> <b>power</b> density of UE 0 where its BER equals 10 − 1 and compute the corresponding total <b>receive</b> <b>power</b> of UE 0. Then, we obtain the DR threshold by computing the difference between the aforementioned total <b>receive</b> <b>power</b> of UE 0 and the total <b>receive</b> <b>power</b> of UE 1. Please note that the total <b>receive</b> <b>power</b> of UE 1 is different for every series of measurement due to the different bandwidth of UE 1. Furthermore, we would like to point out that we consider the DR to be the <b>receive</b> <b>power</b> difference between UE 0 and UE 1, i.e., we use the difference between the maximal and minimal <b>receive</b> <b>power</b> instead of the difference between the 5 th and the 95 th percentile of the <b>receive</b> <b>powers</b> (in dB) as defined in Eq. (2). The reason for this decision is that we do not need to avoid outliers by means of the percentiles as we only have UE 0 and UE 1 present in our experiment.|$|R

On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA.

25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the <b>received</b> <b>power</b> to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E
