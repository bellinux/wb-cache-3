5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} <b>right,</b> <b>in</b> Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn <b>right</b> <b>in</b> an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E
50|$|Germany and Austria-Hungary {{lost their}} <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> China in 1917 after China joined the allies in World War I; the Soviet Union gave up its <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> China in 1924; the United States and United Kingdom {{gave up their}} <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> 1943; Italy and Japan gave up their rights {{by virtue of being}} at war with China in World War II; and Portugal was the last country to give up its <b>rights,</b> <b>in</b> 1946.

5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Braşov was granted a staple <b>right</b> <b>in</b> 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.|$|E
5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} <b>right</b> <b>in</b> its nest, or that a wolf has a property <b>right</b> <b>in</b> its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E

5|$|Nora Chadwick (1950) {{suggested}} that mythical legends of Þorgerðr and Irpa have become confused and intertwined with historical accounts of Haakon’s wife Þóra and her sister, Guðrún; {{and that the}} figure of the shieldmaiden Lagertha in the Gesta may also be an aspect of Þorgerðr. Lotte Motz (1993) proposed that Þorgerðr was a rare instance of a giantess who was the recipient of cultic worship in her own <b>right</b> <b>in</b> heathen Scandinavia.|$|E

30|$|Several {{chapters}} {{argue for}} subtle distinctions between ‘state’ and ‘collective’, and between ‘individual’ and ‘personal’ and ‘private’ property in livestock and land. <b>Rights</b> <b>in</b> animals cannot be discussed separately from <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> land and often <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> the crops and creatures living on that land. All the chapters devote space to discussion of land rights (ownership/disposal, usufruct), sometimes {{more than they}} do to <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> livestock.|$|R
