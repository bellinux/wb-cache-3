50|$|Photovoltaic systems {{need to be}} {{monitored}} to detect breakdown and optimize their operation. There are several photovoltaic monitoring strategies depending on {{the output of the}} installation and its nature. Monitoring can be performed on site or remotely. It can measure production only, retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment (probes, meters, etc.). Monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions. Individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software. Energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes. A third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters, using the inverter manufacturer's protocols, and also acquire weather-related information. Independent smart meters may measure the total energy production of a PV array system. Separate measures such as satellite image analysis or a solar <b>radiation</b> <b>meter</b> (a pyranometer) can be used to estimate total insolation for comparison. Data collected from a monitoring system can be displayed remotely over the World Wide Web, such as OSOTF.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of calibrating TLD badges and <b>radiation</b> survey <b>meters</b> demand that accurate dose {{gets to the}} TLDs and <b>radiation</b> survey <b>meters.</b> A lead block mould and an ICRU slab phantom had been designed and constructed to collimate the panoramic Cs- 137 source at the secondary standards dosimetry laboratory (SSDL) by experts at the National Nuclear Research Institute (NNRI) workshop of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission according to required specifications. This is to concentrate the panoramic isotropic emission into narrow beam geometry to enhance the calibration of personnel dosimeters and <b>radiation</b> survey <b>meters</b> and further reduces scattered radiations due to backscatter and transmission through the biological shield. The designed block was tested {{by a series of}} dose measurement of 1 mSv using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) placed on a standardized ICRU slab phantom to cater for backscatter conditions of the human body at specified distances of 1, 2 and 3 meters with and without the collimation. The transmission dose rates measurements through the biological shield were taken by a survey meter. The results show percentage distribution of an effective reduction of transmitted dose rate to the laboratories and offices. However, the lead door recorded very high transmitted dose rates. It was finally concluded that further collimation will be necessary to completely eliminate scatter radiations introduced by the panoramic bench and transmission through the lead door...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{emissions}} within territories that accommodate {{nuclear power}} facilities are monitored by stationary gamma radiation measuring systems. Any facilities that may contemplate the hazard of radioactive emissions {{must meet the}} safety requirements {{both in terms of}} normal conditions of their operation and in case of accidents. Thus, radioactive materials now in use must comply with strict rules. The account for and control of radioactive materials, their proper application, compliance with the rules and security measures minimize their impact on the environment. However, the loss of professional control over the above materials (various emergencies, losses in the course of transportation, plunders) may involve serious consequences. One of the most effective ways of reconnaissance of territories exposed to radioactive contamination to assure the search for the sources of radionuclides represents remote measurement of surface gamma radiation performed by radiation meters installed on unmanned airborne vehicles (UMAV). The main advantage of UMAV is that it may be used as the carrier of radiation meters. In addition to the gamma <b>radiation</b> <b>meter,</b> the system can take a video of different sources of hazards. The article demonstrates the results of tests of the unmanned <b>radiation</b> <b>meter</b> designated for remote sensing of the surface gamma radiation. The option of assessment of the intensity of the radiation and the concentrations of radionuclide fields is considered. It is noteworthy that the technology of remote scanning of the area can also be used for environmental surveying, technical inspection of structures and buildings, fire detection, photography of high-voltage lines and other facilities located in remote areas...|$|E
