40|$|Information on {{sediment}} concentration in rivers {{is important for}} design of reservoirs and for environmental applications. Because of the scarcity of continuous sediment data, methods {{have been developed to}} predict sediment loads based on few discontinuous measurements. Traditionally, loads are being predicted using rating curves that relate sediment load to discharge. The relationship assumes inherently a unique relationship between concentration and discharge and therefore although performing satisfactorily in predicting loads, it may be less suitable for predicting concentration. This is especially true in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia where concentrations decrease for a given discharge with the progression of the rainy monsoon phase. The objective {{of this paper is to}} improve the {{sediment concentration}} predictions throughout the monsoon period for the Ethiopian highlands with a modified <b>rating</b> <b>type</b> equation. To capture the observed sediment concentration pattern, we assume that the sediment concentration was at the transport limit early in the rainy season and then decreases linearly with effective rainfall towards source-limited concentration. The modified concentration rating curve was calibrated for the four main rivers in the Lake Tana basin where sediment concentrations affect fish production and tourism. Then the scalability of the <b>rating</b> <b>type</b> equation was checked in three 100  ha watersheds for which historic data were available. The results show that for predicting sediment concentrations, the (modified) concentration rating curve was more accurate than the (standard) load rating curve as expected. In addition loads were predicted more accurately for three of the four rivers. We expect that after more extensive testing over a wider geographical area, the proposed concentration rating curve will offer improved predictions of sediment concentrations in monsoonal climates...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the influence of <b>rating</b> <b>type</b> on respiratory sensation and behavior during repeated hypercapnic exposures. METHODS: Sixty-one healthy women performed three rebreathing trials. Half of them were auditorily cued to rate breathlessness intensity every 12 s (CR, n= 30), the other half was instructed to rate breathlessness each time a change in breathlessness intensity was perceived (UCR, n= 31). The ventilatory response was assessed simultaneously. RESULTS: The CR group yielded an earlier threshold in tidal volume (V(T)) than the UCR group. Only in the UCR group did changes occur across rebreathing trials: the V(T) threshold decreased, the respiratory rate (RR) threshold increased, and the sensitivity of the RR increased. CONCLUSIONS: The type of breathlessness rating influences respiratory behavior in the RT. The short-interval cued rating seems to be the best option for a standardized application of this test in research on panic disorder. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with national and European policies, {{the provision of}} financial assistance to residential energy consumers {{has led to a}} greater awareness of and interest in energy retrofit technologies. However, at present Irish energy consumers have no appropriate advice on the future performance of retrofit options available to them. This is a significant limitation to decision making and technology uptake, since this group need to know whether their investment is likely to be worthwhile. The asset rating methodology developed for the certification of energy performance of buildings is the current industry standard of prediction of energy demand and post retrofit performance. The methodology is tedious and may not be viable for ESCos to send trained assessors to residential dwellings while residential customers do not possess the technical knowledge to complete the survey of their own dwelling. This research investigates if the asset rating procedure can be simplified to permit development of simpler models, which would allow quicker and easier assessment of the energy performance of residential dwellings. An asset rating model was created in excel. The Irish housing stock was simulated using a sample data set and Monte Carlo techniques. The model was simplified in stages by systematically removing and parameterising input variables from an initial list of 50. The results of these test methods are presented and should be consulted by policy makers, ESCos and private bodies who wish to create a simplified asset <b>rating</b> <b>type</b> model with known error margins for the prediction of dwelling energy performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical implementation of multicriteria methodologies {{based on the}} UTA model by Jacquet-Lagrèze and Siskos and Quasi-UTA model by Beuthe and Scannella, which are specified with a non-linear, but piecewise linear, additive utility function. In contrast with the general UTA model, the Quasi-UTA specification structures the partial utilities as recursive exponential functions of only one curvature parameter. This allows for a reduction of the quantity of information necessary to build the utility function. The software MUSTARD implements different variants of these models. Firstly, it offers the basic deterministic UTA model of disaggregation, but also its first programmed stochastic version. In both cases, the software proceeds stepwise and interactively helping the decision maker to formulate the problem and state preferences between projects; in the stochastic case, the decision maker is even helped to build the criteria distributions. The Quasi-UTA specification can be introduced in this disaggregation model. Secondly, the software offers an aggregation model whereby the Quasi-UTA partial utility functions are built separately through specific questioning processes. The questions relating to deterministic criteria are of the direct <b>rating</b> <b>type,</b> while those of the stochastic criteria are either of the variable probability or the variable outcome type. The criteria weights can be assessed by the swing weight method or by a UTA-II side-program. As an example {{as well as a}} test of the Quasi-UTA aggregation approach, the paper presents its application to a real problem of selecting road investment projects in Belgium.

This survey is commissioned by the Business Finance Taskforce to provide an independent and authoritative report into the key issues of SME Finance. 5, 000 telephone interviews are conducted per quarter, across the UK, to a carefully structured sample of SMEs by size, sector and region. Data for Q 2 2015 was collected between April and July 2015. The data set includes all data collected for the last 10 waves, i. e. from Q 1 2013 until Q 2 2015, whilst the report focuses on data gathered from the last 4 quarters. The report is now released biannually; The latest report is submitted now for Q 2 2015, {{and the next one}} will follow after Q 4 2015. The survey explores demand for external funding amongst SMEs and the response to requests for funding made to banks in the last 12 months. It also asks for future finance needs and assesses business confidence, growth, and barriers to growth for the future, as well as the impact of a lending experience on the overall banking relationship. As well as identifying the proportion of SMEs that have approached a lender for external finance, the survey identified those who would have liked to apply, but haven't, the barriers to such an application, and the impact of the decision not to seek funding on business performance. A wide range of business demographics are collected to allow for sub-group analysis by criertia such as age of business, external risk <b>rating,</b> <b>type</b> of facility requested, and the "formality" of the business (planning, HR policies, importing, exporting etc). The intention is for this to become the definitive data set on this topic for banks, government, business organisations and other interested parties, including academics. It is hoped it will be used to provide answers, to obviate the need for similar quantitative research, and to provide the starting point for spin off projects into specific aspects of SME Finance. Due to the increasing size of the cumulative data file, it is now constructed on a 10 -wave rolling basis, i. e. the latest file will contain the 10 most recent waves of data. Therefore, to ensure coverage of the whole series, the study now contains separate 10 -quarter data files (e. g. Q 1 2011 -Q 3 2013, Q. 2 2011 -Q 4 2013, Q 3 2011 -Q 1 2014, etc., up to Q 4 2012 -Q 1 2015). The periodic report focuses on data gathered from the last four quarters. The report frequency has now changed to two releases per year, so the next report will follow the Q 2 2015 data release. Further information is available on the SME Finance Monitor web page. For the 16 th edition (October 2016) additional data and documentation were deposited to extend the coverage to Quarter 2, 2016. Main Topics : The survey explores demand for external funding amongst SMEs and the response to requests for funding made to banks in the last 12 months.

30|$|Each {{field of}} life depends on fluids such as water, milk, juices, blood, glycerin, grease, paints, oils, polymer solutions, etc. and their direct or {{indirect}} motions. For most of these fluids, a linear stress-strain relationship does not exist [1] and the classical Navier–Stokes equation cannot describe their behavior. There are lots of fluid models in literature depending upon their response under different circumstances. Among them, the model that has received more attention is the <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> fluid model. The first <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> model, which is viscoelastic and still utilized generally, was given by Maxwell [2]. Although Maxwell developed this model for air, not for polymeric liquids, his methodology {{can be summed up}} to provide a plethora of models. Rajagopal and Srinivasa [3] developed a comprehensive thermodynamic framework by using the concept of Maxwell’s work, which provides a base for making a class of <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> viscoelastic fluids. In the presence of transverse magnetic field, Nayak [4] studied both the heat and mass flow rate of viscous fluid through a medium which is porous considering both heat source and sink. Shateyi [5] used a numerical approach to study the MHD flow of a Maxwell fluid past a stretching plate in the presence of chemical reaction. Shah et al. [6] analyzed the unsteady flow of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) second grade fluid over a stretching sheet by using similarity transformations.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} on samples from a consolidated sandstone reservoir are presented that demonstrate <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> compaction behaviour {{similar to that}} observed on unconsolidated sands and soils. Such <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> behaviour can have large consequences for reservoir compaction, surface subsidence and induced seismicity resulting from oil and gas production. During traditional single loading rate laboratory experiments, the effect of loading rate on uniaxial compressibility can be ignored to first approximation. In contrast, strongly non-linear compaction occurs when stepwise increases or decreases in loading rate are applied within a loading cycle, during loading after creep or during loading after partial unloading. A {{modified version of the}} RTCM <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> compaction model, built on Dieterich’s rate and state friction equation describes the experimental results well. The new isotach version solves a number of limitations of the original model at the cost of an additional parameter that specifies the split between direct (elastic) and secular (creep) strain. The good fits between the updated model and the experimental data suggest that rate and state friction - e. g. on sliding contact surfaces between assemblies of cemented grains or on sliding micro-cracks - causes the observed non-linear compaction. The same rate and state friction phenomena have been linked to the non-linear rate-dependent earthquake generation in volcanism-induced seismicity, suggesting similar rate dependence for the induced seismicity in depleting oil and gas field...|$|R
