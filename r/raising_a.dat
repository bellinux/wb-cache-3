5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it {{increasingly}} difficult to stage her fake pregnancy.

The Essex rebels, possibly a few thousand strong, advanced towards London, some probably travelling directly and others via Kent. One group, under the leadership of John Wrawe, a former chaplain, marched north towards the neighbouring county of Suffolk, with the intention of <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> revolt there.|$|E

5|$|In January or February 1939, Metzger, now a {{scriptwriter}} for Terra Filmkunst, {{mentioned his}} idea to Wolfgang Ebbecke {{with whom he}} was working on the script for Central Rio.

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E

5|$|On April 14, 1775, Gage {{received}} {{instructions from}} Secretary of State William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, to disarm the rebels and to imprison the rebellion's leaders, but Dartmouth gave Gage considerable discretion in his commands.

5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
