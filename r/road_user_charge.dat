50|$|Fuel {{taxes in}} New Zealand are {{considered}} an excise applied by the New Zealand Customs Service on shipments {{brought into the}} country. A breakdown of the fuel taxes is published by the Ministry of Economic Development. Excise as at 1 August 2012 totals 50.524 cents per litre ($1.89/imperial gal; $1.58/US gal) on petrol. In addition the national compulsory Accident Compensation Corporation motor vehicle account receives a contribution of 9.9 cents/litre (37.1¢/imperial gal; 30.9¢/US gal). The ethanol component of bio blended petrol currently attracts no excise duty. This was to be reviewed in 2012.

This involved the trial of a congestion metering scheme, a form of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging.</b> Cambridge presented an ideal opportunity for the implementation of a <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> scheme not least in terms of its congestion problem, the free-standing nature {{of the city and the}} fact that at the time, the local authority in the form of the council was sympathetic to the objectives of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging.</b> The scheme did not, however, proceed and many reasons have been put forward as to why this was the case—issues such as not all the alternatives having been exhausted, the level of sophistication of the proposed scheme and the lack of a similar scheme to consider elsewhere.

40|$|Managing {{congestion}} – Are we {{willing to}} pay the price? A number of authors have written on the topic of congestion, both pointing out that it is not necessarily wholly undesirable, and also that it may not be susceptible to being reduced, let alone eliminated. Nevertheless, concerns continue to be raised about the costs of congestion, both to freight and passenger movements, and solutions tend to be put forward mainly in terms of capacity increases at particular congestion locations. This paper explores the extent of the problem of congestion and current trends in Australia. It looks at current policy directions and their impacts on congestion. It concludes that the most politically popular strategies are unlikely to make any impression on congestion, and may even exacerbate it. It then considers some possible changes in policy directions and investment and examines the likely impact that these would have on future congestion. The paper concludes that congestion is unlikely to be reduced significantly and that there will be major challenges to maintain congestion at current levels, as opposed to having it get considerably worse. A comprehensive program of strategies is required to even maintain current congestion levels, and the paper also concludes that a central policy that must be considered is that of time-distance-place user charges.

40|$|This study {{examines}} public policy, privacy, and institutional {{issues related to}} a new <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> system. This system has been viewed as a possible replacement for existing motor fuel taxes. The adequacy of motor fuel taxes is a national issue, {{as the federal government}} and all states rely heavily on today's fuel-based user charges to finance transportation projects. With new vehicle propulsion technologies on the horizon, in particular hybrid gas-electric engines and hydrogen fuel cells, there is a realization that transportation revenue collected from motor fuel taxes may eventually be in serious jeopardy. The authors conclude that the best method for assessing road user charges is on an actual miles traveled basis, also called a vehicle miles of travel (VMT) user charge. A VMT charge, coupled with intelligent vehicle technology and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology, would provide a means for crediting states or sub-state jurisdictions for the miles of travel occurring within their boundaries. Data would be stored on the vehicle and downloaded to a collection center at various times. The researchers conclude that a system can be designed that is convenient, ensures low evasion rates, is efficient to administer, and ensures user privacy. The concept has the potential to ensure a stable stream of revenue for the highway system, as well as being equitable, convenient, and flexible in its application. This system may allow for varying user charges by jurisdiction, class of vehicle, type of facility, or time of day. However, the authors caution that trying to accomplish all of these purposes could greatly complicate implementation, at least initially. The authors recommend a systematic field test and demonstration including the equipment of a substantial number of vehicles to validate system technology, reliability, and security and to assess user satisfaction and acceptance...|$|E

Firstly, this study investigates the effects of information concerning traffic conditions on drivers' route choice behaviour {{and the way in}} which drivers evaluate the value of information concerning delay time. Secondly, drivers' response to different types of variable road user charges and their sensitivity to these road user charges are explored. Thirdly, the way that the uncertain information influence drivers' behaviours are also analysed. Finally, this study investigates the extent to which socio-economic characteristics influence drivers' responses to <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> and to the information concerning traffic conditions and charges. The traffic information is provided via VMS and related to the expected delay time. Three types of the variable road user charges are applied: fixed charges; timebased charges; and delay time-based charges. Three SP surveys are conducted to collect data. The main survey is conducted in Leeds and Seoul, and the additional survey is conducted in Leeds. Logit models are used for analysing the main SP survey data. The repeated measurement problem in the main survey data is corrected using the jackknife method and Kocur's method. A regression method is used in the analysis of the additional survey data. Some results reveal that Utility Theory was not enough to explain the results. Therefore, Prospect Theory is applied to the results and is found to give a satisfactory explanation. The results indicate that drivers are less likely to choose a route characterised by recurrent delays and as the length of delay reported on their usual route increases drivers value delay time information more highly than free travel time and become increasingly sensitive to delay time as it increases. The delay thresholds in this study are 10 minute for the normal delay time and 15 minutes for the extra delay time on VMS. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> {{is used as}} an 'umbrella' term to {{describe}} {{a wide range of}} applications of pricing roads and infrastructure. <b>Road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> includes a number of charging measures that governments and other road owners use to: i) finance new or maintain existing road infrastructure ii) manage traffic (e. g. reduce congestion) iii) minimise environmental impacts of transport iv) internalise the external costs of road transport caused, e. g., by pollution and noise emissions. Historically, the common approach to charging for road use is some form of general taxation rather than differentiated <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging.</b> <b>Road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> has long been proposed as an efficient and equitable method to pay for road use and to fund road infrastructure projects.

40|$|The South African fuel levy {{is used to}} fund government?s general {{expenditure}} programmes, {{including the}} construction and maintenance of roads and support of public transport. Yet, the continuing reliance of the fuel levy to generate sufficient income is questioned due to {{a decrease in the}} average amount of fuel sold per vehicle per annum. The need exists to identify, explore and test a viable and operationally feasible alternative that is not dependant on fuel sales when generating income. The paper undertook a qualitative analysis of transportation financing sources to identify and then explore a viable alternative to the fuel levy. Furthermore, the operational feasibility of the alternative was tested and evaluated through a proof of concept vehicle tracking experiment. A kilometre-based <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> (KBRUC) system was identified as a viable alternative which addresses many of the problems associated with the fuel levy. The system could entail an on-board global positioning system (GPS) enabled device to be fitted to a road user?s vehicles where vehicle movement data can be collected in order to generate a road use invoice at a set charge per kilometre travelled. The vehicle tracking experiment showed that a suggested configuration of the system is operationally feasible, in small scale, in South African.

The United Kingdom introduced a HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicles) Road User Levy Act, 2013, which became effective from 1 April 2014. Given Irelandâs geographical location as a peripheral European nation, it has been historically dependent {{on the use of the}} British road network (UK land bridge) for exporting and importing goods to and from Europe. Irish exports are set to be the main growth driver for the Irish economy in real GDP and critical for economic revival. The UK 2 ̆ 7 s introduction of the new HGV road charge has raised serious concerns across the freight transport sector and policy-makers in the Republic of Ireland.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{transport tax}} and charging regime has stimulated limited behavioural change {{and has been}} politically problematic (as demonstrated by the September 2000 fuel duty protests). This project synthesised a range of research that has explored ways in which road user charging could replace the present regime based on taxing fuels and car ownership. In 2002, when this project was proposed, this was a fringe transport policy issue. Throughout 2003 the subject achieved a sudden prominence, with a government working party being established to explore the possibility of long-term area-wide road user charging. A tax regime change towards a car <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> for cars has occurred, or is being considered, in societies as contrasting as Oregon State in the USA, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK, reflecting a range of policy considerations. For the UK, these include: the ongoing failure of transport policy measures to achieve adequate cuts in congestion and emissions; {{the success of the}} London Congestion Charge; the rise in the cost of transport policy interventions; the reduction in Treasury income of eco-reforms to the current tax regime; and the difficulties of, and equity issues relating to, taxing fuel in a future multi-fuel transport sector. The project developed tax change scenarios in conjunction with the project's user group (including policymakers, NGOs and researchers). Five scenarios were modelled using an adaptation of the Dutch Mobility Explorer program. An 'opt-in' transitional policy mechanism involved replacing VED with a small flat-rate kilometre charge for cars of 0. 77 p/km. The model suggested it would have little policy impact, but could be used to familiarise car drivers with the concept of a distance charge. A fiscally neutral scenario involved the replacement of VED and Fuel Duty with a banded kilometre charge for cars of between 2. 3 and 8. 5 p/km (varied by the environmental performance of the vehicle type). This induced little behaviour change, reducing car driver mobility by only 4...|$|E

40|$|The {{progress}} {{made by the}} national government in consolidating its fiscal position between 2002 and 2006 proved unsustainable as its revenue effort started to go down once again in 2007 after a brief improvement in 2005 - 2007. With the more expansionary stance taken {{by the government in}} 2009 as part of its effort to shield the economy from the effects of the global financial and economic crisis of 2008 / 9, the national government fiscal deficit jumped to 3. 9 % of GDP in 2009 and national government debt started to rise when measured relative to GDP. Clearly, turning around the national government`s fiscal health should be high on the policy agenda. In previous episodes of fiscal consolidation, the easiest way to address the fiscal imbalance is by cutting expenditures. However, this option {{does not appear to be}} consistent with the government`s avowed commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and inclusive growth. After estimating the budgetary requirements of achieving the MDGs and inclusive growth, this paper shows that national government revenues need to increase from 14. 3 % of GDP in 2009 - 2010 to 17. 5 %- 17. 9 % in 2012 - 2016 if fiscal consolidation were to be achieved while providing the fiscal space for the much needed basic social services and infrastructure. The Aquino administration has repeatedly said that the much needed revenue increases will be derived solely from improvements in tax administration rather than from the imposition of new taxes or increases in the rate of imposition of existing taxes. The record of the BIR and BOC in increasing their revenue effort through improvements in tax administration does not inspire optimism, however. This study also cautions that tax administration improvements do not happen overnight primarily because the installation and operationalization of system-wide changes take time. Thus, it argues that there is a need for government to consider the imposition of new tax measures if fiscal consolidation is to be achieved without sacrificing the financing of MDGs and inclusive growth. The least distortionary options in this regard include: (i) the restructuring of excise tax on sin products, (ii) the rationalization of fiscal incentives, and (iii) reforming the <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charge.</b> In addition, the government should also consider the simplification of tax structure by reducing the number of rates at which various taxes are levied or by reducing the number of taxpayers/transactions/types of income which are exempt from any given tax. tax effort, fiscal sustainability, tax gap, Philippines, millennium development goals (MDG), inclusive growth, tax gap, fiscal consolidation, zero-based budgeting...|$|E

Whilst {{it is clear that}} perfect implementation is not possible in the real world, and Gunn has subsequently been criticised for his 'top-down' approach to decision-making, these conditions do, nonetheless act as an effective framework through which to evaluate good practice in the implementation of urban transport policy instruments. Two urban transport policy instruments, which form an increasingly important element of the Government's strategy in the UK for reducing the demand for private transport as set out in a New Deal for Transport (DETR, 1998), are travel plans and <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging.</b> Travel plans are a relatively recent policy instrument in the UK and seek to reduce trips to work by car by providing, through individual employers, a targeted, integrated package of incentives and disincentives to influence commuters' choice of mode of travel to and from the workplace. <b>Road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging,</b> whereby motorists are charged for the road space they use in urban areas, seeks to reduce the congestion problem via the price mechanism, and has a longer history in the UK. To date the implementation of travel plans in the UK has been more widespread than that of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging.</b> It is fair to say, however, that the widespread implementation of both urban transport policy instruments is a complex and sensitive area for decision-makers. The aim of this paper is firstly, to analyse travel plans and <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> in the UK with respect to the conditions for perfect implementation put forward by Gunn and secondly, to highlight the elements of good practice, pertinent to the implementation of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging,</b> in the process of the implementation of travel plans.

Acceptability can be enhanced by demonstrating {{that there is a}} serious problem to be overcome, that a measure as dramatic as <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> is needed, and that it is likely to work. It is essential that the impacts, both positive and negative, are clearly identified and effectively communicated. A continuing dialogue is needed with the public, pressure groups, politicians and the media. In particular politicians need to understand, but not over-estimate, the concerns of the public (Section  3.11).|$|R
30|$|The {{business}} community {{is likely to}} be critical of the potential impact of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> on the urban economy [28, 68] unless it can anticipate substantial benefits through congestion relief [36]. Although there is still only limited evidence to counter such fears, the evidence that does exist does not support them. Much still comes from predictive models, which have typically indicated that urban <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> would only alter population and employment in the affected areas by between + 1 % and − 3 % [22, 38, 67]. Some empirical evidence is now becoming available. An early study in Trondheim [77] found that a decline in annual turnover prior to the toll ring was reversed after the toll ring had been implemented, and concluded that {{there was no evidence that}} the toll ring had adversely influenced trade. A similar finding has arisen recently in Stockholm [13]. More detailed analyses have been conducted in London, where some firms have argued that they have lost market share [52], but the general consensus is that <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> has had a broadly neutral effect on the London economy [24, 74]. Thus, while the evidence remains limited, it is increasingly clear that the impacts of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> on the urban economy are likely to be small and, in particular, much smaller than the {{business community}} predicts.|$|R
