Disposal regulations and recommendations for smoke detectors vary from region to region.

25|$|If {{graphite}} is used, {{the gross}} erosion rates due to {{physical and chemical}} sputtering would be many meters per year, so one must rely on redeposition of the sputtered material. The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with {{the location of the}} sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious <b>radiological</b> <b>hazard</b> in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary plasma-facing material (PFM) in a commercial reactor.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} {{toxicity of}} depleted uranium {{is about a}} million times greater in vivo than its <b>radiological</b> <b>hazard,</b> with the kidney {{considered to be the}} main target organ. Health effects of DU are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external. Three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur: inhalation, ingestion, and embedded fragments or shrapnel contamination. Properties such as phase (e.g. particulate or gaseous), oxidation state (e.g. metallic or ceramic), and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their absorption, distribution, translocation, elimination and the resulting toxicity. For example, metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent uranium(VI) uranyl compounds such as uranium trioxide.|$|E

50|$|Tritium is {{used because}} it is {{believed}} to pose a negligible threat to human health, {{in contrast to the}} previous radioluminescent source, radium (below), which proved to be a significant <b>radiological</b> <b>hazard.</b> The low-energy 5.7 keV beta particles emitted by tritium cannot pass through the enclosing glass tube.
