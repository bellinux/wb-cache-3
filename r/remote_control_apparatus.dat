Yves Bourdon, a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the air brakes of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as hand brakes on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set hand brakes on just the five locomotive engines, a buffer car, and a car housing the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on; this gave the false impression that the hand brakes alone would hold the train.|$|E

40|$|A <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> {{security}} <b>apparatus</b> {{includes a}} lock element movable between {{locked and unlocked}} positions by an electrically actuated power device. The operator is provided with a portable transmitter adapted to generate light which is interrupted at a predetermined frequency so as to produce an encoded light signal. This signal is detected by a light transceiver which generates an independent signal at the same predetermined frequency and which compares the frequencies of the detected signal and independent signal. If these frequencies are substantially the same, the transceiver actuates the power means to move the lock element to its unlocked position. The security apparatus may be advantageously installed as a door lock, in which case a lock element receiving member is secured to the door. The signal detector is positioned at the exterior {{side of the door}} for receiving encoded signals from the transmitter and an override switch may be positioned at an interior side of the door for opening the lock without a transmitter. A contact switch is disclosed which maintains the lock element in the unlocked position whenever the door is open...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is design {{low-cost}} device {{and easy to use}} for physically disabled people with limited mobility who they cannot move to operate electrical household appliances so they need a simple device that allow them to control these appliances without needing help. <b>Remote</b> <b>control</b> is having a great impact in making life easier; it is a device has an ability to <b>control</b> <b>apparatus</b> from a distance by means of signals. In this project we presented design of a simple universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> that have the ability to control multiple electrical devices. The {{goal of this}} thesis is design low-cost device and easy to use for physically disabled people with limited mobility who they cannot move to operate electrical household appliances so they need a simple device that allow them to control these appliances without needing help. The universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is the solution from this problem, this thesis discuss the design and implementation of the universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> using USART protocol that provide serial transmission of the commands that operate the electrical devices from the transmitter to the receiver device, these commands are transmitted using infrared radiation emitted by the IR led transmitter and received by IR sensor. The system based on microcontrollers so sit offers the advantage of having small size, light weight and portability which provide the simplicity and the ease of use. The efficiency of this system could be improved by further optimizations. Also further work is needed to improve the system and more devices can be added to be controlled and operated...|$|R
25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} the burnup (BU) of BWR spent fuel was investigated by using a novel type of 137 Cs calibration source. The source is constructed to fit in the fuel handling fixtures of all the BWR type power plants in Sweden and Finland. It can be used also in the interim storage facilities for spent fuel, CLAB in Sweden and TVO-KPA-STORE in Finland. The source is covered by a watertight steel cylinder that is fixed inside a 0. 65 m long section of a ASEA-ATOM type BWR fuel channel. Inside the cylinder there is a 37 GBq 137 Cs pellet fixed to a wagon, which can be driven up and down {{by means of a}} stepping motor. By moving the source the repeatability of the geometrical positioning is attained. The amplitude and scanning speed are <b>controlled</b> by a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> unit. The <b>apparatus</b> is easy to handle and decontaminate. The source can be transported in a custom made box (45 cm × 45 cm × 70 cm) under category II-YELLOW. In repeated measurements the precision of the new calibration source was found to be 1 l. 7 %. The use of this calibration source makes it possible to calibrate the whole measurement chain and to compare the data measured in different geometries. A typical calibration time is 15 min, including source handling. In recent measurements a Westphal loss free counting (LFC) system was used in connection with a...|$|R
