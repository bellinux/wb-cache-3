Scientists are actively discussing the impact of personal characteristics on entrepreneurial activity, and entrepreneurship is analyzed under two key aspects in terms of this research. Scientists describe entrepreneurship differently: some claim entrepreneurship is simply initiative, others that these are natural and acquired human characteristics, which enable his/her innovative behaviours and active performance and risk. The research aim is, after having identified personal youth characteristics, to define their significance for entrepreneurial activity. During the research the significance of personal entrepreneurial characteristics was indicated, and their links to value principles and specific influential factors on youth entrepreneurial activity. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{documents the}} social trajectory {{developed in the}} Sogamoso valley {{with the aim of}} comparing its nature with other trajectories in the Colombian high plain and exploring whether economic and non-economic attractors produced similarities or dissimilarities in their social outputs. The initial sedentary occupation (400 BC to 800 AD) consisted of few small hamlets as well as a small number of widely dispersed farmsteads. There was no indication that these communities were integrated under any regional-scale sociopolitical authority. The population increased dramatically after 800 AD and it was organized in three supra-local communities. The largest of these regional polities was focused on a central place at Sogamoso that likely included a major temple described in Spanish accounts. Demographic estimates for the pre-contact period (1200 - 1600 AD) and for the Colonial times indicate a density similar to the demographic estimates calculated for 800 - 1200 AD. Regional-scale political organization shifted, however, without sign of overall political integration of the entire survey area. This scenario suggested political dynamics with only moderate levels of sociopolitical differentiation. The strongest and most intensive social interaction occurred in the local community around which the largest regional polity gravitated. This interaction responded to social and religious activities related to burial practices and the use of large communal structures where people from across the valley gathered regularly in the central place at Sogamoso, but did not live there as permanent <b>residents.</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>activities</b> were also probably at play as centripetal forces that attracted population to different places of the survey area but they seemed less important than social activities and religious practices. This evidence indicates that the polity centered in Sogamoso during prehispanic times was demographically smaller and less central than indicated by interpretations based on the historic accounts. This data suggests that the Spaniards classified as important prehispanic communities that were both large and small and based on varied centralizing forces affecting daily and supra-local interaction. The comparison of the Sogamoso valley with other trajectories in the Eastern Highlands suggests that economic and non-economic centralizing forces acting on human interaction create different degrees of nucleation, inequality and system survivability...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{the usual}} game {{reserves}} and national parks, Namibian conservancies allow <b>residents</b> to continue <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> such as livestock and cattle farming {{and they are}} allowed to add wildlife use and tourism to their daily pursuits. Kathryn Fuller, president of the United States section of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), presented President Nujoma a 'Gift to the Earth' certificate for Namibia's conservancies scheme. Previous awards have essentially related to the protection of ecosystems and animals and efforts to combat global warming. Namibia is the first country to receive the award for a programme which has people at its heart. Namibia's Conservancy Programme opens the way for communal area farmers to manage, protect and benefit from wildlife and other natural resources. President Nujoma recently presented four new communally-run conservancies with certificates of registration. These areas together cover around 1. 7 million hectares. The Nyae-Nyae, Salambala, Torra and Khoadi Hoas conservancies are home to many elephants, buffaloes, rhinos, and sable and roan antelopes as well as 15, 000 local people. Another 16 conservancies are in development. According to environment Minister Philemon Malima, over the past year more than N$ 1 million (approximately euros 180, 000) has flowed directly to community members in the conservancies. In addition, the scheme allows for local communities to decide for themselves in which ways money raised by activities such as game hunting and ecotourism is to be used.

40|$|Historic-Religious Kampung {{refers to}} the {{historical}} urban kampung which has an artifact or tradition of religious ritual. This type of kam-pong is able to grow independently because of the spirit that comes from its religious tradition, which in turn generating the <b>resident’s</b> and migrant’s <b>economic</b> <b>activities.</b> Currently there is an argument that formalism and universalism of the physical forms and the demolition of urban kampung have alienated the local spirit and culture. The socio-spatial-economic approach on to the historic-religious kampung case presented here will be significantly contributing {{to the preservation of}} the local spirit (Genius Loci). This paper is based on the empirical study of historic-religious kampung Luar Batang (Jakarta, Indonesia) which hopefully will be able to uncover the relationships between the local spirit and spatial structure. Dialogues based on the comparative study with the other similar kampung have been carried out as an attempt to conceptually formulate the significant aspects that would be useful for consideration in environmental regulation planning and maturation process, especially for the historic-religious kampung settlements in urban areas in Indonesia and other similar contexts...|$|R
40|$|The Republic of South Africa {{since the}} 1948 {{inception}} of Apartheid policies has experienced economic problems resulting from spatially dispersed growth. The election of President Mandela in 1994, however, eliminated the last forms of Apartheid {{as well as}} its discriminatory spatial, social, and economic policies, specially toward black Africans. In Cape Town, South Africa, several initiatives to restructure and to economically revitalize blighted and abandoned township communities, like Langa, have been instituted. One element of this strategy is the development of activity streets. The main questions asked in this study are whether activity streets are a feasible solution to the local economic problems left by the apartheid system and whether activity streets represent an economically sustainable approach to development. An analysis of a proposed activity street in Langa and its potential to generate jobs is undertaken. An Employment Generation Model used in this study shows that many of the businesses rely on the local purchasing power of the <b>residents.</b> Since the <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> are mostly service oriented, a combination of manufacturing industries and institutionally implemented strategies within the township will have to be developed in order to generate sustainable employment. The result seem to indicate that, in Langa, the activity street depend very much on an increase in sales, pedestrian and vehicular traffic flow. ...|$|R
