40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies on the US {{subprime}} market indicate that, due to asymmetric information, credit risk transfer activities have perverse effects on banks' lending standards. We investigate {{a large part of}} the market for securitized assets ("prime mortgages") in Italy, a country with a regulatory framework analogous to the one prevalent in Europe. Information on over a million mortgages consists of loan-level variables, characteristics of the originating bank and, most importantly, contractual features of the securitization deal, including the seniority structure of the ABSs issued by the Special Purpose Vehicle and the amount <b>retained</b> <b>by</b> the <b>originator.</b> We borrow a robust way to test for the effects of asymmetric information from the empirical contract theory literature (Chiappori and Salanié, 2000). Overall, our evidence suggests that banks can effectively counter the negative effects of asymmetric information in the securitization market by selling less opaque loans, using signaling devices (i. e. retaining a share of the equity tranche of the ABSs issued by the SPV) and building up a reputation for not undermining their own lending standards. securitization, asymmetric information, signaling, reputation...|$|R
50|$|The Network of Networks {{strategy}} proposed within OCJR {{recommended the}} creation of specific networks based upon these Communities of Interest which were joined together through data interchange gateways supporting common standards. Under this approach networks would be arranged by data type and business functions such as Criminal Justice, Health and Social Care, Defence and Intelligence or Public Finance rather than solely on established departmental boundaries.Within a COI, trust relationships and data interchange are readily supported, enabling data sharing without a need to cross network boundaries and providing benefits of scale without the challenges and compromises intrinsic to homogeneous cross sector networks.

40|$|We present {{mobile agent}} abstractions {{in terms of}} a few basic {{mobility}} and connec-tivity features. The features used in formulating the abstractions are identied as self-hopping, push by host, retraction <b>by</b> <b>originator,</b> push <b>by</b> <b>originator,</b> and mobility and disconnection of host machines. Combining these primitives leads to dierent agent abstractions with varying avors of mobility and interaction with hosts. Six such abstractions namely Autonomous Agent, Messenger Agent, Controlled Agent, Greedy Agent, Phoenix Agent and Disconnected Agent are presented. A unique feature of this work is that the abstractions themselves are described in the more general Ambient Calculus. Ambient descriptions bring out the subtle dierences between structural and behavioral properties of the agent abstractions. Guidelines for mapping the abstractions to an implementation over a mobility framework are also discussed...|$|R
