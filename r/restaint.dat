5000|$|However, {{there are}} some {{operating}} roller coasters {{that do not have}} either <b>restaint</b> systems. Rollo Coaster at Idlewild and Soakzone {{is a good example of}} this. Usually roller coasters with little to no air-time (being lifted out of your seat) do not have restraints. Until early 2006, The Rollercoaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the UK also operated without any restaints, although seatbelts were added to the ride in the 2007 Season. During 2008, trains from the Big Dipper Rollercoaster were installed on the ride. [...] "The Rollercoaster" [...] now operates with lapbars, although the original train is still stored on the transfer track in the station.|$|E

Enveloped {{concrete}} wall type structures of localizing safety systems for <b>restaint</b> and localization of radioactive decay products {{or in the}} case of special natural or man-made impacts on the power unit is one of the most important components to ensure the safety of nuclear power. The promising direction for the development of the NPP technical system monitoring is to use conductive nanocomposites as primary elements of information. The purpose of the article is to review the theoretical background and experience in the conductive nanocomposites creating for diagnostics of localizing nuclear safety systems. Conclusions. A promising area for the development of diagnostic systems of localizing nuclear safety systems is the use of electrically conductive nanocomposites (conductive concrete - bethels, plasters, paint coatings). A mechanism for conductive nanocomposites creating is the use of the filler metal and carbon nanoparticles. As binders is promising to use nanocomposites of the mineral binders (cement) and water glass...|$|E
