5|$|The {{dust in the}} gossamer rings {{originates}} in essentially {{the same way as}} that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-section,</b> decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.|$|E

25|$|The M 20 was {{designed}} by Willy Messerschmitt at Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, primarily for use with Luft Hansa which had ordered two {{in advance of the}} first flight. It was a development of the BFW M.18d eight-seater, equipped with a single 375kW (500hp) upright inline water-cooled BMW VIa engine. It had a high, cantilever wing based around a robust D-section box formed from a single dural spar and dural skin, forward to the leading edge. The fuselage was all-metal, with a mostly dural frame, covered with metal sheeting providing <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-section</b> accommodation, with four square windows each side, for eight passengers. The single-axle main undercarriage was strutted vertically to the wing.|$|E
25|$|The E-34 had a <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-section</b> {{fuselage}} {{formed from}} steel tubing with internal wire bracing. Its cockpits were open. The undercarriage used {{a pair of}} internally sprung mainwheels with balloon tyres and a tailskid. A split axle was mounted on a short V-strut below the fuselage. On the prototype, the undercarriage main legs were short, mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and assisted by short forward struts. The second prototype and production aircraft had longer legs fixed to the upper longerons. The prototype and production series aircraft were powered, as {{the rules of the}} competition required, by a 105hp (78kW) Walter Junior four-cylinder inverted inline engine, although the second prototype was fitted with the more powerful 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major of the same configuration.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} quite novel. Barnwell borrowed from marine experience by using duralumin sheet, varnished to prevent corrosion and used these {{to make the}} fuselage in four sections. The two forward sections were semi-monocoque (i.e. open channels) with braced longitudinal upper members which, bolted together, held the engine, a water-cooled inline upright 140hp (100kW) Hispano-Suiza) and the pilot's cockpit. Aft, two more sections, both true monocoques, held the observer and carried the tail unit. The two cockpits were close together, with the pilot under the wing at mid-chord and the observer under a trailing edge cutout; Barnwell proposed that the short observer's fuselage section should be removable to turn the M.R.1 into a single-seater, though this configuration was not realised. The monocoque sections were very early examples of double-skinned construction, with a smooth outer skin riveted to a longitudinally-corrugated inner skin. The detailed design was by W.T.Read. The complete fuselage was of round-cornered <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-section</b> and quite slender, mounted between the wings. The M.R.1 was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep, with ailerons on both planes. Aluminium wing spars proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid and Bristol outsourced their manufacture to The Steel Wing Company at Gloucester, who had built experimental steel wings for other aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of “template” and “adder” {{proteins}} self-assemble {{into large}} amyloid fibers of varying morphology and modulus. Fibers range from low modulus, <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-sectioned</b> tapes to high modulus, circular cross-sectioned cylinders. Varying the proteins in the mixture can elicit “in-between” morphologies, such as elliptical cross-sectioned fibers and twisted tapes, {{both of which}} have moduli in-between rectangular tapes and cylindrical fibers. Experiments on mixtures of proteins of known amino acid sequence show that control of the large amyloid fiber morphology is dependent on the amount of glutamine repeats or “Q-blocks” relative to hydrophobic side chained amino acids such as alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine in the adder protein. Adder proteins with only hydrophobic groups form low modulus <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-sections</b> and increasing the Q-block content allows excess hydrogen bonding on amide groups that results in twist and higher modulus.

The aircraft has a fixed, wheeled tricycle undercarriage, assisted by a small tail skid. First flown on 15 June 1948, development of the SE-3101 led to the Sud-Est SE-3110 and the single tail rotor SE.3120, though none of them entered production.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-section</b> {{fuselage}} of the MB.90 was a {{tubular steel}} structure, fabric covered {{apart from the}} cabin which had plywood floor and sides.

Pairs of parallel bracing struts linked wing spars to the lower fuselage longerons. The fuselage narrowed rearwards to a conventional tail with a rectangular, round tipped tailplane mounted on the fuselage and a triangular fin with an unbalanced rudder which reached down to the keel.|$|E
2500|$|The Type L had short floats, flat {{bottomed}} with no chine but in {{plan and}} profile curving inwards to the nose.

40|$|This work {{intends to}} {{demonstrate}} the importance of geometrically nonlinear cross-sectional analysis of certain composite beam-based four-bar mechanisms by using different stacking sequences in all component bars in predicting better system dynamic charac-teristics. All component bars of the mechanism are made of fiber reinforced laminates and have thin <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> They could, in general, be pre-twisted and/or possess initial curvature, either by design or by defect. They are linked to each other by means of revolute joints. We restrict ourselves to linear materials with small strains within each elastic body (beam). Each component of the mechanism is modeled as a beam based on geometrically nonlinear 3 -D elasticity theory. The component problems are thus split into 2 -D analyses of reference beam cross-sections and nonlinear 1 -D analyses along the four beam reference curves. For thin <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-sections</b> considered here, the 2 -D cross-sectional nonlinearity is overwhelming. This can be perceived {{from the fact that}} such sections constitute a limiting case between thin-walled open and closed sections, thus inviting the nonlinear phenomena observed in both. The strong elastic couplings of anisotropic composite laminates complicate the model further. However, a powerful math...|$|R

2500|$|The Vampyr had a {{fuselage}} with {{a simple}} <b>rectangular</b> <b>cross-section</b> but that of the Greif was more refined, with an elliptical section, though both were rather similar in profile. Both fuselages were completely ply skinned over wooden bulkheads and stringers. [...] The Greif's wing was mounted closer to the fuselage than on its predecessor, with the consequence that a cut-out {{had to be made}} in the leading edge for the pilot's head. This turned out to have deleterious aerodynamic effects. [...] Its undercarriage consisted of a pair of semi-recessed wheels with balloon tyres on the centreline, one under the nose and the other larger one under the wing spar. [...] The tail surfaces of the Greif were very similar to those of the Vampyr; a rectangular all-moving tailplane was hinged at the extreme rear of the fuselage with the rudder hinged at the same point. The fin was broad as required by the short fuselage; fin and rudder had straight vertical edges and a straight, rising top. The bottom of the rudder was parallel with its top, leaving room the tailplane movement.|$|E
