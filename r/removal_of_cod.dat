40|$|BACKGROUND: Biological {{treatment}} {{efficiency of}} coking wastewater is rather poor, especially for {{chemical oxygen demand}} (COD) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH 4 +-N) removal due to its complex composition and high toxicity. RESULTS: A pilot-scale anaerobic/anoxic/oxic/oxic (A(2) /O- 2) biofilm system has been developed to treat coking wastewater, focusing attention on the COD and NH 4 +-N removal efficiencies. Operational results over 239 days showed that hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the system had {{a great impact on}} simultaneous <b>removals</b> <b>of</b> <b>COD</b> and NH 4 +-N. At HRT of 116 h, total <b>removal</b> efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>COD</b> and NH 4 +-N were 92. 3 % and 97. 8 %, respectively, reaching the First Grade discharge standard for coking wastewater in China. Adequate HRT, anoxic <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> refractory organics and two-step aerobic bioreactors were considered to be effective measures to obtain satisfactory coking effluent quality using the A(2) /O- 2 biofilm system.

The <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>COD</b> and TP in this examine {{was obviously}} {{lower than the}} most related facility (Wang et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2012), it {{is due to the}} fact that only two EF tanks (the first tank and the second tank) were concatenated in this study but three tanks were designed in their experiment, added with the big fluctuations of the influent character during the entire year. As can be deduced from our data, the <b>removal</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>COD</b> and LAS could be enhanced to satisfaction if the third EF tanks or recycling measures are in further connected to the process. The <b>removal</b> rate <b>of</b> LAS was averaged as 71 %, which mainly attribute to the living plants and the depth of the packing (Huang et al. 2004; Kadewa et al. 2010). Despite the <b>removal</b> rate <b>of</b> LAS was not so good by the this EF process, the content of LAS in the influent was near to the discharge standard, and predictably the content of LAS in the influent will lower than the discharge standard if a third similar tank was added and connected to this process.|$|R
40|$|In this work, ferric {{coagulation}} {{and acid}} cracking as olive mill wastewater (OMW) pretreatments during photocatalysis process were compared in batch recirculation reactor. Because of ferric ions influence, ferric coagulation has preference over acid cracking. Ferric ions influence on intensification of penolic components absorption on TiO 2 surface in initial and oxidize organic pollutant during photocatalysis treatment. In this investigation, COD and total phenolic (TPh) reduction were studied with altering TiO 2 concentration and pH as main effects. The {{results revealed that}} the percentage <b>removals</b> <b>of</b> <b>COD</b> and TPh in ferric coagulation were 69. 24 % and 88. 16 % respectively, whereas these percentage removals in acid cracking were 62. 66 % and 57. 87 % respectively.
