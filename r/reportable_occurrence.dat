40|$|Despite {{the best}} {{preventative}} measures, ruptured hoses, spills and leaks occur {{with use of}} all hydraulic equipment. Although these releases do not usually produce a RCRA regulated waste, they are often a <b>reportable</b> <b>occurrence.</b> Clean-up and subsequent administrative procedure involves additional costs, labor and work delays. Concerns over these releases, especially related to Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) vehicles hauling waste on public roads prompted Fleet Services (FS) to seek {{an alternative to the}} standard petroleum based hydraulic fluid. Since 1996 SNL has participated in a pilot program with the University of Iowa (UNI) and selected vehicle manufacturers, notably John Deere, to field test hydraulic fluid produced from soybean oil in twenty of its vehicles. The vehicles included loaders, graders, sweepers, forklifts and garbage trucks. Research was conducted for several years at UNI to modify and market soybean oils for industrial uses. Soybean oil ranks first in worldwide production of vegetable oils (29 %), and represents a tremendous renewable resource. Initial tests with soybean oil showed excellent lubrication and wear protection properties. Lack of oxidative stability and polymerization of the oil were concerns. These concerns were being addressed through genetic alteration, chemical modification and use of various additives, and the improved lubricant is in the field testing stage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE Analyzing {{incidents}} {{reported in}} a public hospital in the Federal District, Brasilia, according to the characteristics and outcomes involving patients. METHOD A descriptive and retrospective study of incidents reported between January 2011 and September 2014. RESULTS 209 reported incidents were categorized as <b>reportable</b> <b>occurrences</b> (n = 22, 10. 5 %), near misses (n = 16, 7. 7 %); incident without injury (n = 4, 1. 9 %) and incident with injury (adverse events) (n = 167, 79. 9 %). The average age of patients was 44 years and the hospitalization time until {{the moment of the}} incident was on average 38. 5 days. Nurses were the healthcare professionals who most reported the incidents (n = 55, 67 %). No outcomes resulted in death. CONCLUSION Incidents related to blood/hemoderivatives, medical devices/equipment, patient injuries and intravenous medication/fluids were the most frequent. Standardizing the reporting processes and enhancing participation by professionals in managing incidents is recommended...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the remedial action to achieve compliance with 29 CFR 1910 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements of fluorescent light fixtures containing PCBs at K- 25 site. This remedial action {{is called the}} Remediation Plan for Fluorescent Light Fixtures Containing PCBs at the K- 25 Site (The Plan). The Plan specifically discusses (1) conditions of non-compliance, (2) alternative solutions, (3) recommended solution, (4) remediation plan costs, (5) corrective action, (6) disposal of PCB waste, (7) training, and (8) plan conclusions. The results from inspections by Energy Systems personnel in 2 buildings at K- 25 site and statistical extension of this data to 91 selected buildings at the K- 25 site indicates that there are approximately 28, 000 fluorescent light fixtures containing 47, 036 ballasts. Approximately 38, 531 contain PCBs and 2, 799 of the 38, 531 ballasts are leaking PCBs. Review of <b>reportable</b> <b>occurrences</b> at K- 25 for the 12 month period of September 1990 through August 1991 shows that Energy Systems personnel reported 69 ballasts leaking PCBs. Each leaking ballast is in non-compliance with 29 CFR 1910 - Table Z- 1 -A. The age of the K- 25 facilities indicate a continued and potential increase in ballasts leaking PCBs. This report considers 4 alternative solutions {{for dealing with the}} ballasts leaking PCBs. The advantages and disadvantages of each alternative solution are discussed and ranked using cost of remediation, reduction of health risks, and compliance with OSHA as criteria...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{present the}} result of a safety culture {{questionnaire}} within aircraft maintenance engineering, initially produced by Diaz-Cabrera et al. (2007) was developed and validated leading to a better result of seven factors. This safety culture questionnaire (SCQ) is further used as a tool to do a pilot assessment on the factors retrieved. The report ends with the implementation of literature distilled concepts about safety culture including the validated practical safety assessment tool leading to a complete SMS (Safety Management System) which is both reactive as proactive. To increase aviation safety it is compulsory, since the beginning of 2007, to report occurrences to the quality control. This directive is legislation on occurrence reporting in civil aviation from the European Union. The Occurrence reporting process was also regulated before by EASA Part 145. A. 60 although their specific purposes seem to differ. The purpose of the EASA set of regulation and the purpose of the EC regulation are different. The purpose of the EC regulation is to require Member States to put a system in place and to exchange data using the ECC-AIRS tool. The purpose of the EASA regulations on reporting is to ensure continuing airworthiness. It {{should be noted that the}} list of <b>reportable</b> <b>occurrences</b> are consistent between the EASA texts and the EC regulation. Therefore there are no plans to harmonize these requirements in a single one (EASA, 2006) Part A. 60 : “the organization shall report to the competent authority, the state of registry and the organization responsible for the design of the aircraft or the component. There is therefore no direct reporting to the Agency”. Although the purposes seem to differ because the EC-directive is primarily for benchmarking with other EU member states and the EASA regulation is to ensur...|$|R
40|$|In 2005, the NSLS proved itself, once again, to be {{a center}} of {{scientific}} excellence. This remarkable facility, commissioned in the early 1980 s, is still attracting some of the world's best researchers in almost every scientific field, who produce more than seven hundred scientific papers every year using the NSLS. The 'Science Highlights' and 'Feature Highlights' sections of this report are just a small sampling of the many, many impressive research projects conducted at the NSLS in 2005. For example, a user group synthesized and studied zinc-oxide nanowires, which have applications in many optical and electrical devices. Another user group studied how strontium and uranium are removed from high-level radioactive waste. And in another interesting study, users deciphered the basis for antibiotic resistance. However, as always, {{the success of these}} projects depends on the performance of the facility. Again this year, the rings were in top form [...] reliability was 96 percent for the x-ray ring and 99 percent for the VUV-IR ring. Additionally, to keep the NSLS as productive as possible and to continue to attract users, many beamline upgrade projects were completed this year. One of the highlights of these upgrades is the new mini-gap undulator installed at beamline X 25. This insertion device is providing a much brighter x-ray source for the program at X 25. In the always important area of safety, several noteworthy activities took place this year. In particular, NSLS staff made a major commitment to labeling and inspecting electrical equipment. And perhaps the best news is what didn't happen [...] there were no <b>reportable</b> <b>occurrences</b> related to environmental, safety, or health issues in 2005, and no injuries that resulted in restricted or lost time. We all owe thanks to the dedicated NSLS staff and users who have ensured that the NSLS remains a reliable, safe, up-to-date research facility. As 2005 came to an end, I stepped down as NSLS Chairman in order to focus my primary efforts on NSLS-II, the world-leading third-generation synchrotron planned for construction at BNL. NSLS-II passed a critical milestone in 2005 with the approval by the Department of Energy of CD- 0. BNL has established the NSLS-II Project Organization within the Light Sources Directorate to put in place the management systems and infrastructure necessary to execute this complex undertaking. I will serve as NSLS-II Project Director and also retain my position as Associate Laboratory Director for Light Sources, with the NSLS reporting to me. Another exciting development is the planned establishment of the Joint Photon Sciences Institute (JPSI). JPSI will be devoted to cultivating and fostering collaborative, interdisciplinary R&D in areas of the physical sciences, engineering, and the life sciences that are united in employing synchrotron-based methods. JPSI will also develop new methods and applications that exploit the unique capabilities of NSLS-II and will serve as a gateway for NSLS-II users. JPSI will be a partnership between the Department of Energy and New York State, and I am delighted that New York State Governor George Pataki has pledged $ 30 million for the construction of the JPSI building. The building will be located adjacent to NSLS-II and will contain offices, meeting rooms, and specialized laboratories. The operating expenses of JPSI and funding for its research programs will be provided by the federal government. Until a permanent NSLS Director is selected, NSLS User Science Division Associate Chair Chi-Chang Kao will serve as the Interim NSLS Director. I couldn't be leaving the facility in more capable hands. Chi-Chang will lead NSLS staff and users this year {{in the development of a}} five-year strategic plan for the NSLS, scheduled for completion by the end of summer 2006. The plan will outline the course for the future operation and development of the NSLS, and will help ensure that the future of the NSLS remains as bright as its past...|$|R
