5|$|The {{terms were}} {{transmitted}} to Germany on 12 November 1918, instructing {{them to make}} the High Seas Fleet <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> by 18 November, or the Allies would occupy Heligoland.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{what time}} {{they entered the}} straits, the Persians did not move to attack the Allies until daylight. Since they were not {{planning}} to flee after all, the Allies {{would have been able}} to spend the night preparing for battle, and after a speech by Themistocles, the marines boarded and the ships made <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 1804, President Jefferson {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} Preble's squadron. President, Congress, Constellation, and Essex prepared to sail {{as soon as}} possible under the direction of Commodore Samuel Barron. Barron selected President as his flagship, but she required a new bowsprit and repairs to her masts and rigging. Some two months passed before the squadron was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail.</b> They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12August.|$|E
50|$|As he was <b>readying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> on {{his second}} voyage he {{received}} a commission as ensign in the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment of the Continental Army in 1778.

5|$|A third frigate {{was visible}} on the horizon. Emerald {{immediately}} set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. The {{need to make the}} two captured frigates <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> delayed Leviathan, and by the time this was completed the third frigate had made her escape. Leviathan then returned to rendezvous with Emerald, managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell. The following day, both British vessels sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} months of 1918, the {{composition}} of Battleship Division Nine changed to reflect the lessons learned from operating in a war zone with the Grand Fleet. It soon became apparent that with only four ships, the division could not maintain the level of preparedness required by the constant need to be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> at limited notice. The inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced the squadron to three ships, a development considered unacceptable given the Division's important position {{at the tail end of}} the battle line. The British—faced with the same problem—responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons. In this way, each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired.|$|E
5|$|Little to {{no major}} {{modifications}} {{were made to}} the two active Colorados in the opening months of the U.S.'s entry into the war; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not be spared for any major yard work. Colorado was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar, splinter protection, 14 Oerlikon 20mm and four 1.1in light anti-aircraft guns; Maryland received a similar treatment later, the only difference being 16 20mm's and no 1.1in. Although tower masts were constructed for Colorado and Maryland and a majority of the old cage masts were cut down by the ships' crews in the beginning of 1942, the ships could not be spared the time needed to install the new masts. The tower masts were placed into storage and not used until early 1944.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} Daggett was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make <b>sail</b> again, {{he found his}} return round the {{headland}} was entirely cut off, by the field's having come in absolute contact with the rocks! ...|$|R
60|$|In this {{he succeeded}} {{so far as}} then seemed necessary, {{and when it was}} known that the fleet was nearly <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make <b>sail,</b> he came <b>to</b> Blackwall with all his {{belongings}} tied in his doublet.|$|R
500|$|By this time, the Allied {{naval forces}} in the area {{were aware of the}} raid, and were in a {{position}} to block the Austro-Hungarian retreat. Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton—the commanding officer of the Italian Scouting Division—ordered Mirabellos group southward at 04:35, while he embarked on the British light cruiser [...] By 06:45, the cruisers Dartmouth and —along with the Italian destroyers Mosto, Pilo, Schiaffino, Acerbi, and Aquila—were sailing north in an attempt to cut off the Austro-Hungarian cruisers. The Italian light cruiser , the flotilla leader Racchia, and the destroyers Insidioso, Indomito, and Impavido were <b>readying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> in support as well.|$|R
5|$|When news of {{the arrival}} of Duperré's {{squadron}} reached Decaen at Port Napoleon, he immediately despatched fast couriers to Grand Port and ordered Hamelin's squadron, consisting of the frigates Vénus, Manche, Astrée and the brig Entreprenant, to make <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> in support of Duperré. Hamelin departed Port Napoleon at midnight on 21 August, intending to sail northeast and then south, down the island's eastern shore. On 23 August, Hamelin's squadron spotted and captured a British transport ship named Ranger, sent 24 days earlier from the Cape of Good Hope with 300 tons of food supplies and extensive naval stores for Rowley on Île Bourbon. On rounding the northern headlands of Isle de France, however, Hamelin found he could make no progress against the headwinds and reversed direction, passing the western shore of the island and arriving off Grand Port at 1:00 pm on 27 August.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Algeciras on 9 July, the {{combined}} squadron was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> again on 12 July, departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening. The British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, having effected its own hasty repairs, {{set off in}} pursuit. Finding that his ships were falling behind, Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack {{the combined}} squadron as best they were able to. The fastest ship was HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless night fell. Superb fired on the rearmost ships, setting the 112-gun Real Carlos on fire and capturing the Saint Antoine. Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness, Real Carlos inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship San Hermenegildo, spreading the fire to its compatriot. Both ships subsequently exploded with enormous loss of life. A second stage of the battle then developed, as HMS Venerable took {{the lead of the}} British line, attacking the rearmost French ship Formidable under Captain Amable Troude. In a furious and protracted engagement, Venerable suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore, allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} in Europe {{rose in the}} aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar es Salaam on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe. Concurrently, the cruisers of the British Cape Squadron, , , and , arrived with the intention of bottling up Königsberg at the colony's capital Dar es Salaam. Looff got his ship <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship's superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day. Königsberg steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.|$|E
50|$|He <b>readied</b> her <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> Alexandria, {{but found}} himself {{blockaded}} by the British Siege of Malta. Carthaginoise remained in harbour until Malta capitulated to the British in September 1800. The British {{found that she}} had been stripped for firewood and so they decided to break her up.|$|R
25|$|Latouche-Tréville {{decided to}} have one ship or frigate patrol for three days outside the harbour, in rotation, while another would always be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> put <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> at the first signal. Furthermore, the entire {{squadron}} regularly scrambled to support the cruisers whenever superior British forces ventured into Toulon harbour, preventing the British from conducting useful reconnaissance of French activities in the area. Over the time, the squadron received three more ships {{of the line and}} three more frigates as reinforcements.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{they are}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail.</b> Bulldog tricks Number Four into going {{in search of}} his missing machete, then casts off without him. When Biscuit tries to stop him, Bulldog knocks him {{unconscious}} with an oar. Number Four tries to swim to the raft, but is killed by a shark.|$|R
5|$|On 6 March 1799, a French {{squadron}} had sailed from Rochefort. Consisting of the frigates Concorde, under Commodore Jean-François Landolphe, Médée, under Captain Jean-Daniel Coudin, and Franchise, under Captain Pierre Jurien, it was {{a powerful}} force, capable of inflicting significant damage on lightly defended merchant shipping. Eluding the blockade force off Rochefort, the squadron sailed southwards until it reached the coast of West Africa. There Landolphe's ships began an extended commerce raiding operation, inflicting severe damage on the West African trade {{during the rest of}} the year. Eventually the strain of serving in tropical waters told on the ships and all three were forced to undergo an extensive refit in the nearest available allied shipyards, which were located in the Spanish-held River Plate in South America. Repairs continued for six months, until Landolphe considered the squadron once again <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> in the early summer of 1800. The squadron almost immediately captured an American schooner, which it fitted out as a tender. At the time, France and the United States had been engaged for two years in the Quasi War.|$|E
5|$|When Roquebert's ships {{appeared}} off Grand Port, Hillyar had {{his three}} {{ships in the}} harbour <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> at short notice and ensured that French tricolours were flying from Île de la Passe and other landmarks {{in the hope that}} the French could be lured into the shallow waters of the bay and defeated in a similar manner to the British defeat at the battle at Grand Port the previous year. Signals were exchanged between the French squadron and the shore but Roquebert was wary: the signals from Île de la Passe were out of date and he knew of the British invasion from the Lisbon newspapers captured two months before. Waiting offshore, the French commodore sent three boats ashore during the night with instructions to discover the situation on the island. Seizing two black inhabitants, one of the boats returned on the morning of 7 May and from his captives Roquebert learned that the British had captured the island six months earlier. The other landing parties were captured by British troops and did not return. With Hillyar's trap uncovered, Roquebert raised French colours and turned eastwards away from Grand Port, Hillyar emerging from the harbour to give chase.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume's fleet {{remained}} off the Cape Derna for {{the next}} six days, performing repairs to the captured vessel to make it seaworthy. Detachments of sailors were taken from all of the ships in the squadron and transferred to the prize, and on 30 June Ganteaume's force was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> northwest once again, eventually reaching Toulon without further incident on 22 July. Ganteaume used the capture of Swiftsure to excuse the failure of his effort to reinforce Egypt, which was invaded and captured by a British expeditionary force {{in the spring and summer}} of 1801. While in captivity, Hallowell wrote a letter that was published in Britain praising the treatment he and his men had received while prisoners of war under Ganteaume, and he and his officers were released on parole the following month. On 18 August they faced a court martial on board HMS Genereux at Port Mahon in Menorca to investigate the loss of their ship, and were all honourably cleared of any blame. He was also praised for detaching the convoy, which otherwise might have also been lost. Hallowell subsequently returned to naval service in 1803 at the start the Napoleonic Wars, operating in the Caribbean and Mediterranean and eventually becoming a rear-admiral in 1811. Swiftsure, one of only five British ships of the line to be captured by the French during the entire war, was subsequently commissioned into the French Navy and remained in service {{for the next}} four years until recaptured at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E
60|$|At this place, my truly {{honest and}} pious clergyman left me; for a ship being <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail</b> for Lisbon, {{he asked me}} leave to go thither, but I assure you {{it was with the}} {{greatest}} reluctance I parted from a person, whose virtue and piety merited the greatest esteem.|$|R

50|$|In late 1805, eleven {{ships were}} <b>readied</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail</b> in two squadrons, one under Rear-Admiral Leissègues, {{and the other}} under Willaumez; the squadrons {{departed}} on 13 December and separated on 15. Willaumez' comprised the 80-gun flagship Foudroyant, the 74-gun Vétéran, Cassard, Impétueux, Éole and Patriote, and the 40-gun frigates Valeureuse and Volontaire. Its mission was <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> the Cape of Good Hope, replenish its water and provisions, harass British interests wherever opportune, and return no later than 15 months after.|$|R
25|$|Almeida {{was able}} to free the Arrogant Barcelones with a bail of $9,106, and within weeks he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> with a load of bread {{previously}} agreed on with U.S. Customs for shipment to Margarita.|$|E
25|$|In early 1918, Mihail Kogălniceanu was {{converted}} to a coastal monitor. Her bow was fitted with a breakwater, the distribution of her inner cargo was evened to prevent listing, her deck was made waterproof and more instruments required for sea navigation were brought from the cruiser Elisabeta. By the beginning of March 1918, the monitor was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> at sea.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January a {{messenger}} came by express from the Admiralty to Plymouth with orders for a fast sloop to be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> at a moment's notice with dispatches for the Straits. Weazle and Spitfire {{went out into}} the Sound, still very rough from a gale the previous night, to await orders. The dispatches arrived in the morning three days later and Weazle sailed immediately. Spitfires orders, however, did not come.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is all right," [...] he said. [...] "My craft {{is always}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail,</b> at an hour's notice, {{and if the}} wind holds fair I will land you on the French coast before nightfall. I see that your {{business}} is urgent, or {{you would not have}} put on disguises before leaving London. I suppose you have brought other clothes to land in?" ...|$|R
60|$|And now, having {{embarked}} his live-stock, fruits, vegetables, and water, {{the captain}} made <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail.</b> How much the honest man had suffered in spirit {{by what he}} considered the freaks and vagaries of his passengers, and how little he had understood their humors and intentions, is amusingly shown in a letter written to Mr. Astor from Woahoo, which contains his comments on the scenes we have described.|$|R
60|$|The {{leave-taking}} {{was of the}} briefest, {{for just}} then a loud halloo from his mate, or second in command, apprised the captain that all was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail.</b> But neither Penelope nor her husband were anxious souls or addicted to the melting mood. The square baby was rather more given to such conditions. In emulation of the mate it set up a sudden howl which sent its father away laughing to the harbour.|$|R
25|$|Based at Nouméa, New Caledonia, O'Bannon first escorted Copahee (CVE-12) on a run to Guadalcanal, {{where on}} 9October, twenty Marines flew their Grumman F4F Wildcats off Copahees decks, desperately needed as {{reinforcements}} at beleaguered Henderson Field. Through {{the remainder of}} the month, O'Bannon sailed the New Hebrides and southern Solomons on escort duty. On 7November at Nouméa, she joined Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan's Support Group, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> with a convoy carrying critical reinforcements, replacements, food, ammunition, and aviation material.|$|E
25|$|Kalanikupule and his generals then {{determined}} to attack Kamehameha's forces on Hawai'i. On January 3 the captured crew {{was put to}} work preparing the vessels for sea, and on January 11 they were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> for Hawai'i. Kalanikupule ordered all of the arms and ammunition to be loaded into the two captured vessels, {{along with all the}} captured crew, although he was advised by his general to divide them among the canoes. This proved to be a fatal mistake.|$|E
25|$|Kattegat {{was later}} {{salvaged}} by the Norwegian military, with 1,400 tons of diesel and 207 barrels of grease unloaded at Svolvær. On 15 May, before Kattegat was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> to Tromsø, she was bombed and damaged by a German aircraft. As the damaged ship still held 5,000 tons of oil, the local fishing boat fleet helped {{themselves to the}} cargo until the Germans arrived to retake the ship after the capitulation of mainland Norway in June. The short time Kattegat was in Norwegian hands she served under the name MT Bodø.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 {{under the}} care of Stichting Loggerbehoud Nederland a {{complete}} refit started again. She was going to be rebuilt under RH class for worldwide service, but the project was abandoned. In 2014 Dutch shipmaster Floris de Waard bought what remained of the Tradewind and started a complete overhaul of the ship, supported by sponsors like Register Holland and UB Sails. As of early 2015, the project is ongoing and the ship is expected <b>to</b> be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail</b> again in 2017.|$|R
50|$|The poem opens as the Greeks {{are getting}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail</b> back <b>to</b> Greece. The goddess Athena is wrathful {{because of the}} Greeks' impious {{behaviour}} in the sack of Troy (see Iliou persis). Agamemnon waits behind, to appease her; Diomedes and Nestor set sail straightaway, and reach home safely; Menelaus sets sail, but encounters a storm, loses most of his ships, lands in Egypt and is delayed there for several years. Other Greeks, including the prophet Calchas, go by land to Kolophon, where Calchas dies and is buried.|$|R
60|$|The Japonese, very happily for himself, met there Alvarez Vaz, just <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> set <b>sail</b> for Malacca. The Portuguese, {{who loved}} Anger, reproved {{him for his}} impatience, and offered to reconduct him to the place which he had so {{abruptly}} left; withall telling him, that, according to all appearances, the Father by this time was returned from the Moluccas. Anger, who still carried about him a troubled conscience, and thereby was easily induced to any proposition which tended to compose it, followed the advice of Vaz, and returned with him.|$|R
