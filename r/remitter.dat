40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn the {{treatment}} of major depressive disorder (MDD), it is not fully understood how individual symptoms improve over time (trajectory) in <b>remitters.</b> This study compared symptom improvement trajectories, as measured with the 17 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17), in <b>remitters</b> and nonremitters. MethodsThis analysis is based on 10 placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trials of duloxetine (40 – 60 mg/day) for treatment of MDD from baseline up to week 8. Remission {{was defined as a}} HAM-D 17 total score ≤ 7 at week 8 (last observation carried forward). Trajectories of HAM-D 17 items were assessed by mixed model repeated measures analysis for treatment and remitter-nonremitter comparisons. Grouping of the trajectories was performed by factor analysis. Predictor analysis using HAM-D 17 items was conducted by logistic regression. ResultsThere were 1555 patients in the duloxetine group (489 [31. 4 %] <b>remitters)</b> and 1206 patients in the placebo group (290 [24. 0 %] remitters; P<. 0001). For most items, the difference in trajectories between <b>remitters</b> and nonremitters appeared at early time points and increased over time. Treatment response trajectories were very similar for duloxetine and placebo <b>remitters,</b> while duloxetine nonremitters improved more than placebo nonremitters. For duloxetine <b>remitters,</b> we found 3 trajectory groups of HAM-D 17 items. The predictor analysis showed that improvement in 6 individual items at week 1 or 2 was significantly associated with remission at week 8. LimitationsGeneralizability of these results may be limited by the relatively short observation period used to define remission.

We examined whether cognitive and neurophysiological impairments on a performance-monitoring task distinguish between ADHD persisters and <b>remitters.</b> MethodsOn average 6 years after initial assessment, 110 {{adolescents and young}} adults with childhood ADHD (87 persisters, 23 <b>remitters)</b> and 169 age-matched control participants were compared on cognitive-performance measures and event-related potentials of conflict monitoring (N 2) and error processing (error-related negativity and positivity) from an arrow flanker task with low-conflict and high-conflict conditions. ADHD outcome was examined with parent-reported symptoms and functional impairment measures using a categorical (DSM-IV) and a dimensional approach. ResultsADHD persisters were impaired compared with controls on all cognitive-performance and event-related potential measures (all p <. 05). ADHD <b>remitters</b> differed from persisters and were indistinguishable from control participants on the number of congruent (low-conflict) errors, reaction time variability, error-related negativity, and error-related positivity (all p ≤. 05). <b>Remitters</b> did not differ significantly from the other groups on incongruent (high-conflict) errors, mean reaction time, and N 2. In dimensional analyses on all participants with childhood ADHD, ADHD symptoms and functional impairment at follow-up were significantly correlated with congruent errors, reaction time variability, and error-related positivity (r =. 19 –. 23, p ≤. 05).

40|$|Symptoms of {{attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children often persist into adulthood and can lead to severe antisocial behavior. However, to-date it remains unclear whether neuro-functional abnormalities cause ADHD, which in turn can then provide a marker of persistent ADHD. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in subjects during a reversal learning task in which choice of the correct stimulus led to a probabilistically determined ‘monetary’ reward or punishment. Participants were diagnosed with ADHD during their childhood (N[*]=[*] 32) and were paired with age, gender, and education matched healthy controls (N[*]=[*] 32). Reassessment of the ADHD group as adults resulted in a split between either persistent (persisters, N[*]=[*] 17) or remitted ADHDs (<b>remitters,</b> N[*]=[*] 15). All three groups showed significantly decreased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the left striatum during punished correct responses, however only <b>remitters</b> and controls presented significant psycho-physiological interaction between these fronto-striatal reward and outcome valence networks. Comparing persisters to <b>remitters</b> and controls showed significantly inverted responses to punishment (P[*]<[*] 0. 05, family-wise error corrected) in left PFC region. Interestingly, the decreased activation shown after punishment was located in different areas of the PFC for <b>remitters</b> compared with controls, suggesting that <b>remitters</b> might have learned compensation strategies to overcome their ADHD symptoms. Thus, fMRI helps understanding the neuro-functional basis of ADHD related behavior differences and differentiates between persistent and remittent ADHD...|$|R

We carried out a systematic literature review on the predictive value of neurocognitive functioning for future ADHD.

40|$|Background: Previous {{attempts}} to identify clinically useful predictors of treatment outcome in schizophrenia have been hampered by methodological inconsistencies, including {{a lack of}} standardized outcome measures. Recently proposed operationally defined criteria for remission {{provide an opportunity to}} readdress this topic. Method: We applied the remission criteria to a sample of 57 subjects with first-episode psychosis (DSM-IV schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder), treated according to a fixed protocol in a prospective study. Subjects were recruited between April 1999 and January 2000 and were followed for 2 years. Various demographic, baseline clinical, and early-response variables were subjected to discriminant analysis for their ability to predict remission or nonremission. We also assessed the symptom improvement patterns over time and compared endpoint psychopathology in the <b>remitters</b> and nonremitters. Results: A model incorporating neurologic soft signs, 6 -week treatment response, duration of untreated psychosis, marital status, and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale excited factor baseline score was able to correctly predict 89 % of the <b>remitters</b> and 86 % of the nonremitters. Symptom reduction at 6 weeks, including core psychotic symptoms, was significant in both groups (<b>remitters,</b> p <. 0001; nonremitters, p <. 0001), although reduction was substantially greater in the remission group (p =. 004). Thereafter, the remission group continued to improve (p <. 01), while the nonremitting group failed to do so (p =. 55). Considerable overlap of endpoint symptoms was observed, and depressive symptom scores were similar in <b>remitters</b> and nonremitters.

IGF-I levels were compared between patients and controls and between <b>remitters</b> and non-remitters with general linear model using age, gender, and {{body mass index}} as covariates. In patients, IGF-I levels were significantly higher at admission (p= 3. 29 E- 04) and in week 6 (p= 0. 002) compared to controls.

Glucose homeostasis, serum interleukin- 1 β, plasma gut hormones and adipokines, and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) ten-year cardiovascular risks were evaluated. The diabetes remission rate was significantly higher in GB than SG. Changes in the area under the curve (AUC) for glucose were greater in those with complete and partial remission after GB and <b>remitters</b> after SG than non-remitters after SG, whereas changes in AUC for C-peptide were higher in complete and partial <b>remitters</b> after GB than non-remitters after SG. Insulinogenic index was enhanced and serum interleukin- 1 β was reduced in complete <b>remitters</b> after GB and <b>remitters</b> after SG. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that insulinogenic index and interleukin- 1 β, not insulin resistance, were the factors determining the success of diabetes remission after metabolic surgeries. GB and SG significantly reduced the ten-year risk of coronary heart disease and fatal coronary heart disease in T 2 DM patients after surgery, while GB had the additional benefit of reduced stroke risk.

Thirty-three patients and 32 controls were phenotyped for serum concentrations of IFN-γ and IL- 10 and genotyped for functional polymorphisms of the IFN-γ and IL- 10 genes. Sixteen of 25 informative patients (63 %) remitted. Serum IFN-γ concentrations were significantly decreased in <b>remitters</b> but increased in non-remitters compared to controls, and did not change over time in any group.
