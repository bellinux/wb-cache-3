50|$|Grupo Clarín {{was listed}} in the Buenos Aires and London Stock Exchanges in 2007, upon which a 20% share in the group was made {{available}} to stockholders (leaving 9% for Goldman Sachs, and 71% for its private shareholders). The group's revenues in 2011 were accounted for mainly by its cable television units (principally Cablevisión and Multicanal), which accounted for 46% of sales, and by advertising revenues (22%).

50|$|For {{most of its}} {{tenure as}} an {{independent}} station, channel 56 was well behind WSBK-TV (channel 38) — which had exclusive <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>broadcasting</b> the games of the highly popular Boston Bruins, and was carried on almost every cable provider in New England — in the ratings. Still, it was carried on most cable providers throughout New England, and channel 56 did carry some sports programming of its own, including road games of the Boston Celtics from 1966 to 1969 and road telecasts of the Boston Bruins in 1966-67. It also carried telecasts of the World Hockey Association's New England Whalers (now the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes) from 1972 to 1974 (25 regular-season games during the 1972-73 season and 20 games during the 1973-74 season, some home and some away games broadcast each year). In early 1974, the station agreed to carry away games of the Boston Bulls of the World Football League and carry the TVS package of WFL games, but the franchise folded shortly thereafter. Nevertheless, the station (now WLVI) ghonored the contract they had signed with TVS to carry the WFL national package.|$|R
50|$|The archive holds {{approximately}} 16,000 titles: about 4,500 films, over 9,000 {{videos on}} various formats and roughly 600 DVDs are cataloged. The collection {{deals with a}} variety of Jewish subjects: Jewish history, the establishment of the State of Israel, immigration, Jewish communities in the Diaspora and the relationships between them and Israelis. The films come from diverse sources: primarily the WZO and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem but also other public bodies, such as the Jewish National Fund and private sources that either donate or deposit their films - mainly documentary filmmakers and their families. In addition, the archive possesses a number of collections deposited by various kibbutzim. The Steven Spielberg Archive holds the copyright for the films produced by its founding institutions - i.e., the WZO and the Hebrew University - and is authorized <b>to</b> sell user <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>broadcasting</b> and production companies and all other interested parties. The films are kept in temperature controlled vaults, facilitating their preservation, as much as possible, in optimal conditions. Movies can be watched on 16 mm and 35 mm viewing tables, and on video players in U-Matic, Betacam, VHS, DVCAM, Mini DV, Super VHS and Betamax.|$|R

Before 2001 no footage of any AFL games could be aired by the show as the rival Seven Network held the broadcast <b>rights</b> and refused <b>to</b> allow the show to air footage {{in an attempt to}} stall the program's success. From 2002 until 2006, Nine had the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> AFL broadcasts and footage was used liberally during the show. From 2007 they reverted to not using footage due to Nine having lost the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> AFL <b>broadcasting</b> <b>to</b> the Seven Network and Network Ten {{until the end of the}} 2011 football season. Footage is now used regularly since 2012 as Fox Footy now broadcast all of the AFL games every weekend.|$|R

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to revitalize the corporation, the Board of Directors {{appointed}} outside management {{in the form of}} CEO Michael Jordan, who brought in numerous consultants to help re-engineer the company in order to realize the potential that they saw in the broadcasting industry. Westinghouse reduced the work force in many of its traditional industrial operations and made further acquisitions in <b>broadcasting</b> <b>to</b> add to its already substantial Group W network, purchasing CBS in 1995. Shortly after, Westinghouse purchased Infinity Broadcasting, TNN, CMT, American Radio Systems, and <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> NFL <b>broadcasting.</b> These investments cost the company over fifteen billion dollars. To recoup its costs, Westinghouse sold many other operations. Siemens purchased non-nuclear power generation, while other firms bought the defense electronics, office furniture company Knoll, Thermoking, and residential security. With little remaining of the company aside from its broadcasting, Westinghouse renamed itself CBS Corporation in 1997.|$|R
50|$|However in a {{court ruling}} against Ofcom the station won the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} <b>broadcasting.</b> The ruling which was delivered just hours before the station's licence was due to expire, the judge held that the process was unfair and disproportionate. The regulator's decision was quashed and an extension of Blast 106's community radio licence was granted. After hearing submissions the judge sat to give his verdict just before the expiry deadline. He held that Ofcom ignored a request from Blast 106's solicitors for an oral hearing after learning the regulator's preliminary view. A decision was made not to consider sanctions over the alleged breach - which would have involved due process safeguards. That meant {{all that was left}} to consider was the station's application in January for an extension to its licence.|$|R
5|$|On 4 September, Mary Kom had {{its world}} premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it became the}} first Hindi film to be {{screened}} on the opening night of the film festival.

The <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> television <b>broadcasting</b> belonged <b>to</b> Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state {{would not be able to}} see her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{the station}} faced a new challenge: {{that of a}} new {{franchise}} round. Following the Broadcasting Act of the previous year, the allocation of regional franchises had changed to become a blind auction in which the franchise went to the highest bidder. This process was further complicated by a quality threshold, in which a higher bidder could be disqualified for having a poor business plan or if their high bid {{would result in a}} lack of funds for the programmes themselves. In the franchise round, Channel bid £1,000 (the lowest bid accepted) and were out-bid by challenge consortium CI3. This latter consortium, forming in part of ex-Channel employees, bid £102,000 and were disqualified as they failed to pass the quality threshold. Channel had won the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>broadcasting</b> beyond 1993. As another consequence of the franchise round, Channel began local news broadcasts during breakfast time as part of GMTV's new service.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} July 2007, RDS and the Montreal Canadiens {{extended}} their exclusive broadcasting rights contract through 2013. The deal included all of the Canadiens' 82 regular season games and all of their playoff games, if need be (none of this precludes CBC Sports from televising games in English as part of Hockey Night in Canada). Also, RDS had exclusive <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> French television <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> for the NHL All-Star Game and Skills Competition, {{as well as one}} NHL game per week that did not involve the Canadiens and a minimum of 40 playoff games for either RDS or RDS Info.

50|$|The Kempler {{video was}} shown three {{times on the}} Israeli TV Channel 2 in late December 1995, after it {{acquired}} the rights and edited it for broadcasting.

According to reports Kempler received $350,000 from the Israeli News Company and Yedioth Ahronoth, a major newspaper in Israel, for his video footage. The sum or {{most of it was}} recovered by selling the <b>rights</b> for <b>broadcasting</b> <b>to</b> other news agencies.|$|R
50|$|WNEV/WHDH had {{exclusive}} <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> Lottery Live, <b>broadcasting</b> the Massachusetts State Lottery games six {{nights a}} week from August 31, 1987, until March 6, 1994. Motivated to cultivate an identity to the station that would indirectly help its last-place news ratings, WNEV acquired the lottery from WBZ-TV, which had announced late in 1986 that {{it would no longer}} show the games. The arrival of the lottery games was promoted heavily, and went hand-in-hand with the station's on-air image change that fall; the new dotted-7 logo that was adopted during that time had a dual meaning, in that the dots were to represent lottery balls.|$|R
25|$|The 1957 VFL {{season was}} the first {{broadcast}} after the commencement of television in Australia (introduced in 1956 {{to coincide with the}} Melbourne Olympic Games). During the late 1950s and 1960s, all Melbourne stations (ABV2, HSV7, GTV9 and, after it commenced in 1965, ATV0/ATV10) broadcast some games. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the VFL was concerned that direct telecasts may affect attendances and stations were only permitted to telecast a delayed replay of the last quarter of games. In the 1980s, the Seven Network was given exclusive <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> VFL/AFL games. The only year Seven did not telecast games was 1987, when the rights were bought by Broadcom, which on-sold the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the Australian <b>Broadcasting</b> Corporation (ABC). The exclusive rights were won back by Seven in 1988.|$|R
40|$|In Federal Communications Commission v.
