50|$|After graduating, Barbe {{worked as}} a copywriter, though due to her poor spelling, she opted to read her first {{commercial}} out loud to her boss instead of submitting it in writing. He asked her to record the commercial herself. In 1963, she began recording messages for the Audichron Company, announcing time, temperature and weather, as well as recordings for early voice mail systems. In the 1970s and 1980s, she regularly <b>recorded</b> the <b>intercept</b> <b>messages</b> used when a number is disconnected or number dial errors, and started sharing recording duties with AT&T voice Pat Fleet in 1981, who eventually took over Barbe's role.|$|R
50|$|Captain Sisko {{receives}} a <b>recording</b> of an <b>intercepted</b> <b>message</b> - the few surviving Maquis terrorists {{who have not}} been wiped out by Cardassia's Dominion allies have launched a massive retaliatory missile strike against Cardassia. The missiles are believed to be equipped with cloaking devices, and unless they are stopped, Sisko fears the Dominion response will envelop the entire quadrant in all-out war. Sisko goes to Michael Eddington, former Starfleet officer turned Maquis leader, now in prison, who is likely the message's intended recipient. Eddington refuses to tell Sisko how to stop the missiles, so Sisko takes Eddington with him to compel him to help.|$|R

50|$|In {{almost any}} case, a {{telephone}} switch may {{be programmed to}} return a slow or fast busy signal instead of an <b>intercept</b> <b>message.</b> <b>Intercept</b> <b>messages</b> also often end with a coded identifier signifying which switch the message is being played by; this can be useful for diagnosing network problems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In sensor networks, correct clocks have {{arbitrary}} starting offsets and nondeterministic fluctuating skews. We {{consider an}} adversary that aims at tampering with the clock synchronization by <b>intercepting</b> <b>messages,</b> replaying <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages</b> (after the adversary’s choice of delay), and capturing nodes (i. e., revealing their secret keys and impersonating them). We present the first self-stabilizing algorithm for secure clock synchronization in sensor networks that is resilient {{to such an}} adversary’s attacks. Our algorithm tolerates random media noise, guarantees with high probability efficient communication overheads, and facilitates a variety of masking techniques against pulse-delay attacks {{in the presence of}} captured nodes...|$|R
50|$|It {{was known}} from an <b>intercepted</b> <b>message</b> dated 5 May 1944 that the IJA 2nd Area {{intelligence}} thought that next Allied landing {{would probably be}} on Biak, and a preliminary landing was made on 17 May at Wakde {{on the way to}} Biak. There a smaller airfield was available, which could be used as an advanced base until the Biak strips were ready. While initial G2 estimates of enemy troops was approximately 5,000, an <b>intercepted</b> <b>message</b> at the end of April gave the ration strength as 10,800, though it was thought this was a figure based upon projected, rather than, current strength.|$|R
50|$|Blencowe's son William Blencowe {{had been}} taught by her father, and he in time took on her father's role as the government's decoder of <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages.</b> William {{took his own life}} in 1712.|$|R
5000|$|Principle Department III: Intercept. Commanded by Senior Specialist Breuer. The {{department}} {{was responsible for}} intercept, including the actual intercept stations and initial sorting of <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages.</b> It consisted of over 200 personnel and two sections.|$|R
50|$|As of June 23, 2008, 10-digit dialing became {{mandatory}} across British Columbia; {{attempting to}} use seven digits would trigger an <b>intercept</b> <b>message</b> reminding callers {{of the new}} rule. After September 12, 2008, 7-digit dialing ceased to function.|$|R
5000|$|The Colossus {{computers}} {{were used to}} help decipher <b>intercepted</b> radio teleprinter <b>messages</b> that had been encrypted using an unknown device. Intelligence information revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems [...] "Sägefisch" [...] (sawfish). This led the British to call encrypted German teleprinter traffic [...] "Fish", and the unknown machine and its <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages</b> [...] "Tunny" [...] (tunafish).|$|R
50|$|The precise {{wording of}} <b>intercept</b> <b>messages</b> {{is left to}} the {{discretion}} of each local telephone company, except that most such messages nowadays start with one of several special information tones, standardized by Telcordia {{when it was still}} called Bellcore.|$|R
50|$|While the American {{aircraft}} were {{attacking the}} Japanese flattops, Yorktown and Lexington had been alerted by an <b>intercepted</b> <b>message</b> that {{indicated that the}} Japanese knew of their whereabouts and prepared to fight off a retaliatory strike, which came shortly after 11:00.|$|R
50|$|The second event also {{involved}} {{a failure to}} decipher intercepts. Starting in 1923, the Army began intercepting European and American diplomatic radio communications. Interception was difficult but the task of deciphering <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages</b> proved {{too much for the}} Army cryptanalysts.|$|R
50|$|Because {{encryption}} {{is performed}} using a probabilistic algorithm, a given plaintext may produce very different ciphertexts each time it is encrypted. This has significant advantages, as it prevents an adversary from recognizing <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages</b> by comparing them to a dictionary of known ciphertexts.|$|R
50|$|An <b>intercept</b> <b>message</b> is a {{telephone}} recording informing the caller that the call cannot be completed, {{for any of}} a number of reasons ranging from local congestion, to disconnection of the destination phone, number dial errors or network trouble along the route.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{customer}} moves and cancels their telephone service, an <b>intercept</b> <b>message</b> {{is often used}} even if no new number has replaced the old one. [...] The number you have reached, number, has been disconnected. No further information is available about number.|$|R
50|$|After {{completing}} another resupply mission, on 25 October, Trever {{had been}} expecting orders to bombard Japanese positions along Guadalcanal's coast. However, an <b>intercepted</b> <b>message</b> informed Lt. Cmdr. Agnew of Trever that three Japanese destroyers were approaching, apparently to bombard the airstrip at Henderson Field.|$|R

25|$|While {{the volume}} of {{messages}} was not great, Bletchley Park also <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages</b> from Tito and from the separate Slovene Communist Party to Georgi Dimitrov, the Secretary-General of the Comintern in Moscow.

We {{consider an}} adversary that aims at tampering with the clock synchronization by <b>intercepting</b> <b>messages,</b> replaying <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages</b> (after the adversary’s choice of delay), and capturing nodes (i. e., revealing their secret keys and impersonating them). We present an efficient clock sampling algorithm which tolerates attacks by this adversary, collisions, a bounded amount of losses due to ambient noise, and a bounded number of captured nodes that can jam, intercept, and send fake messages. The algorithm is self-stabilizing, so if these bounds are temporarily violated, {{the system can}} efficiently stabilize back to a correct state. Using this clock sampling algorithm, we construct the first self-stabilizing algorithm for secure clock synchronization in sensor networks that is resilient to the aforementioned adversarial attacks...|$|R

Almost overnight, they unravelled the keying system and then the machine pattern - with nothing but the <b>intercepted</b> <b>messages</b> in hand.
