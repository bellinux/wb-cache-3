Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5|$|Deodato also hired Perry Pirkanen {{and another}} actor from the Actors Studio to play Jack Anders and Alan Yates, respectively. The latter dropped out {{shortly before the}} {{production}} team left for the Amazon, although he appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates. Casting director Bill Williams subsequently chose Carl Gabriel Yorke to replace him for the role. Yorke, a stage actor who had studied under Uta Hagen and appeared in three national tours of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, was chosen {{in part because he}} was the <b>right</b> <b>size</b> for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because Cannibal Holocaust was a non-Union production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the alias Christopher Savage, but ultimately decided against doing so.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{float in}} the pelagic zone of the ocean with other {{plankton}} {{for three to four}} weeks, during which a large number of them are eaten by predators. The larvae pass through three to five zoea stages before moulting into the post-larval glaucothoe stage; this process takes from 25 to 33 days. Upon reaching the glaucothoe stage of development, they settle to the bottom, find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell, and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial hermit crabs. At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. Afterwards, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. As with all hermit crabs, they change their shells as they grow. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the <b>right</b> <b>size</b> often use broken coconut pieces. When they outgrow their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. The coconut crab reaches sexual maturity around five years after hatching. They reach their maximum size only after 40 to 60 years.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish word smörgåsbord {{consists}} of the words smörgås (sandwich, usually open-faced) and bord (table). Smörgås in turn {{consists of}} the words smör (butter, cognate with English smear) and gås. Gås literally means goose, but later referred to the small pieces of butter that formed and floated {{to the surface of}} cream while it was churned. These pieces reminded the old Swedish peasants of fat geese swimming to the surface. The small butter pieces were just the <b>right</b> <b>size</b> to be placed and flattened out on bread, so smörgås came to mean buttered bread. In Sweden, the term att breda smörgåsar (to spread butter on open-faced sandwiches) has been used since at least the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{certified}} scuba diver {{is expected}} to be able to assess what type of diving exposure suit is suitable for the planned dive, and to check that it is in safe usable condition, that it is the <b>right</b> <b>size,</b> and to dress correctly in it. Entry level skills usually cover wet suits, but in countries where the water and/or weather conditions are very cold, dry suit skills may be considered an entry level skill. In other parts of the world, dry suit skills are considered a specialty skill. Where dry suits are used, the skills of using the dry suit safely during a dive are also necessary. These include equalizing, buoyancy control, inversion recovery, emergency venting and blowup recovery. Recreational divers trained in warm tropical waters may have no skills in the use of diving suits.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To define right atrial {{appendage}} functional parameters and comparing them {{with those of}} left {{atrial appendage}}. Methods: A consecutive series of 154 patients (76 males and 78 females) with mean age of 42 years were referredfor transesophageal echocardiography. Ejection and filling velocities of right and left atrial appendages were measured at 120 and 70 degrees respectively. The left and <b>right</b> ventricles <b>size</b> and function, <b>right</b> atrial <b>size,</b> tricuspid regurgitation severity, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were prospectively measured and calculated during transthoracic echocardiography. Results: Mean right and left atrial appendages velocities were 42 ± 18 cm/s and 50 ± 26 cm/s respectively (PV< 0. 001). Statistically significant positive association (PV< 0. 001) was found between right atrial appendage velocity and right ventricle ejection fraction and statistically negative relationship was observed between right atrial appendage velocity and smoke pattern (PV< 0. 001). Also, the results suggested marginally significant associationsbetween right atrial appendage velocity and <b>right</b> atrium <b>size</b> (PV = 0. 05) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PV = 0. 07). It was also found that right atrial appendage measures were relatively independent on <b>right</b> ventricle <b>size</b> and tricuspid regurgitation severity. Conclusion: Our study showed right atrial appendage measures were relatively dependent on right ventricle function, <b>right</b> atrium <b>size</b> and pulmonary artery systolic pressure and relatively independent on <b>right</b> ventricle <b>size</b> and tricuspid regurgitation severity. In patients with right atrium smoky pattern right atrial appendage velocitywas significantly reduced...|$|R

25|$|A {{terrestrial}} {{planet of the}} <b>right</b> <b>size</b> is needed to retain an atmosphere, like Earth and Venus. On Earth, once the giant impact of Theia thinned Earth's Atmosphere other events were {{needed to make the}} atmosphere capable of sustaining life for a long time span. On Earth the Late Heavy Bombardment reseeded Earth with water lost after the impact of Theia. The development of an ozone layer formed protection from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are needed in a correct ratio for life to form. Nitrogen is needed for amino and nucleic acids. Lightning is needed for nitrogen fixation to happen. The carbon dioxide gas needed for life comes from sources such as volcanoes and geysers. Carbon dioxide is only needed at low levels, in Earth's atmosphere it is at 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume of the atmosphere. At high levels carbon dioxide is poisonous. Precipitation is needed to have a stable water cycle. A proper atmosphere must reduce temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).|$|E

The gas station {{does not have the}} <b>right</b> <b>size</b> fan belt, so they follow Bo to his house. Inside, Wade is knocked out by Bo's twin brother, Vincent, who is wearing a wax mask to cover his disfigured face. Outside, Carly realizes Bo is the one who visited them the night before, after noticing his car's broken headlight. She runs to the church for help, but finds out that it is populated only by wax sculptures. Bo captures Carly and brings her to the cellar of the gas station, where she is restrained and her lips are glued. Meanwhile, Vincent strips Wade naked and straps him to a chair, where he is both injected and covered in molten wax.|$|E

Playtex was founded in 1947 as one of four divisions ILC re-organized into. Its name was a portmanteau of [...] "play" [...] and [...] "latex", reflecting its focus on latex products. Playtex's marketing in the post-war era was influential in creating the shift from custom-tailored undergarments to manufactured sizes.

Subsequent actors who portrayed a young Jason include Timothy Burr Mirkovich in Jason Takes Manhattan and Spencer Stump in Freddy vs. Jason. The adult role of Jason Voorhees has been played by various actors, some not credited, others taking great pride in their parts. Due to the physical demands the adult character requires, and the lack of emotional depth depicted, many of the actors since have been stuntmen. The most well-known among them is Kane Hodder, who is cited as the best to play the role.|$|E

At 25% of the total adult size, the juvenile show that crest growth of Parasaurolophus began sooner than in related genera, such as Corythosaurus. It has been suggested that Parasaurolophus adults bore such large crests, especially when compared to the related Corythosaurus, because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing. Its age also means that Parasaurolophus had a very fast growth rate, which took place in about a year. The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults, but low and hemispherical.|$|E
