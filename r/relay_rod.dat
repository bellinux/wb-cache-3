25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the <b>relay</b> <b>rod</b> at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{reliability}} of aerospace relay directly influences the {{reliability of}} the whole system. The analysis and research on the optimum position of aerospace <b>relay's</b> pushing <b>rod</b> are an important process of aerospace relay reliability design. In the past, most researches were done for electromagnetic systems and spring systems of aerospace relays. However, there was not any research on the position of the pushing rod. An analytical method for the optimum position of aerospace <b>relay's</b> pushing <b>rod</b> is presented in this paper. From four aspects, including the electromagnetic force and torque, work done by the electromagnetic force and displacement, the optimum position of a pushing rod is investigated based on the analysis of a straight spring system. The conclusions can be used to direct the optimum design and assembling of aerospace relays...|$|R
40|$|Rod {{signals in}} the {{mammalian}} retina {{are thought to}} reach ganglion cells over the circuit rod [...] >rod depolarizing bipolar cell [...] >AII amacrine cell [...] >cone bipolar cells [...] >ganglion cells. A possible alternative pathway involves gap junctions linking the rods and cones, the circuit being rod [...] >cone [...] >cone bipolar cells [...] >ganglion cells. It {{is not clear whether}} this second pathway indeed <b>relays</b> <b>rod</b> signals to ganglion cells. We studied signal flow in the isolated rabbit retina with a multielectrode array, which allows the activity of many identified ganglion cells to be observed simultaneously while the preparation is stimulated with light and/or exposed to drugs. When transmission between rods and rod depolarizing bipolar cells was blocked by the glutamate agonist 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyric acid (APB), rod input to all On-center and briskly responding Off-center ganglion cells was dramatically reduced as expected. Off responses persisted, however, in Off-center sluggish and On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells. Presumably these responses were generated by the alternative pathway involving rod-cone junctions. This APB-resistant pathway may carry the major rod input to Off-center sluggish and On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{ion channel}} HCN 1 (hyperpolarisation-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel- 1) is {{expressed}} in photoreceptors of the mammalian retina. The central conclusion {{of the present study}} says that HCN 1 in rods counteracts saturation of light responses by bright light stimuli. The mammalian retina works in an intensity range that covers ten orders of magnitude. This task is achieved by two photoreceptors. The very sensitive rods are optimized for scotopic (night) vision, the less sensitive cones for photopic (day) vision. Cones relay their information via bipolar cells to the ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina. Rods feed their signals into the cone network at multiple sites. Using the patch-clamp technique, I recorded in vitro light responses of ganglion cells from retinae of normal (wild type) mice and of mice, in which the gene encoding HCN 1 had been knocked out (K. O.). Recordings were performed under different states of adaptation with contribution of only rods (scotopic), only cones (photopic), or both rods and cones (mesopic) to the light responses. Flicker stimuli of different frequencies were applied and current or voltage responses were recorded. Under scotopic and photopic conditions, no major differences were observed between light responses from wild type and from HCN 1 K. O. retinae. In both retinae, ganglion cell responses followed flicker stimuli equally well. Under mesopic conditions, light intensity was chosen such that rod responses saturated. In wild type retinae, light responses of ganglion cells were similar to those under photopic conditions. In contrast, in HCN 1 knock-out retinae light responses of ganglion cells could not even follow flicker stimuli of low frequencies. Cells responded as if they were saturated by bright and long lasting light stimuli. A second mouse line was used in which in addition the gene encoding the visual pigment of rods, rhodopsin, was knocked out. These mice have no functional rods. In those retinae, despite the absence of HCN 1 no saturation of light responses was observed. It is the task of HCN 1 in rods to counteract saturation and thus, to enable vision under mesopic conditions. First experiments were performed to analyze the pathways that <b>relay</b> saturating <b>rod</b> responses to the retinal network...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} the P 23 H line 1 {{homozygous}} albino rat to study how progressive photoreceptor degeneration affects <b>rod</b> and cone <b>relay</b> pathways. We examined P 23 H retinas {{at different stages of}} degeneration by confocal microscopy of immunostained sections and electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. By 21 days of age in the P 23 H rat retina, there is already substantial loss of rods and reduction in rod bipolar dendrites along with reduction of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR 6) and rod-associated bassoon staining. The cone pathway is relatively unaffected. By 150 days, when rods are absent from much of the retina, some rod bipolars remain and dendrites of rod and cone bipolar cells form synaptic complexes associated with cones and horizontal cell processes. These complexes include foci of mGluR 6 and bassoon staining; they develop further by 270 days of age. Over the course of degeneration, beginning at 21 days, bipolar axon terminals atrophy and the inner retina undergoes further changes including a reduced and disorganized AII amacrine cell population and thinning of the inner plexiform layer. Electroretinogram (ERG) results at 23 days show reductions in a-wave amplitude, in rod and cone-associated b-waves (using a double flash paradigm) and in the amplitude of oscillatory potentials (OPs). By 38 days, rod scotopic a-wave responses and OPs are lost. B-wave amplitudes decline until 150 days, at which point they are purely cone-driven and remain stable up to 250 days. The results show that during the course of photoreceptor loss in the P 23 H rat, there are progressive degenerative changes, particularly in the <b>rod</b> <b>relay</b> pathway, and these are reflected in the changing ERG response patterns. Later reactive changes involving condensation of cone terminals and neurotransmitter receptors associated with rod and cone bipolar dendrites and with horizontal cell processes suggest that at this stage, there are likely to be complex changes in the relay of sensory information through the retina.
