Heidegger {{believed}} that Dasein’s efforts to understand himself ought to lead to interpreted truths about himself and, in turn, Dasein being exactly who he is {{with others in the}} world. Heidegger postulated that authenticity would lead to better relationships and enrich human experience. However, authenticity is more than just honest interaction and being who one is. For Heidegger, authenticity is also a sense of richer and fuller participation with others. If human interactions produce rich and full outcomes, and are appropriate to the context and situation of the relationship, then they are authentic. Authenticity is not just a mere mindset, it is a relational phenomenon. Anything that Dasein offers in his relationships, verbal or non-verbal, inviting or antagonistist, is authentic only because it is arising out of a particular relationship. That means that the perspectives or opinions that he shares, and the behaviors he demonstrates, are done so because of a particular relationship with a particular person and in that particular place and time.|$|E
25|$|Lysaker & Lysaker {{explained}} that Bakhtin theorized {{of human beings}} as entities composed of a multiplicity of voices (self-as-father, self-as-son, self-as-student, self-as-teacher, self-as-sad, self-as-happy, self-as-pro-life) that are in constant flux within him as he dialogues with and relates to the world around him. These voices constantly arrange and re-arrange themselves in hierarchies that are not governed by an overarching ego. Each hierarchy of voices (roles and dispositions) constitutes a dialogical position. Lysaker & Lysaker use the term dialogical positions because they are exactly the positions (roles and dispositions) Dasein takes {{up in the world}} when interacting with and relating to others—-and are constituted by his polyphonic nature. The flux, or re-arrangement, occurs from situational contexts that tells Dasein which dialogical position, or set of voices, must come to the foreground. The flux is also based on increased understanding of the world around human beings and their respective roles in it. Hermeneuts {{say that this is a}} stark contrast to mainstream paradigms in psychotherapy. Instead of a single ego, or voice, that makes up a person's identity and stands above and against the world, a constantly-rearranging hierarchy of multiple voices dialogues with others and co-constitutes a person's identity, and that this is the reason that Taylor writes that we should abandon paradigms such as the self as a highly autonomous individual and re-conceptualize that self as a dialogical self that is always-already a <b>relational</b> <b>being</b> constantly engaged in multiple ongoing conversations.|$|E

25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to accomplish {{what they need to}} do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably <b>relational</b> <b>beings.</b> That human beings exist in-the-world as radically <b>relational</b> <b>beings</b> ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot be thought of as merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is this understanding of himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|R

Thus, a unified explanation for lowering one's thermostat (a form of environmental action) {{and participating in}} mass protest (a form of collective action) is lacking. Building on a broad literature that views humans as <b>relational</b> <b>beings,</b> I aim to show that (a) a relational perspective synthesizes these two perspectives by reconceptualizing environmental and collective action as types of social interaction that regulate social relationships and (b) therefore, environmental and collective action have a similar motivational profile. This implies that both collective and environmental action are ultimately relational phenomena; that any assumption that environmental action is motivated by individualistic concerns and collective action by collectivistic concerns, limits our understanding of either type of action; and that future theorizing and research on environmental and collective action will benefit from adopting a relational perspective...|$|R

[...] He is also known for his comment [...] "I am linked therefore I am" [...] as an answer to Descartes' proposition [...] "I think, therefore I am". Most of these developments are summarized in <b>Relational</b> <b>Being,</b> Beyond the Individual and Community, which attempts to demonstrate that what are considered mental processes are not so much [...] "in the head" [...] as in relationships.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{critical}} reflection {{on one of}} the most widely discussed topics within the theoretical debate in the humanities and social sciences over the last two centuries: the relational dimension; that is, on the one hand, the intersubjective component that encourages and accompanies the maturation of identity and awareness and, on the other, the “complex dimension" of mind/body connection that characterizes human experience moment by moment. This paper examines concepts such as "here and now", "awareness", "mind/body connection" that define our being-in-the-world as <b>relational</b> <b>beings.</b> It discusses, then, the pedagogical salience of these aspects in the fields of education and teacher training.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 Oceania PublicationsThis {{paper is}} an {{exploration}} of the nature of personhood through the medium of the concept of piot in the Lihir islands, Papua New Guinea. Piot is an embodied experience in response to the movement of others in space. When people leave or arrive at a place and spend the night, others in the area feel unwell. Piot is thus one aspect of the relations between persons. I suggest that ideas of relational personhood are inadequate to fully comprehend piot, and, following LiPuma (1998) and Clay (1986) rather than Strathern (1988), argue that persons in Lihir are more than just <b>relational</b> <b>beings</b> who always act with others in mind. Piot is predicated on the dual themes of fixed sociality and mobility that are important in Lihir as elsewhere in Melanesia (cf Eves 1998; Patterson 2002).

5000|$|There {{are some}} notable {{individuals}} that have, {{and continue to}} make a large impact on theoretical psychology. Jerome Kagan's (1971) work on personality traits and aging, emotion, and temperament could be considered theoretical psychology due to Kagen dedicating much of his work to psychology constructs, specifically to the developmental psychology. As a science gains new empirical procedures it also generates new information. Donald Meichenbaum (1977) had work that focused on cognitive behavioral therapy. Meichenbaum did {{the majority of his}} work in the field of cognitive psychology. He compared his theory to Pandora's box. Its main focus is connecting cognitive processes and relations to things such as clients' feelings, behavior, and consequences of these. It also factors in physiologic and social cultural processes. Alan E. Kazdin (1980) had theories that focuses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a style in children and adolescence. He focuses on child and adolescent psychopathologies such as depression and conduct problems. His writings on research strategies and methods have set a high standard for rigor in the field. Robert Sternberg's (1990) main focus revolves around some theoretical idea that include; creativity, wisdom, thinking styles, love, and hate. Sternberg often includes politically charged articles that focus on admissions testing and general intelligence. He performed both empirically driven and theoretical work. [...] Kenneth J. Gergen's (1991) work on social psychology as history was used towards generative theories, realities and relationships, the saturated self, positive aging, and <b>relational</b> <b>being.</b> He included many theoretical ideas such as culture and science, assumptions, views on mental illness, and relations. Many of his idea's were theoretical in nature. Ulric Neisser(1995) has work thats related to cognitive psychology, specifically the idea of flashbulb memories. Although he used empirical data to test this idea, he originally took the concept from theoretical work. [...] These individual's and many others continue to impact psychology with theoretical ideas {{that may or may not}} be yet supported by empirical data.|$|E

Using the social construction of masculinity and college men gender identity theory as theoretical frameworks to guide this study, I sought to attain a clearer understanding of the experiences of men who study abroad as these experiences related to their masculinity identity. Eight men participated in three in-depth interviews through which data for this study were collected. The data were coded, analyzed, and organized into four emerging themes: a) Expressing Masculinity, (b) Men 2 ̆ 7 s Unfamiliarity with Themselves as Men, (c) Men as <b>Relational</b> <b>Beings,</b> and (d) Study Abroad as a Pathway to Change. The findings revealed that the males in this study expressed their masculinity through competitiveness, in particular through academics and sports; being strong; and defining success personally. The men 2 ̆ 7 s unfamiliarity with themselves as men was apparent from their limited awareness of their gender identity, the blurring of societal and personal beliefs about gender, and the notion of gender as a female occurrence. Men as <b>relational</b> <b>beings</b> was evident from the participants 2 ̆ 7 desire for connection and to find one 2 ̆ 7 s place, the vital role of family, and the men 2 ̆ 7 s fear of being alone.
