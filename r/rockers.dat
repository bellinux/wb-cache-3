He was once again teamed with Marty Jannetty, billed as The Midnight <b>Rockers.</b> The Midnight <b>Rockers</b> won the AWA World Tag Team Championship, {{defeating}} Doug Somers and Buddy Rose.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Rockers</b> redebuted at a WWF live {{event on}} July 7, 1988. Due to WWF {{chairman}} Vince McMahon's {{desire to have}} his performers carry WWF-exclusive ring names, Michaels and Jannetty were renamed, as simply The <b>Rockers.</b> The team proved popular with both children and women and was a mid-card stalwart of television and pay-per-view shows {{for the next two}} years. During this time, Michaels headlined his first pay-per-view for the WWF when The <b>Rockers</b> were involved in the 4-on-4 Survivor Series match main event of the 1989 Survivor Series.|$|E

50|$|A <b>rocker</b> sole shoe or <b>rocker</b> bottom shoe is a shoe {{which has}} a thicker-than-normal sole with rounded heel. Such shoes ensure the wearer does not have flat footing along the proximal-distal axis of the foot. The shoes are generically known {{by a variety of}} names {{including}} round bottom shoes, round/ed sole shoes, and toning shoes, but also by various brand names. Tyrell & Carter identified at least six standard variations of the <b>rocker</b> sole shoe and named them: toe-only <b>rocker,</b> <b>rocker</b> bar, mild <b>rocker,</b> heel-to-toe <b>rocker,</b> negative heel <b>rocker</b> and double <b>rocker.</b>|$|R
50|$|The primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> arm {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the {{oil pressure}} {{flowing from the}} exhaust <b>rocker</b> shaft into the primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> arm forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> arm, thereby locking both exhaust <b>rocker</b> arms together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> arm alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both exhaust <b>rocker</b> arms together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake <b>rocker</b> shaft, except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary <b>rocker</b> arm.|$|R
5|$|In the WWF/WWE, Michaels headlined major {{pay-per-view}} events between 1989 and 2010, {{closing the}} company's flagship annual event, WrestleMania, five times.

Michaels also wrestled in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), where he founded The Midnight <b>Rockers</b> with Marty Jannetty in 1985. After winning the AWA Tag Team Championship twice, the team continued to the WWF as The <b>Rockers</b> and had a high-profile breakup in January 1992. Within the year, Michaels would twice challenge for the WWF Championship and win his first Intercontinental Championship, heralding his arrival {{as one of the}} industry's premier singles stars.|$|E
5|$|Paul Roma began feuding with The <b>Rockers</b> (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) {{during the}} July 21, 1990, episode of WWF Superstars. Roma was {{attacked}} after a match by Dino Bravo; when The <b>Rockers</b> {{came to the}} ring for the following match, Roma accused them of attacking him. The argument turned physical, and Roma was backed up by Hercules. One week later, Roma and Hercules appeared on the Brother Love Show, an interview segment, and announced that they had formed a tag team known as Power and Glory. A match between the two teams was later scheduled for SummerSlam.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, The <b>Rockers</b> {{were signed}} by a {{competing}} promotion: the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

5|$|Prior to teaming with Rex King, Steve Doll {{competed in}} Pacific Northwest Wrestling with partner Scott Peterson as the Southern <b>Rockers.</b> The team was {{fashioned}} after The Rock 'n' Roll Express, and Doll and Peterson held the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship together seven times. In 1989, Doll replaced Peterson with King. They won the tag team title by defeating Scotty the Body and The Grappler on August 26.

Power and Glory's team won the match, during which Roma eliminated Michaels after performing a PowerPlex with Hercules.|$|E

5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of incorporating VTEC {{for both the}} intake and exhaust valves in a SOHC engine has been removed on the J37A4 by a novel design of the intake <b>rocker</b> arm. Each exhaust valve on the J37A4 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> arm. Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> arms and twelve secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> arms. However, each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> arm is shaped similar to a [...] "Y" [...] which allows it to contact two intake valves at once. One primary intake <b>rocker</b> arm corresponds to each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> arm. As {{a result of this}} design, there are only six primary intake <b>rocker</b> arms and six secondary intake <b>rocker</b> arms.|$|R

5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used <b>rockers</b> to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
