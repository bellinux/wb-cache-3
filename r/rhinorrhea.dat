25|$|Azelastine {{nasal spray}} is {{indicated}} {{for the local}} treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis, such as <b>rhinorrhea,</b> sneezing and nasal pruritus in adults and children 5 {{years of age and}} older. In some countries, it is also indicated for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in adults and children ≥ 12 years old. Azelastine eyes drops are indicated for the local treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|If later {{exposure}} to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held {{on the surface of}} the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule, and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth muscle contraction. This results in <b>rhinorrhea,</b> itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, allergen, and mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems; asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the dermis.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), <b>rhinorrhea</b> (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E
2500|$|Before Ommaya’s work, CSF <b>rhinorrhea</b> was {{classified}} as either traumatic or spontaneous.

Ommaya classified non-traumatic <b>rhinorrhea</b> as resulting from either high pressure leaks (tumors and hydrocephalus) or [...] "normal" [...] leaks (congenital abnormalities, focal atrophy, oysteomyelitis). Non-traumatic <b>rhinorrhea</b> is a challenge in diagnosis and choice of surgical approach. Of importance to successful surgical outcome is the demonstration of fistula.

In the systemic reactions can also be included severe reactions like dizziness, drowsiness, chills and collapse as {{has been reported in}} patients after ingestion of a falafel burger.|$|E
2500|$|According to its advocates, nasal {{irrigation}} promotes good sinus and nasal health. Patients {{with chronic}} sinusitis including symptoms of facial pain, headache, halitosis, cough, anterior <b>rhinorrhea</b> (watery discharge) and nasal congestion are reported often to find nasal irrigation to provide relief. In published studies, [...] "daily hypertonic saline nasal irrigation improves sinus-related quality of life, decreases symptoms, and decreases medication use {{in patients with}} frequent sinusitis", and irrigation is recommended as an adjunctive treatment for chronic sinonasal symptoms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rhinorrhea</b> or rhinorrhoea is a {{condition}} where the nasal cavity is filled with {{a significant amount of}} mucus fluid. The condition, commonly known as a runny nose, occurs relatively frequently. <b>Rhinorrhea</b> is a common symptom of allergies (hay fever) or certain diseases, such as the common cold. It can be a side effect of crying, exposure to cold temperatures, cocaine abuse or withdrawal, such as from opioids like methadone. Treatment for <b>rhinorrhea</b> is not usually necessary, but {{there are a number of}} medical treatments and preventive techniques available.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rhinorrhea</b> {{can occur}} as a symptom of opioid {{withdrawal}} accompanied by lacrimation. Other causes include cystic fibrosis, whooping cough, nasal tumors, hormonal changes, and cluster headaches.

50|$|If {{caused by}} a head injury, <b>rhinorrhea</b> can {{be a much more}} serious condition. A basilar skull {{fracture}} can result in a rupture of the barrier between the sinonasal cavity and the anterior cranial fossae or the middle cranial fossae. This rupture can cause the nasal cavity to fill with cerebrospinal fluid. This condition, known as cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea or CSF <b>rhinorrhea,</b> can lead to a number of serious complications and possibly death if not addressed properly.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rhinorrhea</b> can be {{a symptom}} of other diseases, such as the common cold or influenza. During these infections, the nasal mucous {{membranes}} produce excess mucus, filling the nasal cavities. This is to prevent infection from spreading to the lungs and respiratory tract, where it could cause far worse damage. It has also been suggested that <b>rhinorrhea</b> {{is a result of}} viral evolution, and may be a response that is not useful to the host, but which has evolved by the virus to maximise its own infectivity. <b>Rhinorrhea</b> caused by these infections usually occur on circadian rhythms. Over the course of a viral infection, sinusitis (the inflammation of the nasal tissue) may occur, causing the mucous membranes to release more mucus. Acute sinusitis consists of the nasal passages swelling during a viral infection. Chronic sinusitis occurs when one or more nasal polyps appear. This can be caused by a deviated septum as well as a viral infection.|$|E

50|$|Nose-blowing {{may be used}} to {{alleviate}} nasal congestion or <b>rhinorrhea</b> (runny nose). A 2000 study showed that nose-blowing produces a high degree of pressure in the nasal cavities and may worsen a cold by propelling nasal mucus into the paranasal sinuses.|$|E
5000|$|People {{who prefer}} to keep clear nasal passages, such as singers, who need a clear nasal passage to perform, may use a {{technique}} called [...] "nasal irrigation" [...] to prevent <b>rhinorrhea.</b> Nasal irrigation involves rinsing the nasal cavity regularly with salty water or store bought saline solutions.|$|E
