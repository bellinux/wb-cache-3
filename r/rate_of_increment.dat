Compared to normal patients, both essential and borderline hypertensive patients had a shorter average duration of exercise test (ie, a decreased exercise capacity), always negative for transient myocardial ischemia. This was in spite <b>of</b> a mild <b>increment</b> <b>of</b> maximal RPP (+ 19 % and + 10 % v normal patients, respectively).

Daily periodicity <b>of</b> growth <b>increments</b> was corroborated by staining the stylets either with oxytetracycline or tetracycline and comparing the number of rings produced with the elapsed days. A total of 19 individuals (10 males and 9 females, 680 to 1470 g body weight) were marked with oxyetracycline injections at Vigo (mean of 124 mg oxytetracycline per Kg of octopus) and 6 individuals (1 male and 5 females, 248 to 570 g body weight) were stained with tetracycline injections at Naples (mean of 120 mg/Kg). The animals were successfully maintained in captivity until sacrificed for up to 6 (1 specimen), 9 (1 specimen), 18 (6 specimens from Naples) and 21 (17 specimens) days. Transverse stylet sections were embedded in thermo-plastic resin and polished until a thin and translucent section was achieved. Several sections of each stylet were prepared and photographed. Increments were counted 3 - 5 times by two different readers. Increments counts for each stylet were analysed and outliers excluded using statistical methods.

BACKGROUNDPatients with syndrome X have angina pectoris and exercise induced ST segment depression on the electrocardiogram despite normal coronary angiograms. Increasing evidence suggests that myocardial ischemia is uncommon in these patients. Altered potassium metabolism causing interstitial potassium accumulation in the myocardium may be an alternative mechanism for chest pain and ST segment depression in syndrome X. METHODSWe compared the magnitude of exercise-induced hyperkalemia in 16 patients with syndrome X (12 female and four male, mean ± SD age 53 ± 6 years) and 15 matched healthy control subjects. The participants underwent a bicycle test at a fixed load of 75 W for 10 min, and blood samples were taken for analysis of potassium, catecholamines and lactate before, during and in the recovery period after exercise. In five patients with syndrome X, the test was repeated during alpha 1 adrenoceptor blockade. RESULTSBaseline concentrations of serum potassium, plasma catecholamines and plasma lactate were similar in patients and control subjects. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> exercise-induced <b>increment</b> <b>of</b> serum potassium was increased in the patients (70 ± 29 vs. 30 ± 21 μmol/liter/min in control subjects, p < 0. 001). Six patients, who stopped before 10 min of exercise, showed very rapid increments in serum potassium concentration. Compared to the control subjects, patients also demonstrated larger increments in rate–pressure product, plasma norepinephrine and lactate concentrations during exercise. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> serum potassium <b>increment</b> correlated with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> plasma norepinephrine <b>increment</b> in the patients (r = 0. 63, p < 0. 02), but not in the control subjects (r = 0. 01, p = 0. 97). Blockade of alpha 1 adrenoceptors decreased systolic blood pressure at baseline, but did not influence the <b>increment</b> <b>of</b> serum potassium, plasma catecholamines and lactate.

40|$|We {{designed}} a behavioural paradigm for vibro-tactile detection to characterise the sampling time {{and performance in}} the rat whisker sensory system. Rats initiated a trial by nose-poking into an aperture where their whiskers {{came into contact with}} two meshes. A continuous nose-poke for a random duration triggered stimulus presentation. Stimuli were a sequence of discrete Gaussian deflections of the mesh that increased in amplitude over time - across 5 conditions, time to maximum amplitude varied from 0. 5 to 8 seconds. Rats indicated the detected stimulus by choosing between two reward spouts. Two rats completed more than 500 trials per condition. Rats' stimulus sampling duration increased and performance dropped with increasing task difficulty. For all conditions the median reaction time was longer for correct trials than incorrect trials. Higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increment</b> in stimulus amplitude resulted in faster rise in performance as a function of stimulus sampling duration. Rats' behaviour indicated a dynamic stimulus sampling whereby nose-poke was maintained until a stimulus was correctly identified or the rat experienced a false alarm.

40|$|Lutzomyia spinicrassa is a vector of Leishmania braziliensis in Colombia. This {{sand fly}} has a broad {{geographical}} distribution in Colombia and Venezuela {{and it is}} found mainly in coffee plantations. Baseline biological growth data of L. spinicrassa were obtained under experimental laboratory conditions. The development time from egg to adult ranged from 59 to 121 days, with 12. 74 weeks in average. Based on cohorts of 100 females, horizontal life table was constructed. The following predictive parameters were obtained: net <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> reproduction (8. 4 females per cohort female), generation time (12. 74 weeks), intrinsic <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> population increase (0. 17), and finite <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> population <b>increment</b> (1. 18). The reproductive value for each class age of the cohort females was calculated. Vertical life tables were elaborated and mortality was described for the generation obtained of the field cohort. In addition, for two successive generations, additive variance and heritability for fecundity were estimated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a critical {{assessment of the}} ability of existing Drucker-Prager (D-P) type plasticity models to predict the behaviour of confined concrete using both experimental observations and a recent analytical model. This assessment shows that for a D-P plasticity model to succeed in predicting the behaviour of FRP-confined and other passively-confined concrete, it needs to possess the following three features: (a) a yield criterion which includes the third deviatoric stress invariant, (b) a hardening/softening rule which {{is dependent on the}} confining pressure; and (c) a flow rule which is dependent on both the confining pressure and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> confinement <b>increment.</b> None <b>of</b> the existing D-P type models possesses all three features, so they cannot be expected to lead to accurate predictions for both actively-confined and passively-confined (e. g. FRP-confined) concrete...|$|R
