50|$|Many {{currently}} manufactured automobiles worldwide use MacPherson strut suspension, which utilises one {{ball joint}} per side, between {{the lower end}} of the strut and the control arm, with the necessary small amount of articulation at the top of the strut being usually provided by an elastomeric bearing, within which is a ball bearing to allow free rotation about the steering axis. So, there are commonly only two ball joints in the suspension, however there will be at least four (track rod <b>ends</b> and <b>rack</b> <b>ends)</b> in the steering linkage.|$|R

50|$|Pockets, usually rimmed at {{the back}} with leather or plastic, may have leather mesh or cloth bags or plastic cups, or {{elongated}} wire racks, to catch the balls, common in home billiard rooms and pool halls, or in the coin-operated tables found in bars/pubs may instead lead to ball-return troughs inside the table, which channel the balls into a collection chamber {{on one side of}} the table (or, in non-coin-op models, on the <b>racking</b> <b>end</b> of the table). A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} part of the 17th century Standlake had three or four public houses, {{including}} the Chequers, which traded until at least 1781. By the latter part of the 18th century Standlake had between seven and 11 pubs. The Black Horse is a 16th-century building that was a pub by 1761 and continues to trade today. By 1790 The Bell had opened in <b>Rack</b> <b>End,</b> but by 1804 it had moved to the High Street to a building part of which is timber-framed infilled with brick nogging, and the remainder of which is built of Cotswold stone. The Bell was closed for refurbishment for some time after the sale of the pub by Greene King in 2008, but reopened in August 2010 as a free house run by Few Inns.|$|R

40|$|Current Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) aim at high {{temperatures}} in the Thermal Energy Storage (TES).

In order to avoiding this technical challenge, we developed a Low-temperature Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (LTA-CAES) plant based on a two-tank non-thermocline TES. We selected and designed multistage radial compressors and expanders with single stages arranged at the <b>ends</b> of several <b>pinion</b> shafts rotating with different- and for the assembled impellers optimal speeds. The proposed LTA- CAES design shows cycle efficiencies in the range of 58 to 67 %, slightly lower compared to those envisioned for high temperature A-CAES.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{sequencing}} of requests in an automated storage/retrieval system with dedicated storage. We consider the block sequencing approach, where {{a set of}} storage and retrieval requests is given beforehand and no new requests come in during operation. The objective for this static problem {{is to find a}} route of minimal total travel time in which all storage and retrieval requests may be performed. The problem of sequencing a list of retrievals is equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and thus NP-hard in general. We show that the special case of sequencing under the dedicated storage policy can be solved in polynomial time. The results apply to systems with arbitrary positions of the input and output stations. This generalizes the models in the literature, where only combined input/output stations are considered. Furthermore we identify a single command area in the <b>rack.</b> At the <b>end</b> we evaluate the model against heuristic procedures...|$|R
5000|$|Passengers {{are allowed}} to carry {{a limited number of}} smaller bags with them in the vehicle, these are known as hand luggage (more {{commonly}} referred to as carry-on in North America), and contain valuables and items needed during the journey. There is normally storage space provided for hand luggage, either under seating, or in overhead lockers. Trains often have luggage <b>racks</b> at the <b>ends</b> of the carriage near the doors, or above the seats if there are compartments. There are differing views between North America and Europe in relation to the rules concerning the amount of baggage carried on to aircraft. In North America there is considerable debate as to whether passengers carry too many bags on board and that their weight could be a risk to other passengers and flight safety. US airlines are beginning to introduce weight and size restrictions for carry-on baggage. Whereas in Europe, many airlines, especially low-cost airlines, impose what is commonly known as [...] "the one-bag rule". This is a restriction imposed to stop excessive weight on board and airlines claim that this policy allows them to speed the boarding of the aircraft. Airports in Europe have mounted a campaign with the European Commission in an attempt to overturn these hand luggage regulations. They claim that it is affecting their duty-free and other airport retail sales and is reducing their revenues.|$|R
50|$|The {{release lever}} (L) holds the rack (M) {{up when the}} clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a {{projection}}. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the release lever, allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, {{is determined by the}} position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins (G) repeatedly lift the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small pin (S) on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the <b>rack</b> reaches the <b>end</b> of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, {{in such a way that}} gear (H) is held stationary with the pin (S) not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of the rack which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.|$|R
40|$|Debris flows are {{dangerous}} phenomena {{due to their}} large run-out distances and high velocities. The time-space evolution of the interstitial pore water pressures much affects the propagation stage of debris flows. Thus, a quantitative physically-based combined modelling of both flow propagation and pore water pressure changes is a fundamental issue for landslide risk analysis and to design effective control works. The paper provides a contribution to this topic {{through the use of}} an enhanced numerical model, which combines a 3 D depth-integrated hydro-mechanical coupled SPH (Smooth Particles Hydrodynamics) model for the propagation analysis and a 1 D vertical FDM (Finite Difference Method) model for the evaluation of the pore water pressure along the height of the flowing mass. In this paper, the SPH-FDM model is used to simulate, in 2 D and 3 D analyses, well-documented flume tests performed in USA through a 90  m long channel exiting at a sub-horizontal pad. The model is later used to simulate other flume tests, performed in Japan in a 3. 4  m long channel, equipped without or with a (permeable) <b>rack</b> at the <b>end</b> of the channel, which allows the pore water pressures reducing until the mass eventually stops. Doing so, the paper shows that the SPH-FDM model is capable to properly reproduce the time-space evolution of the pore water pressures during the propagation stage with different geometries of experimental flumes and different hydraulic boundary conditions, such as an impervious or permeable bottom...|$|R
40|$|Integrally geared {{compressors}} (IGCs) {{comprise of}} single stage impellers {{installed on the}} <b>ends</b> of <b>pinion</b> shafts, all driven by a main bull gear (BG) and shaft system. When compared to single shaft multistage centrifugal compressors, the benefits of IGCs include better thermal efficiency, reduced footprint and simple foundation, dispensing with a high speed coupling, as well as better access for maintenance and overhauls. In IGCs the compression of the process gas induces axial loads on the pinion shafts that are transmitted via thrust collars (TCs) to the main drive shaft and balanced by a single thrust bearing. The TCs, located {{on either side of}} pinion gears, slightly overlap with the BG outer diameter to form lentil-shaped lubricant-wetted regions. A numerical model, based on classical thin film lubrication theory, predicts the force response of lubricated thrust collars for use in integrally geared compressors. The predictive model determines performance parameters such as lubricant flow rate, mechanical power loss, peak pressure, lubricant temperature rise, as well as rotordynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for a lubricated TC and bull gear pair. A Newton-Raphson based iterative procedure determines an equilibrium operating position for a given set of TC and BG operating conditions and geometry. Periodic, dynamic displacements from the equilibrium position renders complex dynamic stiffnesses (H = K+i?C), from which the fluid film force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients are determined. In a lubricated thrust collar and bull gear, a hydrodynamic pressure builds in {{the lower half of the}} lubricated zone and lubricant cavitation occurs in the upper half. The minimum film thickness and peak pressure in the lubricated zone shift location due to the difference in taper angles between the TC and BG surfaces. For a given applied load, a study on the differences in taper angle between the TC and BG surfaces reveals that current angular tolerances of ? 0. 1 produce TC/BG pairs with similar performance parameters (power loss, lubricant temperature rise, etc.) and dynamic force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients. Increasing the taper angles of both the TC and BG decreases mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise, but also decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. In addition, static angular misalignments of the TC and BG about the horizontal (x) axis joining the BG and TC centers alters the shape and extent of the lubricant cavitation region. This change alters the load carrying capacity and mechanical power losses of the lubricated element. For the specific TC/BG pair investigated herein, there exists a maximum difference between the two taper angles for which the mechanical element can support an imposed thrust load. Increasing the speed of the BG (and proportionally the TC speed) increases the mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise and decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. As with most fluid film bearings, increasing the applied load increases the power loss, lubricant temperature rise, and axial stiffness and damping coefficients. The thesis delivers a predictive tool, yet to be benchmarked against experimental data, that provides insight to both the static and dynamic force performance of a lubricated thrust collar, not currently in the archived literature...|$|R
