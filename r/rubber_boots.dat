25|$|A {{preliminary}} inquiry {{was held in}} 2003, the testimony from which was covered by a publication ban until 2010. At the inquiry, the fact that Pickton {{had been charged with}} attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of prostitute Wendy Lynn Eistetter in 1997 was revealed. Eistetter testified at the inquiry that after he had driven her to the Port Coquitlam farm and had sex with her, Pickton slapped a handcuff on her left hand and stabbed her in the abdomen. She stabbed Pickton in self defense. Later, both she and Pickton were treated at the same hospital, where staff used a key they found in Pickton's pocket to remove the handcuffs from the woman's wrist. The attempted-murder charge against Pickton was stayed on January 27, 1998, because the woman had drug addiction issues and prosecutors believed her too unstable for her testimony to help secure a conviction. The clothes and <b>rubber</b> <b>boots</b> Pickton had been wearing that evening were seized by police and left in an RCMP storage locker for more than seven years. Not until 2004 did lab testing show that the DNA of two missing women were on the items seized from Pickton in 1997.|$|E
25|$|Monty {{has brought}} {{supplies}} and persistently comes on to Marwood. He offers {{to take them}} into town to get fitted into <b>rubber</b> <b>boots,</b> but they end up spending the money he gave them on drinks. Monty is hurt, though he puts {{it out of his}} mind quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of what else Monty might try on him and wants to leave immediately. After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of them}} have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.|$|E

50|$|A {{common use}} of {{dielectric}} grease is in high-voltage connections associated with gasoline engine spark plugs. The grease {{is applied to}} the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> of the plug wire. This helps the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug. The grease also acts to seal the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot,</b> {{while at the same time}} preventing the rubber from becoming stuck to the ceramic. Generally, spark plugs are located in areas of high temperature and the grease is formulated to withstand the temperature range expected. It can be applied to the actual contact as well, because the contact pressure is sufficient to penetrate the grease film. Doing so on such high pressure contact surfaces between different metals has the advantage of sealing the contact area against electrolytes that might cause rapid deterioration from galvanic corrosion.|$|R
2500|$|The {{corpse of}} the lost Andaste's first mate, Charles Brown, was found wearing high <b>rubber</b> <b>boots.</b> [...] The {{footwear}} was seen {{by some as a}} sign that the vessel was prone to shifting its cargo of aggregate in bad weather, and that the doomed ship's officer may have had to dress himself for the frantic task of shoveling gravel uphill inside a wet ship's hold. [...] As of September 1929, {{there was no way to}} confirm or deny this speculation.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor was {{the only}} {{successful}} deaf pitcher in Major League Baseball and was regarded, along with Dummy Hoy, {{as a role model}} and hero in the American deaf community in the early 20th century. [...] In the 1900s, Taylor was reported to be the highest paid deaf person in the United States. He was also known as the comedian of the Giants teams, waving a lit lantern when an umpire refused to call a game due to darkness and coaching at third base in <b>rubber</b> <b>boots</b> when an umpire refused to call a game due to rain.|$|E
2500|$|Grbavica is {{a feature}} film {{directed}} by Jasmila Žbanić. It is set in post-war Sarajevo and focuses on Esma, a single mother, and Sara, her daughter, who discovers she is a war baby as {{her mother had been}} raped. The film won the 2006 Golden Bear award at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival. Žbanić had also written and directed a short documentary about the war in 2000, titled Red <b>Rubber</b> <b>Boots</b> [...] In the Land of Blood and Honey, directed by Angelina Jolie, also deals with the subject of wartime rape. The Abandoned is a 2010 Bosnian film which {{is the story of a}} boy from an orphanage who tries to find out the truth about his origins, it being implied that he is the child of a rape. The 1998 war film Savior is about an American mercenary escorting a Serb woman to a UN safe area after she has been raped and impregnated by a Bosniak soldier.|$|E

50|$|Rubber boot-style gas-loaded {{relief valves}} operate by using {{nitrogen}} pressure loaded {{on the outside}} diameter of a <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> that is covering the flow path through the relief valve. As long as the process pressure is below the nitrogen pressure, the valve is closed. As soon as the process pressure raises above the nitrogen pressure, the product in the line forces the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> away from the barrier and allows product {{to pass through the}} valve. When the process pressure decreases below the nitrogen pressure, the valve goes closed again.|$|R

2500|$|... "Dmitry {{received}} Yusupov's suggestion with alacrity, and alliance {{was welcomed}} as {{indicating that the}} murder {{would not be a}} demonstration against the dynasty." [...] They had planned to burn Rasputin's possessions and call from the train station a popular restaurant to ask if Rasputin was in. Sukhotin put on Rasputin’s fur coat, his <b>rubber</b> <b>boots</b> and gloves. He left together with Dmitri and Lazovert into Purishkevich's car, suggesting Rasputin had left the palace alive. Because Purishkevich's wife refused to burn the fur coat and the boots in her small fireplace in Purishkevich's ambulance train, the conspirators went back to the palace with the mentioned items. When the body was wrapped in a curtain, the conspirators drove toward Krestovsky Island and, at about 5 a.m., threw the corpse from a bridge into the Malaya Nevka River into an ice hole. They forgot to attach weights so that the body would sink deep, dropped his fur coat over the railing with the chains, and drove back, without noticing one of Rasputin's goloshes, a rubber boot (size 10), was stuck between the piles of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Murphy also preached {{the need}} for a pure mind and body and {{abolished}} the old attitude that athletes in training for a physical test required ale and certain stimulants [...] "to give them the vim and make them 'go.'" [...] He also became known for his advocacy of not over-working an athlete during training. In 1895, one of his athletes, Sweeney, set a world record in the high jump. Murphy rested Sweeney for three days before the International Games against England, and Sweeney {{spent most of his time}} in bed. When Sweeney arrived at the field on the day of the competition, [...] "he was so full of ginger he could hardly stand still" [...] and set a world record. Another writer emphasized Murphy's recognition in his training regimen that an athlete is a human:"He is the originator of the now generally accepted belief that an athlete is a human. Under his system the old idea of athletes being steamed and worked like mules was banished. Training with weighted shoes or running uphill in <b>rubber</b> <b>boots</b> were old methods that were put into the discard. Light shoes for racing and heavier ones for workout are enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conventional {{ballasted}} tunnel-track {{was ruled}} out {{owing to the}} difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision. [...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of <b>rubber</b> <b>boots.</b> The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains. The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on [...] rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{models that}} are able simulate a buckling of the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot.</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>boot</b> {{must be able}} of a large change of its length. A buckling of cylindrical shape of the boot during this deformation would cause a serious problem. Due to the space limitation in an assembly it is quite difficult to find optimal shape of the boot profile which will be able of the required deformation without the buckling. We have created numerical models {{that are able to}} simulate mechanical behavior of the compressed boot including the buckling of the boot with an inappropriate profile. Due to the material of the <b>boot</b> (<b>rubber),</b> a nonlinear hyperelastic material model was used in the analyses. The material constants of this hyperelastic model were obtained from the uniaxial and equibiaxial tests of the boot material. Created numerical models were used to design the optimal shape of the boot which eliminates the risk of the buckling...|$|R
