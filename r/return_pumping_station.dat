5000|$|The <b>Return</b> Sludge <b>Pumping</b> <b>Station,</b> Fields Point Sewage Treatment Plant is an {{historic}} wastewater <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> in the Field's Point Sewage Treatment Facility on Ernest Street in Providence, Rhode Island. It is a rectangular hip-roofed brick and concrete structure, located {{adjacent to the}} facility's aeration tanks, and is not readily visible from any public way. The building houses a number of large pumps in a large concrete substructure that is below grade. The facility was built in 1934-35, when the sewage treatment method was changed from a chemical process to a biological one, and is used to return biologically active sludge from the aeration tanks back into the treatment process. The pumps in the building are no longer original, having been replaced several times. [...] The building {{is one of three}} to survive in the Field's Point area from the early decades of Providence's wastewater treatment system. the others are the Ernest Street Sewage <b>Pumping</b> <b>Station</b> and the Chemical Building; the Sludge Press House was demolished sometime in the last 30 years.|$|R
5|$|After its closure the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> lay {{derelict}} {{until the}} late 1960s, when the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust proposed to the British Waterways Board that students from the University of Bath conduct a survey and report on the viability of <b>returning</b> the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> to working order. Work started in 1969 with engineering students from Bath providing the labour {{under the supervision of}} John Butt, and the Trust providing the funding. Within the building rotten woodwork was replaced and electric lighting installed. To work on the sluices and the waterwheel the leat was dammed. Specialist wood and metal work was undertaken by apprentices from the British Aircraft Corporation in Filton. By 1972 some progress had been made; John Butt retired and Derrick Dudden took over as restoration manager, with more volunteers from the Canal Trust helping to provide the labour. Silt was removed from the pond, hatches replaced and the waterwheel restored. The 408 oak teeth on the pitwheel were replaced and the pumps overhauled with new rope packing. By February 1976 all the machinery was working and water could be pumped from the river to the canal. The <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> was formally re-opened in 1978.|$|R
25|$|By September 6, 2005, the <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> {{began to}} get online on 17th Street Canal. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 10 was {{actually}} pumping at this point. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 6 was interrupted to clean up some debris out of the area. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1, {{which is a little}} bit further up in the system, was <b>pumping</b> to <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 6, so as to drain the upper area, uptown areas. Over on the east side, <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 19 had been running for some time. Two of the three big <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> in New Orleans East were running, in addition to temporary pumps. At least one <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> was running in Plaquemines Parish.|$|R
5|$|<b>Pumping</b> <b>stations</b> {{maintain}} {{the momentum of}} the oil as it goes through the pipeline. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1 is the northernmost of 11 <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> with 4 <b>pumps</b> each, but <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 5 held in reserve. <b>Pump</b> <b>Stations</b> 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|R

40|$|AbstractEl-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Stations</b> (1) and (2) {{are located}} at 22. 1 km and 54. 3 km {{respectively}} at El-Salam Canal. When El-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> (1) is in operation, and switching off El-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> (2), water level rises upstream El-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> (2). Water level overtops El-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> (2) and banks upstream it. Flooding then takes place as Wadi El Noqra Canal, Egypt. This necessitates discharging the excess water {{to protect the}} <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> and the canal from water flooding when the electricity is shut down. The hydrodynamic simulation of El-Salam Canal determinates the critical time for storage capacity according to location and type of emergency spillways through the numerical model to prevent water overtopping upstream <b>pump</b> <b>stations.</b> Determination of the critical time of storage capacity is considered as a new parameter in case of the hydraulic design of the canal controlled by cross <b>pump</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper mainly {{introduces}} {{that the}} overall simulation and numerical calculation model which includes the system of <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> and groundwork is built to study the concrete structure of <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> with 3 -D finite element software Marc. By undertaking a study on stress and deformation of <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> structure and combining the living example, {{the root cause of}} cracks is raised. By calculating and studying, the overall strength and displacement of structure can be reflected more intuitively and accurately with the method of 3 -D finite element. 1 Raise the question <b>Pumping</b> <b>station</b> as an essential part of water project has been widely applied in the agriculture and industry and water conservancy projects. It can be expected that <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> will be more widely used in the different areas of national economy with the modernization of industrial and agricultural production. However, with the multistage <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> <b>pumping</b> water, flood control and industrial needs of the business process, requirements on the safety and reliability of <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> project is also rising. Reliability of the <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> is not only a problem of the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> itself, but also becomes important factors which affect social development and benefits [1...|$|R

Citrus <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> and St. Charles <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> each were running at half capacity because the Citrus <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> has to pull power from a generator {{at one of the}} other two stations.

40|$|In {{the thesis}} we {{displayed}} an automation of an industrial facility on {{an example of}} a water <b>pumping</b> <b>station.</b> We described the structure of a typical automated system and presented it's key components. We designed a water <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> with three main components – a water pump, a reservoir and a drain. The proposed water <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> could be used for suplying water to a small settlement, in case the settlement had access to a water source with adequate capacity in it's vicinity. As part of the thesis we developed a programme for Allen-Bradley's CompactLogix 5370 controller, which operates the <b>pumping</b> <b>station.</b> We built a supervisory system, which communicates with the controller through OPC standards and records the key parameters of the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> to the database. Finally we created a report system that shows the operation of the water <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> within a selected time frame. We tested the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> with an all-day simulation and analysed it's results at the end of it...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the much}} reduced {{health and safety}} concerns, and smaller {{footprint}} and visibility, submersible <b>pump</b> sewage <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> have almost completely superseded traditional sewage <b>pumping</b> <b>stations.</b> Further, a refit of a traditional <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> usually involves converting it into a modern <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> by installing submersibles in the wet well, demolishing the pump house and retiring the dry well by either stripping it, or knocking down the internal partition and merging it with the wet well.|$|R
