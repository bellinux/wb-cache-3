5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{arise from}} the subclavian artery, and run through the transverse foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting {{at the level of}} the first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to <b>rotational</b> <b>movement</b> in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen {{at the level of the}} first and second vertebrae. The vertebral artery supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.|$|E

The filament is approximately 20nm in diameter and consists of several protofilaments, each made up of thousands of flagellin subunits. The bundle is held together by a cap and {{may or may not}} be encapsulated. The motor complex consists of a series of rings anchoring the flagellum in the inner and outer membranes, followed by a proton-driven motor that drives <b>rotational</b> <b>movement</b> in the filament.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inner ear}} is {{primarily}} responsible for balance, equilibrium and orientation in three-dimensional space. The inner ear can detect both static and dynamic equilibrium. Three semicircular ducts and two chambers, which contain the saccule and utricle, enable the body to detect any deviation from equilibrium. The macula sacculi detects vertical acceleration while the macula utriculi is responsible for horizontal acceleration. These microscopic structures possess stereocilia and one kinocilium which are located within the gelatinous [...] otolithic membrane. The membrane is further weighted with otoliths. Movement of the stereocilia and kinocilium enable the hair cells of the saccula and utricle to detect motion.

2500|$|In the United States, {{engineers}} use the ASTM {{standards and}} AASHTO specifications {{when referring to}} the concrete slump test. The American standards explicitly state that the slump cone should have a height of 12-in (300 mm), a bottom diameter of 8-in (200 mm) and an upper diameter of 4-in (100 mm). The soft SI conversions provided in the standard allow using the same dimension slump cones as those described in other standards. The ASTM standards also regulate the rigidity of the cone.

2500|$|The {{creation}} of Somb {{by the supreme}} being is found within the hermeneutics of Serer religion and [...] traditions. By thought, Roog first plotted the shapes of all the trees or plant species yet to come. Through the mythical words, Roog fashioned its placenta on the primordial seed − the seed of the Somb tree. Within this seed, Roog placed all the plant species including their reproductive energies − male and female. Through its feminine principle, Roog opened up and [...] "projected the germ of Somb" [...] which became the bearer of all the plant species found on earth and the underworld. The Somb seed penetrated the earth, the placenta of Roog where it took root and grew. Growing from this placenta, it kept all the plant species within its trunk. When it became a big tree, its trunk swelled diminutively and opened up as if by caesarean section or explosion. From this event, it opened up all the plant species found on Earth, and the <b>rotational</b> <b>movement</b> of the Universe scattered {{them all over the}} world.|$|E

To broaden the classical view,the field of experimentation is obviously the high level competition in which most of rotational application can be found applied more or less instinctively by high level Athletes. Considering the two biomechanical tools that are the physical basis of judo throws {{it is possible to}} obtain such results from the analysis of high competition application:Lever Techniques are enhanced in their effectiveness in three ways: The <b>rotational</b> <b>movements,</b> strictly connected to the Lever techniques mechanics achieving victory in competition, can be extended to the unbalance phase. The <b>rotational</b> <b>movements</b> can be applied in a totally new way putting away even the unbalance that is basic in the Lever techniques. The Lever tool can be hybridized with the Couple tool to lower the energy consumption. Couple Techniques are enhanced in their effectiveness also in three ways: The Couple tool that doesnt need unbalance allowing uke body rotate around his center of mass, is enhanced utilizing the Uke body smaller resistance directions,normally summarized in Diagonal attacks. The vertical <b>rotational</b> <b>movements</b> in the transverse plan with the axis in the sagittal plane can be added to the Couple application with transverse rotation and axis in the frontal plane to overcome some defensive resistance, mainly in the trunk and leg group of Couple techniques,like Uchi Mata or O Soto Gari. The <b>rotational</b> <b>movements</b> enhance the throwing action changing the mechanics of Couple into Lever applying a Torque,both with the direction change of one force or the time delay of his application. This analysis, expanded with a short physical framework, clarifies hidden deep concepts and helps teacher and coaches in their professional work.
