It is shown that by appropriately choosing the filter time constant as {{a fraction of the}} rotor time constant the instantaneous power losses after a load torque step can be significantly reduced compared to the standard case. The analysis for the appropriate choice of the filter time constant is based on a numerical study for three different induction motors with different <b>rated</b> <b>powers...</b>|$|E

3000|$|Taking the {{switching}} scheme into consideration, I_r,off is {{much higher}} at the instant of voltage recovery than at other times, which is possibly generated by the overlapped transient process of crowbar switching-off and grid fault recovery. Before or after the recovery, the peak current is significantly reduced. Hence, it is suggested to avoid switching-off around voltage recovery. In practice, the instant of fault clearance is unpredictable, thus we cannot ensure crowbar deactivating before voltage recovery. Therefore, postponing switching-off is more practical.

40|$|A {{microgrid}} {{is a local}} {{electricity network}} with several distributed energy systems. Different strategies of power sharing in distributed generation are reviewed and the droop control approach for inverter based distributed generators is selected for further investigation due to its low cost and potential for performance enhancement. The inverters in a microgrid with droop control use a wireless control system which doesn't have any intercommunication cost and is not distorted by electromagnetic interferences. The control system is extendable to any number of distributed sources. Proper power sharing, which enables the energy sources (with energy storage units) to provide powers proportional to their apparent <b>rated</b> <b>powers,</b> {{is a very important}} property of the system. Hence, the collection of the distributed sources can deliver their maximum powers when there is full load demand, without overloading some and underutilizing others. The conventional droop control doesn't result in proper power sharing; especially when the sources have different <b>rated</b> <b>powers</b> or the feeders are unbalanced (have different impedances). This drawback has not been fixed in the other publications; either by using the power sources with equal apparent power or by ignoring the improper power sharing ratio. Also in some publications, there have been some poor load voltage regulations. In this thesis, a modified droop system has been used which will result in appropriate power sharing and load voltage regulation. Furthermore, the effects of the sources' voltages' magnitude, phase angle, and frequency on the system power sharing are considered. Moreover, the influences of the droop system's parameters on system's behaviour were evaluated in different cases of sources' apparent powers ratio and feeders' lengths ratio and a general rule is presented which shows how to choose the droop parameters for any isolated microgrid's control system...|$|E

For each lamp, at 70 % of its rated power, the luminous efficacy is greater than 80 lm/W, colour rendering index is above 74 and correlated colour tempera-ture increases by less than 800 K. Dimming applications of these lamps are validated by these parameters. Furthermore, the complicated variation of lamp parameters as a function of operating power is explained by the variation of metal halide vapour pressure with wall temperature. 1...|$|E

More likely, the charging stations will {{be integrated into}} the parking infrastructure (parking decks, public, private and commercial parking sites). On average the duration of the parking will be longer than the duration of the charging process which creates a potential for load shifting.

A {{multiple}} generator drivetrain (MGD), where {{a single}} large generator in a wind turbine {{is replaced by}} multiple generators with the same or different <b>rated</b> <b>powers,</b> is proposed along with an automatic switch {{as an alternative to}} an existing MGD configuration. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of a MGD with a conventional drivetrain are provided to better understand {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} having a MGD in wind turbines.

A simple mathematical model for a MGD with electromagnetic clutches is developed, a novel prototype of a MGD is designed and fabricated, and experiments are conducted on the prototype. It is concluded that a multiple-generator drivetrain with generators operating individually or in parallel has a better potential of improving the efficiency and the reliability, expanding the operational range, and reducing the cost of offshore and onshore wind turbines than the existing MGD configuration...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to predict the wind energy {{potential}} over the Langkawi Island, Malaysia. The wind data for year 2009 was collected from Malaysia Meteorology Department (MMD) and then extrapolated to the hub heights of various turbines. Wind turbines with <b>rated</b> <b>powers</b> between 1 kW and 110 kW were chosen for annual energy production calculations and best fitted ones were used for the micrositting analysis. In this study, the turbine with 22 kW rated power with hub height 30 m was selected based on its best value of capacity factor. The wind speed frequency per year is highly peaked in the range 1 – 6 m/s, this indicate that most of the wind speed at Langkawi Island lies in this range. The ‘WAsP’ and ‘WindPRO’ softwares were used for the wind statistics and energy calculations. Calculated energy production of located 10 turbines with total capacity of 0. 22 MW was 111. 1 MWh.

40|$|Wind {{resources}} vary {{significantly in}} strength from one location to another {{over a wide}} geographical region. The major turbine manufacturers offer a family/series of wind tur-bines to suit the market needs of different wind regimes. The {{current state of the}} art in wind farm design however does not provide quantitative guidelines regarding what turbine feature combinations are suitable for different wind regimes, when turbines are operating as a group in an optimized layout. This paper provides a unique exploration of the best tradeoffs between the cost and the capacity factor of wind farms (of specified nameplate capacity), provided by the currently available turbines for different wind classes. To this end, the best performing turbines for different wind resource strengths are identified by minimizing the cost of energy through wind farm layout optimization. Exploration of the “cost- capacity factor ” tradeoffs are then performed for the wind resource strengths cor-responding to the wind classes defined in the 7 -class system. The best tradeoff turbines are determined by searching for the non-dominated set of turbines out of the pool of best performing turbines of different <b>rated</b> <b>powers.</b> The medium priced turbines are observed to provide the most attractive tradeoffs − 15 % more capacity factor than the cheapest tradeof...|$|E

40|$|The rotor of {{a typical}} wind turbine rotates at a speed of 20 - 200 rpm. In {{conventional}} wind power plants the generator is coupled to the turbine via a gear {{so that it can}} typically rotate at a speed of 1000 or 1500 rpm. The wind power plant can be simplified by eliminating the gear and by using a low-speed generator, the rotor of which rotates at the same speed as the rotor of the turbine. The hypothesis in this work is that the typical generator-gear solution in the wind power plant can be replaced by a low-speed PM synchronous generator. This thesis deals with the electromagnetic design and the optimisation of two types of low-speed generators for gearless wind turbines. The generators designed are radial-flux permanent-magnet synchronous machines excited by NdFeB magnets. The machines have different kinds of stator windings.

The first algorithm is used for solving single-objective function represents either total operation cost or total pollutant emission injected from the installed generating units while ALO is applied to solve the multi-objective function of both total operating cost and emission. The problem is formulated as nonlinear constrained objective function with equality and inequality constraints. In this work; the devices installed in MGs are photovoltaic panel (PV), wind turbine (WT), micro-turbine (MT), fuel cell (FC), battery and grid. Two scenarios are studied; the first one is optimizing MG with installing all RESs within specified limits in addition to grid, while the second scenario is operating both PV and WT at their <b>rated</b> <b>powers.</b> The obtained results are compared with different reported algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA), Fuzzy self-adaptive PSO (FSAPSO) and others programmed like particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey-wolf optimizer (GWO) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA).
