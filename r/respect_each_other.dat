Dinah is so accepting and so open that Helena sees an opportunity to be part of something without having to force her way in. There's friction, because once Helena puts the mask on, she's really not very good fitting in. But she likes that they're giving her a chance. Whether she blows it or not, you'll have to keep reading." ...|$|E

2500|$|While their {{rivalry with}} the Philadelphia Phillies lacks {{the history and}} hatred of the Mets, {{it has been the}} more {{important}} one in the last decade. Between 1993 and 2013, the two teams reigned almost exclusively as NL East champions, the exceptions being in 2006, when the Mets won their first division title since 1988 (no division titles were awarded in 1994 due to the player's strike), and in 2012, when the Washington Nationals claimed their first division title since 1981 when playing as the Montreal Expos.

When it looks like the end, Ip remembers Hung's patriotic spirit and is spurred to go on. He changes his strategy and attacks the boxer's arms to disable him. The fight is brought to a climactic finish as Ip Man rains blow after blow into the knocked-down Twister's face, with flashbacks reflecting the latter's killing of Master Hung. While the Chinese celebrate, Wallace was finally arrested by his superiors for corruption, as Fatso [...] has secretly reported him before the match. Ip then gives a speech to the audience, stating that despite the differences between their race and culture, he wishes for everyone to <b>respect</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> regardless of their status. Both the Western and Chinese audience give him a standing ovation while Twister's manager walks away, unhappy at the defeat.

2500|$|In 1980, {{sculptor}} Robert Arneson {{was commissioned}} {{to create a}} monument to Moscone to be installed in the new Moscone Convention Center. [...] The bust portraying Moscone was done in Arneson's expressionistic style and was considered acceptable by San Francisco's Art Commission. [...] However, the pedestal which the former Mayor's head rested on was deemed inappropriate and Arneson was asked to change it. At issue were references to Harvey Milk, the assassinations, the [...] "Twinkie Defense", the White Night riots, and Dianne Feinstein's mayoral succession that Arneson had included {{on the surface of}} the pedestal. [...] Arneson refused to make alterations to the work, returned the commission, and later resold the sculpture. In a critique of the event, Frederic Stout wrote that [...] "Arneson's mistake was in presenting the city mothers/fathers with something honest, engaging and provoking, that is to say, a work of art. What they wanted, of course, was not a work of art at all. They wanted an object of ritual magic: the smiling head of a dead politician." [...] In 1994 a new bust by San Francisco artist Spero Anargyros was unveiled, depicting Moscone holding a pen, below which are words from Moscone: [...] "San Francisco is an extraordinary city, because its people have learned to live together with one another, to <b>respect</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and to work with each other for the future of their community. That's the strength and beauty of this city – it's the reason why the citizens who live here are the luckiest people in the world." ...|$|E
