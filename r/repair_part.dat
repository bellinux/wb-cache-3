40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{maintenance}} platform for business vehicles which detects failure sign using IoT {{data on the}} move, orders to create <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> by 3 D printers and to deliver them to the destination. Recently, IoT and 3 D printer technologies have been progressed and application cases to manufacturing and maintenance have been increased. Especially in air flight industry, various sensing data are collected during flight by IoT technologies and parts are created by 3 D printers. And IoT platforms which improve development/operation of IoT applications also have been appeared. However, existing IoT platforms mainly targets to visualize "things" statuses by batch processing of collected sensing data, and 3 factors of real-time, automatic orders of <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> and parts stock cost are insufficient to accelerate businesses. This paper targets maintenance of business vehicles such as airplane or high-speed bus. We propose a maintenance platform with real-time analysis, automatic orders of <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> and minimum stock cost of parts. The proposed platform collects data via closed VPN, analyzes stream data and predicts failures in real-time by online machine learning framework Jubatus, coordinates ERP or SCM via in memory DB to order <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> and also distributes <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> data to 3 D printers to create <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> near the destination.

Earlier on in the series he has an emotional and ambiguous relationship with his Sergeant Tess Gallagher. Tess is eventually so overwhelmed by her colleague's affection and her own feelings for him that she tries {{to put a stop}} to any future romantic relationship happening between the pair by eloping in Fiji with Doctor Josh Carmichael instead. After the breakdown of Tess' ultimately doomed marriage her subsequent pregnancy with Josh’s child lead Jonesy to propose to her, but it's declined as she wants the two of them to just remain friends on the basis that she wants to raise the child as a single parent. Later complications with her pregnancy then force her to leave Mt. Thomas, leading to an emotional goodbye to Jones. Senior Constable Susie Raynor's relationship with Jonesy provided more promise and even culminated in a successful marriage proposal. However his initial hesitation in starting a romantic relationship lead her to have two presumptuous yet fleeting relationships with fellow members, Sergeant Ben Stewart and Senior Constable Alex Kirby , the revelation of the latter with Jonesy’s best mate Kirby cause her and Jonesy’s eventual relationship and short lived engagement to end. It is seen in the final episode of the series that Jonesy and Susie have managed to <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> of their once close friendship with each other.|$|E
50|$|The Allied command {{planned to}} open the battle with an {{artillery}} bombardment scheduled for the 5 of May 1917. On that day 91 Italian and French batteries(372 guns and heavy mortars) opened fire along the entire front of the 302nd Division and the 22nd Brigade. Due to the calm and warm weather the entire defensive line was soon engulfed {{in a cloud of}} smoke and dust. The barrage lasted for the entire day and had mixed effects, depending on the ground and strength of the fortifications it was directed at. This {{was the case in the}} sector of the 302nd Division where the Bulgarian 2/2nd Infantry Brigade was defending lines situated in a flat plain and the shelters were not enough for all the soldiers. By contrast the bombardment hardly made an impression on the German 201st Infantry Brigade which occupied the important hills 1020 and 1050. Its infantry benefited from the rugged terrain and the excellent shelters, that were in some cases dug in the solid rock. The Allied artillery fire in the sector of the Bulgarian 3/7 Infantry Brigade caused serious damage on part of the barbed wire and collapsed several infantry shelters. Von Reuter's troops were also exposed to the heavy bombardment and had some of their first-line trenches and barbed wire severely damaged. The Allied artillery on this part of the front was forced to pause its barrage for some time in the afternoon due to the appearance of German fighter aircraft and the destruction of one of their observation balloons. With the coming of the night the Allied fire was significantly reduced in intensity which gave a chance to the defenders to <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> of the inflicted damage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church was}} built around 1130, its shape being {{inspired}} by the rotunda in {{the church of the}} Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem. It was built by the Fraternity of the Holy Sepulchre, who were probably a group of Austin canons. It consisted of a round nave and an ambulatory, with a short chancel, probably in the shape of an apse. Initially it was a wayfarers' chapel on the Roman road known as Via Devana (this is now Bridge Street). By the middle of the 13th century it had become a parish church under the patronage of Barnwell Priory. Around this time structural alterations were made to the church, with the rebuilding of the chancel and the addition of a north aisle, the aisle being shorter than the chancel. During the 15th century the Norman style windows in the nave were replaced by larger Gothic style windows. The carvings of angels in the roofs of the chancel and aisle were added. A polygonal bell-storey was built over the nave. [...] In 1643, during the Civil War, many of the [...] "idolatrous" [...] images were destroyed. By the 19th century the church was in a poor state of <b>repair.</b> <b>Part</b> of the ambulatory collapsed in 1841, and the Cambridge Camden Society offered to carry out repairs. They appointed Anthony Salvin for the purpose.Salvin replaced the bell-storey by a roof similar to the original roof. This was made necessary because the weight of the bell-storey was too much for the walls to support. The 15th-century Gothic windows were replaced by windows in Norman style, and a formerly-inserted gallery was removed, together with the external staircase leading to it. To compensate for this, a new south aisle was added. It was found that the east wall of the chancel was unstable and this was replaced. Then the north aisle, by that time in poor condition, was also rebuilt, extending it to the same length as the chancel. The original estimate for the cost of the restoration was £1,000 (...) , with the parish paying £300 (...) in the event it cost nearly £4,000 [...] ), with the parish providing only £50 (...) [...] In 1899 a vestry was added {{to the north of the}} north aisle; this was extended in 1980. [...] The Victorian stained glass in the east window was destroyed by a bomb in the Second World War and was replaced in 1946. [...] By 1994 the congregation had become too large for the church, and they moved their gatherings to the nearby Church of St Andrew the Great.|$|E

40|$|A basic {{function}} in the proper management of <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> inventories is the forecasting of future demand. The Navy maintains a database of univariate demand data for its <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> inventories using a quarterly time interval. Historically, Navy <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> demand forecasting has been done using the exponential smoothing procedure. This method is a simple and robust means of forecasting, however {{it does not make}} use of any characteristics of the entire time series such as trend, cycles, presence of outliers, or demand clustering. This research begins by developing several simple, robust, and dimensionless time series features. These features are used to predict the suitability of Box- Jenkins (ARIMA) modeling. The ARIMA process is a powerful time series modeling and forecasting technique which possesses flexibility for the inclusion of many time series characteristics. This research project develops a predictive model of ARIMA suitability using both classical regression and a modem expert-system statistical package, ModelQuest. A computationally simple means is presented for determining which time series may benefit from the Box 4 enkins methodology. Using ARIMA modeling for time series that show significant benefit will provide a more accurate demand forecast and benefit inventory management. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Developing and updating shipboard <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> allowances for the tremendous number of Navy shipboard equipments {{is a large}} scale, complex task. In order to avoid excessive downtime on these critical equipments, more sophisticated allowance computation techniques which account for system characteristics and availability requirements are needed. This study examines three availability centered inventory models used to determine <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> allowances. The models are the Availability Centered Inventory Model (ACIM), the Lagrangian Equipment Optimization (LEO) model, and the Spares Economically and Automatically Selected to Criteria Applied for Performance Effectiveness (SEASCAPE) model. Model effectiveness will be compared using a hypothetical ship steering system. After inventory levels are computed by each of the models through internal optimization techniques, operational availability (A sub o) is estimated by simulation of a ship's mission timeline using the Naval Sea Systems Command's TIGER program. The comparison is made by examining {{the availability of the}} hypothetical system using the TIGER model under the following conditions: fixed budget, variable budgets, and variable mean supply response times (MSRT) [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|A basic {{function}} in the proper management of <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> inventories is the anticipation of demand. The US Navy maintains a database of univariate demand data for its <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> inventories using a quarterly time interval and {{a limited number of}} periods. Historically, the exponential smoothing procedure has been used for demand forecasting. This method is simple and robust, but it does not make use of any characteristics of the entire time series such as trend, cycles, presence of outliers or demand clustering. Sharper information may be available {{with the use of the}} Box-Jenkins system. Not all repair parts can capitalize on this and there is a problem in identifying those that do. Moreover the number of parts is quite large and the speed of identification is an issue. This paper addresses this problem. The research begins with the development of several simple, robust and dimensionless time series features. These are used to predict the suitability of Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) modeling. Two predictive models are considered: classical regression and a modern expert-system statistical package, ModelQuest(TM). Their strengths and weaknesses are compared. The result of either is a computationally simple means for determining which repair parts time series may benefit from the Box-Jenkins methodology for purposes of inventory management.
