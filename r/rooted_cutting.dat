40|$|Cuttings of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) {{from three}} open-pollinated {{families}} were rooted in {{two types of}} tray, and then grown for 1. 5 years in a bareroot nursery. During their second winter they were sampled periodically and tested for cold hardiness, dormancy status, root growth potential and various morphological characteristics. Two-year-old seedlings and transplants were tested concurrently for comparison. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings,</b> seedlings and transplants cold hardened at similar rates during early winter, achieving {{the same level of}} midwinter hardiness (LTso =- 18 “C) in early January. However, <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> remained hardier later into the spring than did seedlings or transplants. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> exhibited deeper dormancy in early winter than seedlings or transplants but these differences disappeared after January. Root growth potentials of all three stock types remained above threshold values established for trans-plants throughout winter. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> had greater stem diameter, higher stem diameter to height ratio, and greater root weight than either seedlings or transplants. This may reflect lower growing densities for the <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Root/shoot ratios of <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> were greater than for seedlings and similar to those of transplants. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> also had deeper and coarser root systems, which probably reflects lack of wrenching at the nursery...|$|R
40|$|Patterns of shoot {{growth and}} {{branching}} were studied over two growing seasons in <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> collected from both epicomric shoots and seedlings of Betula pendula Roth. Epicormic shoots were induced to sprout on stumps and small logs of 5 -, IO- and 30. year-old trees. The use of epicormic shoots enhanced the rooting capacity of stem cuttings collected from these shoots {{but did not}} appear to reverse the process of maturation. In this study, maturation was based on characteristics typical of mature trees but not necessarily those of the mother plant, because {{it was not possible to}} <b>root</b> <b>cuttings,</b> for comparison, from 5 -, lo- and 30 -year-old ortets, other than from epicormic shoots. There was evidence of the persistence of mature characteristics through an increase in shoot plagiotropism with increasing ortet age. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> from both seedlings and epicormic shoots, however, assumed an increasingly orthotropic habit with a smaller shoot angle at the end of the first growing season than at the beginning and this continued into the second growing season. Other indications of maturation, such as delayed bud flushing and the incidence of flowering with increasing ortet age, were also evident in <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> from epicormic shoots. There was a clear difference in branching habit depending on <b>cutting</b> source. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> derived from epicormic shoots produced nearly twice as many lateral branches compared with <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> collected from seedlings, but this was not an effect of maturation. There was some evidence that <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> derived from seedlings grew taller than <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> from epicormic shoots...|$|R
40|$|Outplanting {{performance}} of 1 -year-old narrow leaved ash stocks (<b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> and seedlings) grouped into three height categories (large, medium and small) {{were examined in}} a bottomland site with heavy clay soils.

5000|$|The Washington Elm, Cambridge, Massachusetts. George Washington {{is said to}} {{have taken}} command of the American Continental Army under the Washington Elm in Cambridge on July 3, 1775. The tree survived until the 1920s and [...] "was thought to be a {{survivor}} of the primeval forest". In 1872, a large branch fell from it and was used to construct a pulpit for a nearby church. The tree, an American white elm, became a celebrated attraction, with its own plaque, a fence constructed around it and a road moved in order to help preserve it. The tree was cut down (or fell [...] - [...] sources differ) in October 1920 after an expert determined it was dead. The city of Cambridge had plans for it to be [...] "carefully cut up and a piece sent to each state of the country and to the District of Columbia and Alaska," [...] according to The Harvard Crimson. As late as the early 1930s, garden shops advertised that they had cuttings of the tree for sale, although the accuracy of the claims has been doubted. A Harvard [...] "professor of plant anatomy" [...] examined the tree rings days after the tree was felled and pronounced it between 204 and 210 years old, making it at most 62 years old when Washington took command of the troops at Cambridge. The tree would have been {{a little more than two}} feet in diameter (at 30 inches above ground) in 1773. In 1896, an alumnus of the University of Washington, obtained a <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> of the Cambridge tree and sent it to Professor Edmund Meany at the university. The cutting was planted, cuttings were then taken from it, including one planted on February 18, 1932, the 200th anniversary of the birth of George Washington, for whom Washington state is named. That tree remains on the campus of the Washington State Capitol. Just to the west of the tree is a small elm from a cutting made in 1979.|$|E
40|$|Baldcypress, Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich., var. distichum is {{a highly}} {{adaptable}} tree of significant ecological importance in the Southeastern U. S. Including Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium (Pondcypress) and Taxodium distichum var. mexicanum (Montezuma cypress), the native range is extended into south Texas and Mexico. Previously, baldcypress selections were made for drought, foliar salt exposure and high pH soil tolerance. Experiments were conducted beginning in May, 2008 to determine commercial viability of vegetative propagation by shoot tip cuttings of these selections, to identify treatment combinations that led to optimal <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> quantity and quality, and to determine whether baldcypress cuttings displayed a topophytic effect and if so, {{if there was a}} correlation between branch angle on the ortet and topophysis exhibited by ramets during nursery production. The propagation studies revealed that <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> quantity and quality were optimal when softwood cuttings were taken from south Texas and/or Mexican provenances and treated with either 7, 500 or 15, 000 mg?L- 1 K-IBA (potassium salts of indole- 3 -butyric acid). A gradient was observed with cuttings from more southern and western provenances typically exhibiting greater <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> quantity and quality than cuttings from more eastern and northern provenances. A tradeoff between greater rooting percentages in a substrate with greater aeration (100 percent perlite) versus greater root quality (root numbers, length, or mass) in a substrate with a higher water-holding capacity (100 percent peat moss) was also displayed. Additional basal wounding proved to be detrimental to both <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> quantity and quality. A significant (P </= 0. 05) topophytic effect was observed among genotypes for the divergence of central leaders from a vertical orientation during nursery production, but the branch angle of the cutting on the ortet was not a good predictor of this divergence on the ramet...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> {{propagation}} {{is widely}} used for maximising tree yield, quality and uniformity in conjunction with clonal selection. Some eucalypt species are deployed as rooted cuttings but many are considered to difficult to root. This study examined IBA effects on photoinhibition, root formation, mortality and root and shoot development in cuttings of Corymbia torelliana, C. citriodora and their hybrids. IBA {{had little or no}} effect on photoinhibition but it had strong, dose-dependent effects on root formation and mortality. IBA frequently increases primary root number of <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> but it did not increase total root weight, length, surface area or volume, possibly because the highest doe (8 g IBA/kg IBA/kg powder) caused leaf abscission and sometimes reduced leaf area (by 55 - 79 %) or shoot dry weight (by 40 - 58 %). An intermediate dose (3 g IBA/kg powder) most consistnely improved root formation with little or no effect on mortality or shoot development. Across the F 1 hybrid families this treatment increased the number of rooted cuttings by 72 - 121 % and more than ddoubled the number of primary roots per <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> (from 1. 1 - 1. 7 roots to 3. 5 - 4. 1 roots).

40|$|Propagation of {{subtropical}} eucalypts {{is often}} limited by low production of rooted cuttings in winter. This study tested whether changing {{the temperature of}} Corymbia citriodora and Eucalyptus dunnii stock plants from 28 / 23 °C (day/night) to 18 / 13 °C, 23 / 18 °C or 33 / 28 °C affected the production of cuttings by stock plants, the concentrations of Ca and other nutrients in cuttings, and the subsequent percentages of cuttings that formed roots. Optimal temperatures for shoot production were 33 / 28 °C and 28 / 23 °C, with lower temperatures {{reducing the number of}} harvested cuttings. Stock plant temperature regulated production of rooted cuttings, firstly by controlling shoot production and, secondly, by affecting the ensuing rooting percentage. Shoot production was the primary factor regulating <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> production by C. citriodora, but both shoot production and root production were key determinants of <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> production in E. dunnii. Effects of lower stock plant temperatures on rooting were not the result of reduced Ca concentration, but consistent relationships were found between adventitious root formation and B concentration. Average rooting percentages were low (1 – 15 % for C. citriodora and 2 – 22 % for E. dunnii) but <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> production per stock plant (e. g. 25 for C. citriodora and 52 for E. dunnii over 14 weeks at 33 / 28 °C) was sufficient to establish clonal field tests for plantation forestry...|$|E
40|$|Large scale {{productions}} of miracle fruit (Synsepalum dulcificum) faces some restrictions as the seeds are recalcitrant and propagation by cuttings {{is difficult to}} root. When grown from seed, miracle fruit takes 3 to 4 years to begin fruiting. A propagation technique by cuttings needs to be devised to produce early fruiting planting materials. However {{there has been no}} report on the rooting performance of miracle fruit stem cuttings using Indole- 3 -Butyric Acid (IBA) and the location of root primordia initiation is unknown. Softwood miracle fruit cuttings were treated with five IBA concentrations (0, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg L - 1) and placed in a propagation area with intermittent mist. Data for percentage of rooting (%), mean root numbers per <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting,</b> mean root length per <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> (cm) and root dry weight per <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> (g) were collected 3 months after planting. Thirty softwood cuttings were propagated for histological study. The basal 5 mm of three cuttings were harvested randomly weekly. The specimens were sectioned and the cross sections were viewed to locate the root primordia initiation. Callus formation started three weeks after sowing and the adventitious roots emerged from the basal end eight weeks after planting. High concentration of IBA treatment was significantly increase the rooting percentage when compared with other treatments. Anatomy of stem 800 mg L - 1 day 0 showed the phloem was surrounded by 2 - 3 layers of fibers. Root primordial developed from the secondary phloem and penetrated the fiber layers 5 weeks after planting. IBA concentrations gave little effect in roots initiation and development of miracle fruit. Root primordial was developed from the secondary phloem and surrounded by fiber layers was could hinder its emergence.

40|$|Minimal-growth storage may be {{a simple}} method to {{preserve}} germ plasm while tree varieties undergo clonal selection, but there has previously been little evidence to demonstrate that minimal-growth storage delays maturation.

Minimal-growth storage increased the subsequent frequency of adventitious rooting in cuttings of 6 of the 10 clones, providing increases in <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting</b> production of between 53 % and 163 % over ex-vitro nursery storage. Minimal-growth storage also increased adventitious root number in two clones and root mass in four clones.

40|$|Many {{plantation}} eucalypts {{are difficult}} to propagate from cuttings, and their rooted cuttings often possess very few adventitious roots. We microscopically examined the stem anatomy of cuttings from 12 species of eucalypts and we determined whether adventitious root formation in auxin-treated cuttings of four species was limited to particular positions around the vascular tissue. Most species contained a central pith that was arranged in a four-pointed stellate pattern. The surrounding vascular tissue was also arranged in a stellate pattern near the shoot apex but it developed a more rectangular shape at the outer phloem as the stems enlarged radially. Adventitious roots formed at, or slightly peripheral to, the vascular cambium, and they formed at both the corners and {{the sides of the}} rectangular-shaped vascular tissue. The study highlighted that auxin-treated eucalypt cuttings can produce roots at multiple positions around the vascular tissue and so propagation methods can aim to produce more than four adventitious roots per <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting.</b> Higher numbers of adventitious roots could improve the root system symmetry, stability, survival and growth rate of clonal eucalypt trees. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|E

30|$|Geranium (Pelargonium graveolens L.) is an {{aromatic}} crop, {{the shoot}} biomass of which, on steam distillation, yields an essential oil which {{is widely used}} in fragrance and flavour industries. It is a vegetatively propagated (through <b>rooted</b> <b>cutting)</b> crop and is initially slow growing. The wide uncovered interspaces between the rows of geranium harbour {{a large number of}} weeds in the initial stage of crop growth resulting in suboptimal utilization of natural resources and inputs leading to yield losses and increased cost of cultivation (Rajeswara Rao et al. 1993). Crop diversification, following intercropping and agroforestry, has been reported to be a potential alternative for enhancing per capita (unit area and time) productivity in the context of shrinking land holding and increasing human and livestock population (Swaminathan 2001). Crop diversification increases resource use, reduces production cost, and improves or maintains soil quality in intensive agriculture systems (Andersen et al. 2004). Geranium cultivation provides income only once a year and the cultivation of some winter crops is sacrificed due to a long duration of this crop. In this context, inclusion of short duration, high value, and midseason income generating intercrops could be highly remunerative. Earlier studies on geranium-based intercropping indicated that the systems, besides being remunerative, maintain the soil quality (Verma et al. 2009).|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is a {{valuable}} species native to North America and today widely planted throughout the world for biomass production. In Hungary, where Robinia has great importance in the forest management, the clones have been selected for plantations on good, medium and poor quality sites. To conserve the identity, superior clones are vegetatively propagated by <b>root</b> <b>cuttings.</b> At times the collection of <b>root</b> <b>cuttings</b> can cause uncertainty for clonal identity because of the overlap of roots from neighboring plants. This can occur especially when the repository is damaged from severe environmental accidents and the planting layout has been lost. The {{aim of this study}} has been to verify by molecular markers the diversity or identity of black locust clones by <b>root</b> <b>cuttings</b> harvested in a damaged trial. Materials and Methods: <b>Root</b> <b>cuttings</b> of 91 clones belonging to five cultivars were collected in a trial severely damaged by storms and flooding periods. The obtained plantlets were analyzed with nine microsatellite (SSR) markers and the genetic identity/diversity within and among the plants was tested using the software GenAlEx version 6. Results: Multilocus genotypes (MLG) and the Paetkau’s assignation test (1985) revealed genetic variability among the samples: the analyzed plantlets were grouped in four classes instead of the five expected.
