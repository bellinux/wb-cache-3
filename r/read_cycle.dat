25|$|This {{standard}} supports standard memory cycles with {{lengths of}} 1 byte to 4 kilobytes of data, short memory cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes that have much less overhead compared to standard memory cycles, and I/O cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes of data which are low overhead as well. This significantly reduces overhead {{compared to the}} LPC bus, where all cycles except for the 128-byte firmware hub <b>read</b> <b>cycle</b> spends more than one-half {{of all of the}} bus's throughput and time in overhead. The standard memory cycle allows a length of anywhere from 1 byte to 4 kilobytes in order to allow its larger overhead to be amortised over a large transaction. eSPI slaves are allowed to initiate bus master versions of all of the memory cycles. Bus master I/O cycles, which were introduced by the LPC bus specification, and ISA-style DMA including the 32-bit variant introduced by the LPC bus specification, are not present in eSPI. Therefore, bus master memory cycles are the only allowed DMA in this standard.|$|E

5000|$|The storage cells on {{a memory}} chip {{are laid out}} in a {{rectangular}} array of rows and columns. The read process in DRAM is destructive and removes the charge on the memory cells in an entire row, so there is a row of specialized latches on the chip called sense amplifiers, one for each column of memory cells, to temporarily hold the data. During a normal read operation, the sense amplifiers after reading and latching the data, rewrite the data in the accessed row before sending the bit from a single column to output. So the normal read electronics on the chip has the ability to refresh an entire row of memory in parallel, significantly speeding up the refresh process. A normal read or write cycle refreshes a row of memory, but normal memory accesses cannot be relied on to hit all the rows within the necessary time, necessitating a separate refresh process. Rather than use the normal <b>read</b> <b>cycle</b> in the refresh process, to save time an abbreviated cycle called a refresh cycle is used.

40|$|The {{integration}} of memory circuits in thin-film transistors (TFTs) {{is essential to}} extend the functionalities of large-area applications such as flat-panel displays, imagers etc. Intensive research is being conducted {{with the goal of}} producing high-performance memory devices for active-matrix backplane electronics. For example, a memory in a pixel circuit has the potential to reduce the refresh rate for display applications. This eventually leads to reduced power consumption which is vital for producing low-power displays. In addition, memory in pixel circuits can improve the fill factor of the display by its ability to hold the data without the need for a storage capacitor. Prior work has reported various TFT structures justifying the performance of the devices especially on their behavior under floating conditions. This work investigates the effect of continuous <b>read</b> <b>cycles</b> on the stability of low-temperature hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) memory TFTs prepared using the industrial standard back-channel etched (BCE) TFT process, as the topic yet to be explored systematically. An engineered charge-trapping interface between the gate dielectric and the channel layer is fabricated to realize non-volatile memory. The performance of the devices was initially measured by comparing the transfer characteristics of the memory TFTs with conventional a-Si:H TFTs. The stability of the memory devices was measured under different stress conditions by varying the gate voltage and stress time. An emphasis was placed on the stability of the memory devices under floating and persistent <b>read</b> <b>cycles</b> as followed in display applications. The drain current was measured over various intervals of time for ~ 60 days to track the degradation of the devices. The reliability of the memory devices was also measured. From the analysis of the results, the charge-trapping memory TFTs demonstrated good stability, large memory window, and better endurance. The charge retention of the devices under floating conditions was extrapolated and it showed a lifetime of ~ 10 years. However, the charge retention of the memory TFTs exhibited a 50 % decrease in lifetime under realistic persistent read bias conditions (~ 5 years). This is possibly due to the instability of a-Si:H devices. This lifetime is subjected to change under different read voltage. Hence, the lifetime under continuous <b>read</b> <b>cycles</b> is extremely important to provide boundaries for expected memory lifetimes under normal display operating conditions...|$|R
