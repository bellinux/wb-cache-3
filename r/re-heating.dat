50|$|If {{dehumidification}} is required, {{then the}} cooling coil is employed to over-cool {{so that the}} dew point is reached and condensation occurs. A heater coil placed after the cooling coil <b>re-heats</b> the air (therefore known as a <b>re-heat</b> coil) to the desired supply temperature. This process {{has the effect of}} reducing the relative humidity level of the supply air.|$|R
50|$|Milo {{is added}} to hot or cold water and/or milk to make a malted {{chocolate}} beverage. It does not dissolve readily in cold milk, and so retains the gritty texture of its raw state. Milo can be stirred into steamed milk to make a drink akin to hot chocolate or cocoa. Use of very hot water when making a Milo drink can also alter the taste somewhat as will <b>re-heating</b> a made-up drink which has gone cold.|$|E
50|$|The age of {{the impact}} event is uncertain. It must be younger than the Teague Granite in the centre, dated at 2648 ± 8 Ma (million years ago). The most {{commonly}} cited age of about 1630 Ma represents a <b>re-heating</b> event affecting the granite; while {{this may be the}} impact event it could simply be a regional tectonic event. More recent dating by K-Ar methods yield ages as young as 568 ± 20 Ma, this age could also date the impact event or represent tectonic activity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{addition}} of lead oxide to the raw ingredients of glass {{resulted in a}} melted mixture that had a lower viscosity than ordinary glass, which {{had the advantage of}} being less likely to contain air bubbles. This made it easier to blow giving it a [...] "working time" [...] of about two minutes without <b>re-heating,</b> and made it particularly suitable for blowing into moulds. Lead glass has a higher refractive index, making its appearance sparkling, bright, and brilliant in light. It “rings” when struck.|$|E

50|$|Döner kebab {{is popular}} in many {{countries}} {{in the form of}} fast food, often as an end to a night out when preceded by the consumption of alcohol. Health concerns regarding döner kebab, including the hygiene involved in overnight storage and <b>re-heating</b> of partially cooked meat, its quality, as well as high salt, fat, and calorie levels, {{have been reported in the}} media. Lean meat, wholemeal bread, and salad, can be considered healthy eating choices, but large amounts of oil-based sauces, added salt, fatty meat, and overly large portions, may contribute to significant health risks.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, {{during the}} heating season, the {{programmable}} thermostat may {{be set to}} allow {{the temperature in the}} house to drop when the house is unoccupied during the day and also at night after all occupants have gone to bed, <b>re-heating</b> the house prior to the occupants arriving home in the evening or waking up in the morning. Since most people sleep better when a room is cooler and the temperature differential between the interior and exterior of a building will be greatest on a cold winter night, this reduces energy losses.|$|E
50|$|A {{soldering}} copper {{is a tool}} with a {{large copper}} head and a long handle which is heated in a blacksmith's forge fire and used to apply heat to sheet metal for soldering. Typical soldering coppers have heads weighing between one and four pounds. The head provides a large thermal mass to store enough heat for soldering large areas before needing <b>re-heating</b> in the fire; the larger the head, the longer the working time. Historically, soldering coppers were standard tools used in auto bodywork, although body solder has been mostly superseded by spot welding for mechanical connection, and non-metallic fillers for contouring.|$|E

50|$|After cross-linking, {{the sheet}} is {{stretched}} by feeding {{it into a}} machine that heats it up, stretches it and cools it down. Because the sheet has been cross-linked, after stretching, it will want to recover to its original length when <b>re-heated.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A forced-air [...] {{central heating}} system is one which uses air as its heat {{transfer}} medium. These systems rely on ductwork, vents, and plenums as means of air distribution, separate from the actual {{heating and air conditioning}} systems. The return plenum carries the air from several large return grills (vents) to a central air handler for <b>re-heating.</b> The supply plenum directs air from the central unit to the rooms which the system is designed to heat. Regardless of type, all air handlers consist of an air filter, blower, heat exchanger/element/coil, and various controls. Like any other kind of {{central heating system}}, thermostats are used to control forced air heating systems.|$|E
50|$|The alloy was the {{end result}} of a {{research}} program into amorphous metals carried out at Caltech. It was {{the first of a series}} of experimental alloys that could achieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling rates. Amorphous metals had been made before, but only in small batches because cooling rates needed to be in the millions of degrees per second. For example, amorphous wires could be fabricated by splat quenching a stream of molten metal on a spinning disk. Because Vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates, production of larger batch sizes was possible. More recently, a number of additional alloys have been added to the Liquidmetal portfolio. These alloys also retain their amorphous structure after repeated <b>re-heating,</b> allowing them to be used in a wide variety of traditional machining processes.|$|E
5000|$|Probably the {{earliest}} beads of true glass {{were made by}} the winding method. Glass at a temperature high enough to make it workable, or [...] "ductile", is laid down or wound around a steel wire or mandrel coated in a clay slip called [...] "bead release." [...] The wound bead, while still hot, may be further shaped by manipulating with graphite, wood, stainless steel, brass, tungsten or marble tools and paddles. This process is called marvering, originating from the French word [...] "marbrer" [...] which translates to [...] "marble". It can also be pressed into a mold in its molten state. While still hot, or after <b>re-heating,</b> the surface of the bead may be decorated with fine rods of colored glass called stringers. These are a type of lampwork beads.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} is endothermic, so the fuel must be continually <b>re-heated</b> {{to keep the}} reaction going. In order to do this, an air stream, which alternates with the vapor stream, is introduced for the combustion of carbon to take place.|$|R

30|$|Thermal {{behavior}} of the samples was evaluated by a Mettler differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (Star SW 10.00, Switzerland). The copolymers were heated to 180  °C and cooled down to −  80  °C and <b>re-heated</b> to 180  °C. Thermal transitions were extracted from the second heating run.|$|R
50|$|Burning powder gases melt part of {{the bore}} each time a gun is fired. This melted metal is {{oxidized}} or blown out of the muzzle until the barrel is eroded to the extent shell dispersion becomes unacceptable. After firing several hundred shells, a gun may be reconditioned by boring out the interior and inserting a new liner as the interior cylinder. Exterior cylinders are heated as a unit to approximately 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit) to allow insertion of a new liner and the liner is bored and rifled after installation. A new liner may be bored for a different projectile diameter than used in the original gun. Liners may be either cylindrical or conical. Conical liners are tapered toward the muzzle for ease of removal from the breech end while limiting forward creep during firing. Conical liners may be removed by water cooling the liner after <b>re-heating</b> the barrel, but cylindrical liners must be bored out.|$|E
5000|$|Core-formed glass: is {{the best}} {{represented}} and probably the earliest manufacturing technique applied. First, a core with the bottle’s shape was shaped around a metallic rod most probably {{by a combination of}} clay, sand, mud and/or animal dung. Then, molten glass was either trailed onto the core {{with the aid of a}} second tool or directly from dipping it into a container of molten glass. The surface was smoothed by continual <b>re-heating</b> and rolling on a flat slab. Finally, vessels were removed from the metallic rod, they slowly cooled down in a side chamber of the glass melting furnace and, then, the core material was scraped out of the interior. Common body colours were translucent dark or cobalt blue, opaque white, brown, red or olive-green and of the decoration opaque yellow, orange, white or turquoise trails in zigzag or feather patterns. This technique limited considerably the size of the vessels, which were mainly close vessels with thick walls.|$|E

5000|$|Various {{presentations of}} shimotsukare exists in {{different}} areas in Japan. The dish is served either hot or cold. Shimotsukare is normally served with rice but could also be taken without it. In some areas, once the dish is simmered, {{it will not be}} <b>re-heated</b> again when served.|$|R
50|$|After {{the solid}} sulfur is removed, the {{hydrocarbon}} solution is <b>re-heated</b> to approximately 150 °F and the liquid is then pumped {{back into the}} absorber to continue the process of absorbing more H2S and removing it from the gas stream.

50|$|Unlike thixocasting, which <b>re-heats</b> a billet, {{rheocasting}} {{develops the}} semi-solid slurry from the molten metal produced {{in a typical}} die casting furnace/machine. This is a big advantage over thixocasting because it results in less expensive feedstock, {{in the form of}} typical die casting alloys, and allows for direct recycling.|$|R
5000|$|Burmese is a uranium glass. The {{formula to}} produce Burmese Glass {{contains}} uranium oxide with tincture of gold added. The uranium oxide produced the inherent soft yellow color of Burmese glass. Because of the added gold, the characteristic pink blush of color of Burmese was fashioned by <b>re-heating</b> {{the object in}} the furnace (the [...] "Glory Hole"). The length {{of time in the}} furnace will determine the intensity of the color. Strangely, if the object is subjected to the heat again, it will return to the original yellow color. On the queen's visit to the United States, the Mount Washington glass company made for her a tea cup and saucer. When it was presented to her, she exclaimed, [...] "It looks like a Burmese sunset." [...] That is where the name Burmese came from for the glass. The design painted on the cup and saucer by the famous Mt. Washington artist Timothy Canty became known as Queen's Burmese design. The Mount Washington Glass Company patented Queen's design Burmese, not Thomas Webb and Sons.|$|E
50|$|The Bindomatic {{technology}} {{is based upon}} several patents. These patents relate both {{to the production of}} supplies and innovations used in the machines to secure a perfect end result. The {{technology is}} based upon a hot melt book binding adhesive designed to have characteristics that optimizes each part of the process from production of the supplies and finally binding the document. The adhesive also allows for <b>re-heating</b> so that the document can be edited by adding or removing pages. The strength of the binding is secured by the process parameters like time and temperature and is during development of these parameters tested through pull and flex testing, see pictures! The pull test has limits set up by various organizations but normally 7.2N/cm is a value regarded as giving very good binding strength. For the Bindomatic system using regular copy paper the strength is 11N/cm and for non-coated color copy paper the strength is around 9N/cm. In general the hot melt binding is not recommended for coated, heavy-weight paper and the Bindomatic system is in that respect not different from other hot melt systems.|$|E
50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for <b>re-heating</b> at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|E
