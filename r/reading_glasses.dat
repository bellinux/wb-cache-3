5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} aging of the characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday is compounded by McCoy's gift of <b>reading</b> <b>glasses.</b> The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer did not know that Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E

25|$|She first won {{attention}} {{for her role}} in Fantastic Voyage (1966), after which she won a contract with 20th Century Fox. They lent her contract to a British studio, for whom she made One Million Years B.C. (1966). She had only three lines in the film, yet images of her in the doe-skin bikini which she wore became best-selling posters that turned her into a celebrity sex symbol. She later starred in notable films including Bedazzled (1967), Bandolero! (1968), 100 Rifles (1969) and Myra Breckinridge (1970). She made several television variety specials. In late 2008, she became a spokeswoman for Foster Grant's <b>reading</b> <b>glasses</b> campaign, created by Ferrara and Company.|$|E

In 1876, Major Glass accepted an offer to edit the Petersburg News, and Carter joined him as a journeyman printer.

25|$|Monovision {{is the use}} of single-vision lenses (one {{focal point}} per lens) to focus an eye (typically the {{dominant}} one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Alternatively, a person may simply wear <b>reading</b> <b>glasses</b> over their distance contact lenses. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.|$|E
25|$|Glasses, {{also known}} as {{eyeglasses}} or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds {{them in front of}} a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with <b>reading</b> <b>glasses</b> and glasses used for nearsightedness. Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes {{as well as in the}} lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses.|$|E
25|$|Brøns Church, {{located in}} Southern Jutland, south of Ribe, {{contains}} two Lutheran frescos, dating from c. 1530, which are probably Denmark's only examples of church frescos with distinctly Lutheran messages. One shows a heavenly castle under siege. An army led by pope and bishops try {{to gain access}} to it by force, while Christ — guarding its city gate — rejects them. Another image shows the pope and a number of bishops presenting a large papal bull, carrying a total of 11 ecclesiastic seals but no text. It is unknown whether this has always been the case, but the presence of two fools, one of them holding a pair of <b>reading</b> <b>glasses,</b> indicates that this is the intention; the Catholic Church is presented as without content. Below, a monk, standing a front of a group of men holding letters of indulgence is confronted by another group of people holding similar letters. This protest scene against the sale of indulgences is inspired by a contemporary woodcarving by Nuremberg artist, Hans Sebald Beham, who was staunchly anti-Catholic.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} type of {{corrective}} lens is [...] "single vision", which has a uniform refractive index. [...] For people with presbyopia and hyperopia, bifocal and trifocal glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and progressive lenses have a continuous gradient. <b>Reading</b> <b>glasses</b> provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. <b>Reading</b> <b>glasses</b> are available without prescription from drugstores, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have two simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like astigmatism or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required. [...] Adjustable-focus eyeglasses might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).|$|E

Some of the settlers whose names appear on the map did not receive their grants from the Mexican Government until later than 1842. All I know about Padre Amable is that he was in charge of the parish at the old Mexican settlement at Agua Mansa between 1852 and 1855. It was under him that the Agua Mansa church was built.

2500|$|For most {{of their}} history, {{eyeglasses}} were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen (as those in religious vocation were {{the most likely to}} be literate and therefore the most likely to need <b>reading</b> <b>glasses),</b> elderly, or physically weak and passive. The stigma began to fall away in the early 1900s when the popular Theodore Roosevelt was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian Harold Lloyd began wearing a pair of horn-rimmed glasses as the [...] "Glasses" [...] character in his films.|$|E
