40|$|A new {{computer}} code, AGNI- 3 D, {{has been developed}} for the modeling of combustion, spray, and flow properties in a stratified-charge rotary engine (SCRE). The mathematical and numerical details of the new code are described by the first author in a separate NASA publication. The solution procedure {{is based on an}} Eulerian-Lagrangian approach where the unsteady, three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for a perfect gas-mixture with variable properties are solved in generalized, Eulerian coordinates on a moving grid by making use of an implicit finite-volume, Steger-Warming flux vector splitting scheme. The liquid-phase equations are solved in Lagrangian coordinates. The engine configuration studied was similar to existing rotary engine flow-visualization and hot-firing test rigs. The results of limited test cases indicate a good degree of qualitative agreement between the predicted and measured pressures. It is conjectured that the impulsive nature of the torque generated by the observed pressure nonuniformity {{may be one of the}} mechanisms responsible for the excessive wear of the timing gears observed during the early stages of the rotary combustion engine (RCE) development. It was identified that the turbulence intensities near top-dead-center were dominated by the compression process and only slightly influenced by the intake and exhaust processes. Slow mixing resulting from small turbulence intensities within the <b>rotor</b> <b>pocket</b> and also from a lack of formation of any significant recirculation regions within the <b>rotor</b> <b>pocket</b> were identified as the major factors leading to incomplete combustion. Detailed flowfield results during exhaust and intake, fuel injection, fuel vaporization, combustion, mixing and expansion processes are also presented. The numerical procedure is very efficient as it takes 7 to 10 CPU hours on a CRAY Y-MP for one entire engine cycle when the computations are performed over a 31 x 16 x 20 grid...|$|E
40|$|Case StudyAn OFS (Oil Free Screw) {{compressor}} experienced problems {{meeting the}} API 619 3 rd Edition vibration level acceptance criteria during shop testing. Extensive testing identified the primary mechanism that increased the rotor vibration levels was {{high levels of}} dynamic pressure pulsations due to acoustic resonance. This presentation will identify the fundamentals of acoustic resonance and how these frequencies can {{be affected by the}} factors which define an acoustic system. An inherent characteristic of OFS compressor discharge flow is a pulsed flow defined by pocket or lobe passing frequency occurring when the discharge gas from the <b>rotor</b> lobe <b>pocket</b> passes into the discharge porting. Oil free screw compressors can experience high levels of vibration due to acoustic resonance coupling with high dynamic pressure pulsations generated by these positive displacement machines. When a screw compressor is not volumetrically matched and the gas MW, density or discharge pressure is high, the discharge dynamic pressure pulsations can be high...|$|R
