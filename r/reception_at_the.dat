5|$|Frankel praised Livolsi {{for making}} the film's four key montages—the opening credits, Miranda's coat-tossing, Andrea's makeover and the Paris introduction—work. The third was {{particularly}} challenging as it uses passing cars and other obstructions to cover Hathaway's changes of outfit. Some scenes were also created in the editing room, such as the <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> museum, where Livolsi wove B-roll footage in to keep the action flowing.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{opening to}} {{positive}} <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2010 Cannes Film Festival, Money Never Sleeps received polarized reviews from critics, who generally praised the acting, but considered it an unnecessary sequel. Though {{failing to meet}} its critical expectations, the film was successful at the box office, topping the United States's ranking during its opening weekend, and earning a worldwide total of $134 million in ticket sales, and more than $15 million on DVD.|$|E
5|$|During {{a tour of}} the Philippines {{the month}} after the Yesterday and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had {{expected}} them to attend a breakfast <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Everton captain Dixie Dean led {{his team}} to the Royal Box and {{received}} the cup from the Duke of York.

The players attended a <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> town hall, where large crowds greeted them. After the reception the cup was taken to Goodison Park for public viewing.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United planned an open-top {{bus tour}} {{of the city of}} Manchester the day after the game, at which they would parade their three trophies for an {{expected}} 700,000 people lining the streets between Sale and the city centre. The parade culminated with a <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Manchester Arena, for which 17,500 tickets were made available at £3 each, with proceeds going to Alex Ferguson's testimonial fund.

5|$|On March 17, Booth {{learned that}} Lincoln would be {{attending}} {{a performance of}} the play Still Waters Run Deep at a hospital near the Soldier's Home.

5|$|On March 3, the President {{hosted a}} large public <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House on his final full day in office.

5|$|Released in July 1968, Thunderbird 6 had {{a mediocre}} <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> box office, which {{ruled out the}} {{production}} of further sequels in the Thunderbirds film series. Critical response has remained mixed: although the special effects have been praised, commentators are divided {{on the quality of}} the plotting, which is considered either well-paced and concluding on a note of high action, or confusing and inordinately long, with little visual spectacle to contrast with the dialogue. Nevertheless, Thunderbird 6 is viewed favourably in comparison to Jonathan Frakes' 2004 film adaptation, receiving praise for the perceived agelessness of its entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|The Foehls knew {{many in the}} Hollywood film industry, and {{a number}} of film stars stayed at the hotel. In late December 1957, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood celebrated their wedding <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hotel. Bette Davis, Roy Rogers, Bing Crosby, Frankie Avalon, Humphrey Bogart, Betty Grable, Janet Leigh, Marilyn Monroe, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and Tony Curtis were known to have stayed there. Sometimes late at night, Jimmy Durante would come down from his room to play the piano in the lounge for other sleepless guests. The Foehls ran the hotel very closely—they lived on the premises.|$|E
5|$|The San Francisco Citizens' Committee {{wished to}} issue a {{commemorative}} coin as a fundraiser for {{a celebration of the}} statehood diamond jubilee.

5|$|Gilchrist's icy <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Gabba did not faze him; he {{took five}} catches, stumped Azhar Mahmood off Shane Warne's bowling and scored a rapid 81, mostly in {{partnership}} with ODI partner Waugh, in a match that Australia won comfortably by ten wickets. In his second Test match he made an unbeaten 149 to help guide Australia to victory {{in a game that}} looked well beyond their reach. Australia were struggling at 5/126 in pursuit of 369 for victory as he joined his Western Australian teammate, Justin Langer, but the pair put on a record-breaking partnership of 238 to seal an Australian win. Gilchrist continued his strong run throughout his debut Test season, and ended the summer with 485 runs at 69.28 in six matches, three each against Pakistan and India, adding two fifties against the latter.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City elected not to parade {{the trophy}} at the match {{as they did}} not wish to be seen as 'crass' in front of the visiting Stoke City supporters. Instead, Manchester City were invited by Manchester City Council to host an open-top bus parade through the City of Manchester in celebration of their victory. The parade took place on 23 May 2011 and began at 18:00 {{starting}} at Albert Square outside Manchester Town Hall where 10,000 people were present to see the team set off on the bus parade with various streets of the city centre closed by 12:00 in preparation for the parade. The open-top bus then travelled out of Manchester city centre via Princess Street, Portland Street, Piccadilly Gardens, Newton Street on onto Great Ancoats Street. The parade finally reached Ashton New Road where thousands supporters were waiting at the gates of the City of Manchester Stadium to welcome the team home. The parade culminated in a special <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stadium, where 40,000 who claimed free tickets for the event were waiting. Greater Manchester Police estimated that the parade attracted a crowd in excess of 100,000.|$|E
