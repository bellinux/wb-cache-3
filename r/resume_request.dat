40|$|In a {{video-on-demand}} (VOD) system, subscribers {{can choose}} both the movie {{they wish to}} view and the time they wish to view it. In such an environment there are invariably hot videos which are requested by many viewers. The requirement that each viewer be able to independently pause the video at any instant and later resume the viewing with little delay can cause difficulties in batching viewers for each showing. Under batching, a single video stream is shared by multiple concurrent viewers and a <b>resume</b> <b>request</b> has to wait for additional stream capacity to become available before actual resumption can occur. The conventional approach to support on-demand pause-resume provides one video access stream to disks for each video request. This can greatly increase the disk arm requirement of a VOD system. In this paper, we propose a more efficient mechanism to support the pause-resume feature using look-ahead scheduling with look-aside buffering. The idea is to use buffering to improve the numb [...] ...|$|E
50|$|There are 12 power events (such as standby, suspend and <b>resume</b> <b>requests,</b> and {{low battery}} notifications), plus OEM-defined events, {{that can be}} sent from the APM BIOS to the {{operating}} system. The APM driver regularly polls for event change notifications.|$|R
50|$|Media Foundation {{provides}} a Media Session object {{that can be}} used to set up the topologies, and facilitate a data flow, without the application doing it explicitly. It exists in the control layer, and exposes a Topology loader object. The application specifies the required pipeline topology to the loader, which then creates the necessary connections between the components. The media session object manages the job of synchronizing with the presentation clock. It creates the presentation clock object, and passes a reference to it to the sink. It then uses the timer events from the clock to propagate data along the pipeline. It also changes the state of the clock to handle pause, stop or <b>resume</b> <b>requests</b> from the application.|$|R
50|$|When a {{computer}} with a self-encrypting drive is put into sleep mode, the drive is powered down, but the encryption password is retained in memory so that the drive can be quickly <b>resumed</b> without <b>requesting</b> the password. An attacker {{can take advantage of}} this to gain easier physical access to the drive, for instance, by inserting extension cables.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} to {{guarantee}} continuous {{delivery of a}} video stream in an on-demand video server environment, a collection of resources (referred a logical channel) are reserved in advance. To conserve server resources, multiple client requests for the same video can be batched together and served by a single channel. Increasing the batching interval results in larger savings in server capacity, however, it also increases the reneging probability of a client. A complication introduced by batching {{is that if a}} batched client pauses, a new stream (which may not be immediately available) needs to be started when the client resumes. To provide short response time to <b>resume</b> <b>requests,</b> some channels are set aside and are referred to as contingency channels. To further improve resource utilization, even when a non-batched client pauses, the channel is released and reacquired upon resume. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model that predicts the reneging probability and expected resume d [...] ...|$|R
50|$|On January 14, 2016, Governor Jay Inslee ordered {{drilling}} on {{the tunnel}} to stop, invoking a contract {{clause in the}} tunnel agreement that allowed the state to suspend work based on unsafe conditions for project personnel or the general public. Before excavation of the tunnel could <b>resume,</b> WSDOT <b>requested</b> that the contractors, Seattle Tunnel Partners, complete and deliver an analysis of what caused the January 12 sinkhole and what modifications to tunneling operations {{could be made to}} prevent further ground-level problems.|$|R
50|$|Following Nationalists’ conquests of the Vascongadas in 1936-7 the {{activities}} of RIEV, Eusko Ikaskuntza and Euskaltzaindia were not <b>resumed.</b> Despite <b>requests</b> from {{some of his friends}} Urquijo did not attempt to reconstruct the Basque cultural infrastructure, quoting a number of reasons ranging from purely personal to organizational to political ones. It was only in 1943 that he was among co-founders of Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País, becoming its chairman. The organization started issuing its review, Eusko Jakintza, in 1945 transformed into the Boletín of RSBAP; Urquijo became its manager.|$|R

50|$|Spano was {{questioned}} continuously {{for several hours}} and was told he could not consult with his attorney. The police provided him with dinner during his first night of questioning. The following day, Spano was transferred to another police station where questioning continued. He was again denied assistance of counsel. Bruno, upon police instructions, told Spano {{that he could get}} into trouble if Spano did not confess, although Bruno's job was not really in jeopardy. Bruno approached Spano four times before Spano gave a statement; each time questioning had <b>resumed,</b> Spano <b>requested</b> assistance of counsel. Police escorted Spano to the location where they believed he had disposed of the murder weapon. While searching for the weapon, Spano confessed.|$|R
5000|$|Drexel's longstanding {{cooperative}} education, or [...] "co-op" [...] {{program is}} one of the largest and oldest in the United States. Drexel has a fully internet-based job database, where students can submit <b>résumés</b> and <b>request</b> interviews with any of the thousands of companies that offer positions. They interview with employers during three rounds of applications: A round, B round, and C round. Students also have the option of obtaining an internship via independent search. A student graduating from Drexel's 5-year degree program typically has a total of 18 months of internship with up to three different companies. The majority of co-ops are paid, averaging $15,912 per 6-month period, however this figure changes with major. About one third of Drexel graduates are offered full-time positions by their co-op employers right after graduation.|$|R

Ifthe primary copy fails, one of the backup copies takes over and <b>resumes</b> processADing service <b>requests.</b> After each failure a new backup copy is created in order torestore the replication degree of the service. All mechanisms necessary to achieveand maintain fault tolerance can be added automatically to the code of a nonADfaulttolerant server, thus making fault tolerance completely transparent for the applicaADtion programmer...|$|R
5000|$|The {{period between}} October 31, 1998 and the {{initiation}} of Operation Desert Fox, December 16, 1998, contained talks by the Iraqi government with the United Nations Security Council. During these talks Iraq attempted to attach conditions {{to the work of}} UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which was against previous resolutions calling for unconditional access. The situation was defused after Iraq's Ambassador to the U.N., Nizar Hamdoon, submitted a third letter stating the position of the Iraqi government on October 31 was [...] "void". After weapons inspections <b>resumed,</b> UNSCOM <b>requested</b> arms documents related to weapon usage and destruction during the Iran-Iraq War. The Iraqi government rejected this request because it was handwritten and did not fall within the scope of the UN mandate. The UN inspectors insisted in order to know if Iraq destroyed all of its weapons, it had to know [...] "the total holdings of Iraq's chemical weapons." [...] Further incidents erupted as Iraqi officials demanded [...] "lists of things and materials" [...] being searched for during surprise inspections.|$|R

40|$|Preparations for {{conducting}} large-scale combustion tests with caking bituminous coal continued during {{the start of}} this quarter. Major project accomplishments related to bituminous coal testing included: a CFD preheat model and evaluation, an update of the process flow diagram and a detailed preheat burner mechanical design (suitable for construction) for firing bituminous coal. Installation and testing of the 85 MMBtu/h bituminous coal preheating system was planned to take place before the end of December. Based on the inability to conduct testing in Riley's Commercial Burner Test Facility (CBTF) during freezing weather, a schedule review indicated required site work for testing bituminous coal at the CBTF could not be completed before freezing weather set in at the site. Further bituminous preheat modification work was put on hold and efforts turned to securing the test facility over the winter season. Bituminous coal tests are therefore delayed; April-May 2005 is earliest estimate of when testing can <b>resume.</b> A <b>request</b> for a time extension was submitted to DOE to extend the project through September 2005 to allow time to secure additional funding and complete the bituminous coal testing. Removal of the PRB PC Preheater from the CBTF burner deck was completed. Decommissioning of the CBTF for the winter was also completed...|$|R
60|$|Many a time I used, in {{our conversations}} of the Canongate, to <b>resume</b> my <b>request</b> of assistance, from {{a sense that}} my friend was the most {{valuable}} depository of Scottish traditions that was probably now to be found. This was a subject on which my mind was so much made up that, when I heard her carry her description of manners so far back beyond her own time, and describe how Fletcher of Salton spoke, how Graham of Claverhouse danced, what were the jewels worn by the famous Duchess of Lauderdale, and how she came by them, I could not help telling her I thought her some fairy, who cheated us by retaining {{the appearance of a}} mortal of our own day, when, in fact, she had witnessed the revolutions of centuries. She was much diverted when I required her to take some solemn oath that she had not danced at the balls given by Mary of Este, when her unhappy husband occupied Holyrood in a species of honourable banishment; [The Duke of York afterwards James II., frequently resided in Holyrood House when his religion rendered him an object of suspicion to the English Parliament.] or asked whether she could not recollect Charles the Second when he came to Scotland in 1650, and did not possess some slight recollections of the bold usurper who drove him beyond the Forth.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{scheduling}} policy called latest preempted, earliest resumed (LPER) for personal communications services (PCS) systems that support voice services {{as well as}} the circuit mode data services. The policy gives priority to the voice services over the data services. The scheduling of voice requests is performed as if no data requests exist. Thus, if no idle channel is available when a voice request arrives, a data channel (if exists) is interrupted and the channel will be used for the voice request. The interrupted data <b>request</b> will be <b>resumed</b> when an idle channel is available. In LPER, the data channel selected for interruption is the one that serves the latest outstanding data request (i. e., other outstanding requests enter the system earlier than this request). When an occupied channel is released, LPER <b>resumes</b> the earliest <b>request</b> that entered the system. An analytic model is 1 proposed to study the performance of LPER and provides guidelines to select the input [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{characteristics}} of four-year public and private institutions employing women in top level administrative positions over three time periods: 1969 - 70, 1974 - 75, and 1978 - 79; and to develop a profile of the women who held chief administrative positions of President/Chancellor, Vice President, and Academic Dean during 1978 - 79. Comparisons were made between those institutions with and without women in top level administration in terms of the date of establishment, type of affiliation, geographic region, size of the institution, student body mix, and the highest degree granted by the institution. Where possible, comparisons were made across the three time periods and statistical significance of the comparisons were tested by chi square. The descriptive data were based on computer taped information from the National Center for Educational Statistics and Probability; The educational and professional background of the women were obtained from individual <b>resumes</b> <b>requested</b> from public relations offices of the institutions in this study;The number of institutions employing women in top level administration has almost doubled over the ten year period from 1969 to 1979. More women were employed in these positions by public institutions than private ones;A majority of the institutions with women administrators were those established during 1880 and 1919. A greater percent of those institutions in the South Central Region of the country had women administrators. When comparing the highest degree offered and the number of women administrators, a majority of the institutions that offered the bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree as the highest had women in top level positions. The greatest number of institutions with women administrators were those with a coed student body with an enrollment below 10, 000;The educational and professional background of the women who fit the criteria were located in 821 institutions. Of the 10, 795 positions identified with the title of President/Chancellor, Vice President, or Academic Dean, women held only 11. 6 percent of the positions. There were 2, 442 positions of President/Chancellor and women held 5. 9 percent of those. Women held 12. 6 percent of the Vice President positions and 14. 3 percent of the Academic Deans positions;Seventy percent of the women held a doctorate degree with 84. 2 percent of them receiving the doctorate between 1961 and 1979. Twenty-four percent of the women held the master 2 ̆ 7 s degree and 50 percent of them received the degree between 1961 and 1979. Education was the most frequent field of study. Forty percent majored in education and 20 percent in the humanities;Approximately one third of the women were appointed to their current position before 1974, 22 percent were appointed in 1975 - 76, and 20 percent in 1978 - 79. Over half of the women had been employed at the present institution for six years or less. Very few of the women received a degree from the institution where they were presently employed. More than eighty percent of the women came to the present position from inside the university community rather than from outside;Forty-six percent of the women had between one and nine years of teaching experience and over 60 percent had between one and nine years of administrative experience;These data indicated that some women had been able to combine marriage, a career and children...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a task of serving requests that arrive {{in an online}} fashion in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) with network function virtualization (NFV). Each request specifies an abstract routing and processing "plan" for a flow. Each processing function can be performed by a specified subset of servers in the system. The algorithm needs to either reject the request or admit it and return detailed routing (a. k. a. "path computation") and processing assignment ("function placement"). Each request also specifies the communication bandwidth and the processing load it requires. Components in the system (links and processors) have bounded capacity; a feasible solution may not violate the capacity constraints. Requests have benefits and {{the goal is to}} maximize the total benefit of accepted requests. In this paper we first formalize the problem, and propose a new service model that allows us to cope with requests with unknown duration. The new service model augments the traditional accept/reject schemes with a new possible response of "stand by. " Our main result is an online algorithm for path computation and function placement that guarantees, in each time step, throughput of at least Ω(OPT^*/ n), where n is the system size and OPT^* is an upper bound on the maximal possible throughput. The guarantee holds assuming that requests ask for at most an O(1 / n) -fraction of the capacity of any component in the system. Furthermore, the guarantee holds even though our algorithm serves requests in an all-or-nothing fashion using a single path and never preempts accepted flows, while OPT^* may serve fractional requests, may split the allocation over multiple paths, and may arbitrarily preempt and <b>resume</b> service of <b>requests...</b>|$|R
