30|$|The {{decolorization}} of MO and RhB under natural sunlight using RBA TNT catalysts {{are presented}} in Fig.  9 c–d. It is notable that MO was completely decolorized by the as-prepared TNT, TNT 250, and the reference anatase powder within the detection limit of 1.0  mg L− 1. TNT 450 decolorized MO up to 87 % in 2  h. The fastest decolorization of RhB was observed using the as-prepared TNT, whereas the decolorization using TNT 250, TNT 450, and anatase <b>reference</b> <b>powder</b> was approximately equal.

40|$|Mold powders {{are mainly}} formed of such oxides as SiO 2, CaO, Al 2 O 3, Na 2 O along with F − and C. One {{of the main}} con-stitutional composes of mold powders is F−, which is {{utilized}} in chemical composition of mold powders due to its fea-tures of controlling viscosity and producing desired lubrication between solidified steel shell and mold. However, the emission of F − through such compositions as HF (g) causes health and environmental problems. The purpose {{of this research is}} to decrease, and subsequently substitute, F − in chemical composition of a lubricating high speed powder, which is used in continuous casting of steel industry. A combination of Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 compositions to substitute F − in chemical composition of a fluorine-free mold powder was used to meet the purpose of this research. In addition, nine powder samples (A-I) with laboratory scale were prepared. In order to evaluate the samples ’ viscosity behavior, groove viscometer test and image analysis software was used and to evaluate the crystalline behavior of samples C and G, XRD and SEM analyses were conducted. The results of these analyses demonstrated that the fluorine-free sample, due to its viscosity resemblance in comparison with molten <b>reference</b> <b>powder</b> and through creation of such crystalline phases as Perovskite (CaTiO 3) and Fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4), will result in viscosity control of the mold powder and therefore optimizing continuous casting conditions.

The integral enthalpy of preferential satu-ration adsorption, AH,~, of n-BuOH on the surface was found to be a function of the BET surface area of the sample.

40|$|The use of {{portable}} X-ray stress analyzers, which utilize an area detector {{along with the}} newly adopted 'cosα' or full-ring fitting method, has recently attracted increasing interest. In laboratory conditions, these measurements are fast, convenient and precise because they employ a single-exposure technique that does not require sample rotation. In addition, the effects of grain size and orientation can be evaluated from the Debye ring recorded on the area detector prior to data analysis. The accuracy of the measured stress, however, has been questioned because in most cases just a single reflection is analyzed and the sample-to-detector distances are relatively short.

30|$|The {{photocatalytic}} decolorization of MO {{using the}} TNT powders presents a different trend between the samples of which one has an increased decolorization effect. Under UV light, TNT 350 presented {{the most prominent}} kinetic rate of 0.24  h− 1, whereas for sunlight, the most prominent rate was found for TNT 450 with 1.05  h− 1; however, the TiO 2 anatase <b>reference</b> <b>powder</b> was superior in both cases. Despite the comparatively small specific surface area, TNT 450 with the mixed crystal structure (anatase/brookite) exhibited the best photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared TNTs.

40|$|The Neutron Residual Stress Mapping Facility (NRSF 2) at HB- 2 B {{is a new}} generation-diffraction instrument, adding {{many new}} Second Generation features, such as larger beam tube, large sample XYZ goniometer, and KAPPA {{orienter}} for {{a broad range of}} materials behavior studies. One key feature is the NRSF 2 monochromator, which is a double focusing, double crystal monochromator system consisting of two sets of stacked Si crystal wafers. One set of wafers has Si[400] plane normal to the surface while the other set of wafers has the Si[500] normal to the surface. The monochromator crystal diffracts at a fixed diffraction angle of 88 {sup o} selecting a neutron wavelength determined by the monochromator d{sub hkl}-spacing. This 'Missouri' monochromator system has two independent monochromators, which enable diffraction from the following set of six diffraction planes: Si(511), Si(422), Si(331) AF (Anti-Fankuchen geometry), Si(400), Si(311), and Si(220). These diffraction planes can provide 6 different neutron wavelengths: approximately 1. 45, 1. 54, 1. 73, 1. 89 {angstrom}, 2. 27, and 2. 66 also incorporate seven position sensitive detectors located in a detector shield box. To use this advanced instrument for scientific and engineering measurements, careful calibration needs to be performed to accurately calibrate the seven position sensitive detectors, neutron wavelength, and 2 {theta}{sub 0 }. Just as in the X-ray diffraction technique, neutron diffraction directly measures the diffraction angle (2 {theta}) or diffraction peak position, then based on Bragg's law and a strain free lattice spacing, the strain can be calculated. Therefore anything that can affect the diffracting angle measurement can influence the accuracy of the strain measurements. The sources of difficulties in achieving accurate neutron diffraction peak positions can be classified into three categories. (1) Instrument - These difficulties come from alignment of the monochromator, alignment of the incident and detector slits, leveling of the sample table, 2 {theta}{sub 0 } offset, and response of the position sensitive detector; (2) Counting statistics - if the peak profile count is too low, then the peak position derived from fitting a profile and background will have larger error. Therefore, adequate counting statistics and well-defined peaks are always good for precise peak position determination; and (3) Sample - Large grain size materials make it difficult to get enough diffracting grains, contributing to the different profile. With a low number the peak becomes 'spot' and results in inaccuracy in peak position. Texture in the sample can change the effective elastic constants and also affect the peak intensity. Phase and composition inhomogeneity can make it difficult to determine an accurate stress-free d{sub 0 } for strain calculation. A partially buried gauge volume due to proximity to the sample surface or buried interface can also shift the peak position. The calibration method presented in this report will address the first two categories of difficulties listed above. The FWHM can be minimized for each sample d-spacing by adjusting the horizontal bending of the monochromator crystal. For the monochromator, the optimum FWHM lies between 70 and 110 degree. This range is selected in order to maintain an approximately equiaxed gauge volume and avoid significant increases in peak breadth for the detectors above and below the horizontal plane. To adequately calibrate the position sensitive detectors, 2 {theta}{sub 0 }, and wavelength, a set of high purity <b>reference</b> <b>powders</b> were selected. Since the selected <b>reference</b> <b>powders</b> have define grain size is, the measurement errors from sample grain size and texture can be excluded, although there may still be micro-strain in the powders, which can broaden the reference peak. In this report, the calibration procedure for the NRSF 2 instrument will be presented and calibration results for five monochromator settings from HFIR cycle 403 will be presented. The monochromator settings calibrated include Si(331) AF (Anti-Fankuche n geometry), Si(220), Si(511), Si(422), Si(400), and Si(311).

Upon desodiation the Na 3 Sb reverts to an amorphous phase, which then recrystallizes into Cu 2 Sb at full charge, indicating a high degree of structural reversibility. The structure after charging to 1 V is different from that of Cu 2 Sb, as indicated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and 121 Sb Mössbauer spectroscopy, and is due to the formation of an amorphous Na−Cu−Sb phase.

40|$|In {{the case}} of a {{hypothetical}} severe accident in a nuclear power plant, interactions of gaseous RuO 4 with reactor containment building surfaces (stainless steel and epoxy paint) could possibly lead to a black Ru-containing deposit on these surfaces. Some scenarios include the possibility of formation of highly radiotoxic RuO 4 (g) by the interactions of these deposits with the oxidising medium induced by air radiolysis, in the reactor containment building, and consequently dispersion of this species. Therefore, the accurate determination of the chemical nature of ruthenium in the deposits is of the high importance for safety studies. An experiment was designed to model the interactions of RuO 4 (g) with samples of stainless steel and of steel covered with epoxy paint. Then, these deposits have been carefully characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

40|$|Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry {{has become}} one of the most {{promising}} techniques for direct analysis of the element distribution in fish ears (otolith) [1; 2]. Especially the element ratios of Ca/Mg and Na, K, Sr, Mn and Ba concentrations provide information about the origin of a fish or reconstruction of migration pathways of fish [3]. The matrix of an otolith consists of Aragonite, which implements trace elements from its environment. Due to the daily growth of the otolith, high spatial resolved analyses are required to reconstruct the element pattern. As early LA-ICP-MS methods, which involved IR-Lasers, needed matrix matched standards due to significant differences in ablation behavior, early experiments focused on reference materials for such studies [4]. The last five years have demonstrated that the ablation behavior improved significantly when using lower wavelengths and led to more matrix independent calibrations [5]. Fast growing applications of LA-ICP-MS can be observed in studying the element distribution in biological materials [6] and environmental samples [7]. A good overview of successful applications have been recently summarized in Durrant [8]. Bones and other tissues have been analyzed using LA-ICP-MS and mostly in-house materials or pressed powder reference materials have been applied for calibration. For the analysis of otolith samples, a Canadian (FEBS- 1) and a Japanese <b>reference</b> <b>powder</b> (NIES- 022) are commercially available and their compositions are summarized in Table 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of the}} {{this work}} was to study {{feasibility}} of titanium dioxide thin films prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique on aluminum foam substrates for photocatalysis and compare performance of thin films with commercially available AEROXIDE® TiO 2. Formic acid and phenol photocatalytic decomposition was monitored using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The morphology and thickness of TiO 2 films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their structure was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surface of the thin films was characterized with Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The amount of TiO 2 deposited on aluminum foam was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). It was observed that initial rates of formic acid and phenol degradation were 0. 007 and 0. 001 mmol L− 1 min− 1, respectively. The apparent quantum yields for formic acid using immobilized and reference TiO 2 powder (AEROXIDE® TiO 2 P 25, Evonik) were 2. 2 and 2. 7 %, correspondingly. While for phenol apparent quantum yield was equal to 0. 4 % when TiO 2 thin film was used and 0. 7 % {{in the case of}} <b>reference</b> <b>powder.</b> A decrease of the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 films deposited on aluminum foam was observed after the first cycle for both model compounds. It was suggested from this study that suppression of activity occurs due to detachment of TiO 2 from the surface of thin film...|$|E
40|$|A tensonometer for {{stretching}} {{metal foils}} has been constructed {{for the study}} of strain broadening in X-ray diffraction line profiles. This device, which is designed for use on powder diffractometers and was tested on Station 2. 3 at Daresbury Laboratory, allows in situ measurements to be performed on samples under stress. It can be used for data collection in either transmission or reflection modes using either symmetric or asymmetric diffraction geometries. As a test case, measurements were carried out on an 18 μm-thick copper foil experiencing strain levels of up to 5 % using both symmetric reflection and symmetric transmission diffraction. All the diffraction profiles displayed peak broadening and asymmetry which increased with strain. The measured profiles were analysed by the fundamental-parameters approach using the TOPAS peak-fitting software. All the observed broadened profiles were modelled by convoluting a refineable diffraction profile, representing the dislocation and crystallite size broadening, with a fixed instrumental profile predetermined using high-quality LaB 6 <b>reference</b> <b>powder.</b> The deconvolution process yielded 'pure' sample integral breadths and asymmetry results which displayed a strong dependence on applied strain and increased almost linearly with applied strain. Assuming crystallite size broadening in combination with dislocation broadening arising from f. c. c. a/ 2 〈 110 〉{ 111 } dislocations, the variation of mechanical property with strain has been extracted. The observation of both peak asymmetry and broadening has been interpreted as a manifestation of a cellular structure with cell walls and cell interiors possessing high and low dislocation densities. 8 page(s...|$|E

This work aims at studying the influence of chemical composition, microstructure and surface energy on the flowability of the FHA particles which {{is known as a}} determinant property during plasma spraying for the quality of the product in terms of yield and homogeneity of composition. The as-synthesized FHA powder was sieved in order to obtain two ranges of particles size: 50 - 80 μm and 80 - 100 μm. The phase composition and structure and physical characteristics of FHA particles have been determined by complementary analytical techniques (X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron spectroscopy and laser granulometry). Then, the FHA flowability was determined as recommended by the European Pharmacopeia. The results showed that the 80 - 100 μm FHA powder has a longer flow time compared to a <b>reference</b> hydroxyapatite <b>powder</b> whereas the 50 - 80 μm FHA particles did not flow. We propose a simple treatment of the FHA particles using ethanol as solventwhich showed to significantly improve the flowability of FHA powders...|$|R

30|$|The milled powders had {{an average}} {{crystalline}} size of about 5 – 10 nm {{as determined by the}} Williamson-Hall method as shown in Table 1. Crystalline size values determined in this way may be low when the concentration of defects in the sample is higher compared to that in the <b>reference</b> large-particulate <b>powder.</b> The BET areas are vastly different for all the samples ranging between 5.5 and 211.2 m 2 /g as presented in Table 1. In the steady state, the BET surface area of the mechanically activated powders was determined to be about 211.2 m 2 /g for several samples (C 200, C 210, C 220 and …). Measuring the surface area of carbon nanostructures via nitrogen adsorption by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method revealed a specific surface area of 211.2 m 2 /g which seems relevant for surface area-dependent applications such as diffusion process. Assuming that all the particles are spherical and have the same theoretical density, and form:dBET = 6 /S · ρ, whereS is the surface area and ρ is the particle density (2.1 g/cm 3 for graphite), a BET particle diameter,dBET, of about 20 nm is found for these nanoparticles. These results are also consistent with the HRTEM image observations. Therefore, the obtained results of specific area (SA) and crystalline size (D) for milled graphite indicate that graphite particles are highly chemically active.|$|R
