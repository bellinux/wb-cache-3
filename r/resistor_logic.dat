5000|$|Germanium {{diffused}} junction transistors {{were used by}} IBM in their Saturated Drift Transistor <b>Resistor</b> <b>Logic</b> (SDTRL), used in the IBM 1620. (Announced Oct 1959) ...|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the logic}} {{circuitry}} of the 1401 was {{a type of}} diode-transistor logic (DTL), that IBM referred to as CTDL (Complemented Transistor Diode Logic). Other IBM circuit types used were referred to as: Alloy (some logic, but mostly various non-logic functions, named for the germanium-alloy transistors used), CTRL (Complemented Transistor <b>Resistor</b> <b>Logic,</b> a type of resistor-transistor logic (RTL)). Later upgrades (e.g., the TAU-9 tape interface) used a faster type of DTL using [...] "drift" [...] transistors (a type of transistor invented by Herbert Kroemer in 1953) for their speed, that IBM referred to as SDTDL (Saturated Drift Transistor Diode Logic). Typical logic levels of these circuits were (S & U Level) high: 0 V to -0.5V, low: -6 V to -12 V; (T Level) high: 6 V to 1 V, low: -5.5 V to -6 V.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This thesis {{considers}} the worst-case design of transistor circuits for {{the realization of}} Majority Logic. First the meaning of Majority Logic is discussed. The requirement of an odd number of inputs for the realization of Majority Logic is justified. The usefulness of Majority Logic in synthesizing a Boolean expression is shown with an example. Next, three separate circuits for the realization of Majority Logic are considered in detail. The three circuits are designated as: (1) Variable Threshold Transistor-Resistor Logic Circuit (VTTRL) (2) Variable Threshold Logic Circuit (VTL) (3) Transistor Tunnel-diode <b>Resistor</b> <b>Logic</b> Circuit (TTDRL). The three circuits are compared for their relative advantages and disadvantages...|$|E
25|$|RTL {{is only a}} {{behavioral}} model of the actual functionality of what the chip is supposed to operate under. It has no link to a physical aspect of how the chip would operate in real life at the materials, physics, and electrical engineering side. For this reason, {{the next step in}} the IC design process, physical design stage, is to map the RTL into actual geometric representations of all electronics devices, such as capacitors, <b>resistors,</b> <b>logic</b> gates, and transistors that will go on the chip.|$|R
50|$|Pull-up {{resistors}} may be discrete devices {{mounted on}} the same circuit board as the logic devices. Many microcontrollers intended for embedded control applications have internal, programmable pull-up <b>resistors</b> for <b>logic</b> inputs so that minimal external components are needed.|$|R
40|$|A {{high level}} {{synthesis}} for testability method is {{presented with the}} objective to generate testable <b>resistor</b> transistor <b>logic</b> designs from behavioral descriptions. The approach is formulated as an allocation problem and solved using an efficient genetic algorithm that generates cost-effective testable designs. We follow the allocation method with an automatic test point selection algorithm that trades off design area and delay with test quality. The method is implemented and design comparisons are reported. N/...|$|R
5000|$|Meandering stripes {{of varying}} lengths are {{sometimes}} used to form on-chip <b>resistors,</b> though most <b>logic</b> circuits {{do not need}} any resistors. The ratio {{of the length of}} the resistive structure to its width, combined with its sheet resistivity, determines the resistance.|$|R
50|$|A wired logic {{connection}} is a logic gate that implements boolean algebra (logic) using only passive components such as diodes and <b>resistors.</b> A wired <b>logic</b> connection can create an AND or an OR gate. The limitations are {{the inability to}} create a NOT gate {{and the lack of}} level restoration.|$|R
50|$|Placing a {{capacitor}} {{in parallel with}} each input resistor decreases the time needed for a driving stage to forward-bias a driven stage's base-emitter junction. Engineers and technicians use “RCTL” (<b>resistor</b> capacitor transistor <b>logic)</b> to designate gates equipped with “speed-up capacitors.” The Lincoln Laboratory TX-0 computer's circuits included some RCTL. However, methods involving capacitors were unsuitable for integrated circuits.|$|R
5000|$|Fairchild had {{not done}} well in the digital {{integrated}} circuit market. Their first line of ICs was the [...] "micrologic" [...] RTL (Resistor-Transistor-Logic) line which {{was used in the}} Apollo Guidance Computer. It had the advantage of being extremely simple - each inverter consisted of just one transistor and two <b>resistors.</b> The <b>logic</b> family had many drawbacks that had made it marginal for commercial purposes, and not well suited for military applications: the logic could only tolerate about 100 millivolts of noise - far too low for comfort. It was a while before Fairchild relied on more robust designs, such as DTL (diode-transistor-logic) which had much better noise margins.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of CMOS over NMOS logic {{is that both}} low-to-high and high-to-low output transitions are fast since the (PMOS) pull-up transistors have low resistance when switched on, unlike the load <b>resistors</b> in NMOS <b>logic.</b> In addition, the output signal swings the full voltage between the low and high rails. This strong, more nearly symmetric response also makes CMOS more resistant to noise.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A defect-tolerant {{design is}} {{presented}} for a demultiplexer circuit {{that is based}} on threshold logic. The design uses coding both to handle (i. e., tolerate) defects in the circuit and to improve the voltage margin in its gates. The following model is assumed for the defects: configured junctions can become either stuck open or stuck closed, and non-configured junctions can become shorted. Two realizations of the circuit are presented: one using conventional transistor circuitry, and the other using nano-scale components and wiring. The design presented in this paper demonstrates how a standard digital building-block circuit—a demultiplexer—can be efficiently protected against several types of defects simultaneously.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a purely electrical version of Maxwell’s demon {{which does not}} involve mechanically moving parts such as trapdoors, etc. It consists of a capacitor, <b>resistors,</b> amplifiers, <b>logic</b> circuitry and electronically controlled switches and uses thermal noise in resistors (Johnson noise) to pump heat. The only types of energy of importance in this demon are electrical energy and heat. We also demonstrate an entirely electrical version of Szilard’s engine, i. e., an information-controlled device that can produce work by employing thermal fluctuations. The only moving part is a piston that executes work, and the engine has purely electronic controls and it is free of the major weakness of the original Szilard engine in not requiring removal and repositioning the piston {{at the end of}} the cycle. For both devices, the energy dissipation in the memory and other binary informatics components are insignificant compared to the exponentially large energy dissipation in the analog part responsible for creating new information by measurement and decision. This result contradicts the view that the energy dissipation in the memory during erasure is the most essential dissipation process in a demon. Nevertheless the dissipation in the memory and information processing parts is sufficient to secure the Second Law of Thermodynamics. 1...|$|R
40|$|Atomically thin {{circuits}} {{have recently}} been explored for applications in next-generation electronics and optoelectronics and have been demonstrated with two-dimensional lateral heterojunctions. In order to form true 2 D circuitry from a single material, electronic properties must be spatially tunable. Here, we report tunable transport behavior which was introduced into single layer tungsten diselenide and tungsten disulfide by focused He$^+$ irradiation. Pseudo-metallic behavior was induced by irradiating the materials with a dose of ~ 1 x 10 $^{ 16 } He^+/cm^ 2 $ to introduce defect states, and subsequent temperature-dependent transport measurements suggest a nearest neighbor hopping mechanism is operative. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy reveal that Se is sputtered preferentially, and extended percolating networks of edge states form within WSe$_ 2 $ at a critical dose of 1 x 10 $^{ 16 } He^+/cm^ 2 $. First-principles calculations confirm the semiconductor-to-metallic transition of WSe$_ 2 $ after pore and edge defects were introduced by He$^+$ irradiation. The hopping conduction was utilized to direct-write <b>resistor</b> loaded <b>logic</b> circuits in WSe$_ 2 $ and WS$_ 2 $ with a voltage gain of greater than 5. Edge contacted thin film transistors were also fabricated with a high on/off ratio (> 10 $^ 6 $), demonstrating potential {{for the formation of}} atomically thin circuits. Comment: 6 figure...|$|R
