25|$|Tolkien was {{initially}} opposed to titles {{being given to}} each two-book volume, preferring instead the use of book titles: e.g. The Lord of the Rings: Vol. 1, The <b>Ring</b> <b>Sets</b> Out and The Ring Goes South; Vol. 2, The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring and The End of the Third Age. However these individual book titles were later scrapped, and after pressure from his publishers, Tolkien initially suggested the titles: Vol. 1, The Shadow Grows; Vol. 2, The Ring in the Shadow; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring or The Return of the King.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{decision}} to publish The Lord of the Rings in three volumes was made, Tolkien had hoped to publish the novel in one volume, possibly also combined with The Silmarillion. [...] However, he had proposed titles for the individual six sections. Of the two books that comprise what became The Fellowship of the Ring the first was to be called The First Journey or The <b>Ring</b> <b>Sets</b> Out. The name of the second was The Journey of the Nine Companions or The Ring Goes South. The titles The <b>Ring</b> <b>Sets</b> Out and The Ring Goes South {{were used in the}} Millennium edition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{titles of}} the volumes {{derive from the}} {{discarded}} names for the separate books of The Lord of the Rings. J. R. R. Tolkien conceived the latter as a single volume comprising six [...] "books" [...] plus extensive appendices, but the original publisher split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included into the third. The titles proposed by Tolkien for separate books were: Book I, The First Journey or The <b>Ring</b> <b>Sets</b> Out; Book II, The Journey of the Nine Companions or The Ring Goes South; Book III, The Treason of Isengard; Book IV, The Journey of the Ring-Bearers or The Ring Goes East; Book V, The War of the Ring; and Book VI, The End of the Third Age. The title The Return of the Shadow comes from a discarded name for Volume I.|$|E

With the {{assistance}} of the Ranger Strider, the four Hobbits escape pursuit by the Black Riders, servants of Sauron, and safely reach the Ford of Bruinen ("Flight to the Ford"). Awaiting them at the Elven settlement of Rivendell is Arwen, the beloved of Strider, whose true name is Aragorn, heir to the kingship of the Lands of Men ("The Song of Hope"). Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, calls a Council of Elves, Men and Dwarves at which it is decided that Frodo will carry the Ring to Mordor. The Fellowship of the <b>Ring</b> <b>sets</b> out from Rivendell: Frodo and his three fellow Hobbits, Aragorn, the human warrior Boromir, the Elf Legolas, the Dwarf Gimli, and the great wizard Gandalf the Grey. Arwen and the people of Rivendell invoke the holy power of the star Eärendil to protect and guide the Fellowship on its journey ("Star of Eärendil"). In the ancient, ruined Dwarf-mines of Moria, Gandalf confronts a Balrog, a monstrous creature of evil, and falls into the darkness.|$|E
50|$|For publication, {{the book}} was divided into three volumes: The Fellowship of the Ring (Books I and II), The Two Towers (Books III and IV), and The Return of the King (Books V and VI plus six appendices). This was due largely to post-war paper shortages, {{as well as being}} a way to keep down the price of the book. Delays in {{producing}} appendices, maps and especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped — on 29 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Houghton Mifflin published The Fellowship of the Ring on 21 October 1954, The Two Towers on 21 April 1955, and The Return of the King on 5 January 1956. The Return of the King was especially delayed. Tolkien did not like the title The Return of the King, believing it gave away too much of the storyline. Nor, moreover, was he happy with the title The Two Towers, as he felt that books III and IV were not really related, and as such the eponymous towers could be either Orthanc and Barad-dûr, or Minas Tirith and Barad-dûr, or Orthanc and Cirith Ungol. Tolkien was, in fact, opposed from the outset to titles being given to each volume, preferring instead the use of the book titles: i.e. The Lord of the Rings: Vol. 1, The <b>Ring</b> <b>Sets</b> Out and The Ring Goes South; Vol. 2, The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring and The End of the Third Age. However, due to pressure from his publishers, Tolkien considered the titles: Vol. 1, The Shadow Grows; Vol. 2, The Ring in the Shadow; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring or The Return of the King.|$|E
40|$|Address for {{correspondence}} Abstract. Ring {{information is}} {{a large part of}} the structural topology used to identify and characterize molecular structures. It is hence of crucial importance to obtain this information for a variety of tasks in computational chemistry. Many different approaches for “ring perception”, i. e., the extraction of cycles from a molecular graph, have been described. The chemistry literature on this topic, however, reports a surprisingly large number of incorrect statements about the properties of chemically relevant <b>ring</b> <b>sets</b> and, in particular, about the mutual relationships of different sets of cycles in a graph. In part these problems seem to have arisen from a sometimes rather idiosyncratic terminology for notions that are fairly standard in graph theory.

40|$|SummaryCytokinesis {{involves}} constriction of a contractile actomyosin ring. The mechanisms generating ring {{tension and}} setting the constriction rate remain unknown because {{the organization of the}} ring is poorly characterized, its tension was rarely measured, and constriction is coupled to other processes. To isolate ring mechanisms, we studied fission yeast protoplasts, in which constriction occurs without the cell wall. Exploiting the absence of cell wall and actin cortex, we measured ring tension and imaged ring organization, which was dynamic and disordered. Computer simulations based on the amounts and biochemical properties of the key proteins showed that they spontaneously self-organize into a tension-generating bundle. Together with rapid component turnover, the self-organization mechanism continuously reassembles and remodels the constricting ring. Ring constriction depended on cell shape, revealing that the ring operates close to conditions of isometric tension. Thus, the fission yeast <b>ring</b> <b>sets</b> its own tension, but other processes set the constriction rate...|$|E
40|$|New {{physics is}} being {{explored}} with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and with Intensity Frontier programs at Fermilab and KEK. The energy scale for new physics {{is known to}} be in the multi-TeV range, signaling the need for a future collider which well surpasses this energy scale. We explore a 10 ^ 34 cm^- 2 s^- 1 luminosity, 100 TeV pp̅ collider with 7 × the energy of the LHC but only 2 × as much NbTi superconductor, motivating the choice of 4. 5 T single bore dipoles. The cross section for many high mass states is 10 times higher in pp̅ than pp collisions. Antiquarks for production can come directly from an antiproton rather than indirectly from gluon splitting. The higher cross sections reduce the synchrotron radiation in superconducting magnets and the number of events per beam crossing, because lower beam currents can produce the same rare event rates. Events are more centrally produced, allowing a more compact detector with less space between quadrupole triplets and a smaller β^* for higher luminosity. A Fermilab-like p̅ source would disperse the beam into 12 momentum channels to capture more antiprotons. Because stochastic cooling time scales as the number of particles, 12 cooling <b>ring</b> <b>sets</b> would be used. Each set would include phase rotation to lower momentum spreads, equalize all momentum channels, and stochastically cool. One electron cooling ring would follow the stochastic cooling rings. Finally antiprotons would be recycled during runs without leaving the collider ring by joining them to new bunches with synchrotron damping. Comment: 11 pages, 20 figures, SESAPS 2015 Conference.
