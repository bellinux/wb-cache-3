25|$|Just as {{the fight}} between local {{authorities}} and the Government over rate-capping was starting in March 1985, the Government was deciding whether to proceed with {{a proposal for a}} new form of tax for local government replace to replace Rates, which would {{take the form of a}} flat <b>rate</b> <b>charge</b> for each individual adult resident living within the area of the local council. According to one published history of this reform, the fight and the acrimony over rate-capping helped to encourage the Government and the Prime Minister in particular to support this change. This proposal was eventually enacted as the Community Charge. For the 1986–87 financial year, twelve local authorities were rate-capped. Ten of them had been rate-capped the previous year (Basildon, Camden, Greenwich, Hackney, Haringey, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Southwark and Thamesdown); two were newly selected, Liverpool and Newcastle upon Tyne. The following year, 1987–88, saw 20 authorities rate-capped and in 1988–89 there were 17.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to compare}} the {{interest}} <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> by credit unions and banks (commercial and multiple) in order to check {{whether there are differences}} between the <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> for loans without personal assignment and the effects of this difference in interest <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> by banks in similar operations. The results show that although the <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> by credit unions are significantly lower {{there is no evidence that}} competition from credit unions make sufficient pressure to reduce the <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> by banks on the personal assignment credit lines. We also found results that show that credit unions tend to be installed in rural areas with lower homicide rates, lower population density, high quality of the judiciary system and a great number of households with income between half and three minimum wages per capita, i. e., places where there are signs of high social capital. ...|$|R

Such damage need not be physical but could be found in obstruction or denial of use but there no evidence of that in this case. In any event, based on the facts of this case, were distress damage feasant to be levied then the landowner or his agent could only seek the value of damages caused and nothing further.|$|E

50|$|Some {{types of}} calls are not charged, such as local calls (and {{internal}} calls) dialed directly by a telephone subscriber in Canada, the United States, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Ireland or New Zealand (Residential subscribers only). In most other areas, all telephone calls are charged {{a fee for}} the connection. Fees depend on the provider of the service, the type of service being used (a call placed from a landline or wired telephone will have one rate, and a call placed from a mobile telephone will have a different rate) and {{the distance between the}} calling and the called parties. In most circumstances, the calling party pays this fee. However, in some circumstances such as a reverse charge or collect call, the called party pays the cost of the call. In some circumstances, the caller pays a flat <b>rate</b> <b>charge</b> for the telephone connection and does not pay any additional charge for all calls made.
