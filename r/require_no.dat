5|$|An air well or aerial well is a {{structure}} or device that collects water by promoting the condensation of moisture from air. Designs for air wells are many and varied, but the simplest designs are completely passive, <b>require</b> <b>no</b> external energy source and have few, if any, moving parts.|$|E
5|$|All new MRT lines built {{since the}} North East Line in 2003 are {{equipped}} with moving block CBTC from the outset, and {{have the capability to}} be completely driverless and automated, <b>require</b> <b>no</b> onboard staffing. Operations are monitored remotely from the operations control centre of the respective lines. Trains {{are equipped with}} intercoms to allow passengers to communicate with staff in emergencies.|$|E
5|$|M. spinosissima {{thrive in}} well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. They prefer low {{humidity}} and full, filtered sun. Plants are typically watered {{once every two}} or three weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. They <b>require</b> <b>no</b> pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} first {{conceived}} by executive producers Julie Gardner and Russell T Davies, {{who decided to}} air an interstitial scene for Children in Need 2007. Gardner asked Steven Moffat to write the special, with the stipulations the scene could be shot in one day and one set, and <b>require</b> <b>no</b> CGI effects. Peter Davison was approached to reprise {{his role as the}} Fifth Doctor in July 2007, and accepted the role to impress his children. The episode was officially announced by the BBC on 21 October.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons {{which can be}} collected and freely switched by players throughout the game and <b>require</b> <b>no</b> reloading. Weapons that are recurrent throughout the series make a return, including the super shotgun and BFG 9000. The BFG has a very small ammunition capacity but is extremely powerful. Similarly, the chainsaw returns but has been reintroduced as a special-use weapon that relies upon fuel, but {{can be used to}} instantly cut through enemies and provide a greater-than-normal drop of ammunition for the player.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and <b>require</b> <b>no</b> birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E

50|$|The V-Prop {{has both}} 2-bladed and 3-bladed versions, {{but only for}} {{clockwise}} rotation (as seen from the cockpit). The advantage of the V-Prop {{is that it is}} very light and compact, it <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> exterior power source, is fail-safe, and being completely automatic, <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> pilot input.|$|R
50|$|UCL {{has been}} {{designed}} to be simple enough that a decompressor can be implemented in just a few hundred bytes of code. UCL <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> additional memory to be allocated for decompression, a considerable advantage that means that a UPX packed executable usually <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> additional memory.|$|R
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally <b>require</b> <b>no</b> special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E
5|$|The {{examination}} {{consists of}} six problems. Each problem is worth seven points, so the maximum total score is 42 points. No calculators are allowed. The examination is held over two consecutive days; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. The problems chosen are from various areas {{of secondary school}} mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They <b>require</b> <b>no</b> knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often short and elementary. However, they are usually disguised {{so as to make}} the solutions difficult. Prominently featured are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years the latter has not been as popular as before.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and <b>require</b> <b>no</b> special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E

5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in conjunction with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and <b>require</b> <b>no</b> magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is a spectrum disorderâ€”its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are mild and <b>require</b> <b>no</b> treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, {{to the extent that}} casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E
