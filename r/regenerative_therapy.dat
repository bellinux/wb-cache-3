40|$|Cell-based <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapies,</b> {{based on}} in vitro {{propagation}} of stem cells, offer tremendous hope to many individuals suffering from degenerative diseases {{that were previously}} deemed untreatable. Due to the self-renewal capacity, multilineage potential, and immunosuppressive property, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as an attractive source of stem cells for <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapies.</b> However, poor growth kinetics, early senescence, and genetic instability during in vitro expansion and poor engraftment after transplantation {{are considered to be}} among the major disadvantages of MSC-based <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapies.</b> A number of complex inter- and intracellular interactive signaling systems control growth, multiplication, and differentiation of MSCs in their niche. Common laboratory conditions for stem cell culture involve ambient O 2 concentration (20 %) in contrast to their niche where they usually reside in 2 – 9 % O 2. Notably, O 2 {{plays an important role in}} maintaining stem cell fate in terms of proliferation and differentiation, by regulating hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) mediated expression of different genes. This paper aims to describe and compare the role of normoxia (20 % O 2) and hypoxia (2 – 9 % O 2) on the biology of MSCs. Finally it is concluded that a hypoxic environment can greatly improve growth kinetics, genetic stability, and expression of chemokine receptors during in vitro expansion and eventually can increase efficiency of MSC-based <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapies...</b>|$|R

50|$|Selectins are {{involved}} in projects to treat osteoporosis, a disease that occurs when bone-creating cells called osteoblasts become too scarce. Osteoblasts develop from stem cells, and scientists hope to eventually be able to treat osteoporosis by adding stem cells to a patient’s bone marrow. Researchers have developed {{a way to use}} selectins to direct stem cells introduced into the vascular system to the bone marrow. E-selectins are constitutively expressed in the bone marrow, and researchers have shown that tagging stem cells with a certain glycoprotein causes these cells to migrate to the bone marrow.

30|$|Stem cells {{encompass}} all cells {{capable of}} generating multiple types of cells through differentiation, {{and they are}} known to be useful resources to develop <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapies</b> [6 – 9]. Stem cells are generally categorized into cells with pluripotency (e.g., embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells), and cells with multipotency (e.g., mesenchymal, hematopoietic, neural stem cells) [10]. Despite the limited capability for differentiation of multipotent stem cells compared to that of pluripotent stem cells, multipotent cells are still considered to be promising candidates for use in <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapies</b> since they are easy to obtain without encountering ethical issues and, most importantly, are relatively free from teratoma formation/tumor development [11].|$|R

50|$|Most {{stem cells}} {{intended}} for <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapy</b> are generally isolated {{either from the}} patient's bone marrow or from adipose tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into the cells that make up bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, as well as muscle, neural and other progenitor tissues, they have been the main type of stem cells studied {{in the treatment of}} diseases affecting these tissues. The number of stem cells transplanted into damaged tissue may alter efficacy of treatment. Accordingly, stem cells derived from bone marrow aspirates, for instance, are cultured in specialized laboratories for expansion to millions of cells. Although adipose-derived tissue also requires processing prior to use, the culturing methodology for adipose-derived stem cells is not as extensive as that for bone marrow-derived cells. While it is thought that bone-marrow derived stem cells are preferred for bone, cartilage, ligament, and tendon repair, others believe that the less challenging collection techniques and the multi-cellular microenvironment already present in adipose-derived stem cell fractions make the latter the preferred source for autologous transplantation.|$|E

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{options for}} patients suffering from {{ischemic heart disease}} (IHD) are limited, and worldwide 23 million patients suffer from heart failure (HF).

Since cardiac regenerative therapies have shown promising results in basic science studies, the attention for cardiac <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapy</b> has been overwhelming in the last decade. Nevertheless the clinical benefits are still modest, and do not always prevent progression of the disease towards end stage HF. The appealing promise of cardiac <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapy</b> to be readily available as a low cost and effective treatment is once more accelerated by the enormous developments in the field of bio-technology in combination with a strong scientific competition. Besides the medical and biological aspects of the therapy, topics concerning the optimal injection strategy and the optimal endpoints to assess the therapy have been underexposed. Standard clinical techniques have been used, whereas specialized techniques might be more effective and better suited in the crucial phase of further development of a promising therapy.

40|$|Latest Development of Guided Tissue Regeneration and Guided Bone Regeneration Membrane as <b>Regenerative</b> <b>Therapy</b> on Periodontal Tissue. Periodontitis is a patological {{state which}} {{influences}} {{the integrity of}} periodontal system {{that could lead to}} the destruction of the periodontal tissue and end up with tooth loss. Currently, there are so many researches and efforts to regenerate periodontal tissue, not only to stop the process of the disease but also to reconstruct the periodontal tissue. Periodontal <b>regenerative</b> <b>therapy</b> aims at directing the growth of new bone, cementum and periodontal ligament on the affected teeth. Regenerative procedures consist of soft tissue graft, bone graft, roots biomodification, guided tissue regeneration and combination of the procedures, including restorative surgical procedure that is connected with oral rehabilitation with implant placement. At cellular phase, periodontal regeneration is a complex process with well-organized proliferation, distinction, and development of various type of cell to form attachment of periodontal tissue. Rationalization of the use of guided tissue regeneration as barrier membrane is to prohibit the penetration of epithelial and connective tissue migration into the defect, to maintain space, and to stabilize the clot. This research discusses: 1. Healing process on periodontal therapy including regeneration, repair or formation of new attachment. 2. Periodontal specific tissue engineering. 3. Various commercially available membrane/guided tissue regeneration in the market with its advantages and disadvantages and their characteristics. 4.
