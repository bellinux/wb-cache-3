5|$|In 1956 Mikoyan helped Khrushchev {{organize}} the Secret Speech, which Khrushchev {{delivered to the}} 20th Party Congress, that denounced Stalin's personality cult. It was he, and not Khrushchev, who made the first anti-Stalinist speech at the 20th Congress. Along with Khrushchev, he helped roll {{back some of the}} stifling restrictions on nationalism and culture imposed during Stalin's time. In 1954, he visited his native Armenia and gave a speech in Yerevan, where he encouraged Armenians to <b>republish</b> the works of Raffi and the purged writer Yeghishe Charents.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Rah and the Muggles is {{currently}} out of print. In early 2001, {{it was published}} by Thurman House, LLC, a Maryland publishing company. Thurman House, formed by Ottenheimer Publishers to <b>republish</b> the works of Nancy Stouffer, was closed when Ottenheimer ceased operations in 2002 after filing for bankruptcy. Stouffer later asserted that any copies of the book published by Thurman House are unauthorized because the publisher failed to honour its contractual obligations to her.|$|E
5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to <b>republish</b> Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} book {{mentioned}} above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to <b>republish</b> A Letter to a Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples {{in the philosophy of}} nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the power}} {{struggle}} after Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev {{emerged as the}} country's new leader. In a secret speech he gave in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his domestic policies largely loosened the government's grip over the country. Khrushchev put more resources into the production of consumer goods and housing. Almost immediately, Armenia underwent a cultural and economic rebirth. Religious freedom, to a limited degree, was granted to Armenia when Catholicos Vazgen I assumed the duties of his office in 1955. One of Khrushchev's advisers and close friends, Armenian Politburo member Anastas Mikoyan, urged Armenians to reaffirm their national identity. In 1954, he gave a speech in Yerevan where he encouraged them to <b>republish</b> the works of writers such as Raffi and Charents. The massive statue of Stalin that towered over Yerevan was pulled down from its pedestal by troops literally overnight and replaced in 1962 with that of Mother Armenia. Contacts between Armenia and the Diaspora were revived, and Armenians from abroad began to visit the republic more frequently.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Data <b>Republishing</b> is {{a recent}} Social Web {{phenomenon}} which {{can be observed in}} different areas of the Social Web. However, current Data <b>Republishing</b> tools don’t work in the emerging context of the Semantic Web. In particular, these tools neither generate any semantic metadata which provide information about the <b>republished</b> content (e. g., provenance information) nor are they able to make use of existing semantic metadata annotating the original content being <b>republished.</b> In this work we introduce the concept of Semantic Data <b>Republishing</b> and describe how to implement it...|$|R

In 1956, {{he was at}} Lima, where he met the Romanian writer-violinist Grigore Cugler. The two began a correspondence, with Baciu persuading Cugler to <b>republish</b> his 1930s avant-garde stories. He prepared for publishing Cugler's Afară de unul singur, but the manuscript {{was lost in the}} process (although an earlier print was eventually recovered in 1998).

25|$|With his {{training}} in Turkish, Persian, and the classical languages, Adam F. Kollár {{was able to}} edit and publish or <b>republish</b> numerous manuscripts and earlier volumes from the collections of the Imperial-Royal Library. His annotated editions of texts in the languages of the Middle East area became particularly respected. As Kollár says in the introduction, he rediscovered the Turkish and Arabic fonts used by Mesgnien-Meninski in 1680 and employed them to reissue Mesgnien-Meninski's Turkish grammar. Kollár added transcriptions, texts of various treaties with the Ottoman Empire, translated it to Latin and added Arabic and Persian versions.|$|E
25|$|The {{culmination}} of material spanning back to 1993 resulted in two lengthy songs, each about 20 minutes in length. After the record's release, the band {{became interested in}} touring the United States. In order to make headway, they sent a copy of their album to the Chicago-based record label Kranky. Impressed by the recording, Kranky offered to <b>republish</b> the album on compact disc. The band quickly returned to the studio and re-recorded the album, which was released in June 1998. Changes to the album included the addition, subtraction and reorganization of material, resulting in three tracks and slightly over an hour of music.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, two {{newspapers}} in New Zealand decided to <b>republish</b> controversial Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. The Muslim community registered their displeasure through press statements {{and a small}} peaceful march in Auckland. The editors {{said they did not}} mean offence but would not back down. Prime Minister Helen Clark and opposition leader Don Brash both made statements that the cartoons were not appreciated if they deeply offended members of the New Zealand community, but that such decisions were for editors to make, not politicians. Muslim leaders and the editors got together with the Race Relations office, and Jewish and Christian representatives in Wellington. As a result of this meeting the editors said they would not apologise but in good faith would refrain from publishing the offending images again. The New Zealand Muslim leadership, through the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIAN]Z, then proceeded in good faith to consider the matter closed, and drafted letters to 52 Muslim countries reversing their earlier stance and asking that New Zealand products not be boycotted.|$|E
25|$|Joint authorship of articles, {{in which}} {{different}} users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, {{can also cause}} editors to become tenants in common of the copyright, {{making it impossible to}} <b>republish</b> without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing. However, where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable. Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership.

25|$|Roth's work became {{increasingly}} varied throughout the 1970s. He exhibited manufacturing instructions - the Order Form Exhibitions - {{for the first}} show, any buyer could take the directions to a printer of their choice, and create their own print or multiple; second time around, the instructions {{had to be taken}} to a baker to create the collector's own baked goods. The same attitude applied to collectors; his most important collector, the German dentist Hanns Sohm, made his own Literature Sausages to Roth's instructions, including Georg Wilhelm Friedrih Hegel’s Work in 20 Volumes. He published the magazine Zeitschrift für Alles (Review for Everything) 1975–1987, promised to publish anything that anyone sent to Roth, the only editorial constraint being the limit of 4 (later 5) pages. By the time Roth announced its demise, the journal had grown to 1396 pages long. The mid seventies also saw a comprehensive attempt to <b>republish</b> all of Roth's bookworks. Instigated by Hansjörg Mayer, a publisher Roth had met in 1963, the Gesammelte Werke (Collected Works) would run to 26 volumes, many of which are still easily available across Europe and America.|$|E
