5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Air Force {{play of the}} second half, quarterback Chance Harridge <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> {{the middle of the}} field for a 21-yard gain. The Falcons {{followed}} that first-down play with a series of rushes that resulted in another first down, this time in Virginia Tech territory. But as the Hokies had done before them, the Falcons faltered inside opposition territory. Instead of punting the ball, however, Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the needed twoyards on fourth down. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Tech's offense returned to the field with 7:40 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
30|$|The {{thickness}} of the deposits seems {{to be related to}} the tsunami <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height in comparable transects from Phang Nga coast (Fig. 7, Table 1). The thickest deposits are in transects with the highest <b>run</b> <b>up.</b> The averaged tsunami deposit layer thickness for a coast with a tsunami <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height less than 6 m is 8.5 cm (29 measurements), and for the sites with a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> greater than 6.0 m, 11.4 cm (34 measurements). The trends of tsunami deposits thickness also differ with regard to the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 1). In the case of the smaller <b>run</b> <b>up</b> transects, the maximum thickness is usually closer to the shoreline, and then the deposits generally become thinner landward (transects 3 and 4 in Fig. 3, and transect 10 in Fig. 4). In some of the areas with the highest <b>run</b> <b>ups,</b> the deposit thickness increase inland until it reached approximately 1 / 3 of the inundation distance, where the maximum is observed, and then the deposits thin landward (transects 1, 5 and 6 in Fig. 3). The fourth transect in this group (transect 7, Fig. 4) revealed three maxima, located at approximately 100, 450 and 600 m landward, separated by areas covered by thinner deposits. The thickest deposits are found in a depression, and their deposition was probably enhanced by the local topography.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating the waves <b>run</b> <b>up</b> for a large semi-submersible production platform. Significant run-up evaluations on its squared-section columns were observed for the waves in operating design displacement. Some seed numbers generated JONSWAP waves in tank were used, and are generally regarded as a pure randomness in nature. Some identical sequences of relatively waves <b>run</b> <b>up</b> were found apart from one another for different seeds. This finding supports the recurrence of waves <b>run</b> <b>up</b> for the large semisubmersible platform...|$|R
40|$|The wave <b>run</b> <b>up</b> under semi-submersible {{platform}} deck and the dynamic response are important design factors, {{and determine the}} expected minimum air gap in extreme design conditions. For a semi-submersible, the prediction of probabilities wave <b>run</b> <b>up</b> in harsh environments is a challenging task. This paper addresses the problem of expressing the probability density and cumulative distribution functions that utilize Weibull distribution to model estimates the waves <b>run</b> <b>up</b> for a large volume semi-submersible squared-section columns platform in two sea states. The two parameters Weibull distribution, namely shape parameter and scale parameter were considered. The analysis interpreted the measured data of 9 realizations with different seeds in the moored model experiments. The length of total measured data analyzed included approximately 9 times 250 waves for each sea state. The wave <b>run</b> <b>up</b> was found by model estimates using a Rayleigh distribution, and some waves <b>run</b> <b>up</b> were identical apart from one another for different seeds. Finally, by this model with a sequence return for two sea states the associated motions distribution for the large volume {{semi-submersible platform}} were numerically predicted...|$|R

30|$|A massive {{appearance}} is observed in approximately 45 % of the investigated sites (Figs. 3 and 4). These deposits lack clear {{change in their}} grain size or macroscopically visible laminations. The massive structure is observed in deposits of various thickness, grain size (both in sand and muds) and distance from the shoreline. The massive layers are more common in areas with smaller <b>run</b> <b>up</b> (more than 50 %) than in the regions with a higher <b>run</b> <b>up</b> (approximately 40 %). A normal grading (fining upward) {{is the most common}} appearance of the IOT layers. Along the Phang Nga coast it is found in almost 70 % of the sites with a low <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height and in almost all of the sites with a higher <b>run</b> <b>up</b> (Table 1). A reverse grading is found only in 2 trenches located less than 200 m from the shoreline, forming the lowermost part of the tsunami deposits. Frequently, tsunami deposits are laminated. In the areas with higher <b>run</b> <b>up</b> more than 25 % of the sites reveal a plane lamination. In the sites with lower <b>run</b> <b>up</b> and in the sites located more than 450 m from the coastline the plane lamination is less common. Cross lamination is less frequent and is found in a few sites close to the shoreline. The scour and fill structures recording two distinct depositional events are found in 5 trenches located within 200 m of the coastline in areas with a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> > 6 m.|$|R

He continued to play club cricket and in 1924–25 he managed a privately organised tour of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Korketrekkeren was {{originally}} part of Frognerseterveien, a road which <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> to Frognerseteren. It {{was completed in}} 1867 to the orders of landlord Thomas Johannessen Heftye, who had been purchasing forest properties in the area. The section between Svendstuen and Frognerseteren gradually became known as Korktrekkeren. Holmen- og Voksenkollselskapet was established in 1888 and undertook a series of public infrastructure investments in the area, including the construction of roads, skiing trails, natural tobagganing tracks and a chapel. The property was given to Kristiania Municipality (today Oslo Municipality) in 1894. Tobagganing became a popular sport from the 1880s and Holmen- og Voksenkollselskapet rented out sleds which were permitted to be used on roads and designated tracks after 19:00 on evenings with moonlight.|$|E
5|$|On the Tar Heels' {{first play}} of the game, running back Jonathan Linton <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> the middle for a three-yard gain.

Now inside Virginia Tech territory, Linton ran for a five-yard gain, which {{was followed by a}} pass from Keldorf to Linton, who gained 26 yards on the play. Following the catch, North Carolina had a first down at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line. Linton left the field limping slightly, and backup running Mike Geter replaced him, then ran for four yards up the middle. Geter was stopped for no gain on the next play, and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete. North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29-yard field goal, which was good.

The Scotland Test was approaching, and the All Blacks decided to rest several players, Hunter, Billy Stead, Selling and George Gillett. Cambridge's kicking game, and fast backs helped them to {{restrict}} the score to 14–0 to the All Blacks. Two days later the All Blacks faced Richmond, and scored five tries to register a 17–0 victory. Their last game before the Scotland Test was against a Bedford XV in Richmond. There were four All Black tries in the first half, and six in the second. The final score was 41–0; the All Blacks had now scored over 600 points on tour.|$|E
5|$|The temple pattern could vary considerably, {{apart from}} the {{distorting}} effect of additional construction. Many temples, known as hypogea, were cut entirely into living rock, as at Abu Simbel, or had rock-cut inner chambers with masonry courtyards and pylons, as at Wadi es-Sebua. They used much the same layout as free-standing temples but used excavated chambers rather than buildings as their inner rooms. In some temples, like the mortuary temples at Deir el-Bahari, the processional path <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> a series of terraces rather than sitting on a single level. The Ptolemaic Temple of Kom Ombo was built with two main sanctuaries, producing two parallel axes that run {{the length of the}} building. The most idiosyncratic temple style was that of the Aten temples built by Akhenaten at el-Amarna, in which the axis passed through a series of entirely open courts filled with altars.|$|E
