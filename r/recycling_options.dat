Regarding these last items, {{in the frame of}} some EU projects (GCFR, PUMA, and RAPHAEL), we analyzed symbiotic fuel cycles coupling current LWRs with HTRs, finally closing the cycle by GCFRs. Particularly, we analyzed fertile-free and Pu-Th-based fuel in HTR: we improved plutonium exploitation also by optimizing Pu/Th ratios in the fuel loaded in an HTR. Then, we chose GCFRs to burn residual MA. We have started the calculations on simplified models, but we ended them using more “realistic” models of the reactors. In addition, we have added the GCFR multiple <b>recycling</b> <b>option</b> using keff calculations for all the reactors.

The work also shows that sulfur doping creates additional redox sites for reaction with Na+ and induces larger interspacing layers, leading to an enhanced capacity compared to the non-doped graphene. The self-standing nature of the films also eliminates the need for other additional anode components, such as conductive carbon or binder, and more importantly, allows their recovery and subsequent reuse in new applications...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the increased runoff that results from plasticulture, {{there is also the}} problem of the increased amount of waste form the plastic mulch itself. The use of plastic mulch for vegetables, strawberries, and other row and orchard crops exceeds 110 million pounds annually in the United States. Most plastic ends up in the landfill, although there are other disposal options such as disking mulches into the soil, on-site burying, on-site storage, reuse, recycling, and incineration. The incineration and <b>recycling</b> <b>options</b> are complicated by the variety of the types of plastics that are used and by the geographic dispersal of the plastics. Plastics also contain stabilizers and dyes as well as heavy metals, which limits the amount of products that can be recycled. Research is continually being conducted on creating biodegradable or photodegradable mulches. While there has been minor success with this, there is also the problem of how long the plastic takes to degrade, as many biodegradable products {{take a long time to}} break down.|$|E
50|$|Oakland {{categorized}} {{the source}} of waste by the individual or group that submitted the waste to the City for disposal in landfills, (1) Non-residential or commercial sources and (2) Residential, including single family or multi-family sources. At the time, 67% of waste was generated by non-residential sources, and residents produced 33%. Of this non-residential group, 30% was being hauled to landfills by entities over which the City had minimal control (those that haul their own garbage to the landfill), such as Cal Trans, AC Transit, BART and independent contractors. Of the 400,000 tons of material transferred to landfills, 67% could be recycled using city operations already established. Regional recovery and diversion options existed in 2006 for paper, glass, metals, plastics, yard trimmings, food, clean wood, concrete, asphalt, and roofing. The City recognized that it could minimize the transfer of these materials with additional focus on improving separation of materials, messaging to businesses regarding diversion and <b>recycling</b> <b>options</b> and stronger incentives.|$|E

40|$|Closed-loop {{recycling}} of construction and demolition waste in Germany {{in view of}} stricter environmental threshold values Recycling of construction and demolition waste contributes decisively to the saving of natural mineral resources. In Ger-many, processed mineral construction and demolition waste from structural engineering is used nearly exclusively in civil engineering (earthwork and road construction sector) as open-loop recycling. Due to the planned stricter limit values {{for the protection of}} soil and water, however, this recycling path in civil engineering may no longer be applicable in the future. According to some new guidelines and standards adopted recently, recycled aggregates may also be used for concrete production in the structural engineering sector (closed-loop recycling). Wastes from the structural engineer-ing sector can thus be kept in a closed cycle, and their dis-posal on a landfill can be avoided.

40|$|Forty-nine {{states have}} {{developed}} site assessment tools (Phosphorus (P) indices) to rank agricultural fields based on vulnerability to P loss. Because long-term biosolids application causes accumulation of soil P above concentrations needed for optimum crop yields, land-based recycling programs may be {{adversely affected by}} deployment of P management policies. Ninety-five active biosolids recycling fields were evaluated using the Pennsylvania P index. Without accounting for biosolids P solubility, only 22 of 95 fields qualify for standard nitrogen (N) -based biosolids application rates. Using biosolids-specific P source coefficients, based on laboratory testing, 76 fields could be managed by applying biosolids to satisfy crop N needs. Changes in crop management practices, biosolids application methods, and variables affecting crop / conservation practices were also evaluated as options for decreasing the overall P index ratings for the fields.

5000|$|Waste may {{be defined}} {{differently}} in legislation and regulations {{of the federal government}} or individual states. Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations dealing with protection of the environment contains at least four different definitions of waste at sections 60.111b, 61.341, 191.12 and 704.83. Definitions may apply broadly to solid, liquid, and gaseous forms or may be specific to one or a subset identified by a threshold characteristic such as toxicity or radioactivity.

5000|$|Indeed, {{as late as}} 2006, the City of Oakland offered {{incentives}} for businesses to haul garbage to a landfill, rather than consider reuse and <b>recycling</b> <b>options.</b> Additionally, Oakland recognized in 2006 {{that a lack of}} service providers for recycling and recovery efforts had prevented progress toward environmentally sustainable solutions. Also, the City had never set aside land needed for reuse and recycling business materials. In this way, incentives and the marketplace were working against the City’s environmental concerns. In fact, most product consumption serves to undermine a Zero Waste Policy because of the inherent negative “externalities,” or those factors outside the market transaction, which are not accounting for in the cost of producing and consuming an item. Historically, prices for toys, watches, cars, etc., have not covered the costs associated with disposing or recycling these items. Oakland will remedy this flaw in the system by working toward shifting the responsibility of material disposal to the manufacturer instead of the government or the consumer. Further, rather than apply the tax base toward cleanup of contaminated landfills, the Zero Waste system will use the tax base to invest in recycling, composting and reuse facilities, called “Resource Recovery Parks.” ...|$|E

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{radioactive materials}} (NORM) sometimes accumulate inside {{pieces of equipment}} associated with {{oil and gas production}} and processing activities. Typically, the NORM accumulates when radium that is present in solution in produced water precipitates out in scale and sludge deposits. Scrap equipment containing residual quantities of these NORM-bearing scales and sludges can present a waste management problem if the radium concentrations exceed regulatory limits or activate the alarms on radiation screening devices installed at most scrap metal recycling facilities. Although NORM-contaminated scrap metal currently is not disposed of by re-melting, this form of recycling could present a viable disposition option for this waste stream. Studies indicate that re-melting NORM-contaminated scrap metal is a viable <b>recycling</b> <b>option</b> from a risk-based perspective. However, a myriad of economic, regulatory, and policy issues have caused the recyclers to turn away virtually all radioactive scrap metal.

40|$|Adverse {{impacts of}} climate change are evident in many {{regions of the world}} and are likely to get worse in the future. Ever {{increasing}} urbanisation is also adding to the magnitude of severity in regards to both quantity and quality. Urban water resources and components of water cycles are likely to be affected severely. To minimise consequences on world water resources, a sustainable water resources management strategy is inevitable. Water conservation in general is a salient part of sustainable water resources management. From very early periods in time, mankind has been practicing several methods of water conservation. However, with the current global scenario, it has become more crucial to look at these methods more scientifically with a sustainable approach. Recently, to tackle water scarcity and to achieve sustainability, water recycling has been promoted around the world. This book describes several water conservation and <b>recycling</b> <b>options,</b> practices, consequences and future implications showing case studies in different countries around the world. Among all the water <b>recycling</b> <b>options,</b> stormwater and greywater recycling is easily achievable. Initial chapters of the book deal with stormwater harvesting options through rainwater tanks in household scale; design optimisation, and water savings and reliability of such systems around different cities of the world. A review of traditional design practice and future efficient design methodology is also outlined. Also, a scientific approach for selecting an appropriate stormwater system at the authority/institutional level has been proposed.

40|$|Increasing {{production}} of corn masa for tortillas, chips, and related snack foods is resulting {{in large quantities}} of organic residuals requiring environmentally-sound management strategies. This study focused on developing value-added livestock feed from these processing byproducts. First, a complete physical and nutritional analysis was conducted. Laboratory-scale and pilot-scale extrusion trials were then performed. Finally, to assess the actual viability of a livestock feed material, an economic model was developed. Through a series of simulation runs with this model, {{it was determined that}} direct shipping was by far the most inexpensive means of recycling masa processing residuals as feed ingredients (10 to 57 $/Mg). Blending prior to shipping resulted in increased costs (3 to 15 times greater). Extrusion and pellet mill processing were considerably more expensive than direct shipping (5 to 18 times, and 4 to 18 times greater, respectively), while dehydration was clearly cost prohibitive (33 to 81 times greater). Based on this cost analysis, it is recommended that direct shipping and feeding to livestock be implemented as the <b>recycling</b> <b>option</b> of choice for masa processing byproducts.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} <b>recycling</b> as one <b>option</b> {{to improve}} the environmental performance of industry in the UK. A systems approach is used to identify objectives and capabilities of legislative and industrial agencies and to analyse issues in the broad context of waste policy formulation and implementation which spans both constituencies. It is shown that regulatory change to empower industrialists as decision takers is limited by a shortage of recycling infrastructure in the UK. Although well resourced firms are developing progressive waste policies in house, other firms are less well equipped to respond to regulatory pressures {{in a manner that}} is congruent with legislative objectives. An innovative <b>option</b> to develop <b>recycling</b> facilities for construction wastes at a landfill site is assessed, considering the roles of construction firms, skip hauliers and waste managers. An investigation is conducted into the practices employed by construction firms that influence wastes arising and likely changes to such practices. It is shown that pressures on construction firms are leading to some improvements to waste streaming that favour the <b>recycling</b> <b>option.</b> A spatial model of landfill catchment is used to estimate the elasticity of the volume of a given waste type delivered to a landfill site with respect to prices charged at the site and competing facilities. The option to recycle a substantial fraction of construction waste is compared with the null option of continuing to landfill waste without pre-treatment using a comparative cost benefit model. This model shows that, in the case of construction waste, benefits due to extending the working life of a landfill pit can be more significant than revenue effects for waste managers. Whether these benefits justify the costs of recycling is shown to be dependent on characteristics of particular landfill sites an...|$|R
