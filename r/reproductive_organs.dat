5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs</b> {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.|$|E
5|$|Some redback {{males have}} been {{observed}} using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs,</b> but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult {{within a few days}} and deliver a clutch of fertilised eggs.|$|E
5|$|Gastrotrichs have {{a simple}} body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and the <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs.</b> They have {{adhesive}} glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E

5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs</b> are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Nose {{piercing}} {{also has}} a long history. c. 1500 BCE, the Vedas refer to Lakshmi's nose piercings, but modern practice in India {{is believed to have}} spread from the Middle Eastern nomadic tribes by route of the Mughal emperors in the 16th century. It remains customary for Indian Hindu women of childbearing age to wear a nose stud, usually in the left nostril, due to the nostril's association with the female <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs</b> in Ayurvedic medicine. This piercing is sometimes done the night before the woman marries.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in Eriophorum angustifolium {{begins with}} flowering in spring or early summer (in or around May), when groups of 3–5 brown flowers are produced. Fertilisation usually {{takes place in}} May or June, via anemophily (wind-pollination), and the white bristle-like perianth, composed of achenes with pappi (seeds with hairs) then grows outwards to appear like short tufts of cotton thread. These pappi endure well into summer, lasting from around June to September. Like the pappus of Taraxacum (dandelions), this aids in wind-dispersal, and also serves as thermal insulation, conserving {{the temperature of the}} plant's <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs</b> by trapping solar radiation.|$|E

5|$|Termites have a ten-segmented abdomen {{with two}} plates, the tergites and the sternites. The tenth {{abdominal}} segment has {{a pair of}} short cerci. There are ten tergites, of which nine are wide and one is elongated. The <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs</b> {{are similar to those}} in cockroaches but are more simplified. For example, the intromittent organ is not present in male alates, and the sperm is either immotile or aflagellate. However, Mastotermitidae termites have multiflagellate sperm with limited motility. The genitals in females are also simplified. Unlike in other termites, Mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor, a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} {{segments}} and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have {{two pairs of}} membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen. The abdomen is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs,</b> and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.|$|E

40|$|This work {{is unique}} in that the {{relationship}} between floral traits and seed yield has not been previously studied. All characters show high heritability with high genetic advance except the characters like bud breadth, petal breadth and female <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ</b> length. They show moderate heritability with moderate genetic advance. The present finding suggest that these characters are additive in nature and could be improved by direct selection. High heritability estimates also indicates that major portion of genetic variability was owing to additive gene action. Most of the characters under this heading showed high heritability with high genetic advance. The high heritability with moderate genetic advance has been observed for the characters like seed per capsule, vegetative and reproductive phase length, harvest index and fruit breadth. Highly significant positive correlation coefficient has been observed seed breadth with fruit length, seed length with flower length, petal breadth, ovary length, breadth and fruit length. Fruit length with bud length, breadth, flower length,breadth, sepal length, filament length, anther length, female <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ</b> length and ovary length. The female <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ</b> length with bud length, flower breadth, sepal breadth, petal breadth, style and stigma length and ovary length. The bud breadth with bud length. The path coefficient analysis indicated that characters like male <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ</b> length, sepal length, pedicel length and ovary length showed the main contribution towards flower breadth. Hence maximum emphasis should be given for these characters during selecting for improvement in flower breadth, because flower breadth provide more space for insect pollination and helping to get hybrid seeds...|$|R
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs</b> (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and rarely a third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by impairing {{the development of the}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs</b> mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E

50|$|Angiosperm {{reproduction}} {{is a complex}} process that includes several steps that may vary among species. Each step is a vast procedure in its own right. Pollen is produced by the stamen, the male <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ</b> of the flower. Each pollen grain contains a vegetative cell, and a generative cell that divides to form two sperm cells. The pollen is delivered by the opening of anthers for subsequent pollination, that is, for the transfer of pollen grains to the pistil, the female <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ.</b> Pollination is usually carried out by wind, water or insects. The ovaries hold the ovules that produce the female gamete: the egg cell, which waits in place for fertilization.|$|R
50|$|Once {{infection}} season {{comes to}} an end, sexual reproduction occurs to form an oospore. In order to have successful sexual reproduction, weather conditions must be favorable and mating types must match. Two mating types, A1 and A2, exist for Phytophthora colocasiae. Hormonal signaling allows for sporangia of the two mating types {{to come together and}} initiate the development of oogonia and antheridia. An oogonium can be likened to a female <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ</b> while an antheridium carries out the role of a male <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ.</b> The penetration of an oogonium via an antheridium leads to the formation of a sexual spore or an oospore. The oospore will overwinter and germinate to produce infectious sporangia once conditions improve.|$|R
5|$|Some insects use parthenogenesis, {{a process}} in which the female can {{reproduce}} and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male. Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis, called cyclical parthenogenesis, in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction. In summer, aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic; in the autumn, males may be produced for sexual reproduction. Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees, wasps and ants, in which they spawn males. However, overall, most individuals are female, which are produced by fertilization. The males are haploid and the females are diploid. More rarely, some insects display hermaphroditism, in which a given individual has both male and female <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The group {{increasingly}} {{focused on}} the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration. They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite's view, sexuality {{was one of the}} most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs</b> but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and <b>reproductive</b> <b>organs.</b> The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E

30|$|Low HIs for {{treatment}} where irrigation was skipped during seed {{filling in the}} 2013 / 2014 season indicate that there was poor aerial biomass accumulation that can {{be transferred to the}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ.</b> Dropping of flowers especially when irrigation was skipped during flowering resulted into a lower number of sinks (Blum 1996). Lack of significant differences between HIs for full and DI in the 2013 season means that the crop was able to remobilize dry matter accumulated shortly before water stress to the <b>reproductive</b> <b>organ</b> before senescence (Turner et al. 2005; Tesfaye et al. 2006). The differences in HIs under full and DI therefore indicate that water stress at different stages affects the rate at which biomass is partitioned into seed in soybeans.|$|R
