40|$|Introduction: For {{women with}} a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 {{mutation}} or a strong family history of breast cancer, {{there is no clear}} estimation of the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>induction</b> versus the beneficial effects of mammography screening available. This study aims to validate the Simulation Model on Radiation Risk and breast cancer Screening (SiMRiSc) model in these women, which can provide information on the benefits and risks of screening for breast cancer for various screening scenarios. Methods: The simulation model for breast cancer screening was developed and the values for model parameters including cancer induction due to radiation were derived from the literature. The simulation model was validated by comparing the outcome data of the model with the data from three published screening studies of {{women with a}}n increased hereditary breast cancer risk. A sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the error margins of the outcome data and to analyse the sensitivity of the simulation model to each parameter. Results: The model predicted 71 +/- 4 % of the reported tumours. When excluding the excess number of incident tumours detected in the first screening round, the model predicted 85 +/- 6 % of the tumours reported. The model was most sensitive to changes in the parameters related to lifetime breast cancer risk and sensitivity of mammography. Conclusions: We conclude that the simulation model is suitable for the provision of accurate benefits' and risks' estimations necessary for the refinement of the screening guidelines for women at an increased risk of breast cancer.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary {{manipulation}} {{of fat and}} fibre on the structural and cell kinetic characteristics of colonic mucosa was studied before and during experimental carcinogenesis in 232 male Albino Swiss rats. Carcinogen treated animals were given 12 weekly injections of azoxymethane (10 mg/kg/week). The animals were divided between four dietary groups (1) high fat, high fibre, (2) low fat, high fibre, (3) high fat, low fibre and (4) low fat, low fibre. Pathological and cell kinetic information together with details of certain faecal characteristics was collected when the animals were killed 4, 20, and 28 weeks after starting their experimental diet. Tumour induction was significantly influenced by diet. The highest risk of colorectal tumour development was found in groups fed diet 3 : high fat, low fibre (p less than 0. 03). In contrast, diet 2 : low fat, high fibre {{was associated with the}} lowest risk. The proportion of histologically proven colonic tumours occurring in each dietary group was: diet 1 - 10. 9 %, diet 2 - 3. 6 %, diet 3 - 63. 7 %, diet 4 - 21. 8 %. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies done on selected samples indicated both dietary and azoxymethane related alterations in crypt unit integrity. The most marked surface architectural changes were seen in carcinogen treated animals maintained on diet 3 (high fat, low fibre). Stathmokinetic analysis revealed considerable intergroup variability. Both fat and fibre produced significant effects, principally during the preneoplastic phase of carcinogenesis. Faster proliferative activity tended to be found in animals at low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>induction</b> (diet 2), slower proliferation being more characteristic of animals at high risk (p less than 0. 05). The findings suggest that both topographical and cell kinetic parameters have an important relationship with promoting and protecting dietary factors during the development of colorectal cancer...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> {{in the central}} nervous system among Danish mobile phone subscribers. DESIGN: Nationwide cohort study. SETTING: Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All Danes aged </= 30 and born in Denmark after 1925, subdivided into subscribers and non-subscribers of mobile phones before 1995. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> <b>of</b> {{the central nervous system}}, identified from the complete Danish Cancer Register. Sex specific incidence rate ratios estimated with log linear Poisson regression models adjusted for age, calendar period, education, and disposable income. RESULTS: 358, 403 subscription holders accrued 3. 8 million person years. In the follow-up period 1990 - 2007, there were 10, 729 cases <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> <b>of</b> the central nervous system. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> such <b>tumours</b> was close to unity for both men and women. When restricted to individuals with the longest mobile phone use [...] that is, </= 13 years of subscription [...] the incidence rate ratio was 1. 03 (95 % confidence interval 0. 83 to 1. 27) in men and 0. 91 (0. 41 to 2. 04) in women. Among those with subscriptions of </= 10 years, ratios were 1. 04 (0. 85 to 1. 26) in men and 1. 04 (0. 56 to 1. 95) in women for glioma and 0. 90 (0. 57 to 1. 42) in men and 0. 93 (0. 46 to 1. 87) in women for meningioma. There was no indication of dose-response relation either by years since first subscription for a mobile phone or by anatomical location <b>of</b> the <b>tumour</b> [...] that is, in regions of the brain closest to where the handset is usually held to the head.

40|$|Background and Objective. The {{cell cycle}} is {{regulated}} by proteins at different checkpoints, and dysregulation of this cycle {{plays a role}} in carcinogenesis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes that degrade collagen and promote tumour infiltration. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the expression of various cell cycle regulators and MMPs, and to correlate such expression with progression and recurrence in patients with stage T 1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB). Patients and Methods. This population-based cohort study comprised 201 well-characterized patients with primary stage T 1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed material to quantify expression of cell cycle regulators and two MMPs. Results. Normal expression of p 53 and abnormal expression of MMP 9 were associated with greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> recurrence. Also, normal p 16 expression was related to a lower <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> progression. MMP 2, p 21, cyclin D 1, and pRb showed no significant results that could estimate progression or recurrence. Conclusions. Normal p 16 expression is associated with a lower <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> progression, but immunohistochemistry on cell cycle regulators and MMPs has little value in predicting the prognosis in stage T 1 UCB.

40|$|OVARIAN tumours may {{be induced}} in {{rats and mice}} by at least three techniques. One method, used most {{commonly}} in rats, is by transplantation of an ovary to the spleen of a castrated animal or to some other site drained by the liver. This method {{gave rise to a}} hormonal theory <b>of</b> ovarian <b>tumour</b> <b>induction</b> put forward by Biskind and Biskind (1944). The oestrogens produced by this transplanted ovary drained to the liver, where they were destroyed. The consequent lack of circulating oestrogen led to an increase in pituitary gonadotrophin production, which in turn acted on the transplanted ovaries and resulted in the growth <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> in them. Intact ovarian function was found to inhibit ovarian tumour production in intrasplenic ovaries (Biskind and Biskind, 1948), presumably by controlling gonadotrophin production.

40|$|Radiobiological {{modelling}} <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> radiation-induced <b>tumours</b> following {{high dose}} radiation implies a general {{form for the}} dose–response relationship.

30|$|There are two special {{conditions}} requiring the preventive treatment of AKI: (1) {{high doses of}} methotrexate infusion [200]; (2) patients with a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> lysis syndrome. Methotrexate at high doses (1 – 12  g/m 2) is a treatment required for numerous malignant tumours. This drug can induce AKI (up to 40  % of patients in a recent study), {{which is due to}} direct tubular toxicity and intratubular precipitation [201]. Intravenous hydration (≥ 2  l/m 2) and urine alkalinization are both recommended strategies for preventing AKI. Several historical observational and interventional studies highlighted that these strategies were associated with an increased methotrexate clearance and decreased episodes of severe toxicity [202 – 205]. Urine alkalinization decreases methotrexate crystallization [202]. Thus, it is recommended to alkalinize the urine of patients who must receive high doses of methotrexate (1 – 12  g/m 2) in order to prevent AKI. About one-third of patients with a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> lysis syndrome develop AKI [206, 207]. In this clinical condition, hyperuricaemia is one of the factors which contribute to AKI by different mechanisms [208]. In two randomized controlled studies and 2 recent meta-analyses, rasburicase administration was associated with a more rapid and profound decrease in uricaemia as compared with allopurinol [209 – 211]. However, there is no proof that rasburicase is associated with reduced AKI incidence [212]. Hyperuricaemia {{is only one of the}} numerous mechanisms implicated in renal injury during tumour lysis syndrome (phosphate and calcium crystals, hypovolaemia, renal tumour infiltration, nephrotoxic exposure, inflammation). In patients with a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> lysis syndrome, rasburicase administration is proposed by four recent expert recommendations [198, 213 – 215].|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba {{syndrome}} (BRRS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} condition characterised by macrocephaly, developmental delay and subtle cutaneous features. BRRS results from mutations in the PTEN gene. In adults, PTEN mutations cause Cowden syndrome where, {{in addition to}} the macrocephaly, there is a higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> development. Diagnosis <b>of</b> BRRS is often delayed as presentation can be variable, even within families. AIMS: To identify characteristics of this condition which might facilitate early diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis not only avoids unnecessary investigations in the child but potentially identifies heterozygote parents who are at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> development. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six children with a PTEN mutation were identified. All had extreme macrocephaly. Four parents and a male sibling were found to have a PTEN mutation on subsequent testing. Affected parents had extreme macrocephaly and a history of thyroid adenoma, or breast or skin lesions. All six children had presented to medical attention before the age of 2. 5 years (3 / 6 were investigated as neonates), but the median age at diagnosis was 5 years. Four of the children had multiple investigations prior to identification of a PTEN mutation. CONCLUSION: BRRS should be considered in children with extreme macrocephaly as it is the most consistent clinical feature seen, particularly where there is a family history of macrocephaly...|$|R
