As iPads are increasingly employed in the teaching process in classroom the authors intend {{to understand how the}} process <b>of</b> teachers' <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> iPad use is perceived as a learning tool. Through the analysis of focus groups with teachers, they intend to detect changes in the sense <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the iPad in classroom during a school year. The findings of their study allow to identify facilitating and hindering elements that support the process <b>of</b> teachers' <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> iPads and open further spaces {{to investigate}} the role of new technologies in teaching/learning contexts...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined. Here, appropriation is recognized as another source of lyric expression, critical innovation, and conceptual development in contemporary poetry. This thesis encourages a new perspective on the purpose and processes <b>of</b> poetic <b>appropriation</b> and the consequences of its declarative potential for both poet and poem...|$|R

It provides an in-depth examination <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> and its application in extant IS theory.

Using Marxian theory, this paper seeks common ground among existing theories <b>of</b> technology <b>appropriation</b> in IS research. This work contributes to IS research by (1) opening philosophical discussions on appropriation and the human ↔ technology nexus, (2) drawing on these varying perspectives to propose a general conceptualization <b>of</b> technology <b>appropriation</b> and (3) providing a starting point towards a general causal model <b>of</b> technology <b>appropriation...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{address the}} {{controversy}} of origins surrounding Joel Chandler Harris’s Uncle Remus collections. Based on James O. Young’s definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation,</b> I establish Harris’s work as evidence <b>of</b> cultural content <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> European, African, and Native American folklore. Harris specifically appropriates European and African folklore to further his own Post-Civil War psyche, attempting {{to preserve the}} ideal Southern past. Such preservation efforts are literally significant for they provide examples <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that are done not out {{of an attempt to}} oppress European and African culture, but to integrate it into the developing Southern culture. The visible Native American appropriation, however, stands as evidence to the use <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> as a method of taking power and oppressing a minority group...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory. Yet it is rare to find an interpretation of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that does not associate it with serious problems. To {{make room for a}} more satisfying understanding of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> we have to analyse why it was so widely misunderstood. The aim of this paper is fourfold: First, I will show that Mackie’s and Winkler’s interpretations that have shaped the subsequent discussion contain serious flaws. Second, I will argue that the so-called appropriation interpretation —that is the view that appropriation is meant to provide alternative persistence conditions for persons—lacks support. Third, I will re-examine Locke’s texts and argue that we can come {{to a better understanding of}} his notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in the Essay if we interpret it in analogy to his account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in Two Treatises. Fourth, I will offer a more fine-grained interpretation of the role <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in relation to persistence conditions for persons. I conclude by showing that the advantage of this proposal is that it reconciles interpretations that have commonly been thought to be inconsistent...|$|R

After first outlining the decentralized discourse on intertitles in general and theoretically examining the concept <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> from various viewpoints, the thesis then analyses the Desmet collection's paper archive, resulting in a clearer understanding of the day-to-day practice with regards to intertitles.

40|$|The {{management}} of global commons is of vital importance for modern society. The current solutions attempt to internalize the cost <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons by adding {{this to the}} cost of private resources. In this paper we will show that this approach has some fundamental weaknesses. To overcome these shortcomings, we have proposed to segregate the {{management of}} private and shared resources by using non-scalar numbers for the underlying economic signals of money and price. We prove that the resulting non-scalar economy always reaches a macro-economic equilibrium point where the level <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons by the society remains steady. The second contribution {{of this paper is to}} show that the proposed design of the non-scalar economy would guarantee the accuracy of price signal with respect to the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons. In other words, rational economic agents would ensure that the price neither underestimates nor overestimates the actual level <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> incurred. This will provide a powerful basis for an effective market system for the commons...|$|R
