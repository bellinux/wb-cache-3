5|$|Twenty of the NBA Development League's {{top players}} were {{selected}} to the D-League All-Star Game rosters {{by a combination of}} fan balloting on the official D-League website and voting by the 16 head coaches of D-League teams. The selections were divided up into two teams, the <b>Red</b> <b>Team</b> and the Blue Team, by members of the NBA and NBA D-League's Basketball Operations staff. Players who have been selected by coaches and fans must be on an active roster of a D-League team. Iowa Energy head coach Nick Nurse and Austin Toros head coach Quin Snyder were selected as the coach for the <b>Red</b> <b>Team</b> and the Blue Team respectively. Both coaches earned the honor by securing the best records in the D-League through January 27.|$|E

40|$|This {{article will}} discuss why {{the use of}} two types of <b>red</b> <b>teams</b> - {{analytical}} and physical - to identify and then simulate ‘suicide bomber threat scenarios’ {{is necessary for the}} force protection training of deploying Canadian military units. Red teaming as a discipline can be divided into two basic forms: (1) analytical <b>red</b> <b>teaming,</b> which is diegetic in nature; that is, based upon descriptive products and decision support functions and (2) physical <b>red</b> <b>teaming,</b> which is mimetic in nature; that is, derived from live-action and role playing-based training with an opposing force (OPFOR) deployed against a friendly military unit. These forms of <b>red</b> <b>teaming</b> are intimately linked, create synergies when utilized together, and should be fully harnessed for Canadian military force protection requirements. One of the greatest lost opportunities of utilizing <b>red</b> <b>teams</b> in the past has been the decoupling of these two very different forms of <b>red</b> <b>teams</b> from one another...|$|R

5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, <b>Red</b> <b>Team</b> and Blue Team, {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from <b>Red</b> <b>Team</b> abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E

Tarbuck became head of a planning group known as the <b>Red</b> <b>Team.</b> This was one of three teams; there was also a White Team under a US army officer, Colonel Peyton, and a Blue Team under an Australian Army officer, Brigadier Tom White.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fires crew awakens from cryosleep at the Ark and {{receives}} a UNSC {{signal from the}} surface of the installation. Spartan <b>Red</b> <b>Team</b> is deployed to investigate the signal. They recover Isabel from a base but during the exfiltration, Spartan Douglas-042 is injured in an engagement with Atriox and Spartan Alice-130 is left stranded on the Ark. Back on the Spirit of Fire, Isabel reveals to Captain Cutter how Atriox and the Banished invaded the Ark, which leads Cutter to declare war on the Banished. A strike team manages to set up a forward base and defeat Decimus, who is salvaging the Ark’s resources. Decimus escapes and orders a bombardment upon his own base. Upon investigating the wreckage, Isabel discovers information about the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark. The team secures a Forerunner elevator and ascends to the Cartographer.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} coevolutionary {{algorithm}} designed {{to be used as}} a computational tool to assist in <b>red</b> <b>teaming</b> studies. In these applications, analysts seek to understand the strategic and tactical options available to each side in a conflict situation. Combining scenario simulations with a coevolutionary search of parameter space is an approach that has many attractions. We argue that <b>red</b> <b>teaming</b> applications are sufficiently different from many others where coevolution is used so that specially designed algorithms can bring advantages. We illustrate by presenting a new algorithm that simultaneously evolves strong strategies along with dangerous counter-strategies. We test the new algorithm on two example problems: an abstract problem with some difficult characteristics; and a practical <b>red</b> <b>teaming</b> scenario. Experiments show that the new algorithm is able to solve the abstract problem well, and that it is able to provide useful insights on the <b>red</b> <b>teaming</b> scenario...|$|R

5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind <b>Red</b> <b>Team,</b> Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|Subsistences online {{multiplayer}} component, titled Metal Gear Online, {{consists of}} five tournament-style game modes, {{each with a}} capacity of up to eight players. This mode pits players, each playing as a generic soldier {{against each other in}} deathmatch battles and variations of capture the flag, using stages, items, maneuvers, and units (such as the KGB, GRU or Ocelot Unit) from the main game. Depending on server settings, each round the highest-scoring player in each unit automatically assumes the role of one of the main characters (or Reiko Hinomoto from Rumble Roses), along with unique abilities and/or items. For example, the highest scoring player on the GRU team would assume the role of Major Raikov, leader of the GRU, next round. Konami's Metal Gear Online service for the PlayStation 2 closed in Japan on December 26, 2006, followed by in North America on April 2, 2007 and in Europe on October 30, 2007, although a fan community has revived it by emulating the servers. As noted above, the online mode, after one of the players unlocks an animal codename, also allowed for the player to play as either Reiko Hinomoto or Rowdy Reiko from Rumble Roses (depending if the player in question was of <b>red</b> <b>team</b> or blue team, respectively). According to Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima, he added the characters into the game as secret characters in part due to opportunity: Kojima had earlier been offered a deal with Rumble Roses producer Akari Uchida to make a crossover between Metal Gear and Rumble Roses. However, the Metal Gear development team at the time refused to work with them. Kojima eventually accepted the offer when trying to decide on secret characters for the online mode for Subsistence to tie up loose ends. He also admitted that he originally considered offering Tomonobu Itagaki, at the time the producer of the Tecmo fighting game series Dead or Alive, the opportunity of using one of his characters as a secret character.|$|E

25|$|Teams: Contestants were {{initially}} {{divided into two}} teams of red and blue by their trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels. The <b>red</b> <b>team</b> consisted of Adro, David, Jo, Kristie, Shane and Ruth and the blue team consisted of Cat, Artie, Harry, Fiona, Tracy and Wal.|$|E

25|$|For this {{challenge}} teams were altered due to blue now having 4 members and red being left with 2 after Jason's departure. Ivan and Katie chose Fenton {{to join their}} team and even the stakes. Next the teams were taken to a sausage kitchen. They then made their own sausage meat and ground it up into one long sausage {{that had to be}} rolled into normal sized sausages. Ivan was quite adapt at creating objects out of balloons so he was named the 'balloon man' for the challenge and helped the <b>red</b> <b>team</b> make over 400 sausages and win the round. New <b>red</b> <b>team</b> member Fenton was given the nickname 'bacon' as he had the reputation of 'bringing home the bacon.' The next part to the challenge was to construct a BBQ straight out of a flat-pack box. The blue team came out on top this time. Once assembled, the two teams then had to cook the sausages they had made for children (and their parents) from the local athletics club, who were now cheering the teams on. Each sausage had to be served with a different condiment. Then as part of the presenting aspect of the show, the teams were each given a megaphone which they used to try to persuade the kids to try their sausages over the other teams. It seemed like an out of control bidding war and while Katie and Bill did well at the task, Fenton didn't even need a microphone. In the end the judges differed in their opinions of who won. Ben believed the <b>red</b> <b>team</b> made the better sausage sizzle while Mark thought blue had it in the bag. Blue were selected as the winners and two from the <b>red</b> <b>team</b> were sent home.|$|E
