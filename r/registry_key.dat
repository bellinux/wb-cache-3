25|$|A key path is a {{specific}} file, <b>registry</b> <b>key,</b> or ODBC data source that the package author specifies as critical for a given component. Because a file {{is the most common}} type of key path, the term key file is commonly used. A component can contain at most one key path; if a component has no explicit key path, the component's destination folder is taken to be the key path. When an MSI-based program is launched, Windows Installer checks the existence of key paths. If there is a mismatch between the current system state and the value specified in the MSI package (e.g., a key file is missing), the related feature is re-installed. This process is known as self-healing or self-repair. No two components should use the same key path.|$|E

2500|$|Service Pack 1 Beta {{was only}} {{released}} on Microsoft Connect to selected testers on September 24, 2007. This build was offered optionally through Windows Update through a <b>registry</b> <b>key</b> installed by the tester.

Also removed was the [...] "Search" [...] menu option from the right hand bar of the start menu (including the option to re-add it from the Start Menu customization list). This build broke the [...] "HP Touch smart" [...] family of applications, and also caused bugs with resuming from sleep, and in some cases rendered some 64-bit PCs with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chips unable to finish booting. This build also contained unspecified improvements in Speed and responsiveness of the OS.|$|E
