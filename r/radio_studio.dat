500|$|The {{first series}} was {{therefore}} the first BBC radio comedy to use stereophonic techniques. Adams later {{said that before}} Hitchhiker's, stereo was deemed impossible for radio comedy and after it was made compulsory. Producer Geoffrey Perkins recalled that the technology available in 1978 for mixing sound effects at the BBC's Paris Theatre <b>radio</b> <b>studio</b> was limited. The production had one eight track tape recorder at their disposal {{and so many of}} the effects in the programme were mixed [...] "live" [...] with tape loops of background sound effects strung around the recording studio. Actors whose speech needed to be modified in post-production by Radiophonic technicians, such as Stephen Moore's performance as Marvin the Android, were recorded in isolation from the main [...] "humanoid" [...] characters. Allegedly, Moore recorded most of his performance in a cupboard and met the other actors only after the first session was complete.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} in February2002 that Fortuyn did not dare to appear in public owing to death threats. In March, he was attacked by pie-throwing activists at the presentation of his new book De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars (which became the bestselling book by a Dutch author in the Netherlands in 2002). Despite this, the authorities did not provide protection for Fortuyn, nor did he request protection. On 6May, Fortuyn was assassinated outside a <b>radio</b> <b>studio.</b> This was the first political murder in the Netherlands for centuries (excluding the Second World War). Some claimed that by [...] "demonising" [...] Fortuyn, the political left and the media had created a climate of opinion that had made the assassination possible. Campaigning immediately stopped, and although some suggested postponing the elections, the campaign resumed (half-heartedly) after his funeral four days later. His funeral was broadcast live on television and, according to Cas Mudde, lead [...] "to scenes of mass hysteria {{not seen since the}} Dutch national football team won the European Championship in 1988." [...] The murder of Fortuyn, together with that of Theo van Gogh two years later, would result in a polarisation in the political debate in the Netherlands, and subsequently radical changes in immigration-related policies and public discourse.|$|E

500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC <b>radio</b> <b>studio.</b> The {{first year of the}} television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E
