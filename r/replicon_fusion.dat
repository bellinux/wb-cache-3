We have assayed Tn 1 delta Ap-mediated <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion</b> events involving plasmid R 388 and the bacteriophage lambda-derived plasmid p lambda CM, and we find that the role of the recipient molecule is distinct. When p lambda CM carries Tn 1 delta Ap, <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion</b> occurs in more than 1 % of all cells assayed, whether or not p lambda CM::Tn 1 delta Ap can replicate. In contrast, when R 388 carries Tn 1 delta Ap, <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion</b> occurs only when the p lambda CM target can replicate.

40|$|An {{apparently}} nonreplicative integration reaction {{mediated by}} the insertion sequence IS 911 has been analyzed. It is shown to involve the right-end inverted repeat (IRR) of the element and sequences in the flanking vector DNA. The flanking sequences appear to behave as a surrogate IS 911 end, since integration is greatly reduced when limited similarities with IRR are eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis. Data are presented which suggest that {{the activity of the}} IRRjunction results from the proximity of the transposase gene and may therefore reflect preferential transposase recognition of IRR in cis. IS 911, a member of the IS 3 family of insertion sequences, was originally isolated from Shigella dysenteriae as an insertion into the cI gene of bacteriophage X. It is 1, 250 bp long, carries 36 -bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats at the left (IRL) and right (IRR) ends, and generates 3 -bp (or occasionally 4 -bp) duplications in the target on insertion (14). Previous studies showed that, when cloned with its flanking X DNA sequences into a pBR 322 -derived vector, IS 911 can provoke <b>replicon</b> <b>fusions</b> with a suitable target replicon.

40|$|The citrate {{utilization}} (Cit+) transposon Tn 3411 {{was shown}} to be flanked by directly repeated sequences (IS 3411 L and IS 3411 R) by restriction enzyme analysis and electron microscope observation. Cit- deletion mutants were frequently found to be generated in pBR 322 ::Tn 3411 by intramolecular recombination between the two copies of IS 3411. The flanking IS 3411 elements of Tn 3411 were shown to be functional insertion sequences by Tn 3411 -mediated direct and inverse transposition. Tn 3411 -mediated inverse transposition from pBR 322 ::Tn 3411 to the F-plasmid derivative pED 100 occurred more efficiently than that of direct transposition of the Cit+ determinant. This {{was thought to be}} due to the differential transposability of IS 3411 L and IS 3411 R in the transposition process. The frequency of transposition of IS 3411 marked with a chloramphenicol resistance determinant was much higher than IS 3411 -mediated cointegrate formation, suggesting that <b>replicon</b> <b>fusions</b> are not essential intermediates in the transposition process of Tn 3411 or IS 3411. Spontaneous deletions occurred with high frequency in recA hosts.

40|$|ABSTRACT Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), {{which are}} {{resistant}} to most or all known antibiotics, consti-tute a global threat to public health. Transposable elements are often associated with antibiotic resistance determinants, suggest-ing {{a role in the}} emergence of resistance. One insertion sequence, IS 26, is frequently associated with resistance determinants, but its role remains unclear. We have analyzed the genomic contexts of 70 IS 26 copies in several clinical and surveillance CPE iso-lates from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. We used target site duplications and their patterns as guides and found that a large fraction of plasmid reorganizations result from IS 26 replicative transpositions, including <b>replicon</b> <b>fusions,</b> DNA inversions, and deletions. Replicative transposition could also be inferred for transposon Tn 4401, which harbors the car-bapenemase blaKPC gene. Thus, replicative transposition is important in the ongoing reorganization of plasmids carrying multidrug-resistant determinants, an observation that carries substantial clinical and epidemiological implications for under-standing how such extreme drug resistance phenotypes evolve. IMPORTANCE Although IS 26 is frequently reported to reside in resistance plasmids of clinical isolates, the characteristic hall-mark of transposition, target site duplication (TSD), is generally not observed, raising questions about the mode of transposition for IS 26. The previous observation of cointegrate formation during transposition implies that IS 26 transposes via a replicativ...|$|R

40|$|Restriction mapping was {{employed}} to characterize the 104 -kilobase (kb) cointegrate lactose plasmids from 15 independent transconjugants derived from Streptococcus lactis ML 3 {{as well as the}} 55 -kb lactose plasmid (pSK 08) and a previously uncharacterized 48. 4 -kb plasmid (pRS 01) from S. lactis ML 3. The data revealed that the 104 -kb plasmids were cointegrates of pSK 08 and pRS 01 and were structurally distinct. The <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion</b> event occurred within adjacent 13. 8 - or 7. 3 -kb PvuII fragments of pSK 08 and interrupted apparently random regions of pRS 01. Correlation of the transconjugants' clumping and conjugal transfer capabilities with the interrupted region of pRS 01 identified pRS 01 regions coding for these properties. In the 104 -kb plasmids, the pRS 01 region was present in both orientations with respect to the pSK 08 region. The <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion</b> occurred in recombination-deficient (Rec-) strains and appeared to introduce a 0. 8 to 1. 0 -kb segment of DNA within the junction fragments. The degeneration of the cointegrate plasmids was monitored by examining the lactose plasmids from nonclumping derivatives of clumping transconjugants. These plasmids displayed either precise or imprecise excision of pRS 01 sequences or had dramatically reduced copy numbers. Both alterations occurred by rec-independent mechanisms. Alterations of a transconjugant 's clumping phenotype also occurred by rec-independent inversion of a 4. 3 -kb KpnI-PvuII fragment within the pRS 01 sequences of the cointegrate plasmid...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model for {{transposition}} that allows a choice between cointegrate formation (<b>replicon</b> <b>fusion)</b> and direct transposition. We propose that initiation of the process occurs by invasion of the target DNA by a single-stranded end of the transposable element. This leads to nicking {{of one of the}} DNA strands of the target molecule and ligation of this strand to that of the invading transposon. Transposition then occurs in a processive way by replication of the element from the invading end into the target site in a looped rolling-circle mode similar to replication of phage phi X 174 replicative form to viral strand. The choice between cointegrate formation and direct transposition occurs at the nick-ligation step, which terminates the process. We suggest that the choice is determined by the topology of the transposition enzymes and could be related to whether the element generates five- or nine-base-pair repeats in the target DNA on insertion...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{promoter}} probe vectors {{for use in}} Gram-negative bacteria {{has been made in}} two broad-host-range vectors, pOT (pBBR replicon) and pJP 2 (incP <b>replicon).</b> Reporter <b>fusions</b> can be made to gfpUV, gfpmut 3. 1, unstable gfpmut 3. 1 variants (LAA, LVA, AAV and ASV), gfp+, dsRed 2, dsRedT. 3, dsRedT. 4, mRFP 1, gusA or lacZ. The two vector families, pOT and pJP 2, are compatible with one another and share the same polylinker for facile interchange of promoter regions. Vectors based on pJP 2 have the advantage of being ultra-stable in the environment due to the presence of the parABCDE genes. As a confirmation of their usefulness, the dicarboxylic acid transport system promoter (dctAp) was cloned into a pOT (pRU 1097) - and a pJP 2 (pRU 1156) -based vector and shown to be expressed by Rhizobium leguminosarum in infection threads of vetch.

40|$|Transduction with phage {{derived from}} a 2 -year-old lysate of λ cam 105 (λ::Tn 9) gave rise to chloramphenicol-resistant (Cmr) transductants {{harboring}} a plasmid (pλCM 1) formed from λ cam 105 by a Tn 9 -mediated adjacent deletion to position 36. 07 kilobases in the N cistron of λ. The pλCM element can replicate as a plasmid, insert into the bacterial genome, or reproduce lytically as a phage on cells that provide N function. The feasibility of obtaining high titers in encapsidated form and the ease of synchronous introduction into and recovery from bacterial populations make pλCM very suitable for quantitative studies of recombination involving transposable elements. <b>Replicon</b> <b>fusions</b> between pλCM 1 and RSF 1596 (pMB 8 ::Tn 3 Δ 596) occur by duplication of either IS 1 (at low rate {{in the absence of}} TnpA activity) or Tn 3 Δ 596 (in the presence of TnpA activity). At 24 or 32 °C, the rate of increase of TnpA-mediated fusions per pλCM is about 2 % per cell doubling. RSF 103 contains the deleted Tn 1 ΔAp (which lacks intact beta-lactamase and TnpR resolvase coding sequences) adjacent to a streptomycin resistance (Smr) determinant. We observed that Tn 1 ΔAp mediates insertions of external RSF 103 sequences into the R 388 plasmid. R 388 ::Tn 1 ΔAp plasmids show transposition immunity in cells lacking TnpR activity. Using the pλCM system, we isolated adjacent transpositions of the RSF 103 Smr determinant. The resulting pλCM-Sm cosmids contain Smr genetic material flanked by direct repeats of Tn 1 ΔAp, and all are deleted for some RSF 103 or pλCM sequences. The pλCM-Sm constructs will fuse into R 388 by duplication of a single Tn 1 ΔAp element. In the presence of tnpR+ (but not tnpR) Tn 1 or Tn 3 elements, all Tn 1 ΔAp-mediated complex replicons break down completely and rapidly to simple Tn 1 ΔAp inserts. The equilibrium for resolution is at least 105 : 1, and resolution is more than 90 % complete after 40 min of exposure to a tnpR+ cytoplasm. In the absence of TnpR, Rec, and Red activities, Tn 1 ΔAp-mediated complex replicons yield simple Tn 1 ΔAp inserts at a lower rate. The presence of intact RSF 103 replication determinants between direct Tn 1 ΔAp repeats appears to accelerate this precise TnpR- and Rec-independent breakdown...|$|R
40|$|Ancestral genome {{reconstruction}} can {{be understood}} as a phylogenetic study with more details than a traditional phylogenetic tree reconstruction. We present a new computational system called REGEN for ancestral bacterial genome reconstruction at both the gene and replicon levels. REGEN reconstructs gene content, contiguous gene runs, and replicon structure for each ancestral genome. Along each branch of the phylogenetic tree, REGEN infers evolutionary events, including gene creation and deletion and <b>replicon</b> fission and <b>fusion.</b> The reconstruction can be performed by either a maximum parsimony or a maximum likelihood method. Gene content reconstruction is based on the concept of neighboring gene pairs.

We evaluated REGEN using simulated genomes and genomes in the Rhizobiales order...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{replication fork}} progression along the tandemly repeated rRNA genes of Xenopus laevis and Xenopus borealis, rDNA replication intermediates from dividing tissue culture cells {{were analyzed by}} two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the direction of replication in the rRNA coding regions revealed replication forks moving in both directions. However, in both frog species, polar replication fork barriers (RFB) arresting forks approaching the rRNA transcription units from downstream were identified. Whereas in X. borealis the RFB maps to a defined site close to the transcription terminator, in X. laevis the arrest of fork movement can occur at multiple positions throughout a 3 ' flanking repetitive spacer region. A short DNA element located near the respective RFB sites is shared between these two related frog species, suggesting its possible involvement in the arrest of replication fork movement. In a subset of rDNA repeats, these barriers cause an absolute block to replication fork progression, defining the sites where <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion</b> occurs, whereas in the remainder repeats, most probably in the non-transcribed gene copies, the replication machinery can pass the RFB sequences and replicate the rRNA transcription unit in a 3 '-to- 5 ' direction...|$|E
40|$|Interplasmid and {{chromosome}} to plasmid transposition of IS 10 {{were studied}} by assaying inactivation of the phage 434 cI gene, {{carried on a}} low copy number plasmid. This was detected by {{the activity of the}} tet gene expressed from the phage 434 P(R) promoter. Each interplasmid transposition resulted in the fusion of the donor and acceptor plasmids into cointegrate structure, with a 9 -bp duplication of the target DNA at the insertion site. Cointegrate formation was abolished in δrecA strains, although simple insertions of IS 10 were observed. This suggests a two-stage mechanism involving IS 10 conservative transposition, followed by homologous recombination between the donor and the acceptor. Two plasmids carrying inactive IS 10 sequences were fused to cointegrates at a 100 -fold lower frequency, suggesting that homologous recombination is coupled to and stimulated by the transposition event. Each IS 10 transposition from the chromosome to the acceptor plasmid involved <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion,</b> providing a mechanism for IS 10 -mediated integration of extrachromosomal elements into the chromosome. This was accompanied by the formation of an additional copy of IS 10 in the chromosome. Thus, like replicative transposition, conservative transposition of IS 10 is accompanied by cointegrate formation and results in duplication of the IS 10...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and characterize plasmids carrying qnrS 1, qnrB 2 and qnrB 19 genes identified in Salmonella strains from The Netherlands. The identification of plasmids may help to follow the dissemination of these resistance genes in different countries and environments. Plasmids from 33 qnr-positive Salmonella strains were transferred to Escherichia coli and analysed by restriction, Southern blot hybridization, PCR and sequencing of resistance determinants. They were also assigned to incompatibility groups by PCR-based replicon typing, including three additional PCR assays for the IncU, IncR and ColE groups. The collection included isolates from humans and one from chicken meat. Five IncN plasmids carrying qnrS 1, qnrB 2 and qnrB 19 genes were identified in Salmonella enterica Bredeney, Typhimurium PT 507, Kentucky and Saintpaul. qnrS 1 genes were also located on three further plasmid types, belonging to the ColE (in Salmonella Corvallis and Anatum), IncR (in Salmonella Montevideo) and IncHI 2 (in Salmonella Stanley) groups. Multiple events of mobilization, transposition and <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion</b> generate the complexity observed in qnr-positive isolates that are emerging worldwide.

40|$|Transfer factor pBFTM 10, {{isolated}} from the obligate anaerobic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis, carries a clindamycin resistance determinant which we have suggested {{is part of a}} transposable element. DNA homologous to this determinant is found in many Clnr Bacteroides isolates, either in the chromosome or on plasmids. We have now established that Ccr resides on a transposon, Tn 4400. In addition to the Ccr determinant that functions under anaerobic conditions in B. fragilis, Tn 4400 also carries a determinant for tetracycline resistance (Tcr) which only functions in Escherichia coli under aerobic conditions. The presence of Tn 4400 on pBFTM 10 does not confer tetracycline resistance on B. fragilis cells containing it. DNA from pBFTM 10 was cloned in E. coli, with pDG 5 as the cloning vector, to form pGAT 500. Using a mobilization assay involving pGAT 500 and an F factor derivative, pOX 38, we determined that a 5. 6 -kilobase region of pBFTM 10 DNA was capable of mediating <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion</b> and transposition. Most of the mobilization products resulted from inverse transposition reactions, while some were the result of true cointegrate formation. Analysis of the cointegrate molecules showed that three were formed by the action of one of the ends of Tn 4400 (IS 4400), and one was formed by the action of the whole element (Tn 4400). The cointegrate molecule carrying intact copies of Tn 4400 at the junction of the two plasmids could resolve to yield an unaltered donor plasmid (pGAT 500) and a conjugal plasmid containing a copy of Tn 4400 or a copy of one insertion sequence element (pOX 38 ::Tn 4400 or pOX 38 ::IS 4400). Thus, Tn 4400 is a compound transposon containing active insertion sequence elements as directly repeated sequences at its ends...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{and genetic}} studies have {{revealed}} that several illegitimate recombinational events are associated with integration of the specialized transducing bacteriophage lambda cI 57 St 68 h 80 dgnd his into either the Escherichia coli chromosome or into a plasmid. Most Gnd+ His+ transductants did not carry the prophage at att phi- 80, and 10 % were not immune to lambda, i. e., "nonlysogenic. " Integration of the phage was independent of the phage Int and Red gene products and of the host's general recombination (Rec) system. In further studies, bacterial strains were selected which carried the phage integrated into an R-factor, pSC 50. Restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) purified from these strains showed that formation of the hybrid plasmids resulted from recombination between a single region of pSC 50 and one of several sites within the lambda-phi 80 portion of the phage. Furthermore the his-gnd region of the phage, present in the chromosome of one nonlysogenic transductant, was shown {{to be able to}} translocate to pSC 50. Concomitant deletion of phage DNA sequences or pSC 50 DNA was frequently observed in conjunction with these integration or translocation events. In supplemental studies, a 22 - to 24 -megadalton segment of the his-gnd region of the chromosome of a prototrophic recA E. coli strain was shown to translocate to pSC 50. One terminus of this translocatable segment was near gnd and was the same as a terminus of the his-gnd segment of the phage which translocated from the chromosome of the nonlysogenic transductant. These data suggest that integration of lambda cI 857 St 68 h 80 dgnd his may be directed by a recombinationally active sequence on another replicon and that the resulting cointegrate structure is subject to the formation of deletions which extend from the recombinationally active sequence. Translocation of the his-gnd portion of the phage probably requires prior <b>replicon</b> <b>fusion,</b> whereas the his-gnd region of the normal E. coli chromosome may comprise a discrete, transposable element...|$|E
