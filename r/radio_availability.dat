5000|$|One other {{perceived}} {{reason to}} consider 220 MHz for PTC may be PTC-compatible radio equipment availability. Radio equipment specifically targeted toward PTC is currently only available from {{a limited number}} of vendors, and they are focused only on 220 MHz. One radio vendor in particular, Meteorcomm LLC, is able to support the I-ETMS PTC protocol with a 220 MHz radio. Meteorcomm is jointly owned by several of the Class I freights, and some in the industry have indicated that using their 220 MHz radio and associated equipment will be done on a per-site licensing basis. Recurring fees may be associated with this process too. There is further concern that the 'buy in' and licensing fees will be significant, and this has led some to speculate that the owners of Meteorcomm (the freights) may have legal exposure to anti-trust violations. [...] For many railroads, there is no other practical option to meet the federal mandate than to install PTC at 220 MHz using I-ETMS with the Meteorcomm radios. On the northeast corridor, another radio vendor, GE MDS, is able to support the Amtrak ACSES protocol with a 220 MHz radio. It should be stressed that the main concern among the freights regarding the PTC deadline is the availability of PTC equipment. [...] With an eye to anti-trust issues and ready <b>radio</b> <b>availability,</b> Meteorcomm radio designs have been second-sourced to CalAmp radios. This all may mean that there is not enough 220 MHz PTC radio equipment available for all of the railroads that must implement PTC.|$|E

40|$|Developing sensor {{agents that}} can be {{deployed}} untethered in the field presents significant challenges in adapting to hardware, communication, power and environmental limitations. Real-world characteristics dictate agent behavior and operating strategies, sometimes quite differently from often held assumptions and intuitions. In this article, we describe the sensor-agent hardware and blackboard-system software used in CNAS (collaborative network for atmospheric sensing), an agent-based, power-aware sensor network for ground-level atmospheric monitoring. CNAS is representative of a class of battery-powered, wireless sensor networks in which the distance separating deployed sensor agents is near the limit of their WiFi communication range. To conserve battery power, CNAS sensor agents must have their wireless radios turned off most of the time, as even having them turned on consumes significant power. This limitation complicates agent interaction and network responsiveness, because an agent cannot simply turn on its radio when it needs to send a message. CNAS agents also must have their radios turned on when others are sending messages {{to them and to}} support multi-hop message forwarding.

IEEE 802.21 Link Up events can be used in this scenario to notify the MR about WLAN availability. Regular IEEE 802.21 Link Up events are used to inform of 1 -hop <b>radio</b> <b>availability</b> with a given point of attachment. However, in order to gain Internet connectivity, a mobile router in the VANET does not only need a WLAN point of attachment within its radio coverage, but also that this PoA is either the RSU or is connected (via a multi-hop path) to the RSU. Therefore, 1 -hop radio connectivity between a vehicle and another PoA is not enough to trigger a Link Up event, unless the PoA is a RSU. SILVIO benefits from the TREBOL configuration messages used to regenerate the routing tree as enablers of Link Up events. If a vehicle receives a CM message, this means that the message has been successfully forwarded from the RSU to the receiver, and that can be used as a hint that the PoA is indeed able to provide Internet connectivity.|$|E

This thesis focuses on finding additional spectrum to meet this demand in a cost-efficient way by considering shared spectrum access. Our studies aim at identifying key factors in achieving large-scale business success,quantifying the spectrum availability and identifying suitable regulatory/sharing polices for large-scale secondary access in the aeronautical and radar bands. This thesis proposes a research methodology, that considers business, technical and regulatory aspects involved in assessing commercial viability of large-scale deployment of wireless networks, employing vertical spectrum sharing in the aeronautical and radar bands. We pinpoint the following criteria which are critical in ensuring business success:spectrum <b>availability,</b> <b>radio</b> technology <b>availability,</b> low-cost end-userdevices, system scalability and quality of service. Our investigation centers on {{the technical aspects of}} these criteria, and thus deals mainly with the assessment of spectrum availability. The availability of spectrum opportunities is found to be ample for adjacent channel usage despite the strict requirements of the radar receiver. However, it is alsovery location-dependent and mostly non-contiguous. Finally, with regard to the regulatory aspects, our results show thatapplying regulatory policies, especially to the deployment of secondary users, can boost availability in cities or urban areas where the capacity demand is high. In addition, Licensed Shared Access (LSA) is identified as a suitable regulatory framework to meet tough protection criteria ofthe radar receivers and to apply the selected regulatory policies to improve exploitation of sharing opportunities. Based on our results and analysis, we conclude that there is a significant amount of spectrum opportunities for large-scale secondary access in the aeronautical and radar bands from the technical point of view. However, the commercial viability of secondary spectrum access is still undetermined giventhe remaining uncertainties regarding its total cost and the exact time needed for relevant technology to become available. Moreover, thereis no single answer to the commercial viability since it will most likelydepend on the country or region in question, which affects the spectrum availability, which in turn is a key criterion for business success. Futurework should therefore strive to clarify these uncertainties and to identify new responsibilities for all the entities involved in the LSA framework. Moreover, a quantitative evaluation would be needed to obtain more explicit conclusions on the business viability. QC 20140519 </p...|$|R

For a large-scale distributed CPS comprising of numerous machines, sharing radio resource efficiently with the existing wireless networks while maintaining sufficient quality of service (QoS) for machine-to-machine (M 2 M) communications becomes an essential and challenging requirement. By clustering CPS machines as a swarm with the cluster head managing radio resources inside the swarm, spectrum sharing among numerous machines can be achieved in a distributed and scalable fashion. Specifically, we apply the recent innovation, cognitive radio, and a special mode in cognitive radio, interweave coexistence, to leverage machines to collect radio resource usage information for autonomous and interference-free radio resource management in the CPS. To reduce the communication overheads of channel sensing feedbacking from machines, we apply compressive sensing to construct a spectrum map indicating the <b>radio</b> resource <b>availability</b> on any given locations within the CPS coverage. Such spectrum map resource management (SMRM) only utilizes a small portion of machines to perform channel sensing but enables distributed cluster-based spectrum sharing in an efficient way. Through the concept of effective capacity, the SMRM controls available resources to guarantee the QoS for communications of CPS. By evaluating the performance of the proposed SMRM in the most promising realization of CPS based on LTE-Advanced machine-type communications coexisting with LTE-Advanced Macrocells to utilize identical spectrum, the simulation results show effective QoS guarantees of CPS by SMRM in the realistic environments.

With the {{increasing}} penetration of wireless communications systems, customers are expecting {{the same level}} of service, reliability and performance from the wireless communication systems as the traditional wire-line networks. Due to the dynamic environment, such as the roaming of mobile subscribers, maintaining a high <b>radio</b> frequency (RF) <b>availability</b> {{is one of the most}} challenging aspects in wireless network management. To date, in wireless network management, a call is dropped when the channel it uses goes down. In order to increase system end-to-end availability, an RF channel recovery scheme is proposed in this paper. When an RF channel fails, the channel is replaced by another working channel and the call continues. The methods to replace failed RF channels of ongoing calls and to handle channel failures of handoff and new calls are investigated. Markov reward models are developed to compare system availability and performance. Automated generation and solution of Markov reward models is facilitated by a version of stochastic Petri nets that we call stochastic reward nets. The results show that the recovery scheme reduces the dropped calls and the blocked calls significantly under both light and normal traffics. ...|$|R

Further radio/optical analysis of such AGN component has revealed a somewhat unexpected class of flat/inverted-spectrum sources with low radio-to-optical ratios (R< 100), which are preferentially identified with early-type galaxies. Such sources are quite compact (d< 10 - 30 kpc), suggesting core-dominated radio emission triggered by low luminosity AGNs.

I put the focus primarily on political, institutional, and historical factors. I started working on these topics after studying the importance of regime change and institutions in the modern economics literature. The first essay analyzes how media {{can be a powerful}} tool to promote regime change in tightly controlled political systems. I analyze the impact of Radio Liberty, an American radio with an anti-communist slant, on the 1991 Russian elections, which were the first elections in the country, to study the role of Western media on the demise of the Soviet Union. I use a novel empirical strategy exploiting ionospheric variation with the aim of obtaining a measure of <b>Radio</b> Liberty <b>availability</b> in each Russian electoral district. The results show a significant effect of these broadcasts in favor of Yeltsin, documenting that media can {{play an important role in}} political processes of regime change. In the second essay, I analyze the persistent effects of the territorial division in Spain between the Christian kingdoms in the north and Islamic Iberia in the center and south of the country during the Middle Ages. I analyze this question empirically using a spatial donut discontinuity design which compares Christian and Muslim territories exploiting the dynamics of the reconquest process undertaken by the Christians which resulted in the Muslim defeat. I find important differences in current municipal economic development with substantial positive effects in Christian municipalities. The third essay analyzes the importance of protests for regime change. I provide empirical evidence that protests have a significant and non-linear impact on the likelihood that a country successfully democratizes. I show that it is for intermediate values of protests that the likelihood of democratization is higher. I present a dynamic model to explain the empirical evidence. The main implication is that protests could play an important role for regime change as long as they are not too high because in the latter case there will be a backlash which will block regime change. by Javier Garcia-Arenas.

40|$|This report {{describes}} my M. A. Sc. thesis research work. The emerging 4 th generation (4 G) mobile {{systems and}} networks (so called 4 G HetNets) are designed as multilayered cellular topology {{with a number}} of asymmetrically located, asymmetrically powered, self-organizing, and user-operated indoor small cell (e. g., pico/femto cells and WLANs) with a variety of cell architectures that are overlaid by a large cell (macro cell) with some or all interfering wireless links. These designs of 4 G HetNets bring new challenges such as increased dynamics of user mobility and data traffic trespassing over the multi-layered cell boundaries. Traditional approaches of radio resource allocation and inter-cell (cochannel) interference management that are mostly centralized and static in the network core and are carried out pre-hand by the operator in 3 G and lower cellular technologies, are liable to increased signaling overhead, latencies, complexities, and scalability issues and, thus, are not viable in case of 4 G HetNets. In this thesis a comprehensive research study is carried out on improving the radio resource sharing and inter-cell interference management in 4 G HetNets. The solution strategy exploits dynamic and adaptive channel allocation approaches such as dynamic and opportunistic spectrum access (DSA, OSA) techniques, through exploiting the spatiotemporal diversities among transmissions in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based medium access in 4 G HetNets. In this regards, a novel framework named as Hybrid Radio Resource Sharing (HRRS) is introduced. HRRS comprises of these two functional modules: Cognitive Radio Resource Sharing (CRRS) and Proactive Link Adaptation (PLA) scheme. A dynamic switching algorithm enables CRRS and PLA modules to adaptively invoke according to whether orthogonal channelization is to be carried out exploiting the interweave channel allocation (ICA) approach or non-orthogonal channelization is to be carried out exploiting the underlay channel allocation (UCA) approach respectively when relevant conditions regarding the traffic demand and <b>radio</b> resource <b>availability</b> are met. Benefits of CRRS scheme are identified through simulative analysis in comparison to the legacy cochannel and dedicated channel deployments of femto cells respectively. The case study and numerical analysis for PLA scheme is carried out to understand the dynamics of threshold interference ranges as function of transmit powers of MBS and FBS, relative ranges of radio entities, and QoS requirement of services with the value realization of PLA scheme. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} if higher fertility and lower contraceptive use among the poorer {{segments of society}} should be considered an inequality, reflecting a higher desire for large families among the poor, or an inequity, {{a product of the}} poor being prevented from achieving their desired fertility to the same degree as wealthier segments of society. Methods Using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys from 41 countries, we analysed the differences in fertility in light of modern contraceptive use, unwanted fertility (defined as actual fertility in excess of desired fertility) and the availability of family planning services found among poorer and wealthier segments of society. The asset index in each survey was used to construct wealth quintiles and the concentration index (CI) of income inequality was found in health variables. Findings The relationship between the CI found in the total fertility rate and the use of contraceptives was linear, R-square of 0. 289. Unwanted births in the poorest quintile were more than twice that found in the wealthiest quintile, respectively 1. 2 and 0. 5, although there was wide variation among the 41 countries. The CI in our measure of family planning <b>availability</b> (<b>radio</b> messages, knowledge of services and contact with field workers) was largely positively associated with the CI in modern contraceptive prevalence, respectively R-squares of 0. 392, 0. 692 and 0. 526. Conclusion In many countries the higher fertility and lower contraceptive use found among poorer relative to wealthier populations should be considered an inequity.

30|$|Timely {{monitoring}} and prediction of solar-terrestrial processes is increasingly {{important for our}} society which depends {{more and more on}} advanced technology that relies on continuous power <b>availability,</b> <b>radio</b> wave communication and navigation, and satellite operation. Enhanced solar wind and solar radiation input energy into near-Earth space result, for example, in strong electric currents flowing in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and in significant plasma density structuring or alterations of neutral composition, density and winds in the upper atmosphere (e.g., Tsurutani et al., 1997; Prolss, 2011). Such periods of enhanced activity are often called magnetic storms since they cause rapid variations of the geomagnetic field of up to several hundred nanotesla within a few minutes. Strong variations of ionospheric currents, such as the auroral electrojet, cause induced electric fields in the conducting solid Earth that may harm power grid systems (e.g. Kappmenman, 1989; Thomson, 2007). Variations in the strength and direction of the geomagnetic field, that are caused e.g. by the polar electrojets or the magnetospheric ring current may disturb navigation activities that are based on precise magnetic maps, e.g., for aviation or exploration directional drilling activities. Steep plasma density gradients in the ionosphere and plasmasphere bend and scatter trans-ionospheric radio waves that are used for satellite-based navigation, e.g., by the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the future Galileo. Such irregularities result in navigational errors that are not included in ionospheric correction models implemented in commercial GPS receivers and may even lead to signal outage and radio wave scintillations (e.g., Basu et al., 2002). Scintillations, such as equatorial F region plasma irregularities, also have to be considered as regular disturbances, that are independent of magnetic storm activity. Irregular thermospheric density enhancements also have significant effects on satellite drag and space debris monitoring.|$|R
30|$|Nowadays, {{the demand}} for {{high-quality}} multimedia services (video, audio, image, and data) is rapidly increasing. The Digital Video Broadcasting - terrestrial (DVB-T) standard, its second-generation version (DVB-T 2), and the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard are the most promising systems to fulfill {{the demand for}} advanced multimedia services (e.g., high-definition image and video quality), especially in Europe. However, LTE mobile services can operate {{in a part of}} the UHF band allocated to DVB-T/T 2 TV services previously. The main purpose of this work is to explore the possible coexistences of DVB-T 2 -Lite and LTE systems in the same shared frequency band (co-channel coexistence) under outdoor-to-indoor and indoor reception conditions. Furthermore, an applicable method for evaluating coexistence scenarios between both systems is shown with a particular example. These coexistence scenarios can be noncritical and critical. In the first case, both systems can coexist without significant performance degradation. In the second one, a partial or full loss of DVB-T 2 -Lite and/or LTE signals can occur. We consider an indoor LTE femtocell and outdoor-to-indoor DVB-T 2 -Lite signal reception in a frequency band from 791 up to 821 MHz. Simulations of combined indoor and outdoor signal propagation are performed in MATLAB using 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) channel models, separately for both DVB-T 2 -Lite and LTE systems. Correctness of path loss simulation results is verified by measurements. Afterwards, an appropriate linear model is proposed which enables to evaluate the impact of coexistence on performance of both systems in outdoor-to-indoor and indoor-to-indoor reception scenarios. The results are related to an actual location in the building and are presented in floor plans. The floor plans include different coexistence conditions (different power imbalance and different amount of overlay of the <b>radio</b> channels). Service <b>availability</b> of both systems is verified again by measurements. The resulting maps help better understand the effect of coexistence on achievable system performance under different indoor/outdoor reception situations considering real transmission conditions.|$|R
