500|$|The {{influence}} of films is also seen in Earl Cain. As Yuki enjoys the American television series Twin Peaks (1990–1991), [...] reviewers have noted {{its influence on}} Forgotten Juliet, {{the first part of}} Earl Cain. Yuki felt that two minor characters that appear in Forgotten Juliet, Maddi and Leland in the chapter [...] "Branded Bibi", are reminiscent of the series. Yuki also drew inspiration from the film Young Sherlock Holmes (1985) for [...] "The Boys Who Stopped Time", and based the appearance of Cain's aunt on Charlotte from A <b>Room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>View</b> (1985). In the chapter [...] "Double", one of the characters shares his first name with the actor Emilio Estevez, and director Dario Argento served as the model for the antagonist.

Set in the Edwardian period of turn-of-the-twentieth-century England, he portrayed an entirely different character: Cecil Vyse, the proper upper class fiancé of the main character. In 1987, Day-Lewis assumed leading man status by starring in Philip Kaufman's adaptation of Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, where he portrayed a Czech surgeon whose hyperactive sex life is thrown into disarray when he allows himself to become emotionally involved with a woman. During the eight-month shoot he learned Czech and first began to refuse to break character on or off the set for the entire shooting schedule. During this period, Day-Lewis and other young British actors of the time such as Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tim Roth, and Bruce Payne, were dubbed the [...] "Brit Pack".|$|E

5000|$|The {{first part}} of the novel is set in Florence, Italy, and {{describes}} a young English woman's first visit to Florence, at a time when upper middle class English women were starting to lead independent, adventurous lives. Lucy Honeychurch is touring Italy with her overbearing older cousin and chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett, and the novel opens with their complaints about the hotel, [...] "The Pension Bertolini." [...] Their primary concern is that although <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> of the River Arno have been promised for each of them, their rooms instead look over a courtyard. A Mr. Emerson interrupts their [...] "peevish wrangling," [...] offering to swap rooms as he and his son, George Emerson, look over the Arno. This behaviour causes Miss Bartlett some consternation, as it appears impolite. Without letting Lucy speak, Miss Bartlett refuses the offer, looking down on the Emersons because of their unconventional behaviour and thinking it would place her under an [...] "unseemly obligation" [...] towards them. However, another guest at the pension, an Anglican clergyman named Mr. Beebe, persuades the pair to accept the offer, assuring Miss Bartlett that Mr. Emerson only meant to be kind.|$|R

2500|$|Nicolodi {{devised the}} {{original}} story concept but received no on-screen credit {{for her work}} on the screenplay.
