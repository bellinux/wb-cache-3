5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> adopt the literal meaning of the language. The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks {{to give effect to}} the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted.|$|E
5|$|As in Myst, the {{topology}} of {{the islands}} was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be created using polygonal geometry. All other objects were modeled using B-splines and NURBS.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{when the}} FSM {{negotiated}} a defensive {{agreement with the}} United States, it did so from a weak position because it had grown heavily dependent on American assistance.

5|$|Sultan Hamud was {{loyal to}} the British and acted as a figurehead for an {{essentially}} British-run government, the sultanate only being retained to avoid the costs involved with running Zanzibar directly as a crown colony. Several months after the war, Hamud, with British prompting, abolished slavery in all its forms. The emancipation of slaves <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> present themselves to a government office and proved a slow process—within ten years only 17,293 slaves had been freed, from an estimated population of 60,000 in 1891.|$|E

5|$|The {{final case}} in which the Supreme Court upheld Section 5 was Lopez v. Monterey County (Lopez II) (1999). In Lopez II, the Court reiterated its {{reasoning}} in Katzenbach and Rome, and it upheld as constitutional the requirement that covered local governments obtain preclearance before implementing voting changes that their parent state <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> implement, even if the parent state was not itself a covered jurisdiction.|$|E

After their trial period, players could either cancel their accounts, or keep them to continue playing the game at the cost of the monthly subscription fee.|$|E
5|$|Adventure was {{published}} by the developer of the 2600 console, Atari, Inc, and programmed by Atari employee Warren Robinett. At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and development cycle for their games, but this <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> plan for their next game as they neared completion of their current one to stay productive. Robinett was finishing his work on Slot Racers when he was {{given an opportunity to}} visit the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Julius Smith, one of several friends he was sharing a house with. There, he was introduced to the 1977 version of the computer text game Colossal Cave Adventure, created by Will Crowther and modified by Don Woods. After playing the game for several hours, he was inspired to create a graphical version of the game.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{was first}} practiced in simple {{form in the}} mid 18th century by jäger- or rifle units. Their tasks <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be inconspicuous, and they were issued green and later other drab colour uniforms. With the advent of longer range and more {{accurate}} weapons, especially the repeating rifle, camouflage was adopted for the uniforms of all armies, spreading to most forms of military equipment including ships and aircraft. Many modern camouflage textiles address visibility not only to visible light but also near infrared, for concealment from night vision devices. Camouflage is not only visual; heat, sound, magnetism and even smell {{can be used to}} target weapons, and may be intentionally concealed. Some forms of camouflage have elements of scale invariance, designed to disrupt outlines at different distances, typically digital camouflage patterns made of pixels.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Dutch {{colonisation}} of the East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), many people of Chinese descent were contracted as skilled artisans in the construction of Batavia on the northwestern coast of Java; they also served as traders, sugar mill workers, and shopkeepers. The economic boom, precipitated by trade between the East Indies and China via the port of Batavia, increased Chinese immigration to Java. The number of ethnic Chinese in Batavia grew rapidly, reaching a total of 10,000 by 1740. Thousands more lived outside the city walls. The Dutch colonials <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> carry registration papers, and deported those who did not comply to China.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's disloyalty {{led to the}} Crown {{seizing the}} castle again and taking on the burden of {{repairing}} and maintaining it. The expenditure was recorded in still-surviving Treasury accounts which provide a valuable insight into {{the development of the}} castle during the later medieval period. In the 1180s the defences appear to have been a combination of stone walls (the old Roman structure) with Norman modifications, plus earthworks and timber palisades. They were maintained in part by some of the local manors, which were under a feudal obligation called heckage that <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> repair and keep up sections of the palisades.|$|E
5|$|Protestants had {{received}} services from itinerant ministers {{in the late}} 1790s, but the Spanish <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> move to American territory until after the Louisiana Purchase. After the purchase, the Baptist missionary John Mason Peck built the first Protestant church in St. Louis in 1818. Methodist ministers reached the town {{during the early years}} after the purchase, but only formed a congregation in 1821. The Presbyterian Church in St. Louis began as a Bible reading society in 1811, and in December 1817 members organized a church and built a chapel late the next year. A fourth Protestant group to take root was the Episcopal Church, founded in 1825.|$|E

5|$|The {{captain and}} most of the crew of the shipall {{nationals}} of the Philippineshad to face a U.S. Coast Guard Board of Inquiry, which <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> remain in the United States for several weeks after the wreck. In addition, a federal grand jury investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the questions posed at the inquiry, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On September 16, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's error was the primary cause of the wreck, with the first and third officers of the ship also partly responsible. The investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against any member of the New Carissa crew.|$|E
5|$|According to Schafer, Brütal Legend {{had been}} in {{development}} since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts. Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E
5|$|Bond dispatches Sévérine's {{guards and}} sneaks aboard her boat. After he joins {{her in the}} shower, the two have sex. While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond {{that it is not}} too late to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant <b>required</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> evacuate the island. This allowed him to use it as his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine is bound to a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey on her head, and challenges Bond to shoot it with an antique percussion cap pistol. Bond misses the target, and Silva responds by shooting her in the head.|$|E
