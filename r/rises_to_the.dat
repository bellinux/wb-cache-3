5|$|Midsomer Norton {{lies on the}} River Somer which <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Chilcompton and on the Wellow Brook which rises {{near the}} village of Ston Easton. The town {{therefore}} occupies two valleys of the Mendip Hills and these merge west of Radstock. The combined river then flows east reaching the River Avon near Midford, thence to Bath and through Bristol into the Bristol Channel at Avonmouth.|$|E
50|$|In males, the UG sinus {{is divided}} into three regions: upper, pelvic, and phallic. The upper part gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> urinary bladder and the pelvic part gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prostatic and {{membranous}} parts of the urethra. The phallic portion gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> penile urethra.|$|R
50|$|Protophragmoceras gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle Silurian Phragmoceras, {{which gave}} <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> closely related Middle Silurian Tubiferoceras and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Upper Silurian Pristeroceras and Phragmocerina. Protophagmoceras also gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> less {{characteristic}} but still included Middle Silurian Endoplectoceras and Sthenoceras, which extends into the Lower Devonian.|$|R

5|$|The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge {{is located}} in a {{predominantly}} rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County within the Cacapon River valley. Baker Mountain, a forested narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immediate west, and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise to the bridge's east. The confluence of Capon Springs Run with the Cacapon River lies just north (downstream) of the bridge. George Washington National Forest is located to the bridge's southeast, covering the forested area south of Capon Springs Road.|$|E
5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
50|$|Assuming this {{is correct}} the {{evolutionary}} order appears <b>to</b> be: <b>the</b> Archigregarinorida gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eugregarinorida {{who in turn}} gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Neogregarinorida.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{statement of}} Huygens' principle for <b>the</b> D'Alembertian gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> KdV hierarchy, analogously, the Dirac operator gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AKNS hierarchy.|$|R
50|$|According to Donovan et al (1981) the Stephanoceratidae and Otoitdae {{both have}} their {{origin in the}} Hildoceratoidea, in the Phymatoceratidae. <b>The</b> Otoitidae gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sphaeroceratidae which gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cardioceraticae, <b>the</b> Stephanoceratidae <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kosmoceratidae, all within the Stephanoceratoidea. The Stephanoceratidae, accordingly, also gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Perisphinctidae, root stock of the Perisphictoidea.|$|R
5|$|East of {{this station}} on the IND side are {{turnouts}} for a connection to Phase 3 of the Second Avenue Subway, clearly visible from a moving train, which would allow future service from Queens towards Midtown and Downtown Manhattan. Also to the east, the eastbound track of the IND line <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper level of the tunnel, as both IND tracks are located on the upper level of 63rd Street Tunnel for the trip under the East River. The two tracks on the lower level of that tunnel are being connected to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) via the East Side Access project. The project will bring trains from the LIRR's Main Line to Grand Central Terminal, but, as of December 2016, the lower level is currently unused.|$|E
5|$|The River Slea <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Sleaford, near Ancaster, {{and flows}} in an easterly direction, passing through Sleaford {{on its way}} to South Kyme, beyond which it is called the Kyme Eau, joining the River Witham at Chapel Hill. Kyme Eau had been navigable since at least the reign of Edward III, for in 1375 Gilbert d'Umframville was accused of {{illegally}} collecting tolls on boats carrying food products to the people of Kesteven. He had been doing so for 12 years, and he defended his case before the king, explaining that the river was navigable from Dog Dyke to Brent Fen, but that it suffered from silting and the banks were in a poor state of repair. Having agreed to carry out repairs, he was granted the right to levy tolls by letters patent.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Petén {{was the last}} stage of the conquest of Guatemala, a {{prolonged}} conflict during the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. A wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest, Petén contains a central drainage basin {{with a series of}} lakes and areas of savannah. It is crossed by several ranges of low karstic hills and <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south as it nears the Guatemalan Highlands. The conquest of Petén, a region now incorporated into the modern republic of Guatemala, climaxed in 1697 with the capture of Nojpetén, the island capital of the Itza kingdom, by Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to European colonisers.|$|E

5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} typically <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface to breathe through its blowhole {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower ground}} to the {{south-east}} of Bentworth and {{to the south of}} the nearby villages of Lasham and Shalden drains towards the River Wey which <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface near Alton. Near Hall Place is the village duckpond, with cottages opposite it dated to 1733. Such names as Colliers Wood and Nancole Copse in the parish point to the early operations of the charcoal burners, the colliers of the Middle Ages. Other woods in the area include Gaston Wood, Childer Hill Copse, Miller's Wood, Thedden Copse, Well Copse, North Wood, Wadgett's Copse, Bylander's Copse, Nancole Copse, Widgell Copse, South Lease Copse, Stubbins Copse and Mayhew's Wood. The names of Windmill Field and Mill Piece indicate the site of one or more ancient mills.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his {{expulsion}} from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries {{to run away from}} any danger, he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his flatulence affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person who probably shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so bravely and capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rank of brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well-known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: {{by the end of the}} ninth book he estimates that he has had sex with 480 women.|$|E

5|$|The Žirmūnai {{elderate}} occupies 5.7km² or 1.4% of {{the total}} area of the municipality of Vilnius according to data used for the 2001 census. Žirmūnai is located north of central Vilnius, along the western bank of the River Neris, on a flat plain which <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. The elderate extends for about 4.4kilometres from north to south, and is about 1.5kilometres across at its widest point. The southernmost point of the Žirmūnai elderate is only some 450metres from Vilnius' Cathedral Square, in {{the centre of the}} city. Žirmūnai is bordered by the elderates of Verkiai in the north and Šnipiškės in the west, and is separated from Vilnius' Old Town and Antakalnis by the Neris. Žirmūnai's western boundary is defined by the following streets (from north to south): Verkių, Žvalgų, Kalvarijų, Žalgirio, and Rinktinės. The River Neris serves as Žirmūnai's northern, eastern and southern boundary. Žirmūnų Street is the district's main artery.|$|E
