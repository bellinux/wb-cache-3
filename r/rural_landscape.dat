5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a <b>rural</b> <b>landscape.</b> A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a <b>rural</b> <b>landscape</b> and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|By 1958, SR-201 between US-40 west of Magna and SR-68 (Redwood Road) was a two-lane highway through rural Salt Lake County. The <b>rural</b> <b>landscape</b> {{changed by}} the time SR-201 intersected 300 West and entered urban Salt Lake County, the highway {{becoming}} a four-lane road. The route remained this way until the intersection of 1300 East (SR-181), where the route reverted to a two-lane configuration. By 1965, {{a time when most}} U.S. Routes in the city were being replaced by Interstate Highways, all two-lane portions of the road east of 1300 East were widened to at least four lanes; an interchange between US-40, US-40A and future I-215 was being built at the mouth of Parley's Canyon. From under-construction I-15 west to Redwood Road, the old route of SR-201 was being superseded by a six-lane freeway directly to the south. All construction was complete by 1970 with interchanges at 900 West and Redwood Road; the new freeway extended west to 2700 West.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} 105 locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal from Bristol to the River Thames, {{including}} 6 on the navigable section of the River Avon from Bristol to Bath and 9 on the navigable section of the River Kennet to its confluence with the Thames near Reading. The remaining 90 locks lie along the 57miles (92km) of canal. In Bath the canal separates from the river but follows its valley as far as Bradford on Avon. The ornate Bath Locks lead to a stretch through Limpley Stoke valley with few locks. The flight of locks at Devizes, including the Caen Hill Locks, raises the canal to its longest pound, which then ascends the 4 Wooton Rivers locks to the short summit pound which includes the Bruce Tunnel. Pumping stations are used to supply the canal with water. The canal continues through the <b>rural</b> <b>landscape</b> of Wiltshire and Berkshire before joining the River Kennet at Newbury and becoming a navigable river to Reading, where it flows into the River Thames.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Seasonality and {{seasons of}} Estonian landscapes are {{analysed}} using selected natural and social indicators of urban and <b>rural</b> <b>landscapes.</b> Seasonality {{has a great}} influence on the ecological and visual features of landscapes; seasonal variability is especially great in temperate climate zones where relatively cold winters alternate with warm summers. The indicators that are suitable for describing the seasonality of landscapes are natural parameters such as air temperature, radiation regime, climatic seasons and snow cover, and social parameters of birthdays, alcohol consumption and state budget allocations. Because of the great seasonal differences in natural and socio-economic conditions, the differences between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>landscapes</b> having different seasonal rhythms are focused upon. One of the main differences is the change in lifestyle which is detected in {{the change in the}} seasonal variability of births. Seasonal differences between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>landscapes</b> are also confirmed by parameters of changing climate and some social indicators. The developing information society creates new jobs and a lifestyle that has its own seasonal rhythm. Periods of active work and social activity accumulate towards the deadlines preceding the Christmas and the summer period of vacations. A project-oriented information society has more flexibility to enjoy nature in <b>rural</b> <b>landscapes</b> during different seasons.

40|$|The European Landscape Convention (ELC) aims {{to promote}} European {{landscape}} protection, management and planning. The ELC has been ratified {{by a number}} of European member and no -member states, including Italy. A new generation of landscape plans is developing in order to achieve the aims of ELC. A renewed interest is growing for <b>landscapes</b> and <b>rural</b> <b>landscapes</b> both at the Italian national and regional level. Sixteen years after the ELC signature, roughly a half of the Italian regions have modified and approved landscape plans with an emphasis for the analysis and design of rural areas. The <b>rural</b> <b>landscapes,</b> in particular, can be studied and classed through several points of view including the forestry, agronomic, pedological, and built dimensions. The <b>rural</b> built <b>landscape</b> dimension has rarely been studied and integrated within the Italian landscape plans in a satisfactory way. So, after an analysis of the Italian regional landscape plans consistent with the ELC and a literature review about the <b>rural</b> built <b>landscape</b> dimension, we propose a method and some key elements useful to categorize the Sardinian <b>rural</b> <b>landscapes.</b> In this study we present the results achieved, explaining real case studies developed under a research project funded by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Italy...|$|R
