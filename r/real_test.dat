25|$|The tenth {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial, {{and the first}} <b>real</b> <b>test</b> for the favourites. It was won by Stephen Roche, with Mottet in second place; Mottet became the new leader of the general classification.

The Tour arrived in the Pyrenees in the thirteenth stage. Non-climbers, such as Gayant lost more than fifteen minutes, and so the non-climbers {{were removed from the}} top positions of the general classification; the new top three was Mottet– Bernard– Roche, all serious contenders for the final victory.|$|E
25|$|Since 1996, {{international}} cyclists have dominated. Cyclists {{from the}} U.S. have won 8 Classics, Mexico and Guatemala three each, and Belize five. Two of those belong to Ernest Meighan (1997, 2001), one to Shane Vasquez (2006) {{and one to}} Giovanni Choto (2012), while Darnell Barrow became the first Belizean {{to get back to}} back wins for Belize since 1995. A pattern has developed of younger Belizean cyclists and expendable foreign ones leading the race early, dropping back into the peloton, then allowing fresher, stronger, more well-known cyclists to step forward. Most Belizean teams bring in foreign riders to participate, then have to defend themselves to the outraged public when a foreigner wins. But that foreign participation also introduces Belizeans to fresh talent and provides for a <b>real</b> <b>test</b> of Belizean cyclists' capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Murray then {{attempted}} {{to become the}} first British man to defend a Wimbledon title since Fred Perry in 1936. He began his defence with a comfortable straight sets win over David Goffin, his 450th career win, and followed that up with an emphatic win over Blaž Rola in which he only dropped two games. His first <b>real</b> <b>test</b> was against 27th seed Roberto Bautista Agut, but the Spaniard proved no match for Murray who raced to another straight sets win in just over an hour and a half. Murray then defeated big serving Kevin Anderson, the 20th seed, to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final. His defence then came to an abrupt halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak at Wimbledon with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semi-finals {{for the first time since}} 2008.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The popular IEEE 802. 11 WLAN {{is known}} to achieve {{relatively}} small throughput performance compared to the underlying physical layer (PHY) transmission rate. This is due mainly to the large overheads composed of medium access control (MAC) header, PHY preamble/header, backoff time, acknowledgement (ACK) transmission, and some inter-frame spaces (IFSs). Since these overheads are added to each frame transmission, the throughput degradation is relatively high when the small-size frames are transmitted. In this paper, we present a frame aggregation scheme, which can improve the throughput performance of IEEE 802. 11 WLAN. By aggregating small-size frames into a large frame, we can reduce these overheads relatively. We propose a simple method to implement the frame aggregation into the <b>real</b> <b>testbed</b> using off-the-shelf IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN products via the device driver modifications. The performance of the frame aggregation is evaluated by both the numerical analysis and the actual measurements from the <b>real</b> <b>testbed.</b> According to the measurement results from the <b>real</b> <b>testbed,</b> the frame aggregation can improve the throughput performance of IEEE 802. 11 b WLAN by 2 to 3 Mbps, when multiple frames are aggregated.
