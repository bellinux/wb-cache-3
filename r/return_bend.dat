40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a design concept for return passages in multistage centrifugal compressors. Flow in a baseline return passage is analyzed to identify loss sources that have substantial potential for reduction. For the geometry analyzed, {{it is found}} that mismatched incidence of the return vane, separation on the hub surface at the exit of the <b>return</b> <b>bend,</b> and blockage due to separation on the shroud surface near the <b>return</b> <b>bend</b> inlet lead to losses which have such potential. Preliminary designs were developed and computationally assessed to determine effective geometries for eliminating separation on the hub at the <b>return</b> <b>bend</b> exit and for reducing losses. Then, based on assessment of the preliminary designs, other features of the loss generation were addressed. The geometry proposed includes an increased axial extent of the <b>return</b> <b>bend,</b> an increasing radius of curvature through the <b>return</b> <b>bend,</b> and lean of the return vane leading edge, mitigating the loss mechanisms identified in the baseline return passage. The three-dimensional calculations showed a cumulative loss coefficient that was 10 % lower than the baseline. The design described was carried out with a fixed inlet condition, and a second return passage was thus developed to determine the potential loss reduction if the inlet geometry were modified. (The design of the impeller required to achieve the modified inlet flow was not considered.) The cumulative loss coefficient was reduced by 27 % compared with the baseline, with the implication that an area for exploration is integration of the impeller and return passage flow fields. by Benjamin W.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{correlation}} for {{two-phase flow}} {{pressure drop in}} 180 ° <b>return</b> <b>bends</b> is proposed based on a total of 241 experimental data points for R- 22 and R- 410 A from two independent studies. The data span smooth tubes with inner diameters (D) from 3. 3 mm to 11. 6 mm, bend radiuses (R) from 6. 4 mm to 37. 3 mm, and curvature ratios (2 R/D) from 2. 3 to 8. 2. The correlation consists of a two-phase pressure drop for straight tubes and a multiplier that accounts for the bend curvature. The Buckinham-PI Theorem was used to formulate the curvature multiplier in terms of refrigerant properties, flow characteristics, and bend geometry. The correlation predicts all data with a mean deviation of 15. 7 %, and 75 % of the data fall within ± 25 % error bands...|$|R

40|$|Fin-and-tube heat {{exchangers}} {{are often used}} as evaporators in HVAC&R systems. To increase the compactness, the tubes of these {{heat exchangers}} are folded up in a sequence of hairpin tubes. These hairpins consist of two straight tubes interconnected by a sharp U-bend. The working fluid will pass through one or multiple hairpin tubes while evaporating. The geometry of the bends and how the sequence of bends is built up influences the two-phase flow behaviour. In this work {{the evolution of the}} two-phase flow behaviour downstream of a sharp <b>return</b> <b>bend</b> is studied. This is done by measuring the capacitance of the flow on several locations downstream of the <b>return</b> <b>bend.</b> Due to the difference in dielectric constant between the phases, the measured capacitance will vary depending on the amount of each phase present between the electrodes. Previous work has already shown that the flow behaviour can be characterized based on the capacitance signal of the flow. The refrigerant used in this study is R 134 a, the mass flux was varied between 150 and 450 kg/m²s and the vapour quality varied between 0 and 1. It was observed that downstream of the <b>return</b> <b>bend</b> a significant effect on the flow regime was induced up to 10 tube diameters downstream of the bend...|$|E
40|$|The flow boiling heat {{transfer}} characteristics of liquid nitrogen in three U-tubes with different curvature ratios were investigated experimentally.

The drying out occurs near the inner wall of the <b>return</b> <b>bend</b> under high heat flux. A parameter Rh (down/up), which is defined as the ratio of heat transfer coefficient between the downstream and upstream section of U-bend, is proposed to evaluate the contributions of the curvature ratio to the heat transfer.

Furthermore, the experiments results of the average heat transfer coefficient are compared with the calculated results of the empirical correlation...|$|E

A combination of capacity measurements obtained from laboratory testing, the pattern of measured <b>return</b> <b>bend</b> temperatures, and the theoretical analysis suggests the occurrence of tube-to-tube transfer via fins and rejects the tube longitudinal heat transfer as the possible causes of capacity degradation. The impact of tube-to-tube heat transfer was negligible in tests with a uniform 5. 6 °C superheat, but it was significant in tests involving 16. 7 °C superheat. The measured difference in capacity between two evaporators – in one of which tube-to-tube heat transfer was prevented by cuts in common fins – was as much as 23 %.

The brazing temperatures recorded at the selected return bends were compared with control tem-perature profiles for high-quality brazed joints. The results clearly accentuated the disparities in the heating rates, the cooling rates and the peak bonding temperatures between the non-leaking joints and the leaking joints. The autobrazer process parameters were then correlated {{with a number of}} leaks and leak locations to determine how to configure the autobrazer and control the process variables to ensure similar brazing con-ditions at all joints. By so doing, the repeatability of the brazing process and the production of high-quality joints was guaranteed...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} {{study on the}} flow behaviour of gas and liquid in the upward section of a vertical pipe system with an internal diameter of 101. 6 mm and a serpentine geometry. The experimental matrix consists of superficial gas and liquid velocities in ranges of 0. 15 – 30 m/s and from 0. 07 to 1. 5 m/s, respectively, which cover bubbly to annular flow. The effects on the flow behaviours downstream of the 180 ° <b>return</b> <b>bend</b> are significantly reduced when the flow reaches an axial distance of 47 pipe diameters from the U-bend. Therefore, reasonably developed flow is attained at this development length downstream of the bend. Other published measurements for large-diameter film thickness show similar trends {{with respect to the}} superficial gas velocity. However, the trends differ from those of small-diameter pipes, with which the film thickness decreases much faster with increasing gas flow. As a result, {{only a few of the}} published correlations for small pipe data agreed with the experimental data for large pipe film thickness. We therefore modified one of the best-performing correlations, which produced a better fit. Qualitative and statistical analyses show that the new correlation provides improved predictions for two-phase flow film thickness in large-diameter pipes...|$|E
