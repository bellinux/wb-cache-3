40|$|Abstract Background The PORPUS-P {{is a short}} {{questionnaire}} {{for measuring}} prostate-specific quality of life (QoL), which was designed in Canada for use in prostate cancer (PC) patients. We aimed to generate a German version and compare PORPUS-P scores of German <b>reference</b> <b>men</b> from the general population, and German and Canadian patients with newly diagnosed PC who were scheduled to receive radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT). Methods The study sample consisted of 988 <b>reference</b> <b>men,</b> 121 German and 66 Canadian PC patients scheduled for RT, and 371 German and 68 Canadian PC patients scheduled for RP. All men completed the PORPUS-P (German postal questionnaire, Canada personal interview). Data were gathered from PC patients {{before the start of}} therapy. Results Canadian patients were better educated than the German patients, and fewer were retired. Patients scheduled to receive RT were older and more were retired. German RT patients had lower D'Amico risk scores and pre-treatment Gleason scores than RP patients, and Canadian RT patients had higher pre-treatment PSA than RP patients. Urinary and sexual dysfunction were seen in PC patients (especially RT patients), but were also common in the German <b>reference</b> <b>men.</b> Crude mean PORPUS-P scores differed statistically significant between German RT and RP and Canadian RP and RT patients, with RT patients having higher QoL scores. The differences in age-adjusted mean PORPUS-P scores between <b>reference</b> <b>men</b> and RP patients were not clinically significant, while RT patients had (clinically) significantly lower scores than the <b>reference</b> <b>men.</b> Conclusion The German translation of the PORPUS-P appears to be a short and feasible tool for assessing prostate-specific QoL. Although we found a similar response pattern, Canadian and German PC patients scheduled to receive RT or RP rated their pre-treatment quality of life on different levels, which reveals the need for national reference data. Problems in several QoL domains exist before treatment, and differ between PC patients scheduled for RT and RP. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground: In 1975 a <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> for the {{estimation}} of radiation doses without adverse health effects was created. However, during the past decades considerable changes in body weight and body composition were observed and new in vivo technologies of body composition analysis are available. Thus, the <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> might be outdated as adequate standard to assess medication and radiation doses. Objective: To compare body composition of an adult population with 1975 <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> data questioning its value as a suitable reference. Methods: Body composition was assessed in 208 healthy, Caucasian subjects (105 males, 103 females) aged 18 - 78 years with a BMI range of 16. 8 - 35. 0 kg/m 2. Fat mass (FM) and muscle mass (MM) were assessed by Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), organ masses (OM) were measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Results: There was a considerable variance in body weight and body composition. When compared with <b>Reference</b> <b>Man,</b> great differences in body composition were found. Men {{and women of the}} study population were heavier, taller and had more FM, MM and higher masses of brain, heart and spleen. These differences did not depend on age. Relationships between body weight and body composition were investigated by general linear regression models whereby deviations in FM, MM and heart mass disappeared, while differences in brain and spleen mass persisted. Conclusions: Our data indicate the need of a modern <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> and thus a re-calculation of medical radiation doses and medication...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{performed}} by various research groups {{have shown that}} the more realistic organ topology of voxel models constructed from medical image data of real persons has an impact on calculated doses for external as well as internal exposures. As a consequence of these findings, the ICRP decided to use voxel models for the forthcoming update of organ dose conversion coefficients. These voxel models should be representative of an average population, i. e. they should resemble the ICRP <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> with respect to their external dimensions, their organ topology, and their organ masses. The first step towards a whole family of voxel models covering various age groups was to establish adult male and female voxel models representing the working population. To meet the ICRP requirements, workers at GSF constructed voxel models of a male and female adult, based on the voxel models of two individuals whose body height and weight resembled those of <b>Reference</b> <b>Man.</b> The organ masses of both models were adjusted to the ICRP data on <b>Reference</b> <b>Man,</b> without spoiling their realistic anatomy.

The ALI is the annual intake of a radionuclide which would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of 0. 05 Sv/yr for stochastic effects, or a committed dose equivalent to an individual organ or tissue of 0. 5 Sv/yr for deterministic effects, to <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> (ICRP 1975). A DAC is that concentration of a radionuclide in air which, if breathed by <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> for a work-year, would result in an intake corresponding to its ALI (EPA 1988).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Atypical sex {{development}} {{is associated with}} psychosocial vulnerability. We investigated psychosocial well-being in individuals with disorders of sex development (DSD) and hypothesized that psychosocial well-being was related to degree of genital atypicality at birth. METHODS: 120 male (n= 16) and female (n= 104) persons with DSD, aged 14 - 60 years, participated in a follow-up audit on psychosocial well-being. They were stratified in: women with 1) 46,XY and female genitalia, 2) 46,XY or 46,XX and atypical genitalia, and 3) men with 46,XY and atypical genitalia. We used the Illness Cognition Questionnaire (ICQ), Checklist Individual Strength (CIS 8 R), TNO-AZL Quality of Life questionnaire (TAAQOL), Adult Self-Report (ASR), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). RESULTS: Data were compared to reference groups. Participants generally were coping well with DSD (ICQ). Women with DSD reported elevated levels of fatigue (CIS 8 R) and slightly more attention and memory problems (TAAQOL, ASR). Women with atypical genitalia reported more emotional and behavioral problems. On the ASR Rule-breaking Behavior and Antisocial Personality scales, these women had similar scores as <b>reference</b> <b>men.</b> Women with DSD reported a higher self-esteem (RSES). No differences in psychosocial well-being were found between men with DSD and <b>reference</b> <b>men.</b> CONCLUSION: Individuals with DSD across all diagnostic groups generally reported a good psychosocial well-being. The results further suggest involvement of prenatal androgens {{in the development of}} personality traits related to assertiveness and egocentricity. We recommend that individuals with a DSD and their families are involved in decision-making processes and have access to multidisciplinary care...|$|R

40|$|The 70 -kg {open_quotes}standard man{close_quotes} {{representing}} a typical Western adult male {{has been used}} in physiological models since at least the 1920 s. In 1949 at the Chalk River conference, health physicists from the U. S., UK, and Canada agreed on the concept of a standard man to facilitate comparison of internal dose estimates. The 70 -kg standard man included specifications of the masses of 25 organs and tissues, total body content of 15 elements, total water intake and output, water content of the body, and some anatomical and physiological data for the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In 1959, in its Publication 2 {sup 2 } on permissible doses for internal radiation the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) modified standard man. In 1963 the ICRP established a task group to revise and extend the standard man concept. The name was changed later to <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> and the task group`s work was published in 1975 as ICRP Publication 23 {sup 3 }. Publication 23 similar to Publication 2, updates and documents the sources of the data. Data on women, children, and fetuses were also collected, where available, but these data were limited primarily to anatomical data and only a few reference values were established for these groups. Information assembled {{during the course of the}} effort on the <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> report was used at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to construct a mathematical representation of the body (a phantom) that was suitable for use with Monte Carlo methods in the calculation of organ doses. That effort was undertaken to improve estimates of dose from photon-emitting radionuclides residing within organs, so-called internal emitters. The phantom, although updated throughout the years, remains today as the basis for organ dose estimates in nuclear medicine and radiation protection and underlies the radiation risk data derived from the epidemiologic studies of the atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the kinetic {{parameters}} for iodide thyroid accumulation in Japanese today with previously reported values.

Kinetic model analysis was conducted to obtain the clearance for thyroid uptake from the blood circulation. The thyroid uptake clearance of 123 -I was 0. 540 ± 0. 073 ml/min, which was almost similar to those reported previously. There is no obvious difference in the thyroid uptake for 24 hours, and kinetic parameters in healthy Japanese for these 50 years.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Estimates of internal radiation dose require, among other parameters, values of absorbed fraction (AF) for the source and target organs under consideration. These values are generally obtained through Monte Carlo simulation. Computational estimates of absorbed fractions, however, are subject to limitations including statistical uncertainty due to sampling variation and the adequacy of the mathematical model representing the physical system of interest. Consequently, experimental verification of Monte Carlo results is often desired. A feasibility study was conducted in which several tissue substitutes were evaluated for their potential use as volumetric dosimeters. In order to be considered in this study, a given material had to approximate the tissue of <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> as specified in Publication 23 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. This evaluation was based on the electron stopping power, the mass attenuation coefficient, the electron mass density, and the specific gravity. Another important criteria was that the tissue substitute had to be capable of changing from a liquid into a solid form to facilitate an even distribution of thermoluminesent dosimetry (TLD) powder throughout the mold. Secondly, it had to reliquify rather easily to allow for recovery of the TLD powder with little or no loss of thermoluminesence. Of the three materials selected for evaluation, a 10 % gelatin mixture provided the closest match to <b>Reference</b> <b>Man</b> tissue. The gelatin mixture was put through a series of tests to determine the usefulness as a reliable tissue substitute. The TLD powder was cast in the gelatin mixture and recovered to determine if the TLD powder was adversely affected. The distribution of the TLD powder cast into the gelatin mixture was tested to ensure an even distribution of powder was maintained throughout the mold. The gelatin was easily changed from a liquid state to a solid state which could support an even distribution of the TLD powder. Recovery of the TLD was performed with relative ease and showed minimal loss of thermoluminescence in the recovered powder. It was therefore determined that the gelatin mixture was a suitable tissue-equivalent substitute to be used in volumetric dosimetry studies...|$|E
