5|$|The band {{did a lot}} of experimenting and {{arranging}} in Cardiff before going into the studio, as a result of which Love Kraft was recorded in just three weeks. Drummer Dafydd Ieuan also attributes the album sessions' speedy conclusion to producer Mario Caldato Jr. who was very good at keeping the group together and on the <b>right</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of {{the woman and her}} lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears on the beach in a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting her head on her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back on the <b>right</b> <b>track.</b> In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E

5|$|Since re-foundation in 2004, S.S.C. Napoli S.p.A. has a {{sustainable}} management strategy. The club {{has one of}} the largest supporting groups in Italy (fourth, behind Juventus and Milan teams) which was the main source of income, in terms of gate revenue and TV rights. Except the first few seasons, Napoli made an aggregate profit in successive years: in 2004–05 and 2005–06 season the net loss were €7,061,463 and €9,088,780. In 2006–07 Serie B, Napoli made its first profit of €1,416,976 The first Serie A season back Napoli had a net profit of €11,911,041 It followed with a net profit of €10,934,520, due to the income from European matches which was offset by the increase in cost. In 2009–10 season, Napoli heavily invested on players, and made that season a net profit of just €343,686. In 2010–11 Serie A, Napoli returned to the <b>right</b> <b>track</b> with €4,197,829 net profit. It was due to the new collective TV rights of Serie A, as well as qualification to 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{analysis}} of the labour <b>rights</b> <b>track</b> record of 12 major sportsbrands regarding sportswear production in Asia. The report highlights the unfair play inherent in this industry where, for example, Nike pays USD$ 16 million a year to the Brazilian National Team and Adidas pays USD$ 1. 8 million a year to French player Zinedine Zidane while the workers who produce the football and sportsgear worn by these players earn as little as 47 cents euro per hour. The paper examines the labour <b>rights</b> <b>track</b> record of each company and highlights where they could do more to protect basic worker rights and improve the work environment for thousands employed in this industry. It does this while also acknowledging {{the fact that some of}} these companies are currently engaged in positive initiatives to achieve these aims. The report employs a case study approach and is based on interviews and written inputs from representatives of unions and other civil society organisations as well as the companies involved...|$|R

25|$|A {{visit to}} Honopū Ridge {{requires}} a few miles' walk. The view {{along the way}} includes that {{of the ocean and}} the beach of Honopu.

25|$|While {{assembling}} the earliest Nine Inch Nails recordings, Reznor {{was unable to}} find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by Prince, he played all the instruments except drums himself. Reznor has continued in this role on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians, assistants, drummers and rhythm experts. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the <b>Right</b> <b>Track</b> demos were unofficially released in 1988 as Purest Feeling and many of these songs appeared in revised form on Pretty Hate Machine, Reznor's first official release under the Nine Inch Nails name.|$|E

25|$|Rose Stone {{was pulled}} out of the band by Bubba Banks, who was by then her husband. She began a solo career, {{recording}} a Motown-style album under the name Rose Banks in 1976. Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham's group, Graham Central Station, for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 for Back on the <b>Right</b> <b>Track,</b> he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in Vallejo, California. Little Sister was also dissolved; Mary McCreary married Leon Russell and released recordings on Russell's Shelter Records label. Andy Newmark became a successful session drummer, playing with John Lennon, Roxy Music, B. B. King, Steve Winwood and others.|$|E

25|$|Battle {{losses are}} unknown and, {{although}} an Austrian victory, {{the battle of}} Hollabrunn did allow Masséna to write to Napoleon and report {{that he was on}} the <b>right</b> <b>track</b> following the Austrians, whose main body was retreating along the river Thaya near Laa an der Thaya. Johann von Klenau would later be awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa for his actions at the battle of Wagram and gallant rearguard actions after that battle. Meanwhile, Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen regrouped a large force at Jetzelsdorf, on the Pulkau river, but he later evacuated this position, after receiving intelligence that a French force was approaching Znaim from the east. The next major combat would be the one at Znaim, where the Austrians demanded an armistice.|$|E
25|$|French {{philosopher and}} {{mathematician}} René Descartes {{was the first}} to propose a model for the origin of the Solar System in his Le Monde (ou Traité de lumière) which he wrote in 1632 and 1633 and for which he delayed publication because of the Inquisition and it was published only after his death in 1664. In his view, the Universe was filled with vortices of swirling particles and the Sun and planets had condensed from a particularly large vortex that had somehow contracted, which explained the circular motion of the planets and was on the <b>right</b> <b>track</b> with condensation and contraction. However, this was before Newton's theory of gravity and we now know matter does not behave in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} a crowd of about 1,000 people at Centurion – usually figures more {{associated}} with domestic cricket matches – Africa won {{the first of three}} ODIs. The African side included ten South Africans and two Kenyans – and one of the Kenyans was substituted for a South African without getting the chance to bat. Zaheer Khan made early breakthroughs as Africa collapsed to 57 for 5 – Justin Ontong and Steve Tikolo both dismissed for ducks – but Ashwell Prince and Mark Boucher set Africa back on the <b>right</b> <b>track</b> with an 86-run partnership. Prince finished on 78 not out as he ran out of partners to bat with, Africa eventually being dismissed for 198. Asia, however, lost wickets at regular intervals, but a 24-run ninth-wicket partnership between Zaheer Khan and Shoaib Akhtar looked to turn it Asia's way. Asia needed to eke out five runs for the last wicket, with twenty-two balls to spare, but Ashish Nehra was bowled by a straight delivery from ODI debutant Dale Steyn, and Asia finished two runs short of victory.|$|E

25|$|Sly {{signed with}} Warner Bros. and {{recorded}} Back on the <b>Right</b> <b>Track</b> (1979). Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable {{to return to}} the success of his late '60s and early '70s fame. He toured with George Clinton and Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic album The Electric Spanking of War Babies. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted when Clinton and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981. When Sly disappeared into seclusion, producer Stewart Levine completed the album, which was released as Ain't But the One Way in 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance on Late Night With David Letterman that year. Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone disappeared from the limelight and entered drug rehabilitation in 1984, at the insistence of his old friend Bobby Womack. Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music.|$|E

50|$|By 1984, Dolby Stereo had a competitor. Ultra Stereo Labs had {{introduced}} a comparable stereo optical sound system, Ultra Stereo.
