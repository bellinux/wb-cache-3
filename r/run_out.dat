5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E

Another good partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the Vipers to their target with seven balls to spare. Taylor, who was named as player of the tournament, was the most effective bowler for the Storm, but even she could only limit the Vipers to six runs per over.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the percentage of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits made by patients who recently <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of their inhaled short-acting beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids and to characterize this understudied patient population. A secondary analysis was performed of data from four ED-based multicenter studies of acute asthma during 1996 – 1998 (n 64 EDs). In each study, consecutive adult patients, aged 18 – 54 years, with acute asthma underwent a structured interview that assessed running out of inhaled medications. The analytic cohort comprised 1095 adults. Overall, 324 patients (30 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 27 – 32 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of either of their inhaled beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids during the week before their index ED visit; 311 (28 %; 95 % CI, 26 – 31 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled beta-agonists per se. Among a subset of 518 patients on inhaled corticosteroids, 55 patients (11 %; 95 % CI, 8 – 14 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled corticosteroids. In the multivariable model, predictors of running out of an asthma medication were male sex, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, no insurance, lower household income, and use of EDs as the preferred source of asthma prescriptions (all p 0. 05). Among patients who <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of medications, 49 % (95 % CI, 43 – 55 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled beta-agonists and 72 % (95 % CI, 58 – 84 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled corticosteroids, before onset of their acute asthma symptoms. In 1095 adult ED patients with acute asthma, we found that 30 % <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of their inhaled asthma medications before the ED visit. Asthma patients who <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of medications had sociodemographic characteristics that may help with identification of preventable ED visits. Multifacete...|$|R

5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and questioned her. Collins asked {{for the presence of}} a union representative several times but was refused by the manager each time. Upon questioning, Collins explained that she had put four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) into a larger box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of $1 size boxes and admitted she did not know how much chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. The investigator returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E
