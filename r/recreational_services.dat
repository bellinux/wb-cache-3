2500|$|According to British {{historian}} A. J. P. Taylor, Monash was [...] "the only {{general of}} creative originality {{produced by the}} First World War." [...] Monash's impact on Australian military thinking was significant in three areas. First, {{he was the first}} Australian to fully command Australian forces and he took, as following Australian commanders did, a relatively independent line with his British superiors. Second, he promoted the concept of the commander's duty to ensure the safety and well-being of his troops to a pre-eminent position applying a philosophy of [...] "collective individualism". And finally, he, along with staff officer Thomas Blamey, forcefully demonstrated the benefit of thorough planning and integration of all arms of the forces available, and of all of the components supporting the front line forces, including logistical, medical and <b>recreational</b> <b>services.</b> Troops later recounted {{that one of the most}} extraordinary things about the Battle of Hamel was not the use of armoured tanks, nor the tremendous success of the operation, but the fact that in the midst of battle Monash had arranged delivery of hot meals up to the front line.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the [...] {{expansion}} {{was started}} {{in the fall of}} 1932.The company made a deal with the city to employ family providers; in exchange the city would pay the difference between normal pay and the increased pay. 32 men with four or more children were chosen for this deal. The first test run was on 29 September 1933, and was taken into use on 28 October 1933. A number of <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> grew up at Lian, including a ski jump in the winter, and bathing and rowing in the lake Lianvannet in the winter. 1925, during winter, the frozen lake was used for trotting, with up to 6,000 watchers. In 1927, the land owner Graakalbanen offered the trotting association 100 hectare of land for free, but the deal did not go through, but the association did not except the deal since the tramway was not yet built. Instead they established themselves at Leangen. During World War II, the new field was confiscated by the German occupation forces, and again the association was offered free land. The deal only did not strike through thanks to a single, unwilling cabin owner.|$|E

40|$|The current {{understanding}} of urban green space (UGS) <b>recreational</b> <b>service</b> is limited {{due to the}} lack of being examined under the logic that underlies the ecosystem service paradigm, leading to limitations in the application of ecosystem based management in urban land use planning. This paper offers a conceptual model of UGS <b>recreational</b> <b>service</b> that follows the logical flow of ecosystem service generation, supplementing the knowledge gap and supporting the use of ecosystem base management in urban land use planning. The model includes four categories; UGS features, population characteristics, recreational use behavior, and recreational benefits while considering the use behavior as the service carrier. A process analysis shows the role of each model component in generating the services, and highlights the important role of regulating service potentials and their mobilization. Ways of informing interventions for improving efficiency or equity have been suggested. Efficiency can be assessed by applying the dose-response mechanism in the model. Equity on the other hand, can be measured by exploring which predictors of use are dominant, which advances UGS access assessment by shifting from the spatial-based to the use-based. Survey design techniques and indicators measuring various variables of the model have also been proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
