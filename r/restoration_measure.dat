5000|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{performance of}} Measure for Measure {{took place on}} St. Stephen's night, 26 December 1604.During the <b>Restoration,</b> <b>Measure</b> {{was one of many}} Shakespearean plays adapted to the tastes of a new audience. Sir William Davenant inserted Benedick and Beatrice from Much Ado About Nothing into his adaptation, called The Law Against Lovers. Samuel Pepys saw the hybrid play on 18 February 1662; he describes it in his Diary as [...] "a good play, and well performed" [...] - he was especially impressed by the singing and dancing of the young actress who played Viola, Beatrice's sister (Davenant's creation). Davenant rehabilitated Angelo, who is now only testing Isabella's chastity; the play ends with a triple marriage. This, among the earliest of Restoration adaptations, appears not to have succeeded on stage.|$|E
5000|$|Adult redtail chubs feed {{primarily}} on aquatic invertebrates, including small mollusks, insects, earthworms, and crustaceans. A potential predator of the redtail chub is the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, {{which has been}} found preying on related species in Pennsylvania. The river chub {{could be considered a}} potential competitor although it is not currently known to share habitat with the redtail chub. The redtail chub prefers clear rocky runs and pools of creeks and small rivers. It is also found in clear upland streams with predominantly gravel substrates. The right size gravel is extremely important because the redtail chub, like all Nocomis species, uses its mouth in order to collect the gravel to create nests in which to spawn. It prefers small to moderate sized streams, with low to moderate gradients and commonly with a riffle-pool type habitat. The redtail chub prefers coolwater streams with a moderate pH. Stream gradient, turbidity, and coal mine pollution probably restrict the its present distribution and abundance. [...] Gravel addition as a habitat <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> has been successful in reinstating the species' range. Some interspecific competition might exist between the redtail chub and the river chub (Nocomis micropogon), resulting in an altered distributional pattern. This is because the two species are thought to be allopatric. The redtail chub breeds in late spring and females reach sexual maturity around the 2 year mark.|$|E
40|$|Background Peatland {{restoration}} {{can have}} several objectives, for example re-establishing the natural habitat, supporting unique biodiversity attributes or re-initiating key biogeochemical pro-cesses, which can {{ultimately lead to}} a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Every <b>restoration</b> <b>measure,</b> however, is itself a disturbance to the ecosystem. Methods Here, we examine an ecosystem shift in a coastal fen at the southern Baltic Sea which was rewetted by flooding. The analyses are based on one year of bi-weekly closed chamber measurements of methane fluxes gathered at spots located in different vegetation stands. During measurement campaigns, we recorded data on water levels, peat temperatures, and chemical properties of peat water. In addition we analyzed the first 20 cm of peat before and after flooding for dry bulk density (DBD), content of organic matter and total amounts of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and other nutrients.

40|$|This is {{the fourth}} study of the {{response}} of salmonids to river restoration in Bognelv in Finnmark County, Norway. Bognelv was channelized, erosion secured and flood protected during the late 1930 s to early 1990 s period, {{and as a consequence}} of this, salmonid densities declined dramatically. The first restoration measures were conducted in 2006, and the last <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> to date were conducted autumn 2014. Following previous surveys’ sampling design, we sampled salmonid juveniles using electrofishing and benthic invertebrates were sampled by means of kick-sampling. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) responded quickly to restoration measures, already in 2008 with relatively much higher densities compared to before 2006, and continued to their highest overall mean production of juveniles in 2015. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) densities remained low through 2013, but then increased substantially in 2015, but not on the same level as brown trout. According to our data, Arctic charr (Salvenius alpinus) have barely responded to the restoration measures, being absent from all samples in 2013 and 2015, and was therefore excluded from our analyses. Macroinvertebrates were classified to the level of species {{for the first time in}} 2015 to better investigate their response to the restoration measures. The most important environmental variables influencing density and length for Atlantic salmon and brown trout juveniles were; depth, duration of growth period, temperature during growth period, moss cover, 1 + density, gravel and distance from E 6 (the estuary). An ordination analysis was carried out to reveal environmental and restoration effects on the macroinvertebrate community. The most important environmental variables that affected diversity of macroinvertebrates were; distance from E 6 and water velocity. Macroinvertebrate diversity increased with increasing distance from E 6 and increasing water velocity. Type of <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> had different effects on brown trout and Atlantic salmon densities. Both species had highest 0 + densities in areas with weirs and riparian modifications, while brown trout and Atlantic salmon 0 + density was lower in side channels and tributaries than in unrestored stations. 0 + Atlantic salmon density increased with increasing time since restoration. 0 + brown trout length was greater in areas with weirs and riparian modifications, while length was lower in side channels and tributaries. 0 + brown trout length was greater in restored stations than in unrestored stations. 0 + brown trout length decreased with increasing time since first <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> (2006). 0 + Atlantic salmon length was greater in side channels and tributaries, while weirs and riparian modifications had little effect on their length. The highest diversity of macroinvertebrates was found in areas where riparian modifications and opening of side channels/tributaries was conducted. Areas with weirs had a similar effect as unrestored areas on diversity. The restoration process appears to have started, with promising responses for brown trout production, but further monitoring and broader scaled sampling is needed to better test the effects of different restoration measures on all three salmonids and macroinvertebrates in Bognelv...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{disturbance}} {{is recognized}} as an important driver of biodiversity in dry grasslands, and can therefore be implemented as a <b>restoration</b> <b>measure.</b> However, because community re-assembly following disturbance includes stochastic processes, a focus only on species rich-ness or establishment success of particular species will not inform on how plant communi-ties respond ecologically to disturbance. We therefore evaluated vegetation development following disturbance by quantifying species richness, species composition and functional trait composition. Degraded calcareous sandy grassland was subjected to experimental dis-turbance treatments (ploughing or rotavation), and the vegetation was surveyed during four subsequent years of succession. Treated plots were compared with control plots represent-ing untreated grassland, as well as nearby plots characterized by plant communities repre-senting the restoration target.

Sod cutting of the former areas significantly decreased potential net nitrification, whereas in the latter areas no differences were found. Liming of sod-cut soils greatly increased potential net nitrification and the accumulation of ammonium in the soil up to toxic concentrations could be prevented.

40|$|Soil {{disturbance}} is recognised as {{an important}} <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> for conserving biodiversity in sandy soils. We used a soil disturbance (ploughing) experiment in a sandy grassland {{as well as a}} semi-natural disturbance (slope erosion enhanced by cattle trampling) gradient on a sandy slope to test the soil disturbance effects on the ground-living beetle community. Both experimental disturbance and semi-natural disturbance favoured sandy grassland specialists, but there was no overall effect on beetle richness and abundance. Amara lucida and Harpalus spp. were favoured by disturbance while Calathus melanocephalus was disfavoured. Experimental ploughing significantly increased the proportion of red-listed species in disturbed plots compared to non-disturbed controls. In the semi-natural disturbance gradient we found that the beetle community on the disturbed slope differed from that of the flat areas, and there were tendencies for a higher proportion of red-listed species on the slope. We conclude that increasing the area of bare sand in sandy grasslands can have positive effects on many threatened species. Soil disturbance should thus be included as a regular measure in sandy grasslands under conservation management and as a measure to restore high biodiversity in areas where bare sand is rare...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural river banks have been {{transformed}} into banks with artificial revetments or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion. Important river features for flora and fauna have disappeared and the ecological quality of the river reduced dramatically. Recently, the importance of the ecological function of rivers has been getting more attention. One river <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> is the removal of man-made bank protections to increase habitat diversity and biodiversity of riparian areas and the river basin. The river morphology may change due to the freely eroding banks in the restored section. Reference projects show that the removal of bank protection along rivers may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Schirmer et al., 2014). Bars increase morphological diversity, providing specific habitats for flora and fauna (Kurth and Schirmer, 2014). There is a lack of knowledge about the formation of bars related to the length and location of the removal of bank protection. The length of river bank protection removal is usually limited, due to human activities along the riversides.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of wildflower strips (WFS) at the field scale and in the landscape context on butterflies in a Swiss arable landscape. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) butterfly diversity and abundance are higher in WFS than in conventional fields; (2) butterfly diversity and abundance are enhanced by the amount, proximity and connectivity of WFS in the landscape context; (3) additional factors influence butterfly diversity and abundance according to individual site conditions and landscape context characteristics linked to other landscape elements. WFS had more species and individuals of butterflies than conventional habitats. However, promoted species were mainly generalists; few specialists were enhanced. The diversity of all butterflies and of generalists increased linearly with percent cover of WFS, reflecting an effect of <b>restoration</b> <b>measures</b> depending on the landscape context. The influence of proximity and connectivity of WFS were, however, not significant. The occurrence of specialists was conditioned by plant species richness, while the effect of WFS for overall diversity was affected by the amount of grassland in the surroundings.

Several steps are involved in the sexual reproduction pathway of plants: the production of flowers, the production of seeds and the establishment of seedlings from seeds. In this paper we quantify the relative importance and spatiotemporal variability of these different steps for four grassland perennials: Centaurea jacea, Cirsium dissectum, Hypochaeris radicata and Succisa pratensis. We compared undisturbed meadows with meadows where the top soil layer had been removed as a <b>restoration</b> <b>measure.</b> Data on the number of flower heads per flowering rosette, the numbers of flowers and seeds per flower head, and the seedling establishment probabilities per seed were collected by field observations and experiments in several sites and years.

Seedling establishment is the major bottleneck for successful sexual reproduction in all species. Large losses also occurred due to failing seed set in C. dissectum.

Iron is a natural capping agent which can enhance sediment P binding capacity, thus reducing P availability and shifting a lake from an algal to a macrophyte dominated state. Iron could, however, also impose toxic effects on the biota. We therefore provide a synopsis of iron toxicity studies and lake restoration measures using iron addition. Iron toxicity studies revealed that, even though iron is an essential nutrient for growth, when added in excess, it can negatively affect aquatic organisms. We found 13 studies testing the effect of iron addition as a <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> in the field (10) or using sediment from lakes and reservoirs in the laboratory (3). Twelve of the studies reported increased P retention after iron addition, which depended on the iron salts used and the concentrations added in two studies, whereas one study found no effect on P retention. Eight out of the nine field studies that reported biotic responses found reduced chlorophyll concentrations in the water column, whereas toxic effects of iron on organisms remained absent. Iron addition was most successful when external P loading, and concentrations of organic matter and sulphate were low as well as densities of sediment disturbing fish and crayfish.

In this research the efficacy of sod cutting and increased aeolian sand dynamics as <b>restoration</b> <b>measures</b> to improve the quality and increase the area of grey dune is researched. To this purpose articles in international scientific literature and management reports from the Netherlands are reviewed. The <b>restoration</b> <b>measures</b> are not often discussed in scientific literature and <b>restoration</b> <b>measures</b> are often not sufficiently monitored. Much of the literature on the effects of increased aeolian sand activity is mainly geomorphological. Scientific knowledge on the long term effects of <b>restoration</b> <b>measures</b> in grey dunes or comparable systems is scarce. However from the reviewed studies a few general trends became obvious. Sod cutting and the increase of aeolian sand dynamics can be an effective way to increase both the quality and the area of grey dune ecosystems.

Points of interest are the effect on SOM, the soil seed bank, sand deposition and pH, as well as the scale of the measures. These factors are crucial in the establishment of target communities.

Reduced-impact farming systems such as agroforests, have been proposed to increase biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In regions where oil-palm plantations already dominate the landscape, this increase can only be achieved through systematic ecological restoration. However, our knowledge about the underlying ecological and socio-economic processes, constraints, and trade-offs of ecological restoration in oilpalm landscapes is very limited. To bridge this gap, we established a long-term biodiversity enrichment experiment. We established experimental tree islands in a conventional oil-palm plantation and systematically varied plot size, tree diversity, and tree species composition.

40|$|Calcareous grasslands {{are among}} the most diverse habitats, {{supporting}} species-rich vegetation. Propagule limitation and availability of microsites for germination represent major constraints to the successful restoration of these grasslands. To date, little information is available on the effectiveness of seed addition and soil disturbance on the restoration success of encroached semi-natural calcareous grasslands. Here, we conducted a 1 year before - 9 year after control-impact (BACI) study aimed at testing the effect of the addition of seeds of native species and livestock grazing on calcareous grasslands. Each <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> and their combination differed in their impact on these communities and varied over time. Grazing had a significant, beneficial, impact on these communities, although the impact was species-specific. On average, grazed plots were characterized by a higher number of species and a lower vegetation cover. Nine years after treatment application, grazed site were dominated by Trifolium incarnatum subsp. molinerii, Xeranthemum cylindraceum, Orlaya grandiflora, Teucrium chamaedrys and Bromus erectus while ungrazed sites were dominated by B. erectus, X. cylindraceum, O. grandiflora and Prunus spinosa. Only 8 out of 34 species responded significantly to disturbance or/and disturbance and seed addition while 22 species were significantly affected by the sampling year and 18 by a blocking factor. The low recruitment from added seeds and the fact that seed addition is a time-and labor-consuming activity suggests that an adequate level of disturbance and natural regeneration represent the most cost-effective approach to the restoration of these calcareous grasslands. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|The {{current study}} {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} heavy metal pollution and the possibility for use of a basidiomycetes P. ostreatus in the bioremediation of mine dump waste at four selected mine dump sites around the mining town of Bindura in central Zimbabwe. The greatest threat to the ecology in the Mazowe–Pote River catchment areas is currently posed by Cd 2 +, Fe 3 + and Pb 2 + heavy metals from the mine dump sites. The least ecological threat comes from the concentrations of Mn 2 + in the mine dump sites. The considerable reduction in the concentrations of heavy metals in the experimental pits that successfully supported vigorous growth of the basidiomycetes clearly implies that the investigated mushroom species is an efficient bio-exlusor of Mn 2 +, Cr 2 +, Pb 2 +, Fe 3 + and Cd 2 + from their growing environments. The propagation of P. ostreatus can be employed as a <b>restoration</b> <b>measure</b> for the soil ecosystems contaminated by heavy metals at the mine dump sites. In the biosorption of the heavy metal pollutants, P. ostreatus is more efficient in sequestering Mn 2 +, Fe 3 + and Cd 2 +, in that order. The biosorption of Cr 2 + and Fe 3 + from heavy metal-polluted mine waste is less efficient. The propagation of P. ostreatus as bioremediation material reduces the individual heavy metal pollution threat in mine dump waste from medium pollution to clean and uncontaminated waste. The use of oyster mushroom propagation in heavy metal decontamination of mine dump waste presents an opportunity to employ renewable green technologies in the remediation of contaminated environments.|$|E

Aquatic organism groups (e. g., benthic invertebrates and fish), which are {{used to assess the}} ecological status, show low or no responses to restoration, although a strong correlation of hydromorphological measures and biotic responses is expected. Some studies addressed the factor time as the major setback in the missing restoration effects. Currently, the knowledge on time spans required for successful recolonization of restored sections is poor. Effects of <b>restoration</b> <b>measures</b> on riparian organism groups are also less investigated, although single studies reveal strong responses to changing habitat conditions. Furthermore, studies which compare effects of restoration on both aquatic and riparian organism groups are missing. This thesis focused on hydromorphological river <b>restoration</b> <b>measures</b> in Germany and their effects on aquatic and riparian habitats and organism groups. The following questions were addressed: - How do riparian organism groups respond to hydromorphological <b>restoration</b> <b>measures?</b> - How do habitats and species assemblages of the river and the floodplain develop in the first years after restoration and over time? - How do aquatic and riparian organism groups differ in their responses to <b>restoration</b> <b>measures?</b> To answer the first question, the effects of hydromorphological restoration on riparian habitats and organism groups were analyzed by using the example of carabid beetles and floodplain vegetation in a dataset of 24 <b>restoration</b> <b>measures.</b> For the second and third question, aquatic and riparian habitats and species assemblages were investigated in two restored mid-sized mountain rivers at different time spans after restoration. Thus, pioneer colonization and successional processes were analyzed. Restoration effects differed between aquatic and riparian, but also between the individual organism groups. For these differences, the impact of multiple factors is suggested, e. g., the magnitude of habitat generation, dispersal abilities of organism groups, the presence of source populations and accessibility of restored sections for dispersing species. Morphological river <b>restoration</b> <b>measures</b> increased habitat diversity mainly in riparian areas with strong benefits for carabid beetles and floodplain vegetation. The strong responses of these species to habitat changes render them suitable indicators for morphological <b>restoration</b> <b>measures.</b> Missing or respectively minor responses of benthic invertebrates and fish reflected the minor enhancement of substrate diversity on the river bottom of restored sections combined with low dispersal ability and the lack of source populations in the direct surroundings. In contrast, aquatic macrophytes react fast and strong to restoration. For them, shallow bankside areas have a high importance as propagules can accumulate in these areas resulting in fast colonization of restored sections subject to the condition that source population upstream from restored sections are present. The results of this thesis highlight the decisive role of the factor time for the colonization of restored sections. Differing dispersal abilities of organism groups result in different time spans required for colonization of newly created habitats. Organism groups with high dispersal ability, e. g., riparian carabid beetles, are direct colonizers. In contrast, aquatic organism groups which have a lower dispersal ability and are currently suffering from multiple pressures need more time to reach restored sections. A high distance to source populations and deficits in longitudinal connectivity might retard or inhibit colonization of restored sections. In case of mountain rivers, the frequency and intensity of high discharges is another important factor influencing the development of habitats and colonization patterns of restored sections over time...|$|R
