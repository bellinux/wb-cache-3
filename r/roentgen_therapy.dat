40|$|FOR {{many years}} <b>roentgen</b> <b>therapy</b> {{has been the}} most {{satisfactory}} method of treatment of the chronic leukemias. It is generally agreed that life is not materially prolonged by irradiation, but in favorable cases symptomatic and hematologic improvement occurs for variable periods of time. Some patients experience uncomfortable reactions to treatment, others become refractory to irradiation, and occasionally an alarming depression of the red and white blood cells occurs. In the absence of specific forms of therapy for the disease, there is need of other palliative measures which may be used in place of, or in conjunction with, <b>roentgen</b> <b>therapy.</b> Interest in the use of solution of potassium arsenite was revived in 1931 by the reports of Forkner and Scott. 1 ' 2 These authors observed striking symptomatic and hematologic improvement in nine of ten cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia, treated for short periods of time with toxic or subtoxic doses of solution of potassium arsenite (Fowler's solution). During the past three years several reports discussing the treatment of leukemia have containe...|$|E
40|$|A case of {{oesophageal}} basaloid carcinoma is reported. The {{disease was}} revealed as a brain metastasis {{and was found}} ad initium {{to be in an}} advanced stage, with evidence of brain, lung and liver metastasis. The treatment performed was palliative subtotal oesophagectomy followed by <b>roentgen</b> <b>therapy.</b> A year and a half later, the patient is still alive and in home care follow up. The authors end stressing this uncommon presentation for an oesophageal neoplasm and the rarity of its histologic type. They also stress the role of surgery, although palliative, in long survival, very unlike the rapid evolution of the few published cases. A case of oesophageal basaloid carcinoma is reported.

40|$|Dr. Pusey has won world renown {{as one of}} {{the pioneers}} of <b>roentgen</b> <b>therapy</b> and {{especially}} as the founder of the solid car-bon dioxide method of treatment for skin diseases. William Pusey was born into the family of a physician on Dec. 1, 1865, {{in a small town in}} Kentucky. Both his father and brother belonged to the medical profession, his brother being a prominent Chicago ophthalmologist. Pusey received an excellent education in the United States and perfected himself in dermatology in the clinics of Europe, espe-cially in the clinics of Vienna, and later on in New York. From there he went to Chi-cago to start his activity as a dermatologist in 1893. Pusey's talent, erudition, and authority won high appraisal from his contemporaries. He obtained a professorship in dermatology of the College of Surgeons and Physicians, which later on became the Medical Colleg...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report on}} their {{clinical}} and surgical {{experience with the}} treatment of 68 cases of cancer of the esophagus. The therapeutic results are identical and as unsatisfactory as those described in the literature. The prognosis for the non operable patients is particularly severe: their mean survival rate reaches only 3 months after the diagnosis is established. As for the patients who are given palliative treatment, their survival is also very short, since they remain alive {{for an average of}} 3 to 6 months. Finally, the operations which aim to cure still show a mortality rate of 27 %; the 1. 4 % survival rate after 5 years is very disappointing. Preoperative <b>roentgen</b> <b>therapy</b> increases the chances of possible resection and prevents the diffusion of the tumoral cells by the lymphatic way. It seems to enhance the life expectancy of these patients. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of giant-cell tumors of bone {{still remains}} {{the subject of}} con-siderable controversy, and many important questions remain unanswered in con-nection with the histogenesis and clinicopathological diagnosis of these tumors. The separation of the true giant-cell tumor of bone from the group of so-called variants and from the other dysplastic or dystrophic bone lesions, with which it has been confused in the past, is still not accepted by all authors. True giant-cell tumors {{can no longer be}} considered innocent growths; on the contrary, they repre-sent a progressive process which can recur, undergo sarcomatous transformation in about 10 per cent of the cases, and even produce metastases without apparent previous malignant alteration. The alleged variants, on the other hand, usually have a favorable evolution, and can be cured with curettage or <b>roentgen</b> <b>therapy</b> in low doses. Many bone lesions are classified as giant-cell tumors merely because of their roentgenographic appearance or {{because of the presence of}} giant cells in the histo-logical preparations, when actually the lesions so classified are really of mino...|$|E
40|$|THOUGH most {{patients}} with secondary neoplastic {{involvement of the}} heart or pericardium seem to manifest no symptoms or signs of such involvement, a sizable pro-portion do have actual impairment of cardiac funetion. Refinements in thoracic, and spe-cifically cardiac, surgery, in <b>roentgen</b> <b>therapy,</b> and {{in the use of}} isotopic and chemothera-peutic agents have made definite palliation available for metastatic neoplasms of the pericardium. Thus the diagnosis of such fune-tional involvement assumes an increasing im-portance. The study to be reported is a retrospective one wherein records of patients with extensive lesions at necropsy were stud-ied in an attempt to correlate clinical and pathologic manifestations of secondary peri-cardial tumors significant enough to interfere with cardiac function. Background Data A detailed review of the literature on this subject has been presented elsewhere 1 and will not be repeated here. As recently as 1934, Heninger 2 reported that in only five cases of secondary tumors of the heart or pericardium had the diagnosis been made during life. However, several nec-ropsy studies in cases of malignant disease have shown incidences of 2. 3 to 13. 1 per cent for pericardial involvement. 3 - 10 Necropsies in cases of leukemia, carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast have revealed peri-cardial involvement in 11. 1, 10. 4, and 20. 9 per cent, respectively. 11 - 1...|$|E
40|$|CHLOROMA is not {{a common}} form of {{malignant}} tumor. Washburn 1 in a re-view of the literature through June 1929 found 162 cases. Since that time 32 more have been reported, bringing the total to 194. Dock and Warthin 2 in 1904 published an exhaustive study of the clinical and histological features of the disease. Their conclusion was that, " chloroma is a tumor-like hyperplasia of the parent cells of the leukocytes, primarily in red marrow, the periosteum being secondarily involved. " In the past, opinions have been divided concerning the lymphatic or myelo-genous origin of the neoplasm, but the general opinion at present would indicate {{that the majority of}} chloromas are myelogenous in origin. The prognosis of patients with chloroma has been universally bad with two exceptions. The first, reported by Lecene, 3 was a case of a tumor of the humerus, which was treated by amputation and roentgen-ray therapy; the second, reported by Washburn, 1 was a case of tumor of the left frontal bone of the skull, with operative removal and subsequent roentgen-ray therapy. Swan-son, 4 Rosenblum, 5 Doub and Hartman, 6 and others failed to find <b>roentgen</b> <b>therapy</b> to be of value in influencing the final outcome of the disease. We believe the following case of chloroma cannot be classified as either lymphatic or myelogenous in origin as the tumor cell is a primitive blast which might conceivably differentiate into either a lymphocyte or a myelocyte.

40|$|In 1932, Zinsser and Castaneda (1) {{described}} {{a method of}} obtaining large amounts of Mexican typhus Rickettsiae, utilizing the peritoneal suspension obtained by washing the scraped peritoneum of white male rats with a 0. 2 per cent formalinized citrate solution. In order to lower {{the resistance of the}} animals, they were irradiated previous to inoculation, using a high voltage <b>Roentgen</b> <b>therapy</b> apparatus. The following factors were employed: 170 kv. peak constant potential (equivalent to 190 kv. peak pulsating current); 80 cm. distance; ~ ram. copper filter; 8 ma. With this setting, 10 Roentgen units per minute, measured in air, was obtained. The most suitable exposure for the rats was found to be 600 r; that is, a 60 minute treatment time. Immediately after irradiation, the rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with a suspension of Mexican typhus virus from a guinea pig's infected tunica vaginalis, which was not richer in Rickettsiae than the average obtained in routine transfer. By this technique, the authors mentioned developed a sure and practical method of obtaining a highly concentrated suspension of specific Mexican typhus Rickettsiae which they used principally in the preparation of typhus vaccine and specific immune horse serum. The use of this vaccine in Mexico by Varela and Parada (2) and by Sanchez Casco (3) and the study of the therapeutic value of the serum by the Mexican Commission headed by Dr. Landa have given such promising results that it would seem advisable to recommend the extension of this method to those countries affected by the disease. * At the time of doing this work, Dr. MacchiaveUo held a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation...|$|E
