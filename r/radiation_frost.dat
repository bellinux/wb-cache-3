50|$|Frost forms {{when the}} {{temperature}} of a solid surface in the open cools to below the freezing point of water {{and for the most}} clearly crystalline forms of frost in particular, below the frost point in still air. In most temperate countries such temperatures usually are the result of heat loss by radiation at night, so those types of frost sometimes are called <b>radiation</b> <b>frost.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} types of ground frost are <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> (hoar frost), {{advection}} frost (advection hoar frost) and evaporation frost. The latter {{is a rare}} type which occurs when surface moisture evaporates into drier air causing its temperature at the surface to fall at or under the freezing point of water. Rime (both soft and hard) is technically not a type of ground frost.|$|E
50|$|Hoar frost (also hoarfrost, <b>radiation</b> <b>frost,</b> or pruina) {{refers to}} white ice crystals, {{deposited}} {{on the ground}} or loosely attached to exposed objects such as wires or leaves. They form on cold, clear nights when conditions are such that heat radiates out to the open sky faster than it can be replaced from nearby sources such as wind or warm objects. Under suitable circumstances, objects cool to below the frost point of the surrounding air, well below the freezing point of water. Such freezing may be promoted by effects such as flood frost or frost pocket. These occur when ground-level radiation losses cool air until it flows downhill and accumulates in pockets of very cold air in valleys and hollows. Hoar frost may freeze in such low-lying cold air even when the air temperature a few feet above ground is well above freezing.|$|E

There are several potential approaches involving field studies, numerical modelling and/or satellite imagery. For southern New Zealand, the Topoclimate South data set of 223 million temperature values provides an opportunity to map frost and frost risk information. To date, only a few exploratory studies have been undertaken. These typically involve {{only a few of}} the 2550 available sites and/or only a single night. Nevertheless, initial investigations indicate that frost mapping in Southland is likely to be a fruitful and interesting topic of study.

40|$|This Master's thesis {{deals with}} the yield and quality {{parameters}} of thermophilic vegetables according to the risk occurrences of extreme weather events in the Czech Republic. This thesis is also focused {{on the impact of}} climate change and extreme weather events on development of vegetable crops, and possible cultivation of thermophilic vegetables outside of typical growing areas. 	The major part of vegetable production is affected by agro-climate, biological, technical and economic aspects. The main tasks of this study are follows: (i) to combine daily meteorological variables with annual yield datasets, (ii) to provide basic statistical analysis of yield of thermophilic vegetables and weather events, and (iii) to identify days with heat stress (both the spring frost and tropical days) during the growing cycle of thermophilic vegetables for the period from 2005 to 2015. This thesis also contains detailed research of phenological phases of tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) during each farming year and impact of different weather extreme events on plant development and yield. Results based on the analysis of historical meteorological observations and descriptive statistics of yield parameters indicate that the positive factors are higher temperatures, optimal rainfall in combination with irrigation and higher intensity of global solar <b>radiation.</b> Conversely, <b>frosts</b> days during planting and increased intensity of rainfall in all phenological phases are detected as negative factors...|$|R
40|$|Spring <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> {{can cause}} {{significant}} losses in productivity {{and a reduction}} in malting quality of barley throughout Australian barley growing regions. Frost damage in barley has been prevalent in recent years prompting a GRDC funded project to identify spring <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> tolerance in barley. The project aims to characterise genetic variation for tolerance to spring <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> in barley through field-based screening. If genetic variation is found, the development of a mapping population to identify molecular markers linked to genes/QTLs conferring frost tolerance in barley will commence. The impact of frost damage on malting quality is also under investigation. Germplasm from areas throughout the world where spring frost occurs have been selected for screening, as well as commercial winter and spring varieties, selected landraces and mutant gene introgressions. Screening is being carried out at three locations in SA where spring <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> is frequent. The evaluation of frost damage includes traits such as electrolyte leakage; tiller, spike and floret mortality; pinched grain and grain weight.

40|$|The {{power of}} the {{internal}} heat source sufficient to maintain a positive temperature of plants {{during one of the}} possible form of cold stress - <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> was determined with the help of numerical simulation. The simulation of unsteady heat transfer in the soil-plant-air system in the conditions of <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> showed that the the ground part of plants is cooling most rapidly, and this process is partially slowed down by the natural-convection heat transfer with warmer air. If the frost is not continuous, the radiative cooling is the main danger for plant. The necessary power of heat-production inside plant that allows it to avoid hypothermia depends both on natural conditions {{and the size of the}} plant. For plants with a typical diameter of the stem about 2 mm this heat-production should be from 50 to 100 W / kg. Within 2 hours a total amount of heat about 0. 5 MJ / kg in the plant should be allocated. Larger plants will have a smaller surface to mass ratio, and the maintaining of it's temperature will require a lower cost of nutrients per unit, accordingly. Modeling of the influence of plant surface trichomes presence on the process of its cooling showed that the role of trichomes in the protection of plants from hypothermia during <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> usually is negative due to the fact that the presence of trichomes increases the radiative heat transfer from the plant and the impediment in air movement near the plant reduces heat flux entering the plant from a warmer air. But in cases where the intensity of heat generation within the plant is sufficient for the maintenance of the plant temperature higher than the air temperature, the presence of trichomes impairs heat transfer from plant to air, and therefore contributes to a better heating of plants...|$|E
40|$|An {{invaluable}} aid in {{the quantitative}} prediction of <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> is an equation which expresses the minimum temperature {{as a function of}} the evening surface hygrometric data. Many such equations have been developed empirically for application to the source region of the original data (c. f. [1, 21). Because the net loss of heat from the ground at night depends on complex radiation and heat conduction processes (c. f. [3, 4]), the weakness of any empirical equation based on surface data is the assumption of average values of several physical parameters which are lumped together as coefficients in the empirical equation. In certain climatic zones, however, particularly in the low-level valleys of California, this has proved to be a valid assumption.

Thus, a plant may actually 'experience' a local climate that {{is quite different from}} the larger scale climatic data used to quantify climate-growth relationships (Peterson et al. 1998). The scale of topoclimates (0.5 km to 10 m) is the spatial scale at which topography can be used to describe the climate near the ground (Geiger et al. 2003), thus more closely approximating the experience of the organism. The discrete influence of complex environments on habitats and species incorporates topographic shading that influences solar <b>radiation</b> and evapotranspiration, <b>frost</b> pockets or cold-air pooling, and differences in soils, all of which can be described on the basis of topoclimates.|$|R

This manuscript addresses and characterizes frost, and assesses the role of global warming in impacting frost in terms of its frequency, severity, and total number of frost days per year. A comprehensive statistical approach was used. The paper indicates that frost waves will continue to hit in the near future regardless of the fact that Earth is moving towards warmer conditions. Agricultural and financial authorities should be urged to minimize frost damage by considering installing wind fans in Jordan valley as an active method in addition to implementing good farm practices (as a passive methods where deemed necessary) ...|$|R
50|$|Superpáramo is at {{the highest}} {{elevation}} and is usually {{considered to be the}} transition zone between the higher, permanent snow region and the lower grass páramo zone. The superpáramo zone is generally narrow and exists atop loose stones and sandy soils at about 4500 - 4800 m. It has the lowest air temperature, precipitation level, soil water-holding capacity, and nutrient content of all the zones. Being the highest in altitude, it also has the highest levels of solar <b>radiation</b> and night <b>frost.</b> For this reason, vegetation in the superpáramo must be highly resistant to such severe fluctuations in weather. Air temperatures are low - cold at night and cool during the day with daily oscillations greater than the oscillations of monthly averages. Due to its localization on high mountains, this area is the least disturbed by humans and contains the most endemic species of all the zones. Flora includes Azorella pedunculata of the Apiaceae family and species from the Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Ericaceae families.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor the <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> in {{agricultural}} fields, {{it is difficult}} to determine a satisfactory solution. To solve this problem, Selective Inverted Sink (SIS) is proposed as a new active frost protection method. However, the interactions of the SIS (also known as tower less wind machine) with some topo climatic effects such as cold air drainage and inversion strength are not well known. Consequently, this study was dedicated to two main objectives: First, different micro- topographic conditions are compared to validate the capability of SIS against the <b>radiation</b> <b>frost.</b> Second, a new hybrid system was proposed to improve the SIS effects. For these two purposes, three meteorological field campaigns were conducted on the fields of a vineyard and an orchard in Quebec, Canada. The air temperature was recorded with a fine spatiotemporal resolution min and spatial resolution in a synchronous mode of operation. In addition, the air temperature and humidity were recorded with mobile measurements and launching balloons to infer the general variations of temperature and specific humidity. Based on the topographic maps and field measurement, the several locations for SIS installation were determined. The high-resolution isotherms maps were used to evaluate the influence of SIS on nocturnal air-cooling. These results did not provide conclusive observational evidence that the SIS has impartial efficiency on nocturnal cooling. Indeed, a minor part of the SIS's exhausted flux was from horizontal direction, essentially due to land surface roughness. In contrast, a major part of the flux was from the upper layer around the SIS, which behaves like a funnel. The wind speed in the funnel's direction was 3 times greater than the wind speed in the horizontal direction. Therefore, the SIS was not able to remove a sufficient amount of cold air pool or stagnant air. To elucidate the second objective, a simple and affordable innovation with reliable testing was performed. A hot water SIS hybrid system (HWSH) was proposed to use the “forced convection” produced by the SIS to disperse a maximum of water vapors into the air in order to decrease the air dryness. In this system, hot water with a temperature of 60 ° C was deployed under the SIS. The observation during a <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> night demonstrated that, although the reference area (35 m away from the HWSH) was affected by frost, hybrid system's location area was not affected. However, there was no significant temperature gradient between two points, but the moist enthalpy calculated at 18 m altitude was higher above the HWSH in comparison to reference point. In conclusion, the main physical notion throughout this study is moist enthalpy, which depicts heat content. Nocturnal cooling rate decreased by increasing the moist enthalpy using HWSH system. This environmentally clean hybrid system has potential to be considered as an alternative to some frost protection methods such as heaters and fires burning. In addition, the importance of fine-scale measurement {{in agricultural}} field is highlighted in this study...|$|E
40|$|The conductive, {{convective}} {{and radiation}} heat exchange {{process in a}} natural system including plants aggregation, air lower layer and ground upper layer, is examined.

The numerical simulation of plants aggregation cooling is performed for {{the case of a}} <b>radiation</b> <b>frost.</b> It is found up that mutual influence of plants in an aggregation on the heat exchange with environment grows with the increase of plants size and plants number per ground area. The influence leads to that lower parts of plants are cooled slower, while upper parts are cooled faster. The estimations are made for the quantity of heat emitted in a thermogenic plant that is enough to prevent the plant cold stress. It is shown that in presence of enforced air flow the rate of plants cooling is noticeably lower, as well as the quantity of heat enough to prevent the plant cold stress...|$|E

Ice nucleation (IN) occurred between - 3. 1 and - 4. 9 -degrees-C. The distribution of IN temperatures followed a normal distribution with a mean (+/- SD) at - 3. 9 +/- 0. 5 -degrees-C. Forth-three cases were also monitored in the field, where a sample of fruit was checked for frost damage whenever the air temperature dropped below zero. The field data obtained confirmed that exposure of fruits to air temperatures below - 3 -degrees-C creates the conditions for a freezing event in kiwifruit fruit. The longer the exposure of fruits to temperatures below - 3 -degrees-C and/or the lower the temperature, the higher the probability of ice nucleation.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{equipment}} available for evaluating frost hardiness of forest tree planting stock. The {{procedures and precautions}} necessary in under-taking such work are also outlined. The most common and accessible method of evaluating frost hardiness is to raise plants at one or more field sites where plants grow, harden and freeze naturally. However, the frequency and severity of frosts {{in the field are}} unpredictable and uncontrollable. To overcome these problems various commercial cold rooms and cabinets, often modified to provide controlled rates of freezing and thawing, have been used. In some cases these cabinets are portable to allow field plants to be frosted in situ. Freezing bars have also been developed which allow samples of plants to be frosted over a range of temperatures at the same time. Recently, specialised <b>radiation</b> and advective <b>frost</b> rooms have been designed which, although costly to construct and operate, provide very precise, controlled and reproducible ''natural " frosts. Most techniques can distinguish differences in frost tolerance between plants, but only those providing control of all phases of the frost treatment will allow the results to be extrapolated confidently from laboratory to the field. Access to more than one frost temperature is essential if differences in frost tolerance are to be quantified. The final test of the frost tolerance of forest planting stock, however, must remain its performance in the field...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{a severe}} <b>radiation</b> fog during <b>frost</b> {{conditions}} is analyzed as a benchmark {{for the development of}} a very high resolution NWP model. Results by the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) and the High resolution limited area model (HIRLAM) are evaluated against detailed observations to determine the state of the art in fog forecasting and to derive requirements for further research and development. For this particular difficult case, WRF is unable to correctly simulate the fog for none of the parameterizations and model configurations utilized. Contrary, HIRLAM does model the onset of fog, but is unable to represent it beyond the lowest model layer, which leads to an early dispersal of fog in the morning transition. The sensitivity of fog forecasts to model formulation is further analyzed with a high resolution single column version of HIRLAM, and with the Duynkerke (1991) single column model as a reference. The single column results are found to be sensitive to the proper specification of the external forcings. It is reconfirmed that high vertical resolution is essential for modeling the fog formation, the growth of the fog layer and when the fog lifts for the maintenance of a stratus deck. The properly configured column models are able to accurately model the onset of fog and its maturation, but fail in the simulation of fog persistence and subsequent dispersal. Details of the turbulence parameterization appear to be important in this process. It is concluded that, despite of all advances in numerical weather prediction, fog forecasting is still a major challeng...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{the maximum}} {{elevations}} at which treelines are observed to occur coincide with a 6. 4 °C soil isotherm. However, when observed at finer scales, treelines display a considerable degree of spatial complexity in their patterns {{across the landscape}} and are often found occurring at lower elevations than expected relative to the global-scale pattern. There is still {{a lack of understanding}} of how the abiotic environment imposes constraints on treeline patterns, the scales at which different effects are acting, and how these effects vary over large spatial extents. In this thesis, I examined abrupt Nothofagus treelines across seven degrees of latitude in New Zealand in order to investigate two broad questions: (1) What is {{the nature and extent of}} spatial variability in Nothofagus treelines across the country? (2) How is this variation associated with abiotic variation at different spatial scales? A range of GIS, statistical, and atmospheric modelling methods were applied to address these two questions. First, I characterised Nothofagus treeline patterns at a 15 x 15 km scale across New Zealand using a set of seven, GIS-derived, quantitative metrics that describe different aspects of treeline position, shape, spatial configuration, and relationships with adjacent vegetation. Multivariate clustering of these metrics revealed distinct treeline types that showed strong spatial aggregation across the country. This suggests a strong spatial structuring of the abiotic environment which, in turn, drives treeline patterns. About half of the multivariate treeline metric variation was explained by patterns of climate, substrate, topographic and disturbance variability; on the whole, climatic and disturbance factors were most influential. Second, I developed a conceptual model that describes how treeline elevation may vary at different scales according to three categories of effects: thermal modifying effects, physiological stressors, and disturbance effects. I tested the relevance of this model for Nothofagus treelines by investigating treeline elevation variation at five nested scales (regional to local) using a hierarchical design based on nested river catchments. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that the majority of the variation in treeline elevation resided at the broadest, regional scale, which was best explained by the thermal modifying effects of solar radiation, mountain mass, and differences in the potential for cold air ponding. Nonetheless, at finer scales, physiological and disturbance effects were important and acted to modify the regional trend at these scales. These results suggest that variation in abrupt treeline elevations are due to both broad-scale temperature-based growth limitation processes and finer-scale stress- and disturbance-related effects on seedling establishment. Third, I explored the applicability of a meso-scale atmospheric model, The Air Pollution Model (TAPM), for generating 200 m resolution, hourly topoclimatic data for temperature, incoming and outgoing radiation, relative humidity, and wind speeds. Initial assessments of TAPM outputs against data from two climate station locations over seven years showed that the model could generate predictions with a consistent level of accuracy for both sites, and which agreed with other evaluations in the literature. TAPM was then used to generate data at 28, 7 x 7 km Nothofagus treeline zones across New Zealand for January (summer) and July (winter) 2002. Using mixed-effects linear models, I determined that both site-level factors (mean growing season temperature, mountain mass, precipitation, earthquake intensity) and local-level landform (slope and convexity) and topoclimatic factors (solar <b>radiation,</b> photoinhibition index, <b>frost</b> index, desiccation index) were influential in explaining variation in treeline elevation within and among these sites. Treelines were generally closer to their site-level maxima in regions with higher mean growing season temperatures, larger mountains, and lower levels of precipitation. Within sites, higher treelines were associated with higher solar radiation, and lower photoinhibition and desiccation index values, in January, and lower desiccation index values in July. Higher treelines were also significantly associated with steeper, more convex landforms. Overall, this thesis shows that investigating treelines across extensive areas at multiple study scales enables the development of a more comprehensive understanding of treeline variability and underlying environmental constraints. These results can be used to formulate new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms driving treeline formation and to guide the optimal choice of field sites at which to test these hypotheses...|$|R

To {{better understand the}} mechanism of wheat (Triticum aestivum) responding to SRF, a comparative proteomic analysis was performed to analyze the changes of the key proteins in two wheat cultivars Jimai 22 and Luyuan 301 with high and low tolerance to SRF respectively. A total of 43 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) which mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, resistance proteins and antioxidant enzymes, photosynthesis and cellular respiration proteins, cell-wall related proteins, protein translation/processing/degradation and signal transduction were isolated and identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. The results revealed that of the 21 DEPs in Jimai 22 responding to the SRF, 13 DEPs were upregulated and 8 DEPs were downregulated, {{and that of the}} 22 DEPs in Luyuan 301, 9 DEPs were upregulated and 13 DEPs were downregulated.

The focus of frost research therefore has been to identify reproductively frost resistant cereals at the both varietal and species levels that can contribute to alleviating frost damage. Seven triticale and three wheat varieties were assessed to determine relative frost tolerance under natural frost conditions. Plants were grown in pots and raised in the glasshouse. At flowering (± 5 days), plants were exposed to a single overnight frost or frost maintained for a short time with varying intensities from 0. 2 to – 6. 6 °C at crop ear height. The frost impact was assessed at maturity based on ear fertility by counting the number of developed grains. There were variable levels of tolerance between triticale varieties with Tahara being more susceptible than other varieties. At species level, triticale was more susceptible than wheat.

Mapping populations that were segregating for reproductive frost tolerance were screened and significant QTL identified. QTL on chromosome 2 HL were identified for frostinduced floret sterility in two different populations at the same genomic location. This QTL was not associated with previously reported developmental or stress-response loci.

The cause of these frosts was determined by weather parameter values at observation hours and the aid of synoptic maps. Frost series based upon last spring or first fall advection are defined and found to be random and normally distributed.

It occurred that thermography is especially useful in agrophysical studies. Many processes of mass and energy exchange in agrophysical systems are have their reflection in the change of the surface temperature of the studied bodies. This concerns the soil-plant-atmosphere system where the transport of water and gas from the soil through the plant membranes into the atmosphere and the turbulent transport of air in the atmosphere create specific actual distribution of temperature on the surface of plant and soil.

Progress in breeding for frost tolerance has been slow due to large errors resulting from environment and genotype factors confounding selection. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis can aid to remove the effects of confounding factors such as maturity and plant type from intrinsic frost tolerance. The Arapiles x Franklin mapping population was screened in the field for its susceptibility to frost damage. Sterility and grain damage were mapped and the Franklin alleles at the eps 2 region on 2 HS (late flowering) and denso dwarfing region on 3 HL significantly contributed to frost tolerance. When a subset of genotypes were selected based on a narrow maturity range, a significant QTL for frost damage was identified on the long arm of chromosome 5 H close to Sh 2. This region has been previously associated with the expression of winter hardiness in barley. It is also homoeologous to the region where Fr 1 (frost tolerance) is located in wheat.

Observation of cold air drainage is not available in the existing observation network and it requires a special methodology. The main objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the cold air drainage over regions with a slope. A high resolution infrared camera, a meteorological station and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were used. The specific objective was to derive nocturnal cold air drainage velocity over the slope. To address these objectives, a number of infrared measurement campaigns were conducted during calm and clear sky conditions over an agricultural zone (blackcurrant farm) in Canada. Using thermal infrared images, the nocturnal surface temperature gradient were computed in hourly basis. The largest gradient magnitudes were found between 17 h - 20 h. The cooling rates at basin area were two times higher in comparison to the magnitudes observed within slope area. The image analysis illustrated this considerable temperature gradient of the basin may be partly due to transport of cold air drainage into the basin from the slope. The results show that thermal imagery can be used to characterize and understand the microclimate related to the occurrence of <b>radiation</b> <b>frost</b> in the agricultural field. This study provided the opportunity to track the cold air drainage flow and pooling of cold air in low lying areas.

40|$|The subalpine {{environment}} {{is characterized by}} the possibility of frost throughout the summer. The frequency and severity of summertime frost episodes appeared particularly dependent on net losses of infrared energy to a cold night sky (<b>radiation</b> <b>frost),</b> as well as air temperature and wind speed. Longwave radiation minima from the night sky were strongly correlated with the occurrence of leaf temperature minima. Leaf temperatures were modeled using an energy balance simulation that quantified the specific effects of ambient air temperature, wind speed, sky infrared radiation, and sky exposure characteristic of this high-elevation environment. Plants growing in exposed and sheltered habitats have characteristic leaf structures (smaller, thicker leaves in more exposed locations) that have been traditionally associated with the total amount of incident sunlight. However, smaller leaves also appear adaptive for reducing the susceptibility to radiation frosts. Larger, more exposed leaves resulted in colder nocturnal leaf temperatures and greater frost frequencies. Microsite sky radiation, microtopography, plant habit and leaf structure all have important implications for estimating growing season length and plant distribution patterns, especially at higher elevations where summer frosts are common. Radiational frosts at night are typically followed by clear skies and full-sun exposure the next morning. The combination of low temperature stress followed by high light exposure can result in strong photoinhibition of photosynthesis. The morphology of a variety of conifer needles as well as of a broadleaf was modeled to evaluate the effect on incident sunlight intensity. Conifer leaf morphology was found to be particularly adaptive for avoiding high incident light conditions compared to broadleaves...|$|E
