5|$|A <b>Roman</b> {{colonnade}} {{was built}} in the third century, probably by emperor Septimius Severus, and a <b>Roman</b> Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under <b>Roman</b> rule. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a <b>Roman</b> fountain.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were now}} {{led by a}} praefectus (prefect), who could be either a native nobleman, who would {{probably}} be granted <b>Roman</b> citizenship for the purpose (e.g. the famous German war leader Arminius gained <b>Roman</b> citizenship probably by serving as an auxiliary prefect before turning against Rome); or a <b>Roman,</b> either of knightly rank, or a senior centurion.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} wall, <b>Roman</b> sculptures include the marble {{head of a}} <b>Roman</b> emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at Hawkshaw, Peebleshire {{in the late eighteenth}} century. It dates to the second century CE and may have been looted from a <b>Roman</b> {{monument}} further to the south. The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the <b>Roman</b> base of Cramond <b>Roman</b> Fort near Edinburgh. A relief of the goddess Brigantia found near Birrens in Dumfriesshire, combines elements of native and classical art.|$|E

5|$|Before 212 the {{majority}} of <b>Roman</b> citizens had been inhabitants of <b>Roman</b> Italia, with about 4–7% of all peoples in the <b>Roman</b> empire being <b>Roman</b> citizens {{at the time of}} the death of Augustus in 14AD. Outside Rome, citizenship was restricted to <b>Roman</b> coloniaeRomans, or their descendants, living in the provinces, the inhabitants of various cities throughout the Empireand small numbers of local nobles such as kings of client countries. Provincials, on the other hand, were usually non-citizens, although some Magistrates and their families and relatives held the Latin Right.|$|E
5|$|Certainly, the Sassanids had {{not been}} cowed by the {{previous}} battles with Rome and in 253 AD the Sassanids under Shapur I penetrated deeply into <b>Roman</b> territory several times, defeating a <b>Roman</b> force at the Battle of Barbalissos and conquering and plundering Antiochia in 252 AD following the Siege of Antiochia. The Romans recovered Antioch by 253 AD, and Emperor Valerian gathered an army and marched eastward to the Sassanid borders. In 260 AD at the Battle of Edessa the Sassanids defeated the <b>Roman</b> army and captured the <b>Roman</b> Emperor Valerian.|$|E
5|$|Direct trade {{links between}} the Mediterranean lands and India had been {{established}} in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages in the Indian Ocean. The lively sea trade in <b>Roman</b> times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits of <b>Roman</b> coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to <b>Roman</b> communities {{have been identified in}} India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the <b>Roman</b> mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of <b>Roman</b> Egypt to India suggests that <b>Roman</b> commercial activity in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine Plague of 166 AD, the same year as the first <b>Roman</b> embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.|$|E

5|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century, the {{consensus}} remained that the road was most probably <b>Roman.</b> It was still referenced as an undoubted <b>Roman</b> road in a 1947 UK Government report and in 1957 Margary, the leading authority on <b>Roman</b> roads at the time, accepted the road as <b>Roman</b> and assigned it the catalogue number 81b in his list of <b>Roman</b> roads in Britain. In the late 1950s and early 1960s this was a definitive and unquestioned interpretation of the monument. Several works in the 1980s and 1990s stated that Roman-era road construction was still the most probable explanation of the structure.|$|E
5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} <b>Roman</b> {{influence}} over the east, as with the west, as {{not a matter of}} intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the <b>Roman</b> Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the <b>Roman</b> Empire. It was not until the time of the <b>Roman</b> Empire that the entire <b>Roman</b> world was organized into provinces under explicit <b>Roman</b> control.|$|E

5|$|In 1059 {{the same}} papal bull that {{restricted}} suffrage to the cardinals also recognised {{the authority of}} the Holy <b>Roman</b> Emperor (at the time Henry IV), but only as a concession made by the pope, declaring that the Holy <b>Roman</b> Emperor had no authority to intervene in elections except where permitted to do so by papal agreements. Pope Gregory VII (in office 1073-1085) was the last Pope to submit to the interference of the Holy <b>Roman</b> Emperors. The breach between him and the Holy <b>Roman</b> Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the Emperor's role. In 1122 the Holy <b>Roman</b> Empire acceded to the Concordat of Worms, accepting the papal decision.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, a {{candidate}} for a <b>Roman</b> fort was identified by aerial photography at Easter Galcantray, south west of Cawdor.

5|$|It appears, however, {{that direct}} {{trade with the}} Sogdians {{remained}} limited {{in light of the}} small amount of <b>Roman</b> and Byzantine coins found in Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites belonging to this era. Although <b>Roman</b> embassies apparently reached Han China from 166 AD onwards, and the ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk while the Han-dynasty Chinese imported <b>Roman</b> glasswares as discovered in their tombs, Valerie Hansen (2012) wrote that no <b>Roman</b> coins from the <b>Roman</b> Republic (507–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC – 330 AD) era of the <b>Roman</b> Empire have been found in China. However, Warwick Ball (2016) upends this notion by pointing to a hoard of sixteen <b>Roman</b> coins found at Xi'an, China (formerly Chang'an), dated to the reigns of various emperors from Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD). The earliest gold solidus coins from the Eastern <b>Roman</b> Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to thirteen-hundred silver coins) in Xinjiang and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in Turfan persisted long after the Tang campaign against Karakhoja and Chinese conquest of 640, with a gradual adoption of Chinese bronze coinage {{over the course of the}} 7th century. The fact that these Eastern <b>Roman</b> coins were almost always found with Sasanian Persian silver coins and Eastern <b>Roman</b> gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans confirms the pre-eminent importance of Greater Iran in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{when the first}} fortification at Longtown was built. The first defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or <b>Roman,</b> or Anglo-Saxon periods, but this remains uncertain. If <b>Roman</b> defences were constructed at the site, it was probably because of a <b>Roman</b> road that may have run nearby, and the defences may well have then been reused {{in the building of}} the current castle, parts of whose earthworks have square, angular corners, similar to those of <b>Roman</b> forts but otherwise unusual in 12th century English castles.|$|E
